<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and specific—Garrett’s grief is filtered through sensory memory and tool-handling. The contradictory impulse to measure yet secretly commemorate is dramatized in the single beat where he both records erosion and slips the note into the crack. Cost is visible: the act commits him to lifelong secrecy and perpetual return. Only the “archeologist of abandoned dreams” tag drifts toward diagnostic self-label, keeping it from 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the lodged note crystallizes Garrett’s new vocation and forecloses ordinary surveyor detachment. Causal chain holds—each micro-choice (wade, measure, write, wedge) leads inevitably to the final sealing. Cost is legible in the warm brass against palm, synesthetic proof that he has traded professional neutrality for covert custodianship. Lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of submerged images and ink-warmth tightens until the cadence shift at dusk reweights meaning.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The flooded pavilion is not backdrop but prosthetic extension of grief—each crack he fingers is also a lost anniversary. Water depth dictates where he can kneel to insert the note; the brass inkwell’s warmth against seawater-chilled fingers constrains the final gesture. Spatial choreography is flawless: drawbridge, knee-deep terrace, central column track without drift. Micro-setting (inkwell) charges the final image; without its retained heat the cost would be abstract.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“preserve what has vanished”—is signaled early and tightens when the cement crew’s arrival threatens permanent erasure. Single meaningful turn: professional duty flips to covert archive at the moment he chooses the crack over the clipboard. Cost is visible: the clay seal is temporary, guaranteeing perpetual return and perpetual secrecy. Escalation is accretive rather than causal, but the rising water mirrors rising obligation cleanly under the chosen lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges solely through concrete particulars: yellow hem, defunct music program, canceled wedding carved in rail. No explicit thesis; the final image of warm brass reweights “interlaced absence” from metaphor to vocation. Subtext operates in silence—no mention of Sarah’s name in the note, yet her absence is louder than declared grief. Reader leaves with the hush of water still in ear and the conceptual cost that every structure hides a folded elegy.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is sharp: coastlines measured by grandfather’s palm-polish, grief gauged by hem-crease and ink-temperature. Syntax flexes from surveyor precision (“water levels and erosion patterns”) to lyric compression (“hushed blaze”). No dialogue, so voice must carry idiosyncratic idiom alone; it does. Minor template cadence in “today he would…” anaphora is brief and pattern-taught, paid off in the dusk return symmetry.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies: long aquatic sentence mirrors flooded stillness, then staccato micro-choices (“write, fold, wedge”) mimic insertion. Information density high—single sentence can carry occupation, memory, and physical act. No mixed metaphors; “drunken dancers” is earned by prior listing columns. One paraphrase loop (“interlaced absence” twice) forgiven because second use reprices the concept at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Premise—surveyor-as-clandestine-elegist—is fresh synthesis of coastal science and grief archive. Inkwell-as-memory-keeper transforms antique prop into temporal valve. Risk of quiet ending paid off: no corpse, no shouted revelation, yet resonance is undeniable. Could not swap pavilion for any ruin; its tidal drawbridge and dance-history are particularized. Micro-innovation within flash-length threatens gimmick, but emotional specificity keeps it from abstraction.</comment>
