<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elena’s mathematician identity and obsession with proving perpetual motion drive every beat; the diced-roll habit and wall-scribbling are concrete, character-specific rituals that externalize her mind. Her interior contradiction—rigorous logic feeding an irrational hope—remains active in scene, not summarized. The final laugh crystallizes Earned Stasis: she sees the cost of her own proof yet keeps climbing, a credible grim optimist. Only minor: the “three-years-ago” block is cleanly anchored but still feels like off-page exposition rather than lived memory.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a pristine Conceptual Repricing: the proof that she herself is the conserved energy lands with crushing conceptual cost and is shown, not told. Causal chain holds throughout: because she keeps measuring, the staircase iterates; because she proves the loop, escape is mathematically impossible. Lens is Causal; every stair and dice roll is a therefore. No orientation debt; who/where taught by line 3 and paid off in the final image of her still-climbing silhouette.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The staircase as a recursive function is evoked through tactile repetition: cold stone, temperature deltas, harmonic echoes—never a catalog. The chipped die is a micro-setting that constrains every probability calculation; its imperfection is felt in palm and equation alike. Spatial grounding is immaculate: steps, landings, notebooks without end, all filtered through a mathematician’s selective attention. Final image of “endlessly above and below” recharges every prior sensory cue.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can she prove her way out?—tightens with each hundred-step trial; the 0.7 °C confirmation is a micro-turn that keeps hope alive. The rupture is the proof itself: escape becomes forbidden by her own logic, a decisive narrowing of options. Cost is conceptual but unmistakable: perpetual motion equals perpetual imprisonment. Escalation is single-threaded yet sufficient; no coincidence muddies the slope.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</question><comment>Theme emerges from iterated pattern: the price of perfect knowledge is the loss of exit. No moralizing line; the staircase simply re-prices freedom to zero. Subtext lives in the chipped die—flaw as gift and trap. Final reprise of “she moved within it” lets the reader feel the after-echo: enlightenment as life sentence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is mathematician-precise yet fevered: diction of “probability cascades” beside “clutched dice.” Syntax mirrors ascent—longer clauses on climbs, staccato fragments at each landing. No filter-verb drift; perception stays embodied in cold stone, stone fragment, cramping fingers. Rhythm accelerates into the final paragraph without head-hopping, a single consciousness locked in its own proof.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>High information density: each sentence advances either measurement or stakes—no scaffolding. Metaphors are spare and physics-loyal (“harmonic frequencies” is accurate). Zero paraphrase loops; the repetition of “hundred steps” is pattern-taught and payoff-earned. Final line cadence—perpetual and determined—gives a resolved yet open breath.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The infinite-staircase trope is re-forged through rigorous probability mechanics; the chipped die transforms abstract recursion into a tactile fetish. Conceptual risk: declaring the protagonist the energy medium could tilt into gimmick, yet the math tracks and the emotional cost is felt. Synthesis feels inevitable: only this character, this flaw, this proof could produce this prison. Specificity of “0.7 °C shift at 8th step” keeps the wonder grounded.</comment>
