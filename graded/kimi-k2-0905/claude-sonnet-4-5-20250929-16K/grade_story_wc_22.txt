<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Erasmus’s grief-turned-gardening motive is vivid and embodied; the seed-scattering micro-choices show a hierarchy of values (memory vs renewal). Interiority stays concrete, but the absence of any live opposing pressure keeps the arc more observational than crucible-tested.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the owl’s “remembering” reweights the whole act, leaving the garden-to-be swimming with unresolved cost. Accumulative lens holds—each avian cue thickens pattern until the final modulation; no因果 breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Jetty, tide level, and barnacle hollows actively determine where seeds can root; the blooming planks constrain every scatter and charge the last image of beauty “learning to swim.” Sensory selection mirrors Erasmus’s listening bias, keeping detail purposeful and tight.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—transform battlefield into living memorial—is clear early; pressure tightens as birds reveal low-tide opportunity, foreclosing delay. Cost is conceptual (future exposure of garden to salt/death) rather than viscerally felt on-page, capping intensity.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme of vegetal memory versus erasure emerges through seed choices and submerged bones; no explicit thesis stated. Final image of “beauty learned to swim” offers resonant non-literal answer, letting ambiguity linger without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person stays tightly filtered through Erasmus’s ornithological ear; diction (“guttural croaking,” “clicks and whistles”) is character-specific and rhythmic. No head-hop; compression in bird translations is taught early and paid off in owl modulation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but purposeful—each sentence advances gardening action or avian intel. One paraphrase loop (“where soil had settled… where fresh water seeped…”) mildly dulls mid-section; no mixed metaphors or filter-verb stacks in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Coachman who navigates by bird dialects to garden a drowned battlefield feels fresh and inevitable; Sumerian lullaby to flowers is specific risk that pays off. Conceptual blend of eco-restoration and linguistic archaeology is non-obvious yet grounded.</comment>
