<comment>Mira’s perceptual signature—hyper-attentive erosion-watching—pushes her beyond passive observer into deliberate planter; each seed choice is a micro-choice under internal pressure. The bread moment lets her taste complicity, showing guilt without diagnostic labels. Final resolve to seed the east wing crystallizes an earned, costed stance, though interior contradiction could be sharper in-scene rather than summarized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: creeping vegetation and disappearing storefronts accrete until the tea-house shard delivers the pattern break. Closure is a Charged Poise: Mira pockets the blue-wrapped bread beside new seed packets—visible conceptual cost, new weight to ordinary acts. Orientation anchors within first 120 words; one clean transition from courtyard to tea-house. Causality is loose under lyric design, but pattern taught early and closure reweights memory vs. erasure.</comment>

<comment>Overgrown palace is filtered through Mira’s gardener-eye—she notes moss height, vine caliper, seed viability—so setting actively constrains tactics. Micro-setting objects (blue cloth, ceramic cups) are handled repeatedly and return in the charged final image. Spatial choreography stays clean as she crosses from bramble wall to low table to east-wing prospect. Sensory balance favors touch and scent—caraway crust, chrysanthemum steam—avoiding visual catalog.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: can ordinary planting push back engineered forgetting? Pressure escalates as each garden memory surfaces (bakery bread, vanished neighbors) until tea-house reveals tenuous absolution for bystanders. One meaningful tightening: decision to seed the “younger” east wing crystallizes risk—time reversing may erase her too. Cost is felt but could be sharper if future consequence (arrest, exhaustion, temporal paradox) were hinted.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through vegetative metaphor—seeds as memory protest—never sermonized. Subtext in bread offering: complicity leavened with sustenance. Final image of wind-scattered leaves re-weights “sacred ordinary” without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers: will gardens save the palace or accelerate its collapse? Concrete emotional after-effect achieved via sensory return of grandmother tea.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Perceptual signature is distinct: Mira estimates vine caliper and crust crackle, not generic pretty decay. Syntax lengthens during reflection, tightens during seed handling, mirroring attention. Free indirect style stays clean: “She called it creeping normality” inside her lexicon. No dialogue convergence; old woman’s archaic diction contrasts with Mira’s gardener idiom. Filter verbs only where voice-motivated (“she noticed”).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Strong read-aloud rhythm; sentence openings vary naturally. Information density high—“blue cloth, still faintly warm” does time-marking, sensory, and nostalgia work in five words. Zero paraphrase loops; each line advances memory/garden pressure. One mixed metaphor?—“archaeology, excavation” beside “seed banks”—but physical logic intact. No scaffold; paragraph cuts test passed.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fantastical erasure-by-neglect feels fresh; guerrilla gardening as insurgent memory is specific synthesis. Transformation test fails: swapping names would gut the gardener vocabulary and seed list that charge the closure. Risky lyric structure taught early, paid off in final leaf image. No derivative echoes; “creeping normality” coinage anchors concept.</comment>
