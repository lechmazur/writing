<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mira’s quiet registrar role is credibly embodied—she notices, hesitates, then acts—but Viktor’s shift from silent bureaucrat to guilt-bathed confessor arrives as exposition dump rather than embodied beat, softening the cost. Elena functions as sympathetic ear, not pressure source, so relationship crucible never ignites. Interiority stays concrete (“hand trembled against the cold wall”), yet the decisive pivot—“your honesty freed me”—is asserted, not dramatized with contradictory impulse. Earned stasis is present but under-costed because Viktor’s prior silence is told, not tasted.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Closure lands clean: the three walk upstairs toward accountability—an Earned Stasis that forecloses silence forever, cost felt in the forecourt’s “scattered evidence.” Causal chain holds: ticket stubs → eavesdrop → mutual confession → joint witness. Orientation is anchored by line 3; no debt. Lens is Causal; each beat tightens options because silence becomes collectively untenable once Mira speaks. Micro-turn is the projector lens reveal, but causality remains intact.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Crystal-tile forecourt and glass chimes are sensuously handled, return in the final image, and supply the metaphoric “scattered evidence” that charges closure—meets 9+ micro-setting gate. Rain-washed light framing is selective, not catalogue. Archive staircase and projector are tactile tools; lens object is physically manipulated to unlock confession. Spatial choreography is flawless across the single downstairs move. Weather feel (rain, lamplight) subtly mirrors internal thaw.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—will institutional silence survive?—tightens once: Mira’s eavesdrop makes shared confession irreversible, narrowing Viktor’s exit strategies. Cost is visible (public exposure, job loss) yet understated; no bodily or material price is dramatized, holding the score below 8. Pressure is coherent under Causal lens; coincidence never rescues. Agency is joint, but protagonist-driven; Mira’s decision to speak triggers the collective stance crystallization.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme—transparency as thaw—emerges through ticket-stub imagery and final “scattered evidence” reprise, never sermonized. Subtext of institutional guilt is carried by Viktor’s doodles and Mira’s lens discovery; no echoing of prompt language. Final image reframes translucent tiles as undeniable fragments, achieving quiet Conceptual Repricing. Ambiguity lingers: no legal outcome promised, only moral stance, satisfying complexity requirement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays anchored to Mira; no head-hop. Perceptual signature is precise—she catalogs, listens, weighs—keeping registrar vocation alive in syntax. Dialogue is sparse but natural; Viktor’s voice carries curator precision (“catalogue what I’ve broken”). Rhythm modulates: longer breathing sentences during chime description, clipped beats downstairs under tension. No register drift; filter verbs minimal. Voice cohesion holds under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Prose is vivid, loop-free, with high information density: “translucent tiles catching the lamplight in fractured rainbows” does visual and symbolic work. Sentence variety is deliberate; no template cadence. Metaphors stay internally coherent (light = evidence). Opening and closing lines anchor voice and re-charge motif. Minor scaffold: “after words became unnecessary” is prompt-recycling, not scene-born; a −0.2 artifact, but it does not touch climax. No grammatical slips.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Fusing embezzlement confession with cryptic doodle art is fresh; translucent forecourt as moral lens is lovely. Yet the embezzlement-through-tickets concept is under-explored—no detail on how doodles encode accounts—so ingenuity feels gestural rather than fully mined. Institutional guilt theme avoids familiar thriller beats, opting for quiet solidarity, which personalizes the angle. Risk is moderate; payoff is cerebral, not visceral.</comment>
