<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Vera’s interior contradiction—teacher of wonder blindsided by her own creation—lands cleanly, embodied in her chill of recognition. The pilgrim is thin but functional as a catalyst; his rapture moment crystallizes the cost. The final smile of surrender shows earned stasis with visible emotional price.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the cave’s song is permanently altered and Vera’s certitude is forfeited, cost legible in “the terrifying gift of genuine surprise.” Accumulative lens holds: each wonder she amplified layers into the emergent shadows that re-inhabit the cave. Orientation is anchored by word 80; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The musical crystal cave is not backdrop; its shifting harmonics directly enable the shadow transformation and final cadence shift. Selective sensory triage—pearl hum, torch-refracted prisms—guides choice under pressure. Spatial choreography stays clean across the single continuous descent.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preservation of sanctuary versus evolution of magic—tightens when shadows feed on the awakened pearl, foreclosing Vera’s control. One meaningful deepening: the forces she cultivated now inhabit the space, narrowing her options to acceptance. Cost is visible in her admission “I don’t know,” a forfeiture of clairvoyant identity.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: wonder proliferates beyond human stewardship. The reweighted cave song in the final image supplies conceptual repricing—magic’s autonomy—rather than moral. Subtext in Vera’s smile accepts irreversible loss of mastery, avoiding tidy wisdom.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Vera’s perceptual filter; diction (“cathedral of bright darkness”) mirrors her vocation. No head-hopping; pilgrim’s rapture is externally observed. Rhythm modulates from instructional cadence to hushed awe, supporting the final poise.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is vivid yet disciplined: no mixed metaphors, no scaffold loops. Figurative density peaks only after the pearl ignites, justified by spectacle. One paraphrase loop—“shadows that shouldn’t exist… overlapping shadows”—is minor and does not touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: clairvoyant undone by the very wonder she curates, magic achieving self-awareness through her pedagogy. Tropes of mystical cave and lost pilgrim are transformed into ecological fable of emergent enchantment. Final image of shadows singing the cave’s new song feels inevitable yet unforeseen.</comment>
