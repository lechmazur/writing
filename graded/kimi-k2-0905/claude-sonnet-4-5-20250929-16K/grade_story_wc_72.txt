<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Marina’s stone endurance and telepathic restraint give her a disciplined, ancient interiority that stays consistent; the descendant’s trembling hands and stammered questions embody live human fragility. Their value clash—statue certainty vs. human grief—drives every beat and culminates in her shouldering the ampoule, a credible renunciation of simple martyrdom myths. Minor slip: “incisive kindness” is named instead of dramatized in one early sentence. Still, both voices remain distinct and their mutual pressure alters each stance by closure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: statue reveals secret → descendant returns → ampoule opened → lineage task rewritten. Orientation lands by line 8; no props teleport. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: descendant accepts guardianship, foreclosing easy blame; cost is the lifelong burden of telling an unpopular truth. Persistent constraint—the living statues’ eternal vigil—shapes the offer and her yes. One micro nit: “three days ago” is off-stage ellipsis, but it motivates present tension without breaking linkage.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Garden’s drowned marble, coral-threaded limbs, and leaning colonnades are tactile and specific; every visual sharpens the stakes of preserved beauty versus salt-water decay. Spatial choreography stays clean as Marina guides the woman to the garden’s heart; distances and stone gestures track without drift. The ampoule’s bioluminescent purple and the silver fish school act as micro-setting extensions that constrain the final reveal. Environment literally shapes the ending: only underwater silence allows telepathy and guardianship to crystallize.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—will the descendant accept the morally messy truth?—is signaled early and tightens when the ampoule is literally pressed to her chest. Agency sits with her: she could swim away; instead she opens the memory serum, accepting vocal exile. Cost is legible—she trades ancestral pride for perpetual witness. Escalation is a single deepening rather than multiple reversals, adequate for 700-word scale.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: preservation sometimes demands complicity in destruction; moral purity is a luxury the drowning city could not afford. Subtext lives in gesture—stone fingers sifting fish, ampoule glow on diving mask—never slogans. Final image of statues turning “their faces toward their first new guardian” reweights all prior melancholy into solemn continuity. No moral is spoon-fed; the reader is left to shoulder the same nuance the descendant accepts.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Narrative voice maintains poised, elegiac distance suitable to an immortal observer; diction (“animate lifelessness,” “incisive kindness”) remains marble-smooth without drifting into textbook diction. Telepathy is formatted cleanly in italics; no head-hop. Rhythm modulates: longer clauses for statue memory, shorter bursts when human panic pierces water. Compression like “coral threading marble arms” is taught early and pays off at closure, satisfying Track B lyric allowance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is largely uncluttered; sentences carry double duty—world detail plus emotional charge (“the water around her trembled with consequences”). One metaphor overlap: “coral threading” + “threading her fingers” could feel recursive, but the echo is brief and structurally purposeful. No filter-verb clusters or loops obscure causality. Final paragraph cadence slows to match geological time without dragging momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Flooded city as intentional self-quarantine feels fresh; crystallized plague-statues invert the usual “curse” trope into volunteer immortality. Combining conservation ethics with biohazard logic yields a concept that would collapse if names or venues were swapped. Risk—telepathic statues guiding a living archivist—could have slid into kitsch yet stays dignified through geological pacing and salt-water realism. Synthesis earns its inevitability: reader exits unable to un-see memory preserved in stone and brine.</comment>
