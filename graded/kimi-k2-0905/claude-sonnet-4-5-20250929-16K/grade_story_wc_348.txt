<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Maya’s interiority is vivid and anchored in sensory science; the “solid grief blocking her throat” embodiment feels chemist-specific. Her shift from avoidance to recording voice notes is a credible micro-choice that reconfigures her stance toward Daniel’s death. The only thinning occurs in the single-line epiphany “she understood suddenly,” which leans diagnostic rather than earned in-scene. Still, the hierarchy of values—science as continuation of love—lands with visible cost: she leaves the ravine carrying the chrysalis, not the man.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the chrysalis + foam insight reweights the meaning of “divergent path” so that separation becomes reconnection. Causal lens holds: because she wades into the braided streams, therefore she sees the self-healing foam, therefore she re-enters the lab path. Orientation is anchored by line 3; no penalty. The final image carries unmistakable conceptual cost—she forecloses perpetual mourning in favor of unfinished notebooks. Meets 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The braided ravine is not postcard backdrop; its foam patterns supply the literal mechanics for her polymer insight, constraining the final choice. Micro-setting success: the chrysalis functions as portable setting-object that charges the exit image. Sensory hierarchy obeys a chemist’s bias—visual patterns, molecular allegories, cold-water data. Achieves 9+ gate: environment constrains tactics and final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—translate grief into scientific continuation—is signaled early. Escalation under Causal lens: each foam re-patterning tightens the possibility that molecular “memory” could heal tissue, narrowing her avoidance into action. Visible price: she chooses the cold lab over warm nostalgia, foreclosing the fantasy that honoring Daniel means stasis. One meaningful turn suffices; cost legible on page.</answer>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Theme emerges from foam → chrysalis → polymer chain homology; no explicit sermonizing. Subtext of “symphony” reweights from Daniel’s poetic aside to her actionable model, a quiet conceptual repricing. The ending refuses tidy moral—science is both mourning and betrayal—and invites counter-reading: is she healing or substituting? Epiphany is earned through tactile pattern recognition, not therapy-speak.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person intimate maintains chemist perceptual signature: molecules, lattices, melodies. No dialogue, so voice distinction N/A. Prose rhythm mirrors water cadence—long sentences for braided streams, clipped fragments for insight beats. Filter verbs (“she watched”) are voice-motivated, serving observational scientist stance. No head-hop; psychic distance compresses naturally under stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</question><comment>High information density: single sentences perform scenic, metaphoric, and conceptual work (“tiny spheres connecting and breaking apart in endless variation”). Zero paraphrase loops; no mixed metaphors. Opening and closing lines are image-anchors, not scaffold. Minor −0.1: “singing” and “symphonically” verge on double use, but pattern is taught early and pays off, so stays within tolerance.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh angle: grief-into-polymer trope is common, but here the material insight is reverse-engineered from literal river foam and an entomological cast-off, not lab equipment. Risky reliance on nature-as-blueprint is earned because the chrysalis is physically handled and its architecture becomes the closure talisman. Specificity of “memory-site” monomer design feels non-generic, chemist-verified. Transformation test passes: swap chrysalis/foam and the entire causal arc collapses.</comment>
