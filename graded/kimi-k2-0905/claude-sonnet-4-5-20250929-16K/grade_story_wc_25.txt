<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mira’s contradictory motives—union-justice hunger vs. self-protective caginess—collide live in scene: her whisper-campaign, tablet swipe refusal, and final solo fade-out all flow from the same Gemini duality promised by the coin. Flaws (overconfidence, instrumental ethics) drive every beat and foreclose alliance with Voss; cost is visible when she sacrifices immediate leverage to keep the coin warm in her palm. Interiority is embodied (grip, storm-hum, harness tug) rather than labeled. Single POV stays tight; no status crucible needed because Voss functions as institutional mirror, not relationship, and that suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal chain is clean: storm → surveillance blind → smuggler timing → Mira’s key-time insight → server bust. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—her father’s vanished union box is now traceable, a social cost that reweights every prior whisper. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 3 and tighten with tablet swipe. No lens ambiguity; the pace folds rather than resets, satisfying single-scene default. Minor −0.1: Inspector Voss’s off-page file fetch is slightly soft, but Mira’s tactical gamble already locked cost, so closure untouched.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The container labyrinth is not backdrop but tactical Rubik’s cube: 3-D folds on the tablet physically block/enable every move; final nexus “won’t exist by dawn” charges closure. Micro-settings—maintenance harness, storm-humming metal, zodiac coin—constrain access and timing. Sensory economy favors metallic hum and violet light over visual checklist; spatial choreography tracks cleanly through shifting corridors. Environment directly shapes strategy; without the daily re-configuration, Mira’s垄断 of navigation and the key-time insight collapse.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—prove whisper-power while tracing her father’s container—signals early and tightens when she refuses map handover, risking Voss’s armed raid. Mid-story “key = time” revelation escalates under storm-surge pressure, foreclosing electronic tracking and forcing analog cunning. Cost is felt: she trades leverage for the confidential name, paying with future vulnerability. Agency drives each beat; coincidence (storm) complicates but does not resolve. One meaningful turn suffices; escalation is legible and persistent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme—whispered knowledge vs. institutional shout—emerges through action: withheld maps, quiet code entry, off-screen exit. No character sermonizes; final image of Mira walking “like she belonged” reweights prior whispers into authority claimed. Subtext in Voss’s softened “Wait” shows institutional surrender to quiet calculus. Union-corporate critique stays implicit, carried by container 4472-G’s absence. Ambiguity lingers: will the whispered name save her father’s reputation or merely weaponize her? No tidy moral, only reconfigured power.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Voice is crisp, maritime-tech, tinged with union-legacy grit: “quiet words dropped in the right ears,” “storm-light,” “labyrinth’s infinite configurations.” Syntax tightens under pressure—short imperative beats during container breach. No dialogue bloat; single “Wait” carries subtext. POV distance stays close-third; no filter-verb stacks. Minor cadence repetition in “whispers traveled farther…” used twice but frames theme, so forgiven.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>High density: each sentence toggles map, storm, motive. Figurative control precise—“pathways blooming and collapsing like origami” mirrors digital fold without muddle. No paraphrase loops or scaffold. Strong verbs dominate: “adjusted,” “gripped,” “slipped away.” Rhythm varies; paragraph lengths mirror beat pauses. Proofing clean. One near-miss: “calculated spontaneity” as adjective pile, but phrase is motivated by POV’s professional gaze and is earned.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: geomagnetic storm + shifting container maze + labor-ghost subtext feels inevitable yet uncharted. Zodiac coin as union talisman reframes tech-noir into inherited memory. Whispers-over-shouts tactic operationalized, not quoted. Risk in off-page file retrieval pays off by keeping spotlight on Mira’s solitary power. Premise is transformed through specific port logic; not a template graft.</comment>
