<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>The queen’s interiority is vivid—“disenchantment had settled into her bones like winter cold”—and her refusal to let courtiers accompany her crystallizes agency. The final decision to descend is earned, but the causality between “watching fireflies” and “purpose” is asserted more than dramatized; a sharper micro-choice on the ridge would have lifted her into the 9-band. Still, her flawed sovereignty and embodied fatigue keep her credibly human.</comment>

<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Causal chain holds: dreams → collapsed messenger → dawn climb → cobalt grotto → firefly revelation → return with purpose. The Orientation Test is passed by line 5; lens stays situational throughout. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the bleeding starlight re-weights her rule from fatalism to agency, felt cost visible in “harder, clearer, more dangerous.” Only a hairline slip: the old woman’s entrance is unmotived teleport, not earned by prior cue.</comment>

<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Setting is protagonist: the ridge “blade of stone,” the cobalt grotto that “wept light,” the ember grotto whose heat she trades for higher cold. Each geological layer constrains stamina and steers the next foothold. Final image of fireflies ascending to “bleeding starlight” recharges the entire visual pattern. Micro-setting (her scraped hands, gown heavy with cloud-wet) doubles as body-anchor, cleanly meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—escape the maddening dreams—tightens when a third messenger collapses, making the climb an on-page necessity. Pressure escalates via altitude: thinning air, raw hands, vanishing world below. The grotto vision is the single meaningful deepening that swaps passivity for choice. Cost is visible in “hands scraped raw” and the intangible forfeiture of “golden certainties,” but no concrete tactical loss (time, tool, social credit) alters later moves, keeping it just shy of 8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without sermon: rule as a mutable climb rather than inherited crown. The bleeding starlight reframes wounds as portals; fireflies mirror the ascent of tiny, mortal agency. Final image avoids moral, offering only “harder, clearer, more dangerous” purpose. One decorative echo—“color of bruises that never heal”—slips toward symbolic convenience, preventing 9.0.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person keeps queen’s perceptual signature—“softly commanding voice that made refusal sound like benediction”—distinct from the old woman’s lacy menace. Syntax flexes with altitude: longer clauses in oxygen-thick valley, staccato breath on ridge. No dialogue, so voice must carry subtext; it does through metaphors that stay geologic, never venturing into corporate register. Only a faint template cadence in triple “color of…” clause keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sentences do double duty: “The world below vanished into white nothingness” compresses altitude and psychology. Metaphors stay internally consistent—starlight as blood, grotto as wound—without mixed-vehicle collision. One paraphrase loop: “color of deep ocean, the color of midnight, the color of bruises” could lose one clause. Otherwise rhythm breathes with ascent, and zero scaffolding obscures the closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Fantasy trope—prophetic dreams, crone oracle—gets re-geologized into lithic anatomy: kingdom as ridge, crown as discardable stone. The inversion of starlight as bleeding rather than benign is a fresh inflection that grows inevitable from prior imagery. Risky vertical structure (climb as plot) is executed without gimmickry. Remains half-step below 8.5 because the oracle’s cosmology feels borrowed; we get atmosphere, not new mythic logic.</comment>
