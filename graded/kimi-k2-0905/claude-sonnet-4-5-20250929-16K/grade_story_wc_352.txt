<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Celene’s “prism-minded” lens is dramatized in her angled reading of the page and in her bodily negotiation of the inverted grotto; interior contradiction is shown, not labeled. The decision to plant the seeds is the earned culmination of three years of off-page search, but the story withholds any on-page moment where she questions or costs herself in that quest—motivation is coherent yet thinly felt. No secondary character appears, so status crucible is NA; micro-choices under gravity inversion are concrete and specific. Closure choice (planting) is causally tied to prior discovery and carries visible cost in the moment of soil-into-stone, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal chain is clean: doodle → inversion trip → threshold chamber → planting. The inversion-hour rule is taught early and paid off at climax, so orientation is waived. Closure is a Decisive Change with conceptual cost: the seeds’ future vigilance reweights the archive’s mortality. One minor scaffold loop in “coiling route / coils and chambers” is cosmetic, not causal.</comment>

<comment>The grotto’s serpentine anatomy is rendered through Celene’s tactile navigation; walls, mist, and floating grit constrain every pull and squeeze. The manuscript page itself acts as micro-setting, its angle-of-light threshold literally steering her body. Final image of stone-become-soil crystallizes the inversion rule and charges closure. No environment details are wasted; each reappears as tactic or cost.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—archive survival via forgotten combination—is signaled in paragraph four and tightened when the hidden chamber exposes the masters’ prior planting. Inversion hour acts as live clock, foreclosing delay; every upward drift of sediment raises bodily cost. Protagonist agency drives each beat: she chooses the hour, pulls herself through thresholds, plants. Cost is visible in the final seed-press into stone that momentarily resists her thumb.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of vigilance-through-botanical-memory emerges from the concrete act of planting engineered seeds, never abstractly preached. The doodle’s serpent and the grotto’s intestines quietly echo without overt symbol-labeling. Final image reweights “forgotten combinations” as living watchers, offering Conceptual Repricing. No tidy moral—just an open growth that will outlast human custodians.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person focalization stays tight to Celene’s perceptual quirks—“prism-minded,” angle-of-light reading, upward-drifting hair—creating a distinct syntactic shimmer. No head-hopping; psychic distance narrows under inversion to breath-length sentences. Inversion neologisms (“stone tears,” “reverse rain”) are coinages she could plausibly form mid-peril. Final sentence cadence slows to match the seeds’ slow future watch, a rhythmic mirror of theme.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>High information density: one sentence often carries sensory cue, world rule, and emotional tilt (“Mist clung…pearl-gray…she gripped”). No paraphrase loops; each metaphor is physically coherent with inversion physics. Verb choice is muscular—“pulled herself down—or was it up?”—without purple overload. Opening line anchors voice and stakes simultaneously; final line resolves by image that re-cues doodle’s luminescence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The inversion-hour botano-cognitive archive is a fresh synthesis of biopunk and portal-fantasy, not a template trope. Doodle-as-map and gravity-as-key invert the usual treasure-logic: knowledge is planted, not extracted. Risk of quiet ending is embraced; no twist undercuts the earned stasis. Specificity of “seeds of vigilance” could not swap with generic crystals—their growth-into-surveillance is concept-locked.</comment>
