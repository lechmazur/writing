<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Marcus’s “mournfully eager” gait is viscerally embodied in the trembling pull-cord hand; the contradiction between grief and manic hope drives every beat. His seven-year tenure and acoustic experiments are economically anchored to the tunnel’s stone, making the leaf-blower ritual feel inevitable rather than quirky. The micro-choice to scatter actual oak/maple leaves (not just “leaves”) concretizes his private theology of sound. Closure’s cost is understated but legible: he forfeits silence and accepts the role of underground troubadour of grief—an Earned Stasis that forecloses retreat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the household’s silence is pierced, the brother speaks, the mother smiles—undeniable conceptual cost paid. Causality is lyric-accumulative rather than strictly because/therefore; each gust of off-key wind layers texture until the limestone itself seems to remember. The final image of Marcus gripping the cord “like a talisman” reweights the entire premise: the tunnel is no longer service corridor but resonant organ. No orientation debt; anchors (who/where/when) settle by line 3 and hold.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The tunnel’s acoustic physics are not exposition but discovered through ritual action—leaf against stone, nozzle angle changing pitch. Sensory hierarchy obeys Marcus’s caretaker gaze: blower roar first, then smell of leaf dust, then vibration in wrist bones. The ventilation grates function as both literal ducts and emotional trapdoors, letting sound “curl around hearts” upstairs—setting actively mediates outcome. Micro-setting of the pull-cord handle in his palm becomes the story’s heartbeat metronome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—re-open the family’s closed throat—signaled immediately. Escalation is tonal rather than plot-reversals: each blower added thickens the off-key wind until the household must breathe again. Cost is diffuse but felt: Marcus exhausts himself, Risks hearing damage, cedes privacy of grief. The tightening is the moment mother’s hand freezes above kettle—external proof that pressure has breached stone.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</question><comment>Theme emerges obliquely: grief is not a problem to solve but a vibration to keep alive until the living remember how to tremble. Subtext resides in the paradox of mechanical wind carrying half-remembered lullabies—technology enlisted for tenderness. No character names the lesson; the brother’s simple “I heard something today that sounded like her” is the thematic payload. Avoids sentimental trap by leaving laughter still absent—only the possibility has been re-installed.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Marcus’s perceptions; diction—“macerate,” “calcified,” “troubadour”—matches a groundskeeper-poet who thinks in tools and stone. Syntax lengthens during conducting sequences, mimics crescendo; shortens at shutdown to mimic sucked-back silence. No filter-verb clusters; immediacy is achieved through leaf-bits striking skin and acoustic feedback in bones. Voice never slips into authorial lecture; even thematic insights are embedded in tactile detail.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</question><comment>Rhythm alternates between long breathy sentences (wind surges) and clipped fragments (cord yanks) without algorithmic feel. Metaphors stay physically rooted: sound “curls,” silence “rushes back in”—no mixed vehicles. Opening line anchors voice, stakes, and eeriness in one blow. Only minor scaffold: “something else” used twice in proximity; does not dull closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</question><comment>Premise—using leaf-blower roar in limestone tunnel as grief-therapy—is arrestingly non-obvious yet instantly credible given acoustic science. Fusion of autumn leaf ritual with lullaby fragments creates fresh synthesis of machine and maternal memory. Transforms trope of “haunted tunnel” from horror site to healing instrument. Risk pays off: ending feels inevitable yet could not be guessed from opener.</comment>
