<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Maya’s contradictory impulses—narrating detachment while hinting self-harm—are vivid, embodied, and track her slow refusal to perform feeling. “She cultivates lightness” fused with the driftwood’s near-disintegration makes the renunciation legible. Moral ambiguity is dramatized, not labeled, and the final silence carries felt cost. Voice cadence never slips; interiority stays knife-sharp.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the bouquet’s deliberate disintegration forecloses nostalgic performance and reweights silence as permissible. Accumulative lens holds: each shaved curl and narrated blankness tightens the stake of “permission to feel” without causal reversals. Turbine hum and flower ash are charged with conceptual cost the final hush makes undeniable. No orientation debt; transitions are legible and taught early.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Farmhouse/turbine geometry anchors every beat; wind casts literal shadow and auditory pressure that masks forbidden grief. Driftwood block operates as micro-setting—its diminishing mass externalizes the internal lightening. Spatial choreography stays clean; blades’ sweep is sensed even when off-stage. Final wall-absence image reuses the same vertical plane, reconfigured. No generic placeholders; every detail is filtered through Maya’s grief-narrowed attention.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“can she exit performed detachment without breaking new peace”—tightens via each whittling curl: tangible weight lost equals incremental permission gained. Escalation is accumulative: pattern of narrated emptiness grows unbearable until silence itself flips from oppression to option. Cost is visible: bouquet destroyed, wood gone, voice cracked; no reset. Agency is renunciation, not conquest; that aligns with lyric pressure model.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Remade hush theme emerges from concrete reductions: curls, ash, silence. No thesis states itself; final image of “nothing at all” reweights prior narration as first draft of authentic feeling. Conceptual Repricing occurs: silence stops being Mandate residue and becomes earned space. Complexity preserved—no moral certitude about whether this is healing or numbness.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Detached third-person self-narration creates a singular perceptual signature that externalizes dissociation. Syntax mimics turbine rhythm: clipped present-tense reports, passive constructions, avoidance of first-person pronoun. Compression taught by line 3 and sustained; no register drift. Voice modulates once—micro-crack on “lighter now”—without breaking pattern. Prose-as-character fully achieved.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Density is high: each sentence layers task, metaphor, world rule. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Figurative language is patterned—blade/carving imagery stays coherent to physical logic. Rhythm accelerates with whittle beats then breathes at bouquet collapse. Final line achieves charged poise without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: post-utopian grief told through anti-creation—unmaking wood instead of shaping it. Narrating one’s own dishwashing as stage direction literalizes the mandated performance in a way I haven’t seen. Risk of self-harm reference is taken but not sensationalized; refusal to resolve morality feels authentic. Concept and voice are inseparable—swap any detail and the whole fractures.</comment>
