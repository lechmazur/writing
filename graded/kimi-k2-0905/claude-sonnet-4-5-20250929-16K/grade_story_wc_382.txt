<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The narrator’s curiosity is embodied through tactile micro-choices (climbing to the apartment, watching the seal catch starlight) and a credible hierarchy of values—comfortable denial vs. hunger for truth—culminating in the costly request “Teach me everything.” Dr. Khoury’s immortal poise is shown via gesture, not label, and her patiently-nimble trait visibly constrains how she measures sugar and traces glyphs, making the immortal tutor feel individual, not archetype. The relationship shift from neighborly ritual to mentor–initiate is dramatized in the rooftop interrogation beat, so the bond itself becomes the crucible. Only minor shortfall: we don’t yet see how immortality has internally scarred her; that extra contradiction would push to 9+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each Thursday tea accrues knowledge that narrows the narrator’s ignorance until the only remaining option is to confront the lie; the meteor-shower rooftop supplies the visible constraint (cosmic time vs. immortal time) that forces the decisive question. Closure is a clean Decisive Change: the narrator steps from protected pupil to apprentice of eternity, cost felt in the line “Some borrowing…was never meant to be returned.” Orientation is anchored within the first 120 words (door knock, old building, sugar request), and the Byzantine seal’s provenance is foreshadowed early enough to avoid retroactive patch. No plot amnesia or convenient resets.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Environment is filtered through an architect’s eye—cornices as “declarations,” papers like “miniature skylines”—so every book pile and limestone arch guides the narrator’s desire and later choice. The rooftop garden under meteors functions as micro-setting that literally showers the decisive beat with cosmic dust, reweighting the stakes from academic curiosity to existential commitment. Spatial choreography is clean: door, cluttered apartment, rooftop ascent track without drift. The bronze seal recurs as handled object, its shifting wings charging the final image; this satisfies the 9+ gate that a tool constrain choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—learning the language of old buildings—tightens when the narrator realizes the price is entry into immortal memory; the meteor shower intensifies this by offering a visible clock in the sky. One meaningful reversal: the agreed-upon lie flips into demanded truth, narrowing the narrator’s safe options from polite student to bound apprentice. Cost is legible on-page: loss of ordinary temporality (“never meant to be returned”). Pressure escalates under causal lens because each lesson removes the possibility of remaining merely human; no coincidence resolves the conflict.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: knowledge of the past is not archival but visceral, requiring surrender to unending memory. Subtext resides in gesture—the sugar measured “more than I needed” foreshadows the excess of immortal time. The final image reweights the earlier mundane borrowing into existential indebtedness without moralizing. Complexity is honored: the narrator’s gain is also a loss of finite life, yet the story refuses to label this tragic or heroic.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>First-person voice carries an architect’s perceptual signature—planes, angles, load-bearing stones—creating idiosyncratic noticing. Rhythm modulates: longer reflective sentences in the apartment contract to short urgent clauses on the rooftop under meteors. No head-hopping; interior access stays strictly bounded to the narrator’s dawning recognition. Dialogue is sparse but distinct: Dr. Khoury’s quiet, archaic cadence (“Did you think such knowledge came from books alone?”) contrasts with the narrator’s contemporary directness.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is taut, with high information density: “books towered like miniature skylines” does character, setting, and metaphor in one stroke. No synonym loops or template cadence; each sentence advances image or decision. Figurative language is selective—meteors as “punctuation marks” appears only at the climax, charging the closure. Copy is clean; pronouns track cleanly after the subject shift to “she” on the roof.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The immortal-mentor trope is refreshed by framing immortality as linguistic burden rather than super-power: she tutors dead languages because they are alive in her mouth. The architect-as-seer angle gives the familiar “listen to buildings” motif a professional lens, making the final apprenticeship feel vocationally inevitable. Specific detail—ink-stained fingers, Byzantine seal worn smooth—grounds the fantastical in tactile reality. A risk bonus applies: the quiet rooftop reveal eschews spectacle yet intensifies stakes through cosmic timing.</comment>
