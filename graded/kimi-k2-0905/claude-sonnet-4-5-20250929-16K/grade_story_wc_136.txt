<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Mara’s “analytically artistic” eye is repeatedly dramatized: she kneels to trace the cracks, sketches them, then chooses the smallest truth instead of grand secrets—an earned micro-choice that crystallizes her hierarchy of values. The grandmother’s punch and the imperative “follow what others cannot see” supply clear, pressure-heightening motive. Interiority stays concrete (“certainty bloom in her chest,” “tears blurred…vision”) and avoids label-speak. Flawed passivity is not explored, and the moment of selection is summarized rather than scenically lingered-on, keeping the score just below the 9+ threshold.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Accumulative/lyric lens holds: each arrow-cracked block and mist-form adds density until the cathedral of whispers detonates meaning. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Mara’s new cartographic vocation (“she would spend the rest of her days…”)—with undeniable conceptual cost: she forfeits ordinary life to midwife silence. Causality is clean: punch → gate → truth → vocation. The 120-word orientation test is met (midnight, abandoned district), so no penalty. A hairline slip: “she understood its purpose” tells rather than shows the punch’s agency, but the final image still reweights stakes, satisfying the 9− gate.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Setting is filtered through Mara’s cartographer gaze—angles, fractures, bridges-to-nowhere—so environment literally supplies the map she must draw. Micro-setting (the brass punch) is handled repeatedly and constrains the final ingress. Starlit vault and crystallized-silence fortress are lyrically specific yet track spatially. A half-step short of 9: the mist’s architectural forms dissolve unused; they don’t feedback to tighten tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“can she read and survive the hidden map?”—is signaled at word 40. Escalation is accretive: each arrow raises the impossibility density, forcing her forward. The fortress gate renunciation (she may take only one truth) forges a visible trade-off. Cost is present but abstract (lifetime mission) rather than bodily or immediate; that softness caps the score below 8.5.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme—cartography of silence—emerges through concrete recursion: mapping cracks → mapping swallowed words → teaching others to map. No character voices the thesis; the final image of her “guide to finding unspoken truths” is an action, not a maxim. Complexity is honored: the city keeps its secrets, Mara keeps only one. A whisper of sentimentality in “tears blurred” is the single drag.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise: “crystallized silence,” “compressed quiet” match the POV’s analytical artist. Filter verbs are minimal; metaphors stay consistent (architecture of mist, cathedral of whispers). Rhythm escalates via parataxis amid discovery, then softens at dawn. Punch-click as onomatopoeic “key turning” is satisfying sonic payoff. One clause drifts toward editorial certainty—“she understood now why she’d been chosen”—slightly oversteps POV modesty, preventing 9.0.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is taut, imagistic, high-density; sentences multitask (“The mist grew denser, swirling into architectural forms…”). No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Opening and closing lines frame stakes and resonance. A single register lift—“conceptual repricing” territory—appears but fits the lyric mode. Closure beat is crystal-clear; therefore 9+ band remains open with only a hairline deduction for “impossible configurations” echoing twice in close proximity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: urban infrastructure fracture-as-cartography + unspoken truths as architecture is non-obvious and fully committed. Grandmother punch relic sidesteps genre cliché; its emptiness is the key. Risky lyric structure paid off by coherent accretive pattern. The concept would collapse if swapped to another city or vocation—high specificity. Not quite 9.5 only because the emotional after-shock is gentle rather than wrenching.</comment>
