<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>The alchemist’s refusal of wish-escape and her decision to “pour” memory into the bottle are concrete, motive-driven choices that foreclose alternatives with visible cost (solitude, the risk of failure). Interiority stays anchored to action—“she closed her eyes and let the town’s history flood through her”—avoiding label-speak. Yet we get no contradictory impulse mid-scene; her certainty flattens the internal contradiction that the rubric prizes at climax. Still, the earned renunciation lands cleanly and charges the final image, satisfying the 9- test.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The causal spine holds: refusal → discovery → memory transfusion → bottle-crack → reimagined town. Each step tightens options, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing that makes the “library scattered across the wind” both cost and promise. Orientation is nailed inside 120 words; no lens ambiguity. The –0.3 reserve is for the slightly telegraphed epiphany—“she understood now”—that momentarily explains rather than dramatizes the turn, but closure still carries felt cost under the causal lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Paper-lantern cove is evoked through selective, POV-filtered detail—tattered awnings, salt-worn air, ovens beginning to hum—rather than postcard inventory. The amber bottle functions as micro-setting that actively constrains her tactic (no seam → must use memory instead of tools). Sensory hierarchy narrows to touch and light at the decisive beat, charging the final image. Only the “seven languages” line feels briefly touristic, but it is quickly re-filtered through her alchemical purpose, so the cap at 8.8 is not triggered.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—can the town’s genius be reborn without cheap wish-fulfillment?—is signaled early and escalates through one meaningful tightening: the sealed bottle forces her to sacrifice her private memory archive. The price is visible—she empties her mind’s crucible into the glass, risking self-erasure. Escalation is causal, not iterative; one decisive intensification suffices at this length. The 0.1 dock is for the off-stage djinn who never re-applies pressure; the conflict is largely internal, but agency remains legible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the particular sequence: rejection of escapist nostalgia → transmutation of accumulated culture into open-source possibility. No moral is stated; the final “library scattered across the wind” reweights prior motifs without sermon. The ambiguity is productive—readers must decide whether dispersal equals loss or seeding. A hairline deduction for the abstract noun “necessary transformation” hovering near the end; it slightly over-articulates what the image has already earned.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays tight to the alchemist’s perceptual signature—“smooth as honey,” “sugar in rain”—with rhythmic variation that accelerates into the crack-moment. No head-hop; psychic distance compresses believably under stress. The synesthetic “lightning” of fissures is the sole risked metaphor, but it is paid off by the immediate sensory bloom of lanterns. Voice never drifts into committee exposition; diction remains within her plausible lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty: “The amber bottle had appeared…nested in the tide pools where the paper lanterns once reflected like fallen stars” fuses backstory, setting, and loss in one breath. No loops, no scaffold, no filter-verb stacks. Figurative language is sparse and targeted; mixed-metaphor risk is avoided. A single paraphrase twitch—“she had not stayed to preserve a corpse” followed immediately by “she had not revived a ghost town”—is minor enough to leave the 9-band untouched and closure unblurred.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The wish-town-ghost is familiar, yet the story’s synthesis—alchemical memory-transfer as civic reboot—feels non-obvious and inevitable in hindsight. Risk is taken: no dialogue, no antagonist, no traditional conflict beat, yet coherence holds. The dispersed-library image is a fresh inflection that would collapse if any component were swapped. Bold compression and lyric escalation elevate stakes without gimmickry, earning the +0.2 risk bonus within band.</comment>
