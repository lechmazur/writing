<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Mira’s solitude-as-theatre habit is vividly particularized and embodied; her interior contradiction—mourning permanence while liquefying glass—drives every micro-choice. The renunciation of city/answers is credible, but the “thawing heart” thesis is declared more than dramatized in scene. Embodied emotion is strong (frost-rimed palm, chest-weight), yet the final smile feels slightly unearned because no alternative path is foregone on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Mira sketches the next sanctuary while spring collapses winter’s architecture; cost is felt in the elegiac pipe-groan and revealed rock. Lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of melt/ice imagery reweights the stake of impermanence. The “And thus concludes…” sentence risks meta-wink, but cadence shift crystallizes rather than breaks the pattern.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Environment (abandoned control room, dripping eaves, annealer hum) is lived-in and choice-guiding: refrigeration units that no longer refrigerate both enable glasswork and taunt with lost purpose. Micro-setting—bookmark as glacial memory talisman—constrains her reading/act of remembering. Sensory hierarchy priorities (burnt coffee, pinched glass) mirror internal thaw; final melt-channel image reconfigures meaning.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can art hold fragility without demanding answers—tightens once when she suspends shards inside the sphere, paying visible labor/time. No external antagonist, but spring’s slow violence complicates; price is 18-hour anneal wait and the elegiac soundscape. Escalation is accumulative: each icicle drip thickens atmosphere until final gutter-crack; agency remains her decision to keep sketching.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme of impermanence-as-creation emerges through glass/ice mirroring rather than lecture. The bookmarked glacial memory line is reprised and reweighted: Mira re-prices remembering as survival, not failure. Final image of rock revealed beneath snow offers resonant non-literal answer—loss as transformation—without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Perceptual signature is distinct: scientific diction (“oxidized metal,” “annealer”) filtered through lyrical self-narration creates a believable solitary artist voice. Rhythm modulates—long reflective sentences versus crisp tool commands—mirroring melt/formation cycles. No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens interiority without filter-verb clutter.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>High information density: “frost-rimed window” does triple duty—weather, body, metaphor. No loops; sentences vary openings and length. One mixed metaphor (“quiet violence of ice surrendering”) is earned by context; register stays consistent. Final paragraph propels via image-chain rather than explanation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Fusing glassblower with climate-grief station is fresh synthesis; transformation test passes—occupation and locale shape stakes inseparably. Risk of self-narration trope is taken, not hedged, and supports solitude theme. Could edge higher if glacial-memory science tied more tightly to glass technique.</comment>
