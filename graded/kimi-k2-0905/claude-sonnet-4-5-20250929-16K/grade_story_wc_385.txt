<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Kael’s interiority is grounded in concrete sensory action (“clutched the seashell,” “pressed herself into a side corridor”). The moment her voice splits is dramatized, not declared, giving visible cost to her transformation. Still, the final beat leans on abstract heritage speech rather than a micro-choice that seals her new allegiance. The earned shift is legible, but the last paragraph drifts into choral exposition that softens the personal price.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Kael’s dual-voice harmony crystallizes her guardian identity while the nexus reverberates with undeniable new cost. Causal chain holds—seashell cue → split voice → self-revelation—each step tightening options under an Accumulative/Textural lens. One minor orientation lag: “lower passages” geography is assumed, not anchored, but the final image exploits starlight cracks to re-weight meaning, so the waiver applies. The persistent constraint—she now sings two tracks forever—shapes the final cadence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The serpentine nexus is evoked through motion (“wound through the passages”) rather than static catalog. Starlight filtering through cracks becomes the final charged image that mirrors Kael’s layered voice. The seashell fragment acts as micro-setting, guiding her ear to wall-fissures and thus altering tactics. One detail short: we never feel stone temperature or air shift, so environment stops just short of forcing a physical trade-off.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—why some voices linger—signals early and tightens when Kael’s own voice splits, foreclosing her former single-song identity. The escalation is textural: each echo she uncovers adds density until the universe’s “secret song” reweights her purpose. Cost is conceptual but legible: perpetual double-singing is an irreversible new burden. A sharper visceral price (bleeding throat, disorientation) would have pushed higher.</answer>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges without moralizing: communication itself is a palimpsest—commerce on top, secret history beneath. The seashell’s reprise at the end re-weights the motif from curiosity to vocation. Reed-blown melancholy modulates into purposeful harmony, giving emotional aftereffect. Abstract final lines (“universe needed both to hum its secret song”) flirt with pseudo-profundity but stay anchored to Kael’s lived change.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Kael’s perceptions; starlight and stone texture filter through her singer’s bias. Syntax flexes with tension—“voice split for the first time” compresses the shock beat. No dialogue, so voice remains pure lyric without register drift. Occasional elevated diction (“palimpsest,” “serpentine”) is justified by the mythic frame and taught early.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</answer><comment>Prose is mostly loop-free; one scaffold phrase—“through the stone walls”—is repeated in adjacent sentences but does not dull closure. Metaphors are coherent: seashell/ear, starlight/truth. Information density high; single sentences deliver both world-rule and character beat (“She sang again, and this time both her voices harmonized…”). A few adjective clusters (“richly perceptive eyes”) verge on ornament yet fit the lyrical register.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The echo-people guardian conspiracy feels fresh because it literalizes acoustics as politics. Progressive disclosure is structurally woven, not bolted on. Reed-blown melancholy trope is transmuted from mood to vocation. Risk—using song as espionage—pays off without obscuring clarity. Minor deduction for nexus-as-seashell metaphor that edges familiar fantasy topography.</comment>
