<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The portraitist’s prosopagnosia is dramatized through tactile measurement and the paradox of painting faces she cannot recognize; her decision to photograph the coin and later paint the custodian from measured memory crystallizes a credible, earned endurance that forecloses no easy path. Interiority stays concrete—“fingertips across the canvas,” “coin grew warm against her ribs”—and the asymptotic flaw (never truly seeing wholes) drives every choice. No secondary character applies pressure on-page, but the single-POV arc satisfies; the final self-portrait-by-proxy is a visible cost. Voice remains distinct, never diagnostic, and the asymptote metaphor is lived, not labeled.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: she walks out into dawn destruction carrying the warm coin, its invisible engravings now part of her future portraits—an asymptotic promise that reweights the premise. The lens is Accumulative/Textural; density of mirrored attempts (canvas, coin, tree) tightens once through the custodian’s journal revelation, and the final image crystallizes cost without needing causal reversal. Orientation is anchored by line 3 (“4 AM”) and the oak library interior; no debt applies. The ending beat (“The limits we discover…”) is an earned conceptual re-pricing, not an abstract moral.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The tree-library’s weeping sap shelves and encroaching demolition gear constrain every beat; she must act before sunrise. The coin-as-micro-setting charges the closure when its warmth against her ribs becomes the last tactile link to the monk’s infinite attempt. Selective sensory hierarchy—touch over sight—mirrors her face-blind perceptual bias. Spatial choreography is clean: she lifts, photographs, tucks the coin while wrecking-ball idles outside. Environment is not backdrop but ticking container that will shortly fail to hold heaven, forcing her stance.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: can she honor the custodian’s invitation to “see differently” before the tree falls? Pressure escalates once: from arrival at dead custodian → discovery of coin → decision to preserve its pattern through her own asymptotic art. The tightening is textural: each mirrored attempt (canvas, coin, tree) narrows her options to mere continuation, not capture. Cost is felt: the library will fall, the coin’s detail remains invisible, yet she chooses to keep painting. Agency is renunciation/continuation rather than victory—a credible stance crystallization under situational pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the repeating pattern of asymptotic ambition: canvas, coin, tree—each container fails yet the attempt persists. No character states the theme; the final line (“the reaching that reveals them”) is an imagistic re-weighting, not a moral. Subtext resides in silence: the custodian’s peaceful death absolves her from saving the tree, forcing the subtler question of how to live with uncloseable infinity. Counter-readings linger: is the pursuit noble or compulsive? The coin’s warmth against her ribs answers only with embodied continuance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person omniscient stays modest, filtering through her tactile bias—“fingertips across the canvas,” “yellow demolition equipment waited”—no knowledge she lacks. Syntax lengthens in reflective beats, shortens under dawn pressure: “She tucked the coin… walked out…” Rhythm mirrors the asymptote: long spiraling sentences for library description, staccato paragraph at demolition start. No dialogue, so voice is carried by perceptual signature and metrical control. Register stays within her plausible lexicon; no academic intrusion. The compression “measuring distances between features she could never truly see” teaches the pattern early and pays off in final portrait.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high information density—“cambium and heartwood” does arboreal world-building in three words. Metaphors are coherent: asymptotic curves, sap-weeping shelves, coin as meditation in metal—no mixed vehicles. No filter-verb stacks; verbs are strong (“spiraled,” “pressed,” “tucked”). Paragraph cut test passes: every paragraph advances knowledge or emotional charge. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image that recharges asymptote motif. No typos or tense drift. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with scene tempo.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of face-blind portraitist + fractal coin + doomed tree-library is fresh; each element transforms the others into a unified meditation on asymptotic art. The premise is non-obvious yet feels inevitable in hindsight: of course a woman who paints faces she cannot see would understand a monk who engraved stars he could never finish. Risk-taking—no dialogue, no antagonist, no reversal—heightens coherence rather than obscuring it. Specificity throughout (custodian’s peaceful death, sap-weeping shelves) prevents abstraction. Transformation test fails if names changed: the particularity of prosopagnosia and fractal engraving is irreplaceable.</comment>
