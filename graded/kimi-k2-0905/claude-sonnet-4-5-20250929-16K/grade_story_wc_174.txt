<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Marcus’s serenity is stated rather than embodied; the interior contradiction between “ethical storytelling” and his partner’s charge of exploitation is announced but never dramatized in a visible micro-choice. The only embodied cost is the mute freeze of the puppets mid-gesture, yet this is Marcus’s decision, not a forced crucible, so the felt price is oblique. His motivation is coherent but static; no flaw complicates the final stance, so the arc feels more milieu-portrait than transformation.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the frozen tableau reweights the premise—uncertainty as gift—while the drunk’s returned stick and the audience’s “peculiar quiet” let the cost reverberate. Causality is situational/accumulative; no single because/therefore hinge snaps, yet the pressure of the argument and the stick’s circulation accumulate to crystallize Marcus’s stance. The lens holds, but the partner’s exit is off-stage and the drunk’s intervention is coincidence that merely complicates, not resolves, so the tightening is mild.</comment>

<comment>The dome’s “curved embrace” and the “meteor hush” are micro-settings that charge the final image; the campfire stick’s carved symbols constrain who can hold the narrative floor, so the object functions as portable setting that alters tactics. Sensory detail is selective—silence, half-darkness, wet ink—mirroring Marcus’s narrowed attention. Spatial choreography stays clean across the stick’s hand-off and the audience’s murmurs. The environment never stalls momentum; every detail tilts toward the staging of uncertainty.</comment>

<comment>The dominant stake—whether subversive puppet ethics legitimately create moral space—arrives early but stays abstract until the drunk’s half-remembered anger tightens it into a live test. The only escalation is the stick’s unexpected migration; this is coincidence, not agency, so pressure grows via accumulative embarrassment rather than Marcus’s choice. Cost is present but diffuse: the partner’s absence and the suspended ending foreclose tidy moral victory, yet no concrete loss (tool, social credit) alters later tactics.</comment>

<comment>Theme emerges cleanly: ethical storytelling is not answer-delivery but permission to inhabit uncertainty. The refrain of reversal (walking morals backward) and the suspended puppet tableau enact this without final statement. The meteor-hush image offers Conceptual Repricing: silence becomes the moral product, not the message. No tidy moral is asserted; the lingering ambiguity is earned by the stick’s return and the audience’s candle-like epiphanies.</comment>

<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Marcus; perceptual signature—“vast as space itself,” “meteor hush”—is his poetic filter, consistent with a calligrapher’s precision. Syntax lengthens under calm, shortens during intrusion (“This is bullshit,”) mirroring pressure. No head-hopping; the drunk’s interior is only guessed at through Marcus’s watching. Voice modulation is purposeful, the diction controlled without register drift.</comment>

<comment>Prose is clean, no loops or scaffold; “meteor hush” and “peculiar quiet” risk lyric repetition but repay by charging closure. Information density is high—“half-remembered folktales,” “rust belt,” “mismatched furniture”—each doing world and character work. Rhythm accelerates into the drunk’s interruption, then breathes into the suspended ending. One mixed metaphor—“curved embrace of the old radar dome”—is minor; clarity at closure remains intact.</comment>

<comment>Puppet theatre inside a radar-dome bar is fresh, and the stick-as-narrative-passport literalizes oral tradition inside experimental theatre without feeling gimmick. The “reverse a moral” concept is not new, but grounding it in seedy-bar laboratories and a suspended, unresolved tableau transforms the trope. Risk is moderate: refusal to resolve could feel like cop-out, but here it enacts the theme. Specificity of carved symbols and calligraphy ink keeps it from abstract manifesto.</comment>
