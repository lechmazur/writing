<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elena’s interior contradiction—wanting to see whole yet compulsively fragmenting—remains abstract; no embodied micro-choice dramatizes the shift from refusal to acceptance. The final “smile” is earned by image, not by a prior on-page decision that costs her anything concrete. Still, her perceptual drift is consistent and the arc lands credibly under an Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the cracked box stays open, the lighthouse retreats, and the new aesthetic stance carries undeniable conceptual cost (“paint differently now”). Causality is lyric rather than plot-driven, but the pattern is taught early and holds. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no lens ambiguity at end.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The tightening lighthouse walls and rotating beam function as both body-scale constraint and metaphysical mirror; they physically force the card-work and charge the final image. Salt-smell books and gossamer threads are selective, not touristic. Micro-setting (the broken box lid) literally shapes the final gesture of refusal to reseal it.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Single dominant stake—can she see and represent faces truthfully—tightens when walls literally contract, forcing the card rearrangement. The reversal is micro but meaningful: fragmentation stops being failure and becomes method. Cost is felt in the cracked box left open, a permanent loss of containment. Pressure is coherent under Accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: identity as layered, non-simultaneous selves rather than static portrait. The tarot fragmentation reweights from curse to epiphany without moralizing. Final image of “luminous incompleteness” offers resonant non-literal answer. No thematic echo in prompt language.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays tight to Elena’s perceptual filter; beam-as-heartbeat, “gossamer filaments,” and salt-rot idiom are character-specific. No head-hopping; psychic distance compresses credibly under stress. Rhythm modulates from long reflective sentences to staccato “She needed to finish” without losing voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and musical—almost every sentence layers image + motion + metaphor—yet remains clear. One scaffold loop: “fragmentation was truth… fragmentation the only honest way” restates identical claim within four lines; minor. No mixed metaphors or filter-verb stacks. Final paragraph cadence earns its slow sweep.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Fragmented-portrait magic is fresh, but “lighthouse as psyche” and “tarot as memory” are familiar vessels; the synthesis feels inevitable rather than startling. Risk lies in the literal contracting walls—well-executed but not transformative. Specificity of thread-map across ages rescues it from trope-ness.</comment>
