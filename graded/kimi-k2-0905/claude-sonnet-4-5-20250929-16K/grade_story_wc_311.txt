<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s grief is palpably embodied—tracing the atlas, naming monsters with the blade—yet the interior contradiction between duty and loss is stated more than enacted. The micro-choice to speak the sea-monsters’ true names is sharp, but the sudden leap to universal reaper-wisdom (“she understood why reapers existed”) feels unearned, flattening the arc. Daughter remains off-stage voice, so relationship crucible is implied, not pressured. Still, the earned cost is visible: crystallized grief in pocket, voice echoing, path foreclosed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: atlas, recordings, light-crystals layer density until the final naming reframes the emptiness. Orientation anchors within first 120 words; spatial choreography inside dome stays coherent. Closure lands as Charged Poise—Mara leaves with pockets of named fear and the repeated child-voice, reconfiguring her vocation under undeniable cost. No causal break; the telescoping leap to cosmic mission is the only soft linkage, but cost on page saves it.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Observatory as micro-setting constrains every beat: the oxidized dome fractures light necessary for crystal naming, the angled telescope dictates where she stands to catch the ray. Atlas page itself becomes portable setting, perimeter shrinking to knife-tip on kraken. Dusk’s scattered light is not backdrop but required tool—no other locus could supply the prismatic refraction. Final image of crystallized words in pocket is inseparable from this architecture.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—can she resume reaping after unmooring loss—signals early and tightens when naming each monster risks re-inscribing pain. One meaningful deepening: the blade-caught light crystallizes spoken names, making retreat impossible. Cost is legible—physical shards in pocket, audible echo of child-voice—yet escalation is more textural accretion than irreversible fork. Sufficient for length, but second beat of external consequence would have pushed higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from concrete particulars: maps’ blank spaces = unnamable grief; naming monsters = cognitive mastery over sorrow. No final moral—last line is image of transformed love, not message. Subtext in repeated child-voice converts boast (“I’m not afraid”) into requiem without authorial commentary. Minor deduction for Mara’s explicit thesis whisper—“to give names to nameless fears”—which slightly over-articulates what the scene already dramatizes.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person keeps intimate psychic distance, syntax grows clipped under blade pressure—perceptual signature of a reaper who catalogues. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk nil; free indirect cleanly fuses observation (“dust motes danced like small galaxies”) with interior calculation. Patterned repetition of “I’m not afraid” taught early and paid off in altered echo. Diction stays within lexicon of death-cataloguer; no register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>High information density: single sentences fuse sensory atlas, historical wax cylinders, emotional stakes. Metaphors are controlled—kraken=grief—anchored in POV’s cartographic mindset; no mixed vehicles. Rhythm modulates: long breath before naming, staccato during crystallization. Only microscopic scaffold: “again and again until the words became a kind of prayer” could compress, but it occurs mid-scene, not in closure beat, so artifact does not dull final image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Fantasy reaper trope is inverted: not psychopomp but grief-cartographer, mapping the living wound. Wax-cylinder ghosts + astrolabe optics feel fresh synthesis. Risky crystallization mechanic is foreshadowed by dome’s fractured light, paying off in final pocket of shards. Specificity—oxidized copper, sea-monster mouth forever open—grounds concept. Not quite 9 because premise still orbits familiar “immortal learns to feel” arc, albeit through original instrumentation.</comment>
