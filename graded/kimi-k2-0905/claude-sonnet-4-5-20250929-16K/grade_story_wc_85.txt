<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Maren’s guilt is concrete—she returns to the shore, palms splinters—yet the interiority drifts into self-diagnosis (“rewrite her own conscience”) that flattens the peak beat. The micro-choice to confess is present but leans on summary, not a dramatized hinge; the cost is felt yet not embodied in a final gesture.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: because Iris hired the lie, therefore Clara demands the truth, narrowing Maren’s options to confession. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—Maren’s “I’m sorry” and Clara’s imperative “Tell me everything” reweight the premise with visible relational cost. One scaffold paraphrase (“she had been trying to account for the time…”) mildly dulls the beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>“Cobalt terrace at dusk” and driftwood watch hand function as micro-setting: the wind and carved hand pressure the final admission. Color and salt-crust detail are selective, POV-filtered, and return in the closing image, charging the closure. Spatial choreography stays clean across the three-night search.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—truth vs. protective lie—tightens when Clara substitutes the grandfather’s carved hand for Maren’s fabricated lineage; this narrows Maren to confession under the cobalt sky. The cost is legible: Maren’s professional identity as “memory architect” is forfeited in the final line. One escalation beat suffices under causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges without moralizing: manufactured memory collides with self-sculpted penance, reframing “sieved hush” as the ambivalence Iris feared. The driftwood hand reprises as a non-literal answer—redemption and cruelty co-exist—leaving the reader in charged poise rather than a thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-close narration carries a distinct perceptual signature—genealogist metaphors of “bloodlines scrubbed clean,” “census records and creative interpolation”—that stays consistent under pressure. Compression (“terminal diagnosis took her voice forever”) is taught early and paid off in the final demand for speech. No head-hopping; syntax modulates with dusk-light cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, high-density; only minor paraphrase loop on “she had been trying to change” softens the peak. Metaphors remain coherent (salt-smoothed driftwood = time eroded). No filter-verb stacks or template cadence in closure zone.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Fresh angle: black-market genealogist confronted by a client’s DIY artifact of contrition. The watch-hand carve as self-imposed sentence feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Risk taken with lyric ellipsis (three evenings compressed) pays off in resonant final image.</comment>
