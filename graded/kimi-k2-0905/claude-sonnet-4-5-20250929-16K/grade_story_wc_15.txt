<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is concrete—her “strange certainty humming in her chest” after sleepwalking embodies the pull of the labyrinth. Contradictory impulses (obedience to precedent vs. the call to re-enliven) coexist in scene, not summary. The final descent to join the walkers caps a credible arc: her flaw—solitary artistry—yields to communal risk, cost legible in the silent loom above. Only the council confrontation is slightly under-motivated; their capitulation feels swift, blunting the full 9-band.</question>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the empty loom overhead reweights everything with felt opportunity-cost. Accumulative lens holds—each panel, each new walker adds density until the council must re-see the maze. “The labyrinth breathed” crystallizes the before/after without preachiness. No orientation debt; causality never breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The red canyon walls, wooden wharf, and tide-pool timetable are filtered through Mara’s textile gaze—threads, dye, weave—so setting never feels like backdrop. The labyrinth’s carved channels literally constrain footfall and amplify whispers, charging the final communal walk. Micro-setting excels: the copper plate’s glow and the red dust on her nightgown act as handled objects that alter perception. Spatial choreography is flawless; distance from ladder to maze-floor to council overlook stays trackable.</question>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—restore the labyrinth’s living use—tightens when each white stone Mara drops makes her complicity visible to the town, foreclosing anonymity. Escalation is textural: density of walkers, panels, and overlapping paths increases until precedent buckles. No external antagonist needed; social censure and her own dread of profaning provide coherent pressure. Cost is visible: she forfeits her solitary studio sanctity and risks civic punishment.</question>

<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: sacredness is not stasis but communal becoming. The copper plate’s etched procession reprises in the living walkers, letting the final image reconfigure meaning without commentary. “Orchid solace” stays implicit in the fragile red-dust footprints that vanish yet persist. No thematic echo; resonance is built from concrete particulars—threads, stones, whispered prayers.</question>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Lyrical third-person stays close to Mara’s textile sensorium—salt, stone, indigo—creating a distinct perceptual signature. Sentence rhythm mimics weaving: long clauses interlaced with short, taut beats (“She began to sew.”). No dialogue, so voice contamination risk is zero. Filter verbs are scarce; instead we get loom-tight images like “red dust coating her nightgown.”</question>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet breathable: “the greatest weaving happened here below” condenses theme, character, and closure in one line. Figurative choices stay within textile physics—threads, weave, dye—so metaphors cohere. No synonym loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or causality. Opening and final lines function as warp and weft, recharging one another.</question>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The sleepwalking weaver who re-activates a maze via textile cartography is a fresh synthesis of mythic and craft modalities. Risk—breaking sacred precedent—is taken fully, paid off by communal revival. Transformation test passed: swap any detail and the whole unravels. Familiar tropes (forbidden temple, prophet dreamer) are re-threaded through loom logic, making the innovation feel inevitable.</question>
