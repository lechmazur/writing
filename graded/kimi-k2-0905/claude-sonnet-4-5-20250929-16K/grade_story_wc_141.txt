<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Marina’s skeptical-turned-wonder interiority is embodied and consistent; her micro-choice to paint her own blood onto the shell crystallizes the arc. The contradiction between lifelong debunking and surrender to wonder is dramatized in scene, not summary. The cost is felt: her previous professional identity is foreclosed. Voice remains distinct, though a few “gloomy cheerfulness” abstractions edge toward label-speak.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the final image of Marina listening to the unfinished cello reweights the premise with undeniable conceptual cost—she can never again claim myths are merely false. Causal chain holds: each seashell listening session tightens knowledge until the cello transform voices into music. The one soft spot: the sailor/librarian/child triad is reported, not dramatized, so the inciting repetition is slightly telegraphed. Still, cost is on the page in the blood-marked shell.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The collapsed copper dome, wind-tuned cello, and cliff-top acoustics constrain action and supply the literal instrument of revelation. Rust-and-blood ink is tactile and specific. Spatial choreography is clean; telescope mount becomes cello rest without strain. The setting charges the final image: open sky funnels forgotten voices into the broken dome where Marina sits transfixed.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“what if one legend were true?”—tightens across three iterative listenings until the cello forces a public-private renunciation of her life’s work. Agency is continuous: she climbs, listens, speaks, paints. The escalation is accumulative: each hum thickens the acoustic texture and narrows her options. Cost is legible—her professional identity is surrendered—but the external world offers no pushback, so pressure is largely internal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: memory as living vibration rather than relic. The final image answers the riddle (“Where does a voice go…”) without moralizing. Subtext operates through the shell’s shifting compass rose—navigation through what’s left behind. The insight feels earned because it is tied to the concrete act of plucking unfinished strings and hearing her father’s laugh re-instrumentalized.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays pinned to Marina’s perceptual signature: optic shifts of “compass rose that seemed to shift,” auditory narrowing to “resonant hums.” Syntax grows slightly lyric under wonder but never loses clarity. No dialogue, so no convergence risk. Diction remains within her observational lexicon—“bruised twilight,” “acoustic sweet spot”—creating prose-as-character effect.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with scene needs: longer clauses for contemplative listening, staccato fragments when she plucks strings. Metaphors are controlled—“crystallized like frost on glass”—and do not stack. One paraphrase loop: “gloomy cheerfulness” appears twice within four sentences; a minor loop but not at closure. Information density high; each sentence advances image or knowledge. Opening and closing lines are anchored and resonant.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of skeptic-myth-buster, painted shell-compass, and unfinished cello as voice-catcher feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. No prior echo of this exact acoustic ghost instrument. Risk is taken with lyric accumulation rather than external antagonist, and it pays off in conceptual reprice. Specific detail—octopus-ink pigment, rust-and-blood mark—grounds the invention. Transformation test fails: swap names and the concept still works, but the concept itself is sufficiently non-template to satisfy.</comment>
