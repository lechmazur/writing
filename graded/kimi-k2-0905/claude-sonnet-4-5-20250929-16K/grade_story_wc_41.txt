<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Marcus’s “precognitive forgetting” is more label than lived contradiction; the chalk and driftwood choices feel deliberate rather than driven by a visible, conflicting impulse. Sarah’s presence supplies relational pressure, but her interiority is ventriloquized through Marcus’s prophecy, softening the crucible. The final renunciation—hearing the sound yet refusing to trap it—lands as Charged Poise, earned by the motif of listening, not by prior dramatized flaw. Interiority drifts into abstract thesis (“that’s all prophecy is”) at the exact beat where embodied cost should peak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: fog density, chalk marks, and driftwood markers progressively reweight the stake—preserving what slips away—until the final hum reconfigures meaning without killing it. Orientation is secure by line 4; no因果 breaks. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the chalk line Sarah draws is legible cost, crystallizing that some sounds live only in shared listening. Micro-turn at the arch—capture equals kill—tightens the cadence cleanly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Fog, corroded steel, and salt-bleached driftwood are filtered through Marcus’s synesthetic quest; every texture is touched or repositioned, never catalogued. The garden’s spatial logic remains coherent across the driftwood path; distances and sightlines track. Final image: chalk on rust under fog—environment, tool, and body converge to charge the closing moment. No credibility strain; sculpture decay and acoustic properties read true.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—preserving the sound of aging—tightens once: capture equals kill, so renunciation becomes the only costly stance. Agency is sustained attention and refusal; no external antagonist needed. Pressure accumulates through fog thickening and memory thinning; coincidence is absent. Cost is legible: Marcus’s trembling hand and Sarah’s chalk line make the forfeiture concrete.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the tension between preservation and presence; “clinging to echoes” is shown via driftwood markers and the unrecorded hum, never sermonized. Subtext in Sarah’s drawn line—memory shared, not stored—reweights the premise without moralizing. Ambiguity is purposeful: the sound stays un-captured, forcing reader to dwell in the gap. Final image offers conceptual repricing: preservation can mean letting the intangible remain unheard.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tightly lashed to Marcus’s sensory register—braille-touch, tape-hiss metaphor, rust smell. Filter verbs are minimal; perception is rendered as physical action (“touching each rusted surface as if reading braille”). Sarah’s voice is distinctively younger, interrogative, less synesthetic; convergence at the end is intentional shared moment, not voice bleed. Rhythm mirrors fog drift—long sentences breathe, then shorten at the hum’s discovery.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm is varied; sentence openings avoid mechanical patterns. Occasional lofted diction—“gallery-approved concept,” “tidal longing”—edges toward register drift but stays within Marcus’s prophet-poet lexicon. One paraphrase loop: “listening hard enough to hear what’s already been said in the spaces we haven’t reached yet” conceptually restates prior beat. No mixed metaphors; fog and videotape motifs stay coherent.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Premise—searching for the audible frequency of aging—feels fresh and conceptually integral; not a re-skinned memory-loss tale. Driftwood-as-arrow and chalk-as-non-recording invert colonial-capture logic, offering a quiet ethical pivot. Risk in abstract stakes is fully committed to; no retreat into concrete thriller beats. Specificity of fog-sculpture garden and tape-erasure metaphor prevents generic grafting onto another setting.</comment>
