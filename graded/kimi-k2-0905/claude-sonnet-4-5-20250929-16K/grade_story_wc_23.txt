<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s grief-rooted drive and improvisational competence are vivid; the bronze censer foot acts as embodied memory and her micro-choice to “press her forehead against the cold window” crystallizes cost. Interiority stays concrete, but the moment she names her missing daughter feels slightly declarative rather than discovered under fresh pressure, keeping her just shy of the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the patchwork navigation system endures, hydraulics still broken, daughter still gone—cost is the ongoing vigil itself. Causal chain holds: each midnight call → map consultation → censer touch → guidance given; the final image reweights earlier beats without tidy resolution. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) is taught by density of ritual and holds through the last star-pulsed line.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Starlit cliff station, censer foot’s green-black catch of light, and groaning hydraulics create a tactile micro-setting that constrains Mara’s solitude and methods. Sensory selection mirrors emotional paring-down; the censer’s weight and temperature anchor the zero-meridian beat. One clause—“now submerged”—delivers valley history without exposition dump. Environment is inseparable from the navigation logic.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—guiding the scattered home while searching for her own child—tightens via each midnight call; the moon-phase constraint forecloses easy success. No external antagonist is needed; pressure is the cumulative drain of perpetual vigil and the unclosed absence of her daughter. The penultimate paragraph’s count of “forty-seven people” marks visible progress yet underscores personal stasis, a meaningful deepening under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of return-through-ruin emerges from ritual action, not statement; the censer foot transubstantiates from temple refuse to compass of heart. Subtext whispers that every successful return rehearses Mara’s own impossible one. Final image of “stars pulsed their ancient light” offers Conceptual Repricing: cosmic indifference reframed as the only companion left, resonance without moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays welded to Mara’s perceptual filter: “she’d become a patchwork navigator” carries idiom and self-assessment in one breath. Syntax lengthens under star-gaze contemplation then contracts during phone calls, rhythm matching duty-cycle of vigil. No dialogue over-articulates; caller’s whisper and Mara’s clipped replies carry subtext of shared desperation. Voice remains consistent even at peak reflection.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet lyrical: “thin as a fingernail scraping the sky” is precise, not purple. No scaffold loops; each sentence advances atmosphere or tactic. One micro-tautology—“the work of return”—is earned by final placement and prior accumulation. Clause variety and strong verbs keep momentum across reflective passages.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Reverse migration guided by salvaged incense foot and broken lighthouse is a fresh synthesis of post-disaster cartography. Concept grows from character wound rather than clever hook, avoiding gimmick. Risk-taking—quiet refusal of reunion with daughter—pays off as Earned Stasis. Only the phone-call device feels familiar, but its cryptic minimalism is re-inflected by moon-phase interference, keeping score just below 9+ ceiling.</comment>
