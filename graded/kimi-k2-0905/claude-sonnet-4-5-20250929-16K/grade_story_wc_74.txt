<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her insomnia, palette mixing, and trembling steadiness feel lived-in. The contradictions of exhaustion versus disciplined creation are sharp, but the final “threshold state” shift is stated more than dramatized; we are told the brush “rouses” her rather than seeing a micro-choice that costs her something tangible. Still, her value hierarchy (lost alphabets → painted kindnesses) remains coherent and character-specific throughout.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The piece teaches an accumulative/textural lens early: each face is a glyph in a larger sentence of mercy. Closure is a Charged Poise—the canvas “speaks” without expositional summary and the decision to sleep/seek the giver lands with conceptual cost (she now owes the cycle). Orientation is crisp by line 3; the single transition (moon → dawn) is legible. No causal reversals are needed under this lens, but the final cost could be even sharper had the brush exacted a physical toll.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The rooftop greenhouse is sketched with spare, sensory economy: smog-filtered moonlight turns “amber,” tomatoes wither, distance to landlord is implied. The moon-tipped brush functions as micro-setting—its Tangut carving constrains her next stroke and charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible moves. Environment mirrors internal state without overt symbolism, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prove kindness persists—threads every beat; each new face tightens the pattern like a lexical entry. The “rousing” moment deepens rather than reverses, reweighting her fatigue into visionary access; cost is legible (she will seek the anonymous giver, surrendering anonymity herself). Pressure stays coherent under accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves anything. A second tightening beat (e.g., paint shortage) could have pushed higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges inductively: painted faces = living lexicon of mercy. The canvas’s final “sentence” reconfigures meaning without moralizing—no tidy tagline, only the image of seeds carrying lost syllables. Ambiguity is purposeful: we feel the civic scale yet stay inside one woman’s attic. Minor dock for final paragraph’s thematic echo “kindness was its own script,” which flirts with overt thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tightly lensed through Mira’s perceptual signature—smog-yellow moon, cadmium yellow paint, linguistic after-images. Diction is controlled and voice-apt; no filter-verb stacks. Rhythm modulates: longer languid clauses for insomnia haze, shorter beats when brush touches canvas. No dialogue to test, but interior cadence is distinctive and consistent under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Prose carries high information density: one sentence often paints time, pigment, and emotional valence. Figurative layer is selective—“waxing moon above into a pale yellow smudge” compresses weeks of smog into a single perception. No mixed metaphors or synonym loops. Minor scaffold: two “she thought” tags could be cut, but they do not stall momentum or dull closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The endangered-alphabet premise repurposed as urban portraiture feels fresh and non-obvious; the Tangut brush as anonymous catalyst avoids twee magical-object cliché by remaining unexplained. Conceptual risk—kindness as untranslatable grammar—pays off in the final canvas sentence. Specificity of detail (day-old bread, dandelion seeds) grounds the abstraction. Transformation test fails only if relocated to rural setting, confirming originality.</comment>
