<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is concrete and contradiction-rich: ash-black fingers, need to “teach withering to bloom,” simultaneous fear that transformation equals betrayal. Every micro-choice—heating silver, folding second origami—exposes the hierarchy of values and carries visible cost. The final renunciation of her old grief is earned by the causal chain of commissions that force her to practice what she sells. Voice stays individual, never drifts into therapeutic gloss; the flaw (addiction to beautiful stasis) drives the quiet climax.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: Mira on the platform, pendant delivered, telescope dome open—options narrowed, cost felt. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each layer of ash, resin, and paper thickens meaning until the final starlit image reweights prior motifs. One soft spot: the “rock-bottom” paragraph is a 63-word reflective block that slightly stalls momentum; it passes the BRR ceiling but keeps this from 9+. All other beats advance because/therefore.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The observatory’s copper dome, ash-smeared workbench, and star-slit aperture are returned to as micro-setting that literally guides choice (starlight needed for curing, dome opening for perspective). Tool-detail on jeweler’s torch, diamond bur, resin viscosity constrains timing and risks. The final image marries environment and body: pendant held to starlight, Pleiades refracted through ash—setting charges closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can she convert another’s ruin into art without re-breaking herself—tightens when she must embed actual cremains instead of neutral hair. Agency: she could refuse the commission; instead she adapts technique, risking emotional reopening. Cost is legible: ash clouds the resin, reminding her of Vincent’s ashes she once scattered. One beat shy of 8.8+ because the client remains off-stage; the tightening is material, not interpersonal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: grief as renewable material, beauty as honest artifice. Cherry-blossom stencil, origami birds, star-filtered pendant form a returning triad that reconfigures meaning at the end—“death and beauty occupy the same small space.” Subtext in silence: no scene of mother receiving pendant; the emotional aftereffect lands in the reader’s reconstruction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is jeweler-poetic: color values of metal temperatures, haptic precision of resin viscosity, astronomical diction of “Pleiades distorted into new constellations.” Rhythm modulates: longer reflective sentences when memory threatens, clipped parataxis during torch work. No head-hopping; single POV holds. “Subdued ardor” tone is maintained through restrained metaphor and refusal of melodrama.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm is controlled; no template cadence. Figurative language appears ~1 per 4 sentences, avoiding overcrowding. One mixed metaphor—“curtains of intention”—is flagged and self-corrected by the narrative, turning the phrase into diegetic concept. Information density high: one sentence often layers material science, memory, and ethical stakes. No looped scaffolding; paragraph cut test passes.</comment>

<question>8</question><question>8.8</question><comment>Premise—astronomer-less observatory as studio for post-death jewelry—feels fresh yet inevitable. Synthesis of ash, starlight, and origami messaging creates specific cultural logic rather than quirk. Risk: quiet ending without confrontation; payoff is conceptual re-pricing, not twist. Transformation test: swap venue or craft and the emotional calculus collapses—verifies originality.</comment>
