<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is vivid—her fossil-touching ritual and sensory-mapping vocation feel lived-in. The “becoming voice of the unknown” motive, however, is declared more than dramatized; we see no micro-choice that risks or costs her anything on-page. The elm leaf reprise supplies a tactile tether, yet the climactic shift from observer to translator is asserted, not embodied. Still, her perceptual signature is consistent and specific enough to carry the lyric arc.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The piece lands a Conceptual Repricing closure: the final paragraph crystallizes Mira’s new function as ocean-cave translator, reweighting her earlier mapping. Causality is accumulative/lyric rather than plot-turn driven; pressure mounts through density of image and repeated fossil/ floating motifs until the stance shift is legible. Orientation is swift and atmospheric; no anchors remain unclear. The cost is conceptual—she surrenders prior identity—but the absence of an on-page beat where she actively rejects a former option keeps this just shy of 9.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Bioluminescent algae, tide-breathing walls, and the flooded air-pocket shelf are rendered with tactile economy; the cave itself acts as a sensing membrane. The elm fossil micro-setting doubles as tool and talisman, handled in multiple beats and charged in the closing image. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: Mira catalogs taste-air and thermal longing-waves, not cartographic distances. Environment constrains her only route—float/record/speak—so the cave network is agency-shaping, not postcard scenery.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—documenting/feeling the post-human coastline—tightens when she confronts non-human emotional residue; this deepening re-weights her task from archival to translational. No reversal or external antagonist is required under the lyric-accumulative lens. Cost is felt as irreversible immersion: she never leaves the cave, surrenders dry land identity. A sharper on-page moment where she actively abandons return would push this into 8+; as is, the price is legible but oblique.</comment>

<comment>Theme emerges through image pattern—fossil/leaf as prior transformation mirror, floating as suspension between epochs—never sermonized. Subtext is in sensory data: “hope in warm amber streaks” lets reader infer evacuation trauma without exposition. Final reconfiguration—planet speaking through her—re-weights all prior mapping as conversation, not catalog. Ambiguity is purposeful: reader must decide if ocean-consciousness is real or projected, satisfying the “lingering without confusion” test.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric maintains consistent psychic distance and scientific diction that fits a sensory cartographer. Rhythmic control mirrors tidal ebb—long sentences drift, then fragment at revelation (“But that wasn’t her real purpose…”). No dialogue, so voice carries all; perceptual signature is concrete (“caves breathed with the tide”). Filter verbs are minimal and justified. The lyric lift never breaks clarity; compression like “factually mystical” is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and syntactic shape; no template cadence detected. Figurative language is selective—tide-breathing, amber hope—never overwrought. Information density high: single sentences layer time-depth, scientific tool, and emotional register. Minor scaffold: repeated “she would” in closing paragraph creates a soft litany; barely dulls momentum. Opening and closing lines are sharply anchored, ear-tested when read aloud.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The sensory-map maker recording post-human emotional topography is a fresh synthesis of cli-fi, psychogeography, and hauntology. The elm fossil as transitional object grounds abstract premise in palpable archeology. Risky lyric pause—floating in darkness while speaking to sleeping billions—pays off by reconfiguring observer into medium. No close genre or literary echoes; concept commits fully without retreat.</comment>
