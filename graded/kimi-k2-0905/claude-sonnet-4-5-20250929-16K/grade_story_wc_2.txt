<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Ellis’s interiority is concrete and character-specific—her decision to bring the full toolkit, her tactile sifting of ashes, her final smile at the next 3:47 clock all show a tinkerer who thinks with her fingers. The “uncertainly certain” stance is dramatized rather than labeled: she pries the fountain before she knows what’s beneath, a micro-choice that risks her body and tools. Cost is visible—sooty hands, corroded needle, the renunciation of taking only the memory—so the Earned Stasis feels proportionate to length. Minor slip: the admiral’s motives are summarized rather than inferred through Ellis’s body, slightly diluting crucible pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the final image of the compass rose among her tools reweights every prior 3:47 clock from puzzle to witness. Causal chain holds—pattern → coordinates → conservatory → fountain → stairs → shrine; each step is a because/therefore linkage visible on the page. The −0.2 restraint: the admiral’s letter is read once and never re-enters causality, so the price feels partially off-stage. Still, the persistent constraint (clocks will keep arriving at 3:47) is cemented in the last sentence, satisfying the 9+ quick test for cost.</comment>

<comment>Selective sensory economy—"clouded glass panels," "ochre, copper, rust" leaf strata, "cold air rush"—anchors every move without museum tour. The greenhouse’s warped door, dry fountain, and subterranean waterfall each constrain bodily access: she must crawl, pry, descend, get soaked. The compass rose itself becomes micro-setting, its mis-needle charging the final pedestal image. No spatial drift; bodies and props track cleanly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—will Ellis keep trying to solve or learn to witness?—is signaled at “when coincidence becomes pattern.” Escalation is causal: each recovered clock tightens the puzzle until the shrine forces the stance crystallization. The tightening is singular but sufficient for 700 words; options narrow from “fix” to “preserve.” Price is legible (soot, renunciation), yet the off-page admiral absorbs some cost, keeping it just below 8+ band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the recursion of broken timepieces: knowledge as stewardship, not mastery. Subtext lives in gesture—she closes the journal, leaves the clocks—rather than moralizing. The compass rose’s misdirection answers the thematic question without pronouncement. No late echo of “uncertainty” as thesis line, so avoids thematic echo penalty.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Third-limited stays tightly glued to Ellis’s perceptual filter: “her fingers blackening,” “water-music echoed off stone.” Syntax mirrors her methodical mind—short clauses when prying, longer lyrical stretches under the waterfall. No head-hopping; admiral’s voice arrives only via discovered journal, a legitimate prop insertion. Distinctive texture in clockwork diction—“tinkerer,” “chronometer,” “brass compass rose”—without thesaurus drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Strong read-aloud rhythm; sentence variety avoids template cadence. One scaffold trace: “leaves—ochre, copper, rust—carpeted” repeats chromatic triad elsewhere; momentarily decorative but does not stall propulsion. No mixed metaphors or register drift. High information density—each sentence advances place, tool, or interior stance. Final line is crisp, image-driven, no paraphrase loop.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: maritime ghost-story meets horological mysticism, anchored in a conservatory ruin. The 3:47 anomaly is a non-obvious temporal hook; its recurrence feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk—renouncing solution in a puzzle story—pays off by reconfiguring reader expectation. No close echo of familiar source text; transformation passes test.</comment>
