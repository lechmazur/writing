<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid (“furiously tranquil” stance), embodied emotion strong, micro-choices (developing negatives, opening envelope) legible. Motivation consistent but final beat stays observational—no decisive renunciation or visible cost beyond trust, so closure feels contemplative rather than crucible-tested. No second character on page; relationship bullet skipped. Still, contradiction between fury-tranquil drives the scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: she lifts the next print, now armed with state-crime negatives, cost felt via trembling hands. Causal chain holds: censorship → vigil → envelope → new burden. Orientation anchored by word 60; no debt. Lens = Accumulative/Textural; pattern (scar cartography) intensifies to single tightening. Only nit: off-stage documentary voice supplies stakes at the 11th hour, softening full causality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stormlit observatory above cloudbank is specific, atmospheric, constrains action (lightning flash = exposure timing). Copper dome, red-lit darkroom, wire-hung prints give tactile occupation. Weather and altitude guide choices (she waits for lightning’s mask-slip). No orientation issues; spatial choreography clean. Tool-as-setting (darkroom timer) met.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: map scars beyond state reach. Tightening occurs when envelope reveals state-violence negatives—knowledge that reweights danger. Agency: she keeps developing under nascent threat, foreclosing retreat. Cost visible (tremor, implicit peril). Under Accumulative lens, scar-density peaks here; no further twist needed for this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through scar imagery: private bodies vs state erasure. Subtext in sealed envelope, bus timetable (public schedule hiding death) is sharp. Final image reweights premise: her atlas now includes state scars. No moralizing; resonance lingers. “Cartography of scars” refrain could feel thesis-like but stays embedded in action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lyric, controlled free-indirect voice; perceptual signature strong (“storm-kissed wonder”). Syntax flexes with pressure (“tick-tick-tick a heartbeat”). No dialogue; distance stable. Word choice elevated yet aligned with poet POV. No head-hop or register drift. Patterned metaphor (storm/performance) taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varied; sentence shapes breathe with scene. Mixed metaphors rare (“cathedral of storm and light” slightly grand but fits POV). Information density high—each line layers sensation + symbolism. Only minor scaffold: “furiously tranquil” reused thrice; still, it’s thematic refrain, not artifact. No loops or synonym churn.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Fresh fusion: observatory darkroom + censored poet + state-violence negatives. Scar-as-map trope revived via photographic praxis. Risk of conceptual overload skirted by grounding every abstract in tactile detail (developer tray, tongs). Synthesis feels inevitable. Minor deduction for familiar oppressive-state motif, but execution specific enough.</comment>
