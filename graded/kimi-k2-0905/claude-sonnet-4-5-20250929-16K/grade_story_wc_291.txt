<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Vera’s prosopagnosia and portraitist eye create a sharp, contradiction-rich interior that fuels every beat; the final decision to paint the killer’s absence is fully earned. Micro-choices—gloved hand on ribbon, trembling pad—embody her methodical nature under pressure. The lone flaw: “understanding lanced” moment veers toward diagnostic self-label, slightly cooling embodied immediacy.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: Vera’s portrait of negative space reweights the entire case and her own face-blindness with undeniable social cost. Causal chain holds: ribbon discovery → mask-maker insight → empathy gambit. One transition (quarry rim → floor) is cleanly anchored; no orientation debt. Persistent constraint—her permanent face-blindness—shapes the final tactic and image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The quarry’s chisel-scarred walls, mist, and Vera’s boot purchase on ancient marks constrain movement and echo the killer’s precise violence. Micro-setting object—the ribbon—evolves from evidence to emotional lens, charging the final portrait. Sensory hierarchy obeys Vera’s artist eye: texture of stone, color of thread, angle of neck. Final image is inseparable from setting’s negative space.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—awakening empathy in a face-blind artist—tightens when ribbon reopens the sealed case, forcing a tactical shift from observer to portraitist of absence. Escalation is accretive: each quarry step deepens knowledge of killer’s loneliness, narrowing Vera’s options to either paint that void or let the cycle resume. Cost is legible: she forfeits the safety of pure witness and exposes her own blindness to the world.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: the violence of being seen while remaining unseen. Subtext lives in gesture—Vera’s gloved grip on ribbon equals killer’s gloved grip on lance. Final image reframes mask-making as both gift and murder without moralizing. Ambiguity is intact: empathy is offered, not guaranteed, keeping the thematic question alive.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person intimate maintains tight psychic distance; perceptual signature is painterly—negative space, shoulder architecture, syntax of shadow. Rhythm accelerates with sentence fragments under peak pressure: “Understanding lanced through her.” No head-hopping; register stays within Vera’s lexicon. Distinctive diction—“furrowed hush,” “grammar of posture”—creates memorable texture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; every line advances atmosphere or insight. Figurative layering is disciplined—metaphors of topology, grammar, architecture stay coherent. One paraphrase loop: “unified opposites” appears twice in adjacent sentences; minor. No scaffold; opening and final lines anchor voice and re-charge motif.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: prosopagnosic portraitist + cold-case quarry + mask-maker killer yields inevitable yet non-obvious closure. Trope of face-blind detective is inverted—she paints the killer’s absence, not identity. Risky lyric accumulation paid off by final Conceptual Repricing. Specificity of ribbon threading pattern and workshop fire roots premise in lived detail.</comment>
