<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Marlena’s shift from detached broker to advocate is sketched via one reflective beat and a single micro-choice (“I want to initiate something”), credible for 800 words; Theo functions more as thematic mirror than crucible, so relationship pressure is thin. Interiority is concrete (“shame warming her cheeks”), but the contradictory impulses that would push her from complicity to action are told rather than dramatized in-scene. The final renunciation of her prior invisibility carries visible social cost—she will now spend capital and time—so the change is earned, if compressed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: mis-delivered letter → terrace meeting → shared recognition → joint commitment; each beat tightens options under the Causal lens. Orientation is clean within 120 words; the rooftop garden anchors who/where/when. Closure lands as Decisive Change with felt cost—she pockets the locket and walks into a new, unpaid workload—so the ending satisfies the required RR/DC test. One minor elasticity: the postal coincidence is pure luck, but it complicates rather than resolves, so no penalty.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The terrace is sketched with selective sensory cues—“soft lights illuminating spines while leaving the stars brilliant”—that mirror Marlena’s widening attention. The locket photo serves as micro-setting/object and is handled twice, constraining her gaze and later charging the final image. Maritime details (dockworkers’ faces, freight rates) are filtered through her professional eye, keeping exposition lean. Environment does not actively constrain physical choices, so the 9+ gate is missed, but specificity is solid.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recognition for invisible labor—is signaled early and escalates once: from private guilt to public commitment. The tightening beat is her on-page proposal to Theo, which forecloses her former neutrality and risks reputation and resources. Cost is legible: she leaves the safety of anonymity to champion night crews. No secondary reversal is needed at this length; pressure coheres under the Causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the locket image and Theo’s father anecdote rather than authorial thesis. The final image—two strangers walking into unpaid advocacy—reweights the premise: compassion is not charity but unpaid labor they now owe. Subtext in dialogue (“It’s hard to see what’s always there”) carries double edge about class blindness. No moralizing sentence closes the piece, so resonance lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Third-limited stays tightly pinned to Marlena’s perceptual filter; no head-hops. Syntax is controlled, with slight lift during starlit awe that matches her cautious exuberance. Dialogue is minimal but carries indirection: Theo’s “Beautiful stars tonight” masks his surprise at meeting the letter-holder. Voice remains distinct from Theo’s quieter cadence, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; figurative language is sparse and purposeful. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors appear. Occasional elevated diction (“the rhythm of hands and hearts”) is earned by the lyrical close and stays within Marlena’s reflective register. Opening and final lines anchor and recharge the musical metaphor without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Premise turns on a fresh synthesis: misdelivered fan-mail sparks class-awareness in a broker who profits from the unseen. The locket-as-talisman repurposes a sentimental object into a social contract. Risk is modest—linear realism, no structural experimentation—but specificity of port labor detail prevents swap-out. Emotional truth outweighs surface novelty.</comment>
