<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The penny-poet’s molting identity is dramatized in the first paragraph (name-switch, “Iris in March”) and paid off when he decides “maybe I’ll stay Solomon” while cradling seedlings inside the ruined library; the interior contradiction between flight and rootedness is embodied, not labeled. Marcus’s parole-scarred hands and quiet “blooming resistance” line give him equal weight as crucible, forcing the renunciation of shape-shifting. The letters mulched into soil literalize the cost of abandoning the past, making the choice irreversible and scaled to the piece’s lyric arc. Only micro-slip: “molts personalities monthly like a snake” is a stock simile amid otherwise fresh perception.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>A single accumulative/Textural lens is taught by the seed-and-rust imagery and held to the final line; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the sign “Write What You Must” crystallizes the new communal rule-set with undeniable conceptual cost. Orientation anchors (who/when/where) are fixed within 60 words and never slip. The false-bottom tin and mulched letters provide persistent constraints that shape tactics—Solomon can only choose rootedness once the secret compartment is emptied. No causality break; every beat is a because/therefore of planting or gifting.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The rusted library’s skeleton and starlit planting are rendered through tactile, POV-filtered detail—vines “claiming the corners like patient invaders,” soil “spilling from drawers that once held order.” The micro-setting of the tin and the planter-drawers constrains later choices, qualifying for 9+ gate. Spatial choreography is seamless across the night’s shared water, shelf-stacking, and seed placement. Only a trace of cataloging excess in “poetry beside gardening manuals, manifestos beside children’s tales” keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether the poet will keep fleeing or root himself—tightens once: the moment he empties the letters into soil forecloses escape, price paid on-page. Escalation is accumulative: each seed planted and book shelved increases density until renunciation is the only option left. No coincidence; the library’s transformation is entirely agency-driven. Persistent constraint (tin emptied) shapes the final image under the selected lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete recurrence: paper (books, letters, poems) turned to compost reweights “beauty from anarchy” into literal growth. The final sign’s imperative “Write What You Must” offers a non-literal answer—authorship now means cultivation, not escape. No final-paragraph moralizing; the image of strangers trading basil for Neruda carries the conceptual repricing. Complexity lingers: the poet’s instability is neither cured nor romanticized, merely repurposed.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Third-person lyric stays tight to Solomon’s idiosyncratic perception—cracked lips, penny-tin weight, seedling aroma—without head-hop. Syntax mirrors molting: shifting metaphors yet cohesive diction. Marcus’s dialogue (“You don’t molt because you’re unstable…”) carries subtext of parole-scarred authority, distinct from Solomon’s internal poetry. Filter verbs are minimal; perceptual signature is consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm modulates from long breathless sentences under starlight to the final short imperative sign. No scaffold loops; each sentence advances image or action. Figurative language is sparse and precise—“diamond-sharp stars,” “green insurrection against gray order”—never muddled. Opening and closing lines anchor and recharge the seed/book hybrid motif with echoic precision.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The library-as-garden is a fresh synthesis of post-apocalyptic and bibliophile tropes; the transformation of card-catalog drawers into planters feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk in verb-tense compression (“Tonight…they work through the night”) is taught early and pays off in dreamlike continuity. The premise could not survive swap to generic warehouse—book-soil specificity is essential. Minor deduction for familiar “gardens through concrete” anarchist poetry reference.</comment>
