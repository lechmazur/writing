<comment>Celeste’s contradictory drives—applause hunger vs. post-death acceptance—are dramatized in her choice to sing, risking eternal exposure for one last performance. The embodied synesthetic flare (“silver hummed with hope”) shows her perception under pressure and justifies why the coin’s touch catalyzes action. Her interiority stays ghost-specific (translucent palm, drifting) without的诊断标签. Her final renunciation—accepting an encore of changed life rather than ovation—carries visible cost as she cools into orchard solitude.</comment>

<comment>The closure lands as Charged Poise: the orchard crystallizes braided timelines, Celeste’s song forecloses her own curtain call, and the Star coin’s final face makes the conceptual cost legible—“perhaps this time her performance had changed a life.” Causal linkage holds: tarot coin touch → synesthetic vision → decision to sing → echo reaches tomorrow’s boy → future sketchbook discovery. The fractured-timeline rule is taught early and paid off when blossoms from three decades bloom simultaneously at the end.</comment>

<comment>Environment (silver-fruit orchard) constrains tactics: time-folding branches let Celeste literally pick and graft futures onto the boy’s path. Spatial choreography is clean—antique shop → hidden door → hedge maze → orchard—each threshold tightens access and stakes. Selective sensory layering (apple/rot on same branch) mirrors her ambivalence. Tool-as-setting (tarot coin) alters her acoustic reach; orchard responds with windless sway, proving micro-setting qualifies.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—will the boy choose life?—is signaled at minute-17 threshold watch. Escalation arrives mid-text when Celeste decides to sing, narrowing her forever-circumspect ghost existence into audible exposure. Cost is felt: every echo she releases frays her own temporal anchorage (“she’d done what she could—accepting orchard solitude as price”). Agency remains hers; coincidence only complicates (future blossoms already present).</comment>

<comment>Theme emerges from performance-as-salvation: applause transmutes into life-gift without moralizing. Nostalgia is earned through specific particulars—1927 fire, moth-eaten costumes—rather than abstract loss. Final image (simultaneous blossoms) offers non-literal answer: art’s echoes can graft futures. Subtext operates in silence—no dialogue, only gestures of swaying trees and cooling coin.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Distinct perceptual signature: synesthetic tasting of time (“taste of longing”) and color-sound synesthesia remain consistent, never drifting into clinical labels. Rhythm swells with song cadence, then softens into orchard hush; punctuation clean. POV modesty honored—ghost cannot know boy’s interior, only futures’ flavor. No head-hopping; lyric compression (“echoes didn’t just repeat—they revealed”) teaches pattern early.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud ear test passes: sentence length modulates from urgent anaphora (“She sang…”) to lingering orchard sentence. High density: single sentence often advances plot, image, theme (“apple trees heavy with silver fruit twisted toward a perpetually twilit sky”). Zero paraphrase loops; no mixed metaphors. Final line packs punch without over-flourish.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: ghost actress + synesthesia + folded orchard time is non-obvious yet internally coherent. Trope of ghostly unfinished business is reweighted into life-graft for stranger, not self-resolution. Specific 1927 theatre fire anchors uniqueness. Risky lyric structure pays off with resonant closure image. Removing any core element would collapse the causal braid.</comment>
