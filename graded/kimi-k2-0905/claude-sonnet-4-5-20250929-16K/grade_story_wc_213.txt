<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Mira’s “humility” is shown through caretaker gestures and quiet defiance, not labels; her shift from obedient tester to autonomous listener is embodied in the rope-pulling beat. Interior contradiction is thin—no moment where she simultaneously trusts and doubts the sirens—so the arc feels slightly smoothed rather than torn. The final renunciation costs her institutional cover, yet the price is implied, not felt on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the bell-rope becomes a new warning system and Mira’s public stance crystallizes with undeniable social cost—she can never return to mere “testing.” Causal chain is clean: glued rope → vibration discovery → inversion sensing → silent toll → sanctuary saved. Lens is causal throughout; every beat is a because/therefore linkage that narrows options until the final foreclosed path.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The airborne cathedral is sketched with swift, sensory strokes—perpetual cloud, open arches, stone transmitting tremors—each detail later weaponized by the rope. Micro-setting (rope → bell mount → tower bones) literally channels the storm and dictates the climax, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography is flawless; no anchor drift past 120 words.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“will the sanctuary survive zero hour?”—is signaled on first page and tightens when Mira discovers the inversion is <1 hour away. One meaningful turn: she abandons the siren switch for the rope, trading institutional authority for embodied knowledge; the price is immediate (she becomes the warning, no anonymity). Cost is visible—her voice, her body, her future status—but could be sharper if we sensed exile or punishment looming.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: institutional noise vs. tactile attention. The bell-rope’s return as warning device reweights “listening” from passive duty to active power. Final image—her hand on the rope, wind spent—offers a charged poise that answers the thematic question non-literally. No moralizing, only resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Mira’s sensorium; perceptual signature is weather-reader precise—temperature shifts, pressure on palm fibers, vibration frequency. Syntax stays spare, scientific, then grows incantatory during rope-tolling; no filter-verb clusters. Diction never exceeds her lexicon; “pressure inversion,” “buttresses,” “hemp fibers” read as lived technical terms.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, information-dense; each paragraph advances stakes or atmosphere. Metaphors are sparse and apt—“vast antenna tuned to the atmosphere”—no mixed vehicles. Zero loops, zero scaffold, zero register drift. Opening and closing lines anchor and echo without ornamental filler.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Premise—sky-cathedral as barometer—feels fresh yet inevitable; the rope-as-instrument twist is a delightful, earned reconfiguration of obsolete tech. Risk taken: quiet victory replaces spectacle, yet pressure never drops. If the storm had been anthropomorphized or the priest had punished Mira, originality would spike higher; as is, a hair beneath 9.</comment>
