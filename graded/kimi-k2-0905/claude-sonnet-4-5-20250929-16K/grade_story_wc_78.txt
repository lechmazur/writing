<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Kael’s prophet identity, tactile obsession with resonance, and embodied exhaustion feel lived-in; the apple bite at the end crystallizes her earned cost. Interiority stays concrete—no label-speak—and her micro-choices (“Mercy,” “Hold,” etc.) reveal a value hierarchy under pressure. The only minor gap: we get no contradictory impulse in-scene; she’s all-in, so the arc is steady rather than knotted. Still, the endurance itself is credibly costly and specific to her.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: fractal cloud pattern → resonance mapping → orchard survival. Orientation lands by line 4; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—orchard alive but Kael drained, salt-apple taste paying the cost. No teleporting props or plot amnesia; every strike of the mallet tightens options. The recursive rule-set is taught early and paid off in the final image of dawn clouds returned to “simple, peaceful shapes.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The floating orchard is not backdrop but instrument: driftwood, ropes, and root-systems constrain every tactical strike. Micro-setting (xylophone mallet, apple skin tasted) charges the final image. Spatial choreography is flawless—Kael moves counterclockwise, waves lift the structure, no impossible positions. Weather and tide evolve causally with her sonic intervention, reweighting stakes in real time.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—orchard survival—signaled in paragraph 1 and tightened when fractal clouds portend “destroy or transform.” One meaningful escalation: Kael shifts from reading tides to authoring a counter-fractal song that harmonizes with the wave architecture. Cost is visible—three hours of physical playing, collapse, salt-apple taste—foreclosing rest and certainty. Agency remains causal under the lens; coincidence complicates but does not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges obliquely: translation of threat into music, survival through pattern-matching rather than domination. No explicit thesis; the salt-apple moment reweights “victory” as exhaustion plus continuity. Subtext lives in gesture—naming ropes “Mercy,” “Hold”—and in the sky’s listening silence. The idea resists moralizing; ambiguity lingers about what next tide might demand.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is distinct: recursive imagery mirrors root, rope, neural firing; diction stays within a sea-versed prophet’s lexicon. Rhythm accelerates with strike-lists, then exhales into “simple, peaceful shapes,” mirroring pulse and tide. No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens from contemplative to synesthetic under stress. Filter verbs are minimal and voice-motivated when used.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High information density—each sentence advances stakes, sound, or body. Figurative language is patterned and paid off (fractal recursion) rather than decorative overload. One mixed metaphor—“apple trees clinging to their floating prison”—but it occurs early and accrues character. Minor scaffold: “then she…” cadence appears twice in mid-section; does not touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Premise—floating orchard tuned like a marimba—feels inevitable yet unseen before. Fractal acoustics as survival mechanics fuses science, myth, and music without gimmickry. Risky second-person cloud “listening” pays off when sky visibly responds. Transformation test fails if you swap orchard for any farm; the salt-roots and rope-frets are irreplaceably built into every beat.</comment>
