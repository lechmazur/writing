<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Marcus’s interior contradiction—needing facts yet craving narrative redemption—drives every beat; the micro-choice to tack the cloth above his certificates crystallizes the arc with visible cost. The woman’s tremor under “My father never lied” pressures him, but her off-page exit leaves the relationship crucible half-forged, capping the score below 8.8.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Marcus accepts uncertain expertise and re-starts work; the quarry-echo image pays off the disorientation taught in paragraph one. Causal chain holds—fake Strat → humiliation → cloth test → smaller truth offered → re-commitment—though the woman’s departure is slightly under-motivated, a hairline slip keeping it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The trailer’s limestone dust, magnifying lamp, and quarry hollow constrain Marcus’s options and echo his emptied career; the cloth’s weave and smell act as micro-setting that charges the final wall-tacking. Sensory hierarchy is filtered through ex-roadie expertise, never touristic. Spatial choreography is clean; the quarry’s abandoned scale mirrors his interior without overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recover professional identity after public shame—tightens when the cloth’s mid-70s truth forecloses the Woodstock myth, forcing Marcus to decide whether to offer a smaller truth or hide again. The reversal is single but meaningful; cost is legible in his resumed seat at the desk amid quarry silence. No escalation loop; coincidence is absent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges: meaning is forged, not found, in the act of continuing to interpret fragments. The cloth’s migration from evidence to wall icon reweights “after the applause” from loss to quiet vocation. No moralizing; the quarry’s echo answers the question wordlessly. Ambiguity lingers—he may fail again—preserving complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Marcus’s perceptual signature—fiber counts, amp brands, quarry acoustics. Syntax lengthens under emotional load, then fractures into short declaratives at the stasis moment. No head-hopping; the woman’s interior is read only through her tremor, maintaining distance control. Distinctive without self-conscious flourish.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, information-dense; figurative language is sparse and precise (“sound traveled strange”). No loops, scaffold, or register drift. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line recharges echo motif. One near-redundant clause—“trying to wrest meaning from fibers and facts”—is trimmed by context, a hairline slip.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The ex-roadie appraiser premise freshens the common “expert undone by error” arc; vintage-gear minutiae and quarry hollowness feel specific, not borrowed. Risk is taken in quiet stasis rather than triumphant comeback, yet coherence holds. Could swap names, but cloth-as-icon and echo-valley image are inseparable from this telling, satisfying transformation test.</comment>
