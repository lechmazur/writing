<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Interiority is rich and embodied—rage burning while hands stay steady, fingers numb yet precise. The refusal to borrow time crystallizes a hierarchy of values: lineage over expedience, earned over stolen growth. No second character appears, so relationship crucible is waived; the “crucible” is her own paradoxical calm. Cost is visible: she accepts a harder path, leaving frost-prints that starlight will erase—an earned stasis that forecloses the vortex shortcut.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the vortex closes, entropy stays un-reversed, and the single seed becomes the new metric of time—earned, not borrowed. Causality holds: every beat flows from the theft → vortex offer → renunciation. Orientation is anchored by line 3 (icebound atrium, starlit dome). The “texture of borrowed time” refrain pays off in the tactile ice-grain under her palms—cost is felt in that image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The ice-pillar fountain and shattered glass dome are not postcard scenery; they pressure choice—ice must melt by will, not heat, and the dome’s缺席 starlight refracts the vortex. The acorn cap micro-setting literally seeds the final image. Spatial choreography is clean: kneel → pry → place → footprints toward door. One slip: “tables laden with jars” flashback is cinematic, not tactile, but brief enough to avoid cap.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—guardianship of genetic possibility—tightens when every jar is stolen except the acorn cap. Escalation is textural: empty tables → fractal light → vortex yawning → renunciation. No external antagonist; pressure is the temptation to reverse theft via time-debt. Cost is legible: she accepts slower, mortal renewal rather than entropy-cheat—options narrow to the one seed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges: time is not currency to borrow but soil to tend. The oak-to-be reframes “texture” from metaphor to literal root-system. No moralizing; the final footprint in silver frost is the wordless thesis. One near-preach moment—“entropy deferred but not defeated”—survives because it’s internal physics, not authorial sermon.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person intimate stays locked to her sensory filter: breath-crystals, starlight bent “impossible colors,” ice grain felt as “coarse here, smooth there.” Rhythm modulates: long liquid sentences for vortex memory, staccato when she pockets the cap. No dialogue, so voice carries all subtext. “Furiously tranquil” is not label-speak; it’s enacted contradiction in every motion.</comment>

<comment>Prose is dense yet lucid: “fractals of light spread across the frozen fountain” does three jobs—visual, causal, metaphoric. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances. One mixed metaphor—“narrow as a needle’s eye and just as sharp”—but it’s brief and taught early, so tolerable. Filter verbs are minimal; perception stays embodied.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Seed-saving meets time-vortex is fresh, but deeper freshness lies in equifying entropy-decrease with moral debt—physics as ethics. The single-seed solution subverts expected heist-reversal, making renunciation the triumph. Risk taken: lyric temporal texture over action plot; payoff is the silver footprint that reweights all prior abstraction. Could not swap seed for any other MacGuffin—its biology anchors the theme.</comment>
