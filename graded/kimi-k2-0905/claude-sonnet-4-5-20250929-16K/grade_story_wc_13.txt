<comment>Mira’s illustrator-scientist lens is vivid and continuous—she “sketched a nest of wind-sparrows,” “documented in her journals,” and her perceptual hierarchy (visual, taxonomic, temporal) drives every micro-choice. The internal contradiction—chronicling vs. stealing time—remains embodied in the warming/cooling pendant and the visible drain of borrowed seconds, giving the final release a felt cost. No secondary character appears, so relationship bullets are waived; the single-POV interiority is consistent, specific, and pressured. The only bar to 9+ is that the climactic “uncage” sequence is slightly rushed, so the visible bodily toll (tremor, fatigue) is only implied, not shown.</comment>

<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of sensory echoes accumulating density until the final cadence is restored. Orientation anchors (who/when/where) are in by line 3; rooftop canal, giant’s nap, and temporal theft are taught early and payoff at closure. Closure is a Charged Poise: the echo of her oar arrives before the stroke, reweighting the whole premise with undeniable conceptual cost—time debt paid in sound. Persistent constraint (pendant’s dwindling charge) shapes every tactical choice, satisfying the 9+ cost test.</comment>

<comment>The rooftop canal system is not backdrop; its liquid tilt and gravity slack directly enable the gondola approach and temporal bubble mechanics. Micro-setting (the Throat’s leaning towers, iron cages swinging without wind) constrains the final uncaging choreography and charges the echoed oar-stroke image. Sensory selection stays painterly-scientific—visual precision, acoustic anomalies—filtered through Mira’s vocation. One hairline slip: “water froze mid-ripple” is seen from outside the bubble, a micro POV flicker that keeps this just under 9.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—recover the birth-moment of echoes—is signaled in paragraph 3 and tightens when each cage opened releases a sound that retroactively completes its own cadence, deepening rather than widening stakes. Agency is continuous: every theft of seconds visibly drains the pendant, altering tactics (accelerated bubble, lock-aging touch). Cost is on-page: “the borrowed time she carried flowed out freely” and the pendant ends “cool and quiet,” a tangible forfeiture. Meets the 8.8+ gate: visible price that charges the final image under the accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as the ethics of documentation vs. liberation—Mira’s scientific impulse to capture turns into an act of release, reweighting the infinity pendant from power-source to empty conduit. No explicit moral is stated; the final echo arriving early offers a non-literal answer that sound needs temporal theft to become whole. Subtext lives in gesture: the pendant’s temperature shift replaces interior monologue about guilt. The concept that echoes are “born from completion” is a fresh thematic reframing that lingers without sermonizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Distinct perceptual signature: natural-history illustrator’s diction—“anatomical studies of impossible creatures,” “crystalline moss”—remains consistent and specific. Rhythm modulates with pressure: longer sensory clauses in calm canal glide, staccato fragments during cage-opening sprint—“She moved faster, uncaging sound after sound.” No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens from observational to embodied under stress. Minor 0.1 dock for one template cadence (“She… She…” in paragraph 9), not enough to breach 9.0.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>High density: single sentences layer job, world, and stake—“Her infinity symbol pendant hung cold against her chest, its weight reminding her of the bargain she’d made.” No paraphrase loops, no mixed metaphors; figurative language is sparse, precise, and motif-consistent (echoes, cadence, time as honey/wire). Opening and closing lines are texturally linked through the anticipatory echo. One filter-verb cluster (“She heard… She heard…”) is voice-motivated and paid off, so no artifact penalty applies.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of natural-history illustration, Venetian rooftop canals, and echo-genesis as temporal incarceration is fresh and non-obvious. The insight that echoes require stolen time to complete themselves reweights familiar fantasy tropes into conceptual science-fantasy. Specificity anchors risk: “storm beetles, crystalline moss, spiral-finned fish” could not swap into another story without collapse. The gamble of a quiet, lyric ending paid off—the early-before-late echo feels inevitable in hindsight, earning the +0.3 risk bonus.</comment>
