<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Maren’s skepticism and medical vocation collide productively with the changeling request; her “show me” is an active, profession-rooted micro-choice that alters tactics and forecloses lifelong certainty. Interiority stays embodied and specific—her certainty “cracking open like an egg,” teeth aching at harmonics—avoiding abstract labels. The final renunciation of certainty carries visible cost: she walks out carrying “a healing she’d learned to perform on reality itself,” a concrete, profession-metaphor burden that locks her into new agency. One slip: the line “universe was stranger and more merciful” drifts toward platitude; tighter diction here would lift the score into the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the bone constellation becomes a literal gateway, cost paid by Maren’s permanent loss of empirical footing and the changeling’s bodily token. Causal chain holds: substitute body → garden invitation → constellation construction → mutual return, each because/therefore step tight. Lens stays causal throughout; no ambiguity at end. Cost is visible in final image: Maren’s new certainty = the map she carries out, a lived tool that will reshape every future diagnosis. Minor time dilation (an afternoon’s work rewrites cosmic displacement) is allowed in fabulist mode and serves the mythic cadence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Garden, bones, and tooth function as micro-settings that directly constrain tactics: crystalline flowers map alien stars, bones must be arranged symmetrically for gate function, the tooth anchors the exit. Spatial choreography is flawless—kneeling beside Thomas, hand placements, final step into light—all tracked without drift. Selective sensory economy favors the doctor’s touch and sight, reflecting both clinical habit and wonder. Hedge maze and secret garden are named, but the garden’s interior is the active crucible; its twilight-at-noon rule is obeyed consistently. Environment, tool, and recurring object all charge the final image, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“can displaced children go home?”—is signaled early by Thomas and tightens through each bone placement, culminating in a narrowing two-way exchange. Agency is shared: Maren’s medical reordering + Thomas’s memory objects; together they foreclose the option of leaving the mistake intact. Visible price: the changeling forfeits his tooth, Maren forfeits lifelong epistemic safety; both costs are on-page at the beat of crossing. One meaningful escalation is sufficient at this length; no reversal is required, only the deepening recognition that constellation = portal, which reweights stakes from rescue to cosmic realignment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: healing is not restoration of original order but acceptance of irreversible strangeness—bone-setting expanded to ontological level. Subtext operates in gesture (Thomas casually plucks his own tooth) and image (opalescent baby tooth as passport). Final image of garden blooming “nostalgic innovation” is a Conceptual Repricing that reweights the whole premise: innovation now includes looking backward to lost, cherished places. Ambiguity is purposeful: we never see the other world, only the cost of passage, inviting reflection on every displacement we medicalize or mythologize. No moral is declared; resonance is built from particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-limited stays locked to Maren’s medically biased perception: she catalogues harmonics by dental ache, maps stars as bone patterns, reads reality like an X-ray. Syntax grows slightly incantatory under pressure (“Constellations,” “wrong gate, wrong world”) but remains within a diagnostician’s need to name. No head-hopping; Thomas’s interior is accessed only through Maren’s embodied inference. Distinct perceptual signature—bones as text, certainty as bone—carries through to final charged poise. Dialogue is sparse, but Thomas’s diction (“yearned for you to come”) carries antique cadence that differentiates him without cartoon fairy-speak.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet breathable: one sentence often layers job, sensation, and metaphor (“Her skepticism cracking open like an egg”). No scaffold or synonym loops; paraphrase absent. Metaphors stay coherent—bones, gates, maps, healing—no mixed vehicles. Rhythm modulates: longer clauses for wonder, staccato for clinical check. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line offers image-based resolution. Only micro-flaw: “universe was stranger and more merciful” dips toward abstraction; a sharper concrete image here would nudge toward 9.0.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Fusion of rural doctor realism with changeling cosmology feels inevitable and fresh: bone-setting as portal technology is a non-obvious synthesis that grows from character profession. Specificity abounds—opalescent baby tooth, crystalline flowers mapping alien constellations—details that could not swap into another tale without collapse. Risk-taking (cosmic gate built of bones in a single afternoon) is justified by fabulist contract taught early. Transformation test: story fails if Maren is not a bone-setter. No close echoes of famous scenes; avoids Celtic-changeling clichés by centering medical epistemology. Conceptual integrity full: premise pursued to logical, painful cost.</comment>
