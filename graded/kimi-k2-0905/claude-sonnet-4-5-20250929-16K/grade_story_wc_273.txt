<comment>Kael’s interiority is concrete and particular—her “calm fury,” “consciously wild grace,” and predator metaphors create a consistent perceptual signature. The brother flashback is embedded early and directly shapes her present micro-choice to study the ink, satisfying BRR. The final renunciation—she will wait for the next eclipse and risk disappearance—carries visible cost (“she would disappear too, eventually”) and is foreshadowed by her prior tracking obsession. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene, keeping her just shy of the 9+ gate.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the ink’s disappearance reweights the rule-set—time-fracture travel is real and she will follow. The cost is unmistakable in the final line: “she would disappear too, eventually.” Orientation is clean by line 10; the inferred lens is Causal—because the target stepped into ink patterns, therefore Kael will replicate the method. No causality breaks; drone footage and evaporative mandalas tighten options in the final third.</comment>

<comment>Wind-carved sandstone cliffs and prismatic drone wings are filtered through Kael’s predator-biased eye, anchoring who-where-when within 50 words. The alcove’s pale rock becomes a micro-setting that constrains the ink reveal and charges the final image. Sensory hierarchy obeys her eclipse-scorched skin and light-sensitive pink eyes. Environment guides choice: only the wind-sculpted crevice offers the sheltered surface where ink can pool and vanish.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—prove the reality of time-slippage and follow the target—signaled in paragraph 4. One meaningful tightening: drone footage shows the target dissolving into the ink spirals, forcing Kael’s decision to replicate the method. Cost is legible: she accepts eventual self-disappearance. Under Causal lens, the eclipse-crisis linkage escalates options rather than danger, a fresh inversion that still narrows her path to one possible future.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: grief-driven obsession with “stretched seconds” becomes a gateway to literal time travel. Disappearing ink reweights from alchemist’s gimmick to existential key—conceptual repricing at closure. No overt thesis statements; the final image of wind carving stone parallels her patient erosion of reality’s boundary. Subtext in drone footage and evaporative mandalas implies technology and ritual can co-author transcendence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person POV remains tight to Kael’s perceptual signature—“colorless skin,” “pink eyes,” “predator who had chosen not to be domesticated.” Syntax grows clipped under pressure: “She understood now.” No filter-verb clusters; metaphors stay within her tracker lexicon. Drone and ink are handled through bodily interaction—palm, wrist, knees—keeping psychic distance controlled. Voice modulation from reflective to hunted is intentional and coherent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings avoid templates. High information density: “Ink. / But not ordinary ink.”—two jobs in four words. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or causality. Figurative language is sparse,Pattern of prismatic flashes / wind-carved pillars” stays physically accurate. Opening and closing lines anchor and recharge the motif of patient erosion with poetic precision.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of grief-physics—time-dilation in trauma becomes literal eclipse-powered travel—feels inevitable yet fresh. Disappearing ink as portal key is a specific, non-obvious twist on “message that self-erases.” Tracker protagonist who chooses feral cognition over tech comfort adds occupational specificity. Risk: positing time-slippage as navigable space, but groundwork in brother flashback and drone footage earns the leap.</comment>
