<comment>The alchemist’s grief is palpable and embodied; her micro-choices (kneeling, arranging refuse with “deliberate slowness”) externalize patience and loss. Interiority stays concrete—starlight as liquid silver, pulse as geography—avoiding diagnostic speak. The final beat of memorizing the vanished map earns a credible renunciation, though the child remains more mythic than lived; this flattens contradiction and caps emotional complexity just below the 9-band.</comment>

<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: the story teaches its pattern early (frozen world → thaw) and lands a Charged Poise closure—the flash-burn that re-weights the map into memory. Causality is interior but coherent: because time stops, she can finish; because the map burns, the world restarts and her path is chosen. Cost is felt in the ash she must now carry in her mind. Minor waver: “heartbeat-matched pulsar” arrives as late rule, but it is paid off in the same breath and does not break closure.</comment>

<comment>The crater orchard is rendered through tactile refuse—rusted lids, shattered mason jars—each item later charged by starlight and pulse. Spatial choreography is clean: kneeling center → radial placement → upward constellation. Cold halts time, making the environment an active constraint; the same cold is re-inscribed as cosmic distance in the final image. One slip: “subarctic crater” is dropped once and never used to pressure tactics, keeping it just under the 9-gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—reach the dead daughter’s heartbeat-route—anchors early and tightens once: the map’s completion forecloses her old life the instant the paper ignites. Pressure accumulates via density: each piece of trash equals one pulse, starlight pools, options narrow to “memorize or lose forever.” Cost is visible—the ash, the returning cold—though the cosmic-pulsar beat feels like a lucky revelation rather than earned reversal. Sufficient for 8-band, not the persistent constraint needed for 8.8+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as “grief is a cartography that burns yet remains.” The motif of discarded orchard trash transmuted into stellar coordinates reframes loss as trajectory, not burial. Final image reweights the opening freeze: the world resumes, but she now moves along an internal sky-map. Avoids explicit moral; only tiny echo of “heartbeat-maps” in last paragraph keeps it shy of 9.0.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays close to sensorium—“breath crystallizing,” “starlight pooled like liquid silver”—creating a distinct alchemist voice whose perception is filtered through metallurgy and mother-love. Syntax lengthens under reverence, then snaps short at ignition. No dialogue, so voice cohesion is high. Filter verbs are few and motivated; only minor template echo (“with deliberate slowness… with careful precision”) prevents 9.0.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet aerated: each sentence layers job—image, motion, temperature, memory—without scaffold. Metaphors stay physically coherent (starlight as solder in copper channels) and rarely stack. Rhythm breathes: long anaphora in setup, staccato spark at burn. One mixed metaphor—“time stops… world holding breath”—is forgiven because it literalizes within story rules. No loops or paraphrase, clean copy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Fusion of alchemy, neutron-star physics, and parental grief feels fresh against orchard-crater backdrop. Discarded canning lids as pulse-beats converts domestic detritus into cosmic notation; flash-paper ignition as map-transfer is a vivid conceptual leap. Risk is high—frozen time, literal star-path—but the piece commits and lands cleanly. Slight deduction for echoing “heartbeat = star” trope already seen in SF poetry.</comment>
