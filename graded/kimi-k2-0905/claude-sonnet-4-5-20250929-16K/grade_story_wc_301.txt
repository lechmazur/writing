<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maya’s guilt-driven compulsion to chronicle rivers is credibly embodied, but the brother’s death and her complicity are revealed in a single reflective block that tells rather than dramatizes the decisive trauma; the micro-choice to play the accordion is lovely yet arrives after a long interior summary, softening the felt cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: each mapped river and the patched accordion layer density until the final cadence shift ("confluence of before and after"). Closure lands as Charged Poise with conceptual cost, but the causality of the bridge collapse is off-stage and recounted, not dramatized, so the decisive change is slightly abstract.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>The ivy-choked platform, still-functional pump, and tape-glinting accordion are vividly selective and mirrored in Maya’s internal decay/recovery; spatial choreography is clean and the station constrains her choice to stay and play. Environment charges the final image—ivy and bellows both patched yet still breathing.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—self-forgiveness—signals early; pressure tightens when graffiti confronts her denial, forcing the accordion micro-choice. Escalation is textural: each mapped river beat adds guilt-density until the final cadence shift. Cost is conceptual (raw sound leaks from patched bellows) rather than tangible, keeping tension in the lyric register.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically from the twin motifs of mapped rivers and patched music: documentation cannot staunch grief, only witness it. The graffiti line is dangerously close to thematic echo, but its red-marker anonymity keeps it situational. Final image of river moving through ruins offers quiet repricing without moralizing.</comment>

<comment>Third-person lyric stays tightly filtered through Maya’s perceptual bias—she notices flow rates, corroded bolts, tape glints. Rhythm modulates: long reflective sentences breathe, then staccato accordion wheezes. No dialogue, so voice purity remains intact; diction stays within her plausible lexicon ("map references," "bellows").</comment>

<comment>Prose is clean, high-density; no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is restrained—"ivy cascading like green waterfalls frozen in time" is the single extended metaphor and it’s apt. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and image effectively. Minor register lift in "conceptual repricing" meta phrasing, but it compresses rather than distracts.</comment>

<comment>The river-chronicler seeking absolution via an unplayed accordion is a fresh synthesis; graffiti-as-catalyst is familiar, but its placement in a disused station bathroom re-weights the trope. Risk lies in the quiet ending—music as raw solace rather than revelation—which pays off. Still, bridge-collapse guilt feels close to prior literary templates.</comment>
