<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mira’s contradictory inheritance—her father’s forged ink pot versus his injunction to honesty—drives every micro-choice; the moment she rinses the SD card and documents the truth in the logbook, we see the costly, embodied renunciation of his legacy. Pavel’s grief-strained calculation (“How do I repay this?”) forces her to articulate a new ethic: testimony as currency. Interiority stays concrete (“staining her fingers indigo,” “wind through mountain passes”) and avoids therapy-speak. The only minor slack is Pavel’s brief slide into “desperate calculation” cliché, but it’s instantly re-grounded in their shared vigil.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal chain is clean: swallowed SD → post-mortem retrieval prohibition → night-long vigil → biological release → ethical documentation. Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Mira refuses to forge, instead choosing truthful paperwork that forever forecloses her father’s path yet keeps his pot on the shelf—cost legible in the final image. Orientation anchored by line 3; no lens ambiguity. The vigil’s single-scene container holds pressure without leakage.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Funeral home prep room functions as micro-setting: drainage tray, formaldehyde air, and logbook constrain every action; the ink pot’s indigo stain on Mira’s fingers fuses paternal guilt with present labor. Sensory hierarchy is mortician-precise: smell, drainage glint, dawn light through high windows. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly as Mira moves between bodies, equipment, and Pavel’s corner chair. Setting never slips into white-room; the antique pot’s reprise in the final paragraph recharges the space with inherited sin.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—truth versus survival—tightens when Pavel reveals the swallowed SD; the night-long vigil becomes the only permissible “breach.” Escalation is accumulative: each hour of waiting enlarges the cost of honesty. The final documentation act forecloses Mira’s latent temptation to forge, trading her father’s criminal toolkit for a single lawful signature—price paid on the page.</question>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges as testamentary arithmetic: stories > forgeries. No moralizing; the final line (“testimony as currency”) is spoken by Mira to Pavel, not authorial assertion. Subtext pulses in silent gestures—Pavel clutching the rinsed capsule to his chest while Mira re-caps her father’s pot. The indigo stain recurs as charged object, reweighted from instrument of lies to witness of truth.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Mira; perceptual signature is mortician-cool (“deathly vitality,” “formaldehyde smell no longer bothered”). Syntax lengthens under emotional pressure, then fractures into short beats during SD recovery. No head-hopping; Pavel’s interiority is inferred only through Mira’s reading of his “desperate calculation,” maintaining distance control. Dialogue sparse but subtextual (“How do I repay this?”) carries the weight of asylum math.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is high-density and loop-free; every sentence advances character or atmosphere. Figurative language is sparse, precise: “truth like clay,” “mathematics of a fair trade.” No filter-verb stacks; verbs are mortician-strong (“rinsed,” “documented,” “forecloses”). Rhythm breathes with vigil fatigue—long sentences at 2 a.m., staccato at 4 a.m. when the capsule surfaces. Copy-clean; no scaffolding or synonym churn.</comment>

<comment>Fresh synthesis: asylum testimony + post-mortem body-processing + refusal to forge = non-obvious ethical thriller in 700 words. The swallowed SD card is not gimmick; it reconfigures the funeral room into a safe-deposit vault. Risk taken by making the climax an act of passive waiting, yet pressure accumulates through biological inevitability and cultural taboo. Ink pot’s transformation from forgery tool to honesty talisman embodies the story’s conceptual re-pricing.</comment>
