<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Marina’s contradictory impulses—scientific rigor vs. incendiary sabotage—surface only in summary; the archive beats show single-minded purpose, flattening internal tension. The tender final gesture is credible because the tapestry fragment has been carried, fingered, and finally clutched to chest, giving the endurance visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: fires → disappearance → breadcrumb hunt → archive → upload plan, each ‘because’ tightening options. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the ruined portrait plus intact tapestry crystallize both loss and vindication; cost is felt in Marina’s whispered “I found you,” which forecloses her anonymity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Basalt archive breathes through tactile specificity: dry air, volcanic dust under fingernails, headlamp flare on slashed hide. The tapestry fragment is handled repeatedly, becoming micro-setting that charges the final image; removing it would gut the emotional payoff.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—rescue Kiran’s erased truth—tightens when Marina deciphers the vandalized portrait’s border codes, trading anonymity for global broadcast. Cost is legible: she climbs toward daylight knowing she’s trading exile for vindication, a price she accepts on-page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Theme emerges from fire-as-purge versus art-as-memory; the ending’s volcanic tenderness reweights fire from destruction to love-armature without moralizing. Subtextual irony: the same institutions that archived colonial loot now face data-arson exposure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays anchored to Marina’s conservator eye—she notices warp threads, pH of hide, acid bloom on pigment—creating a perceptual signature. Syntax tightens under pressure: clauses shorten as she pieces coordinates, mirroring pulse.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>High information density: “donated books accumulated like sediment” compresses time, complicity, and flammability in one image. No loops; only minor register lift (“volcanic tenderness”) that is earned by literal geology. Final line cadence—two monosyllabic sentences—delivers charged poise without artifice.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</question><comment>Synthesis of library-arson redemption + pre-Columbian archive feels inevitable yet undocumented; risk lies in valorizing arson, but the piece ties fire to archival love, not nihilism. Specificity of Tethani weaving patterns and acid-burned coordinates prevents trope drift.</comment>
