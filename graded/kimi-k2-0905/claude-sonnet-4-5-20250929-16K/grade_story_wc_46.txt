<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mara’s interior contradiction—clinging to memory while converting it into light—remains embodied in every micro-choice (polishing, placing, breathing the grotto). The “pearl of stillness” quest is dramatized, not labelled, and the final renunciation of fire-charged vengeance is earned through two decades of tactile ritual. Cost is visible: raw fingertips, the empty pouch, the admission that some blue shards must stay unknowable. Only the absence of on-page secondary characters prevents the relationship crucible test from lifting this into the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each shard added to the wall increases density and softens the surviving option of revenge-by-fire. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—Mara installs the white-glass lens that will never burn, rewriting the rule-set of illumination. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“serpentine grotto”), transitions are single-state, pattern taught by 25 %. Cost is legible in the final sentence: she “tends her constellation in the dark,” accepting perpetual half-light as price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The grotto’s serpentine anatomy and mist-breath constrain every movement—she polishes where sunlight can strike, places shards only in reachable fissures. Sea-glass itself functions as micro-setting: its fracture planes dictate grip, weight, risk of cut. Tool, body, and environment merge when “the grotto itself seemed to breathe with her,” charging the final image. Sensory economy is POV-filtered: salt-taste of mist, cliff-roar reduced to hush, color admitted only through glass.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—transform pain into non-burning light—tightens once: the white shard must achieve stillness or the wall’s constellation stays incomplete. Agency is continuous (weigh, polish, place); each stroke forfeits time and microscopic flesh. Escalation is density-driven: more shards = softer light = smaller chance she’ll ever strike a match. Cost is visible in cracked fingertips and the admission that some memories (blue fragments) remain un-transformed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the accreted particularity of broken bottle → soft prism: brokenness is not erased but reframed into shared illumination. Subtext lives in gesture—she never speaks to pilgrims, yet the candle offerings prove her ethos contagious. Final image reweights premise: darkness is not expelled, it is companioned by self-renouncing light. No thesis statement; resonance is felt when morning sun will hit the fresh white shard first, extending the pattern beyond her body.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited sustains Mara’s perceptual signature—stars “she would never touch,” glass that “sang yet remained still.” Syntax lengthens during reflective polish, contracts at shard-placement, mirroring breath. No head-hop; mist and grotto stay externalized because she experiences them as collaborators. The lyric register risks nothing generic because diction is salted with maritime specificity: “frost-white,” “tumbling in the sea,” “zephyr bloom.”</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Zero loops, scaffolding, or mixed metaphors; each sentence advances image, tactility, or decision. Sentence variety is purposeful—participle openers mimic circular motion of polishing, then shift to blunt subject-verb for placement beats. No filter-verb stacks; body and tool remain in continuous contact. Opening line anchors voice and stake; final line crystallizes Charged Poise without exposition.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: trauma-transformed sea-glass as non-pyrogenic starlight. Risk is taken in quiet accretive structure rather than twist; coherence never wavers. Specificity grounds novelty—amber shard literally once held mother’s perfume. If relocated to any other coast or character, the entire constellation logic collapses, proving irreplaceability.</comment>
