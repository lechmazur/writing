<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Finder’s wartime reflexes and present fatigue are convincingly embodied; the leaf-cube she’s kept for fifteen years shows a concrete hierarchy of values. Interiority stays sparse and world-weary—no therapy-speak—yet the moment she traces the grooves her pulse quickens in a single, physical cue. The reunion choice is foreshadowed by her carrying a reminder of beauty, so the closure renunciation feels earned. Minor drift: “ready to find the living” is stated, not dramatized, blunting the cost edge.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: cylinder arrival → recognition → groove-reading → map-in-leaf → westward journey → reunion, each step tightening options. Orientation anchor (scrapyard, after-war) appears within first 80 words. Closure is a Resonant Re-configuration: the two leaves glow side-by-side, visually costing the years of separation without verbal summary. One soft spot—Crow’s “months of broadcasts” is off-stage causality not seeded earlier, slightly thinning the final cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>“Twisted metal bones” and “fallen dish antenna shelter” give post-war texture without catalog bloat; the leaf-cube functions as micro-setting that literally refracts the map. Wind whistling through corrugated gaps keeps bodies present. Spatial choreography is clean: caravan → shelf → lamplight → three-day trek → antenna shelter, no impossible moves. The environment does not alter tactics in the final beat, so misses 9-band gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—whether connection across elapsed war-years is still possible—signals early via Crow’s voice on cylinder. Middle escalation occurs when leaf-veins reveal coordinates, forcing the trek; this is the single meaningful tightening. Cost is visible in Finder’s returned war-skill gait and the years already lost, but the trek itself is summarized, muting visceral price. Still, agency remains hers throughout; coincidence only complicates arrival, not resolution.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of “reading distance as closeness” emerges through the groove-riddle and leaf-map rather than exposition. The waxed leaves shift from nostalgia to bridge-building material, reweighting memory toward future contact. Final image resists moralizing: two bloodhounds quietly translating silence into shared space. Ambiguity lingers—no promise of utopia—yet emotional after-effect is concrete. Slight subtraction for Crow’s summary line “distance isn’t just space,” which flirts with thematic echo.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Finder’s sensorium: “her intuition reading landscapes like text” gives bloodhound-specific perceptual signature. Syntax is lean, almost scent-tracked, matching a tracker’s mind. No head-hopping; Crow’s interior is inferred only through gesture and dialogue indirection. Voice modulates once—short, breathless clauses when cylinder spins—then settles into weary cadence at reunion. Distinctive enough, but not yet grain-to-the-bone original.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Prose is generally clean: no filter-verb stacks, mixed metaphors, or template cadence. Opening sentence anchors voice and concept in one sweep. Occasional near-loop: “trying to forget what her gifts had shown her” is paraphrased two sentences later as “what others miss”—minor but perceptible. High-info density achieved through noun-plus-verb pairings (“wind whistling,” “veins emerged”). No artifact touches closure beat, keeping 8+ territory intact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Post-apocalyptic reunion via phonograph riddle isn’t virgin ground, yet the secret groove-text + leaf-map combo feels freshly spliced. Bloodhound-as-reader trope is literalized without cuteness. Wax leaves as data-storage is a specific, non-obvious turn that would collapse if swapped. Risk taken in quiet, lyric closure rather than showdown—coherent with stakes. Lacks the final shock-of-new to reach 9-band, but avoids checklist derivativeness.</comment>
