<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren’s meticulous nature is shown through tactile micro-choices (unscrewing the tube, noting pigeon posture) and her integrity dilemma is embodied, not declared. The interior contradiction—comply vs. protect—drives every beat; the final renunciation (parallel documentation) costs her solitude and safety, felt in the fading-light image. No stock labels; even “credibly curious” is demonstrated via action. The only limit: we never see her flaw compound into error; she’s almost preternaturally competent, muting jeopardy.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: tailing → message → recognition of weaponized data → lateral counter-plan. Closure is Earned Stasis: she forecloses the easy path (compliance) and accepts ongoing risk; cost is legible in the final sentence “They would see the surface. She would continue recording the depths.” Orientation anchored by word 80; no lens ambiguity. One causality hairline: the pigeon arrives exactly when she needs confirmation—lucky, but it complicates rather than resolves, so allowed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Sensory triage matches POV: meteorologist notices moisture-laden breeze, chemical scent replaced by wetland reek. Courtyard’s iron gate, fountain, ivy function as both sanctuary and trap—she’s safe yet visible from balconies, constraining her next move. Micro-setting of the brass tube becomes the story’s pivot. Missing one beat: no tactile description of the tube’s temperature or weight, a lost opportunity to ground the inciting gift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—protecting truth without becoming partisan—tightens when message reveals data can be “weaponized.” Single meaningful turn: she decides to create an unweaponizable archive; this narrows her future options and increases personal risk. Pressure stays coherent under Causal lens; no off-stage rescue. Cost is conceptual (perpetual vulnerability) rather than visceral, keeping it just shy of the 8.5 band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme—integrity as active, lateral resistance—emerges through images (pigeon as courier of complicity, courtyard as fragile refuge) rather than sermon. Final line reweights “surface vs. depth,” forcing reader to revisit earlier sensory notes as evidence of reclamation. Avoids tidy moral; ambiguity lingers in who will ultimately possess the complete record. No thematic echo violations.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-limited voice maintains meteorologist’s perceptual signature: wind direction, scent chemistry, pressure implicit in “amber-lit streets.” Syntax is controlled, rhythmic, slightly clinical—mirroring her temperament—yet opens into lyrical final cadence. No head-hopping, no filter-verb clutter. One micro-slip: “intuited the fuller picture” edges toward diagnostic label, but immediate sensory follow-up rescues it.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, high-density; sentences carry dual duty (action + atmospheric data) without scaffold. Figurative language sparse and precise: “ivy climbing…in darkening cascades” fuses visual with temporal decay. No loops, no mixed metaphors. A single paraphrase echo—“her integrity…she recorded facts; she didn’t take sides”/“this was her integrity”—is close enough to notice, preventing 9+.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Freshest inflection: using mundane meteorological data as both lifeblood and potential weapon inside a reclaimed toxic zone. Lateral resistance through narrative, not numeric, documentation is a non-obvious tactic that feels inevitable once revealed. Tropes (dystopian state, rogue commune) are grounded in sensory specificity rather than stock decal. Risk level moderate; could have pushed further had the pigeon message itself been forged or unreliable.</comment>
