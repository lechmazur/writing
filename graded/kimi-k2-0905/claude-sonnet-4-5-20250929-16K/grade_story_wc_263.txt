<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lyra’s interiority is vivid, embodied, and consistent—her madness manifests as tactile aurora pulses and astrolabe clicks. The contradictory impulses (fear of overload vs. irrepressible conduit) coexist in-scene, driving the final renunciation. Micro-choices (palm on granite, fingers tracing meteors, mouth opening to speak) reveal value hierarchy: world-creation > self-preservation. Cost is felt: she “cannot hold it all” yet yields her body as archway—Earned Stasis with visible price.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: meteor trajectories tighten into a key pattern, cadence shift from hush to scream to release. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—creativity’s liberation reweights prior silence; cost is the protagonist’s dissolution into threshold. Causality intact: each meteor cry escalates toward archway rupture. No orientation debt; spatial anchors (northern edge, cold granite) arrive by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Aurora-lit archway functions as micro-setting: its granite pulse and meteor keyholes constrain every tactical move. Brass astrolabe is handled thrice, altering stance each time—tool-as-setting that charges closure. Sensory economy favors cold, light, sound of unspoken words; no filler weather clichés. Spatial choreography flawless: Lyra → archway center → mouth opens → light pours through her.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—free trapped creativity—signaled in opener; escalation via denser meteor cries that narrow options to single threshold act. Agency: Lyra’s alignment of astrolabe triggers rupture; coincidence complicates (aurora intensity) but does not resolve. Visible price: her corporeal dissolution forecloses any return. One meaningful tightening suffices; no reversal overload.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete arc: unexpressed potential → embodied release. Motif of “fallen stars remember” reweights at closure—stardust made flesh through fool’s sacrifice. No final-paragraph sermon; resonance carried by image of creativity raining onto silent artists. Counter-readings possible: liberation or colonial drain; complexity preserved.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person lyric voice maintains consistent perceptual signature: synesthetic hearing of granite pulse, meteor voices. Syntax swells and contracts with aurora intensity; no head-hopping. Diction stays within moonstruck lexicon—“moonstruck dreamer,” “calcifying silence”—without register drift. Rhythm mirrors escalating chorus of unspoken words, climaxing in breathless release.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Zero loops; each sentence advances image or pressure. Figurative language internally coherent—light as liquid revelation, shadows with fingers—without metaphor clash. High density: “brass circles tarnished with age” simultaneously reveals object, history, mood. Final line cadence mirrors meteor shower, propelling closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Fusion of synesthetic perception + astrolabe mechanics + aurora keyhole is fresh synthesis of familiar cosmic tropes. “Stardust remembers” twist grounded in matrilineal instrument, not abstract rule. Risk—corporeal dissolution as archway—paid off by prior bodily metaphors. Transformation test fails if Lyra swapped out: specificity of her hearing is engine.</comment>
