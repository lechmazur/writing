<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Matthias’s shift from revolutionary fire to scholar-poet is embodied in the velvet-swaddled mirrors and shard-lit visions; his interiority stays sensuous and specific (“each arabesque a hymn to moments”). Yet the single on-page choice—uncovering the shard to the mirror—arrives as a quiet coda rather than a crucible; the cost is elegiac, not tactical, so the arc feels more observed than earned under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: mirrored corridors, storms, and shard-glimpses layer density until the final overlap image reweights the stake. Orientation is clean by line 10; the single transition (storm-to-stillness) is legible. Closure lands as Charged Poise—past and present silhouettes fused in the glass—carrying conceptual cost: humanity’s narrative forever pierced by prior beauty. The persistent constraint (covered mirrors) shapes every beat, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The baroque asteroid is lived-in: gilt corridors flake under fingertips, frescoes exhale centuries of vacuum-dried pigment, velvet drapes hold dust that catches prismatic light. Micro-setting—the shard itself—functions as portal and proof, constraining methodology and final revelation. Spatial choreography stays crisp as Matthias “walks these halls alone,” then “stands before his own reflection.” Weather is literal time-storm, never decorative; it forces the mirror-covering ritual and seeds the closing image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whose narrative will own the asteroid’s past—is signaled early and tightened when the shard’s remembered light refutes Keraine’s Terran thesis. The temporal storm functions as coherent pressure, not coincidence, forcing the mirror ritual and the visionary beat. Cost is conceptual: scholarly certainty dissolved into elegiac ambiguity. A second, sharper tightening—perhaps a direct confrontation or forfeiture of reputation—would push this into the 8.5+ band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges as the impossibility of sole ownership of beauty and history; the final image of two species sharing a fractured reflection offers non-literal resonance. Subtext lives in gesture: covering mirrors = covering imperial gaze. Poetry-as-method motif evolves from affectation to epistemic tool, reweighted in the closing couplet. No moralizing—just the ache of shared transience.</comment>

<comment>Third-person intimate sustains a scholar-poet perceptual signature: “light—not reflected it, but remembered it.” Syntax lengthens into hexameter-like cadence when storms bloom, then tightens into monosyllables at mirror-check beats. No dialogue, so voice carries all texture; diction (“geometric grace,” “burnished sorrow”) stays within a mind that writes verses in margins. The final shard-on-mirror beat compresses into imagist clarity, proving rhythmic control under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Sentences double-duty: “cascading auroras of past and future” fuses visual spectacle with temporal mechanics. No paraphrase loops; each velvet drape or gilt flake appears once, charged. Metaphors stay mutually lucid—mirrors as traps, storms as visible history—no mixed vehicles. Opening and closing lines anchor and recharge the shard motif with zero scaffold. Minor filter-verb trio (“he could see them”) is voice-motivated hallucination, not artifact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Fusing baroque aesthetics with deep-time alien archaeology is fresh; making the shard a literal memory-storage medium re-prices both genre tropes. The poetic-archaeologist protagonist risks gimmick yet feels inevitable because every image serves the closure. Risky second-person glimpse (“we are not the first”) is brief, earned, and amplifies the communal ache. Transformation test: swap asteroid for space station or shard for datapad and the elegiac heart collapses.</comment>
