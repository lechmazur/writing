<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Mara’s dry skepticism and obsession with river-sources stay vivid, but her interiority flips into explanatory summary (“Understanding crystallized…”) rather than embodied contradiction under peak pressure; the micro-choice to walk onto the ice tomorrow is declared, not dramatized, so the cost is prospective, not palpable on-page. The “clever bastard” moment hints at layered self-reproach yet doesn’t force an immediate tactical shift or visible renunciation today. Competence and motive are clear; the missing beat is a present-tense decision with flesh-level stakes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>The causal chain is sound: falcon → coded note → condensation pattern → lake-center coordinates → temporal-reversal hypothesis → tomorrow’s expedition, each because/therefore link tightening knowledge, not options. Closure lands as Charged Poise: Mara sketches plans while the lake “exhales,” crystallizing a new rule-set (rivers return, not begin) with conceptual cost—she now must test ice that may kill her. The lens stays causal throughout; the only softness is that the decisive physical risk is deferred, slightly blunting felt price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Frost-rimed windowsill, rust-red ice-corrosion, and condensation deltas are tactile, selective, and mirrored in the atlas metaphors; the polyglot phrasebook and oil-lamp heat function as micro-settings that literally decode the mystery. Spatial choreography is clean—no impossible reaches or drifting rooms—and weather (dropping temps, mist exhalation) directly shapes tomorrow’s stakes. The lake-as-temporal-drain is vividly particular, constraining her next move.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—prove the lake is rivers’ origin/terminus—remains coherent; escalation is intellectual, not lethal yet: each decoded symbol narrows her epistemic options until the reversal hypothesis forecloses standard hydrology. Price is conceptual (career credibility, possible death off-page) rather than visceral today; one explicit tangible loss (rusted window frame) signals environment’s quiet corrosion, but the tightening would hit harder if an immediate on-page forfeiture accompanied the insight.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>The theme of cyclical return emerges through condensation patterns, the dog-eared page, and her predecessor’s disappearing act—never sermonized. The final image of the lake “remembering” reweights all mapping ambition into existential humility; ambiguity is purposeful, inviting reflection on time versus territory. No platitudes, just reframed water.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person close narrator maintains steady psychic distance, using tactile, atlas-inflected diction (“rust-stained,” “linguistic markers”) that feels character-particular. No head-hopping; filter verbs are minimal and motivated; rhythm tightens in the discovery beat without syntactic monotony. Dialogue is absent, so voice distinctiveness rests on perceptual signature, which is consistent and atmospheric.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and image-rich; sentences vary in length and opening; no paraphrase loops or mixed metaphors. “Ice crystals falling from its wings onto the rust-stained windowsill” does triple sensory work in one stroke. Occasional elevated latinate words (“convergence,” “hydrology”) fit the cartographer POV and are balanced by concrete verbs (“scraped,” “exhaled”). No artifact touches the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Reversing river genesis into temporal return feels fresh yet inevitable; trope of missing predecessor is subverted—he left a condensation cipher instead of a corpse. Condensation-as-code is a lovely, micro-scale invention that fuses setting and plot device. Risk lies in the deferred expedition, but conceptually the piece commits fully to its hydrology paradox without hedging.</comment>
