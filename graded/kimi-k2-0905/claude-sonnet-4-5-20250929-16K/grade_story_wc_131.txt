<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Maren’s contradictory impulses—her reflex to hide versus her new need to be seen—are dramatized in embodied, present-tense beats (emerging through the grate, palm-open gesture). The interiority is concrete, never drifting into label-speak, and the final choice to reveal herself is causally tied to the remembered warmth of being read to. Micro-choices under pressure (arranging the cache, writing the note) show value hierarchy with visible cost (exposure risk). The boy remains a cipher, but within 800 words the single-POV default holds; secondary-pressure bullet is waived.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Causal lens dominates: power outage → free movement → tape-sense memory → decision to surface. Closure lands on-page with felt cost—Maren’s anonymity is foreclosed when the boy sees her—earning a Resonant Reconfiguration under Charged Poise. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are clear by word 70. No meaningful accumulation or mosaic pattern; single-scene default fits scope. The tape fragment and blue light echo at the end, reweighting visibility stakes without mechanical exposition.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Library micro-setting (third-floor heating duct, staff-bathroom chase) constrains tactics and hides the cache; spatial choreography is clean and lived-in. Blue-gray dawn light recurs, charging the final image as Maren steps into literal visibility. Ferromagnetic tape functions as micro-object-setting: its smell triggers the memory that crystallizes purpose. No static catalogue; every detail is filtered through Maren’s survival priorities.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—visibility versus extinction—tightens once when the tape smell converts hiding into active outreach. Agency is renunciation: Maren surrenders perfect invisibility, paying the price of possible discovery. Escalation is a single deepening, not multiple reversals, sufficient for 800-word scope. Cost is legible: the grate left ajar, the boy’s eyes locking on her, irrevocable.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: shared vulnerability as antidote to social erasure. Subtext resides in gesture (granola-bar offering, palm-open hand) rather than abstractions. The final image—two invisible people meeting in the picture-book aisle—reweights earlier hiding motifs without moralizing. No thematic echo in prompt language; insight is earned through the tape-triggered memory, not stated.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays strictly inside Maren’s perceptual signature—duct shadows, spine textures, oxide smell—without filter-verb bloat. Syntax tightens under pressure: “She emerged…palm open” mirrors the cautious, methodical trait. No dialogue, so voice distinctness rests on interior diction, which remains consistent and character-bound. Final short sentences accelerate the reveal without drum-beat monotony.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>High information density: single sentences cache backstory (“eleven months…disappear”), anchor time (“4:47 AM”), and advance plot. No metaphor loops or mixed vehicles; “sapphire hush” is repeated once, purposeful and paid off. Rhythm breathes—long sentence for library hush, fragment for grate creak. Copy-clean: no tense slips, pronoun drift, or scaffold phrases.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Homeless-in-plain-sight premise is familiar, but the library-infrastructure cache geography and tape-smell sense memory provide fresh specificity. Risk taken: quiet, pre-dawn outage instead of action set-piece; coherence holds. Transformation test fails—names/places could be swapped—but emotional particulars (oxide smell → grandmother voice) keep it from generic template. Slight deduction for foreseeable “we can help each other” closure, albeit earned.</comment>
