<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Mira’s calmly inventive trait is shown, not told, through her sundial coding and the bronze-holder logistics; inner contradictions (guard duty vs. rebel engineer) tighten every beat. The blackout moment crystallizes her risk tolerance with a smile—embodied, not labeled. Only micro-gap: we never feel the physical cost (sweat, tremor) while she kneels in the dark; that keeps her just short of visceral flaw-legibility.</comment>

<comment>Causal lens holds: blackout (Kael) → Mira’s access → coded angles → 17 confirmations → Earned Stasis patrol that forecloses retreat. Orientation anchors inside 70 words; final patrol is the visible price (lost anonymity). Closure is clean, legible, and paid for on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Crystalline fort, half-painted sundial, and bronze holder are tactile tools that constrain every tactic; their textures return in the final “winking hush” image, re-weighting the stake. Light/dark reversal is atmospheric yet causally tied to the revolution’s first move. No extraneous place-filler; each descriptor either hides code or risks detection.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—free the prisoners before the lower levels are sealed—tightens at the blackout beat; 72-hour clock is declared and felt. Mira’s agency drives every increment: embeds angles, retrieves holder, encodes next phase, accepts final patrol. Cost is the irreversible exposure she embraces in the last paragraph.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme of quiet subversion emerges through concrete craft (paint layers, key chimes) rather than thesis lines. Final “winking hush” re-prices surface order as complicity, giving reader an after-image of complicity vs. resistance. Avoids moral symmetry; Council is plainly wrong, yet Mira’s own secrecy cost is felt.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person intimate carries a precise perceptual signature: lock sentinel’s金属 vocabulary, angle-math imagery, quiet relish of secrecy. Rhythm modulates—long sentences for rounds, staccato for blackout. No head-hopping; psychic distance stable. Voss lantern pass is staged through her body in shadow, sustaining POV discipline.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Sentences multi-task: “She knelt beside the sundial’s base, running her hands over the painted angles” delivers motion, setting, and code clue in one sweep. No loops or mixed metaphors; figurative language spare and purposeful. Final line cadence mirrors key-ring chime, giving audible closure without overwritten flourish.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: lock-picking + astronomical instrument as clandestine newsletter feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Risk lies in making a maintenance chore sedition; payoff lands. Sundial angles as cipher transforms a cliché “hidden in plain sight” into tactile mechanics. No derivative echoes; concept is fully owned.</comment>
