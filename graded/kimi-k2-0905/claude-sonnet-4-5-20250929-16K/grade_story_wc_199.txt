<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Miren’s tactile seed-sorting ritual, secret monument-building, and the final act of using the moonstone to “write” living moss all embody a believable, earned obsession. Her seventeen-year patience and the hush-hour constraint ground her interiority in concrete time. The climactic internal transformation (she “felt herself begin to transform”) is shown through her subsequent decision to teach others, not merely asserted. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene, keeping this just below the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: each seed, monument, and leaf-transformation adds density until the moonstone catalyzes a pattern-break that reweights the stake. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: “Nothing stayed fixed” revalues the entire prior sorting quest and forecloses the old interpretive method with undeniable conceptual cost. Orientation anchor (“the hush where past meets prophecy”) arrives by line 4; the later disorientation (leaves fall upward) is taught early and pays off at closure, so Orientation Test is waived. The persistent constraint—only transformed leaves carry meaning—shapes every micro-choice and charges the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The arbor’s body becomes a micro-setting that actively constrains choice: seeds must be finger-sorted in zero-g, monuments are built from rejected genetic material, and the moonstone can only “write” on this living wood. Vivid sensory triangulation—ash-colored bark, mossy taste of spring, opalescent glint no larger than a grain of salt—keeps perception urgent and POV-bound. Spatial choreography is immaculate: seeds fall upward, twigs bend into archways, and moss veins track the moonstone’s exact path across the table. The final blooming palette reconfigures the entire visual rule-set, passing the 9+ gate test.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—“decode the message in falling leaves”—tightens when the moonstone proves the method itself is wrong. One meaningful deepening occurs: realization that transformation IS the message narrows her interpretive options to zero, forcing a stance shift. Cost is legible on-page: seventeen years of methodical sorting are retroactively invalidated, paid in lost time and identity capital. Agency is intellectual rather than causal; the tightening still charges the final image under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the accumulating seed-monument-leaf pattern: interpretation must itself keep transforming. The final reweighting (“Everything was always emerging, always translating itself”) lands as a resonant, non-moral answer to the central question. No character states the thesis in prompt-like language; the closest—“She had decoded the message”—is embedded in dramatized action. The after-effect is concrete: reader re-sees prior monuments as frozen translations, fulfilling the 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays pinned to Miren’s fingertip perception; no head-hop. Distinct perceptual signature—“ridged ember-seeds,” “spiral windwhispers,” “mossy delight”—filters every noun through tactile seed-sorter lexicon. Syntax flexes with pressure: short percussive clauses during discovery (“She prodded again”) elongate into cadenced resonance at closure. No dialogue appears; internal thought remains concrete and avoids diagnostic labels.</comment>

<comment>Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances pattern or image. Figurative vehicles stay coherent: leaves → moths → rain → questions maintains one fluid transformation logic. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; closing line (“shimmering with every color transformation could hold”) resolves by recharging the ash palette. No scaffold or register drift; high information density without overcrowding the 750-word count.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The floating oracle-tree whose seeds fall upward is already non-obvious; coupling it with a protagonist who reads by building miniature cairns converts folklore into lived craft. The moonstone speck’s moss-ink rewrites the arbor’s own surface, turning setting into palimpsest—an inflection unlikely to survive relocation. Risk is high (lyric world, no antagonist, purely intellectual stakes) yet coherence remains intact, earning the bonus. Specificity of seed taxonomy and monument grammar prevents generic drift.</comment>
