<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete—her recognition that “disappearing wasn’t the same as healing” crystallizes micro-choice under pressure. Contradictory impulses (stay hidden vs. finish the mission) coexist in-scene, not summary. The final stance shift is earned: eighteen months of snow-watch convert to active re-entry, cost signaled by leaving the bluff’s safety. Voice remains individual, though a trace of therapeutic self-diagnosis (“cowardice by prettier names”) nicks perfect credibility.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal lens dominates: snow-code discovery → decoded grid → partner arrival → Berlin decision, each because/therefore link legible. Closure is a Decisive Change with felt cost: she forfeits anonymity for mission, last image of “silver hush…settling into her bones” conferring permission and loss. No orientation debt; who/where/when anchored by line 3. One minor elastic: Marcus’s off-page survival is convenient but complicates rather than resolves, permissible under lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Zephyr Bluff’s wind-sculpted snow functions as co-protagonist: its patterns enable the code, its melt deadline drives the scene. Mist and spring tilt supply both atmosphere and ticking clock. The engraved pillbox recurs as tacticle anchor, handled twice with reweighted meaning. Environment directly constrains choice—without the snow she can’t read Marcus, without the melt she wouldn’t act today.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—repair the broken mission—signaled in line 4 and tightened when snow-code appears, foreclosing her retreat option. Escalation is causal: each drift line narrows safe inaction until Berlin vault request poses irrefusable risk. Cost is visible—she photographs evidence knowing sunlight will erase her last alibi. No coincidence resolves; Marcus’s arrival results from her barometric reply.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges without thesis statement: fixing what’s broken = returning to danger, not building anew. Snow-as-code motif reweights from accidental curiosity to call-back-to-duty, crystallizing in her question “When do we leave?” Final image of silver hush as benediction offers resonant non-literal answer—permission costs her hard-won ghost-life. Avoids moralizing; complexity intact.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited remains stable, perceptual signature sharp: “snowpack into something readable,” “silver hush of the observation room.” Syntax mirrors wind rhythm—long accumulative sentences build, then clipped exchanges with Marcus release. No head-hopping; knowledge stays Claire-bound. Filter verbs minimal; free indirect clean. Dialogue sparse but natural, distinguishable by Marcus’s weariness versus her taut readiness.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>High information density: “March mist rolled up from the valley like whispered secrets” packs time, place, mood. Rhythm varies—paratactic snow descriptions mimic drift layering; short verbless line “Tomorrow” provides decisive exhale. No scaffold loops; metaphors stay wind/snow domain-coherent. Minor near-repeat—“silver hush” used twice—earns leitmotif status, not clutter.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Snow-as-cipher freshens familiar spy-return plot; mountain weather station replaces usual café dead-drop. Integration of meteorological craft into tradecraft feels inevitable, not gimmick. Character arc—ghost to re-activated agent—follows seasonal thaw, avoiding stock revenge trigger. Could edge higher if Berlin vault specifics had been seeded earlier, but within short frame the synthesis is memorable.</comment>
