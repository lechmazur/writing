<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Maren’s interior contradiction—mapping ignorance while blind to her own—stays off-stage; the quill and ink feel ritualized rather than urgent. Micro-choices are present (cleaning the quill, choosing parchment) but carry no visible cost or risk. The ending’s “suspended future” offers earned stasis, yet her flaw never complicates the decision path, so tension stays intellectual, not visceral.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Maren’s maps crystallize three futures and the colony’s choice-space is reweighted with undeniable conceptual cost—“whether they would find it depended not on fate, but on their willingness to see beyond what they already knew.” Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; density of futures builds until the final image re-sets stakes. No orientation drift; who/where/when anchored by line 3. Persistent constraint (dwindling resources) shapes each modeled path.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Obsidian spire and frozen lake constrain invention options—thermal tapestry future literally grows from the spire’s volcanic DNA. Kingfisher quill recurs as micro-setting/tool whose flexibility mirrors the need for adaptive precision. Selective sensory focus (frigid breath, ink mixed with spire dust) keeps detail purposeful. Final image—sun touching obsidian peak—recharges opening “blackened tooth” with latent warmth, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—colony survival—signaled in paragraph 2. One meaningful tightening: Future Two’s 41 % collapse risk forces the imaginative leap to Future Three. Cost is conceptual (innovation may die) rather than personal, keeping pressure cerebral. Escalation is accumulative—each future lowers the safety margin until only the un-mapped thermal option remains.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Theme—“the shape of their own ignorance”—emerges through the three futures, never sermonized. Final line’s reweighting of knowledge vs. assumption offers quiet conceptual repricing. Subtext operates in silence: the blank parchment is the void they must populate with humility. No tidy moral; ambiguity lingers about whether the Council will choose sight or blinders.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Lush yet disciplined lyricism—“probability lattices,” “terra incognita”—serves the cartographer’s perceptual signature. Rhythm modulates: long sentences for modeling, clipped fragments at dawn. No dialogue, so voice remains pure internal monologue; diction stays within Maren’s scholarly lexicon. Filter verbs avoided; imagery is POV-bound.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>High information density: each sentence advances world or stake. Figurative control: “blackened tooth” opener is striking yet causally apt. No loops, no mixed metaphors. Minor scaffold—“future” repeated three times in close succession—dulls cadence by 0.2, preventing 8.5+.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>“Ignorance cartography” is a fresh conceptual lens; geothermal hope sprouting from the very spire that menaces is elegant reversal. Premise transforms post-apocalyptic survival trope into epistemic quest. Risk-taking modest—structure conventional—but specificity of craft keeps it memorable. No close echoes; synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
