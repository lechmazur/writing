<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira’s contradictory impulses—burning portraits yet secretly preserving ash—are dramatized in charcoal-smeared micro-choices; her final lie-by-omission to Cassius is earned by the gallery’s long habit of vanishing. Cost is felt when she pockets the ash she swears to scatter, foreclosing her own creed. Interiority stays concrete: “powdered hands” vs “soot-stained ones” shows the split. Voice remains single, steady; no occupational drift.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the stopped rocker + Mira’s secret ash-hoard crystallize the gallery’s real rule—nothing vanishes, everything transforms—with undeniable conceptual cost. Causal chain holds: each portrait burn → ash → secret mask; Cassius’s dying request → Mira’s vow → immediate betrayal. Orientation anchor (“gallery’s center room”) appears by line 6; no debt. Lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of burn/rebuild tightens meaning until final image reweights the premise.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Gallery is evoked through tactile art verbs—charcoal dust, porcelain shards, exhaust vents—rather than visual catalog. Rocking chair serves as micro-setting: its decrescendo tracks mortal pressure and dictates Mira’s speed. “Soot-stained palms” body-tool link constrains her touch-based craft. No weather clichés; spatial choreography clean as she moves from easel to chair to back-room kiln. Setting could charge final image more if ash-flow were spatially tied to chair, but still earns high specificity.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—permanence vs obliteration—signaled in line 1. Escalation is density-driven: each new portrait layer thickens the lie, tightening the cost of discovery. Micro-turn when Cassius asks “Will you scatter this one too?” forces on-page false promise; option to confess is foreclosed. Price is conceptual but visible: Mira must live as keeper of the very permanence she denounces. Could use one tangible loss (broken kiln filter, expended shard) to raise band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges from iterated burn/rebuild cycle rather than assertion; final image of two masks side-by-side reweights “vanishing” as secret archive. Subtext in gesture: Mira’s soot-stained kneel replaces verbal apology. No moralizing line; ambiguity remains—reader must decide if her betrayal is mercy or theft. “Mirage of safety” stays implicit, charged by the ash she will not release. Insight earned: permanence as the ultimate contraband.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is tactile, carbon-dark, with rhythmic cadence matching rocker’s slow stall. Compression taught early: “charcoal portrait ash scatterer” is unpacked through action, not glossary. No head-hop; single POV holds. Dialogue sparse, whispered, indirection-rich: “Tell me something true” carries death’s imperative without sentiment. Register stays within artist-hand lexicon; no corporate drift. Final sentence’s “gathering her porcelain shards” echoes opening image, closing sonic loop.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary length to mimic breathing stall; no template cadence. High information density: one line often layers soot, ash, and moral taint. Metaphors are coherent—rocker as metronome of dying—no mixed vehicles. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances ash or porcelain state. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image. Minor filter verbs appear (“she understood why”) but are character-appropriate reflection, not dilution.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Premise—clandestine ash-archive inside an anti-permanence gallery—feels fresh yet inevitable. Burn-to-mask alchemy turns familiar grief craft into contraband art. Risk: secret preservation of ashes could feel gimmick, but is grounded in Mira’s first-hand contradiction. No trope recycling; “vanishing point” redefined as covert horizon of lasting fragments. Transformation test: story collapses if ash is actually scattered. Specific detail (powdered charcoal into palm) prevents generic overlay.</comment>
