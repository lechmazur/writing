<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is specific and embodied: the brass pull cupped in her palm, the cold wall grooves, the decision to “untether from the narratives.” The single contradiction—professional calm versus personal guilt—drives every micro-choice; the final resolve to demand hidden histories is earned by the tactile ritual with the drawer pull. No stock phrasing; even “space between apology and forgiveness” is immediately grounded as physical territory. Voice stays individual; no diagnostic self-talk.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: because the drawer pull exists, Mara confronts incomplete truths; therefore she and Chen agree to swap classified histories next moon. Orientation anchored by line 3; one seamless scene; closure is a Decisive Change plus Resonant Reconfiguration—the brass object literally passes hands, foreclosing the old negotiation frame while reweighting “neutral territory” as shared moral ground. Cost is visible: both diplomats risk treason by demanding truth.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Storm-worn parapet is not backdrop; the slick stone forces Mara to brace her body against the wall, the moonlit mist dictates the clandestine rhythm. Micro-setting rule met: the brass drawer pull functions as portable “home” wreckage, constraining the choice to confess partial histories. Sensory hierarchy obeys negotiator priorities—she clocks wind direction before emotional temperature. Spatial choreography clean; no floating bodies.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prevent war via truth-exchange—signaled early and tightened when both admit their governments lied. One meaningful escalation: mutual revelation of covered-up atrocities narrows their options to either collude on truth or return to liars’ deadlock. Agency resides in the joint decision to risk espionage for honesty; cost is the implied death sentence if exposed. Pressure coherent under causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges from gesture, not thesis: a tarnished household fixture becomes the vocab for diplomacy. Subtext in silence—side-by-side stance, no face-off—performs neutrality better than label. Final image of moon “indifferent to borders” conceptually reweights earlier motif of “neutral territory,” offering non-literal answer: sovereignty is transient, salvage is human. No moralizing paragraph.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays inside Mara’s perceptual signature: moonlight “transforms tarnish into something almost beautiful” reads through her need for hope. Syntax mirrors wind-gust rhythm—long sentence, em-dash splice, clipped dialogue. No head-hopping; Chen’s interior accessed only by Mara’s inference. Filter verbs minimal and purposeful. Dialogue indirection—“Next moon” carries treaty and threat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Read-aloud ear test passes: sentence length modulates with mist density, no template cadence. Information-dense lines carry triple duty—e.g., “storms had stripped away all pretense of ownership” fuses setting, politics, theme. Zero paraphrase loops; no mixed metaphors. Strong verbs—“cupped,” “crushed,” “teetered”—replace modifiers. Opening and final lines frame voice and re-charge object.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Freshest angle: using lunar timetable as diplomatic protocol—an organic, non-gimmicky constraint. Drawer pull salvaged from civilian rubble repurposed as negotiation token transforms familiar peace-process template. Synthesis of personal artifact + celestial rhythm feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk taken with quiet, no-handshake ending; pays off via Charged Poise. No close echoes of famous scenes.</comment>
