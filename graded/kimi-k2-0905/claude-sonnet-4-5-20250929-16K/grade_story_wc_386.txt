<comment>Maya’s interiority is rich—her perceptual filter (“diving-callused palms,” “borrowed starlight”) individuates her—but her decisive turn to contact the archives is declared rather than dramatized, softening the cost of her promise to the captain. The trait “wreck-diver ghost whisperer” appears early and shapes her nightly ritual, yet no contradictory impulse tests her in-scene; she moves from comprehension to action without friction, so the renunciation feels pre-ordained. Still, her embodied emotion and micro-choices under glacial pressure keep her convincingly singular.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the captain’s “windows of connection” are acknowledged, the data’s survival path is secured, and Maya carries “smoke and the captain’s peace” upward—cost is felt in the glacial dark she must re-enter alone. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: candle-by-candle density builds until the melted snow globe reweights meaning; no causal reversals are needed. Orientation is clean—who/where/when anchored by line 3. Only the slightest off-stage convenience (ghost-networked dream reports find her) keeps this from 9+.</comment>

<comment>The glacier shrine is more than postcard: ice walls “that had never seen the sun” constrain oxygen, candle heat, and bodily endurance; the warped glass’s “amber” glycerin mirrors fossilized data, charging the final image. Spatial choreography is immaculate—17 candles track 17 dreams, each wick a beacon in a coherent three-dimensional vault. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven: diesel-tinged bathwater, frozen eyelashes, the globe’s strange warmth—details a diver-tuned sensorium would seize. Environment directly guides the choice to dive again, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—salvaging the truth of a dying planet—tightens once: Maya decodes the dream pattern and commits to resurfacing the logs. Escalation is Accumulative: each candle adds spectral evidence, narrowing possibilities until only the archival act remains; cost is the captain’s death, now borne by Maya as solitary messenger. No reversal is needed under this lens, but the pressure plate would feel sharper if the institution’s resistance or her own bodily risk were hinted.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges obliquely: ghosts haunt “edges of consciousness,” not places—an insight earned through concrete dream triangulation rather than assertion. The final aurora image reweights “borrowed starlight” as cosmic data traveling impossible distances, fusing personal loss with planetary grief. No moral is stated; the reader is left to feel that some truths demand surrogate survivors. Ambiguity lingers cleanly: Maya’s triumph is also an inheritance of mourning.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</question>
<comment>Third-person hovers at Maya’s shoulder, never leaking into ghost-mind; perceptual signature is consistent—“diesel-tasting bathwater” is exactly the synesthetic cross-wiring a diver would note. Rhythm modulates: long breathy sentences for descent, staccato for dream fragments. No dialogue, so voice purity remains un-contested. Filter verbs appear sparingly and only where POV uncertainty is thematic (“she sensed”), not mechanical.</comment>

<comment>Prose is dense yet fluid: “glacier shrine each night, carrying the weight of other people’s sleep” does triple duty—ritual frequency, vocational calling, metaphoric burden. No loops; each sentence advances knowledge or atmosphere. Occasional elevated diction (“crystallized testament”) drifts half a register above Maya’s likely lexicon, a hairline slip that nicks immediacy at the climax. Otherwise, cadence breathes with candle-flick tempo, and metaphors stay physically coherent.</comment>

<comment>The synthesis—“wreck-diver who harvests dreams of the drowned to rescue climate data”—feels inevitable yet wholly fresh; no trope template matches it. Risk lies in the quiet ending, eschewing antagonist or external obstacle, yet coherence holds. Specificity of the Katerina’s unpublished research grounds the concept in real stakes. The melted snow globe as both talisman and data fossil is a stroke of particularized wonder that would collapse if swapped.</comment>
