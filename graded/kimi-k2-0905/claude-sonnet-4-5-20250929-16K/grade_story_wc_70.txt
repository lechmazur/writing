<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Mira’s blunt-truth tic is dramatized early and shapes the encounter; her solitary vigil, tactile attention to puddles and tower shadows, and the trembling choice to climb give us embodied interiority. The beekeeper’s veiled authority is sketched in two beats, enough to pressure Mira without violating single-POV focus. The final ascent is a micro-choice that visibly costs her isolation and forecloses her old stoic routine—earned, on-page. No internal contradiction is shown in-scene, so the missing 9+ hinge is the absence of a second conflicting impulse under peak pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: blackout → drone failure → woman’s riddle → pollen solution; each step tightens Mira’s options. Orientation (who/where/when) is locked by line 4; tower, toll booth, amber dusk serve immediate action. Closure is a Decisive Change: Mira speaks truth that rewrites city protocol, feels the cost in her trembling climb and relinquished gate. Cost is on-page (“Her hands trembled…”) and persists—she cannot return to mute toll-keeping.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Lightning tower as micro-setting constrains every beat: copper warmth, spiral stairs, amber shadows that cue time of day. The lacquer box’s bee-flower motif reweights from mystery to toolkit at closure. Sensory economy favors tactile heat, honey light, silk nest—never catalog. Spatial choreography is clean: gate-counter exchange, vertical climb, rooftop capacitor bay all track without drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</question><comment>Dominant stake—restore pollination—signaled at woman’s first line. One meaningful deepening: riddle forces Mira to reinterpret “failure” as design flaw, not accident; this narrows her path to vocal intervention. Cost is visible: she abandons seven-year solitude, risks ridicule by engineers. Escalation is causal under Causal lens; no coincidence resolves the drones.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from accumulated images of amber, nectar, pollen, dusk—sun without heat, dance without legs. No explicit thesis; final “dancing” drones reprice efficiency itself. Subtext in woman’s silence and Mira’s involuntary speech pits organic messiness against engineered purity. Ambiguity lingers: will random flight scale, or is this only a poetic patch?</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-limited stays tight to Mira’s sensorium: geometric shadows, lacquer gleam, tremor in hands. Diction is precise but modest—“nectar-colored dusk” is the single lyrical flare, earned by prior amber repetitions. No head-hop; beekeeper’s motives remain opaque, preserving distance. Rhythm accelerates up spiral stairs, mirroring breath.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; long sentence opens, clipped clauses climb. High info density: “copper coils still warm” fuses time lapse and tech detail. No loops or scaffold; “amber” recurs with shifting referents (sky, dusk, pollen) rather than churn. Metaphors stay coherent—no mixed vehicles. Opening and final lines anchor and recharge motif cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Riddle-as-key, involuntary truth as plot engine, and pollinator drones form a fresh synthesis; each element requires the others. Amber/nectar color motif grows specific to this world rather than generic sunset. Risk taken: quiet resolution via pollen vials, not heroic sabotage—stakes remain local, believable. Transformation test fails if tower becomes wind turbine and bees become birds, confirming specificity.</comment>
