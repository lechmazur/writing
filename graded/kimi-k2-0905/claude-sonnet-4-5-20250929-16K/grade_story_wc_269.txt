<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Maya’s compulsive tapping and scientist’s vigil are concrete and particular; the knot of grief-professional duty feels lived-in. Interiority stays anchored to sensory cues (rail, desk, glass) rather than abstract labels. The final renunciation—abandoning the modern current map for the atlas—carries credible cost because we’ve watched her fingers drum out the old tidal code all along. Micro-choices (pulling the page to the light, taping it to the window) enact the shift, earning the quiet epiphany.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the atlas page reweights the whole surveillance enterprise, making “recovery” a return to pre-industrial flow, not a kitschy triumph. Causal linkage holds: because she notices the tapping-tide overlap, she reframes the data, therefore she swaps maps—cost is the surrender of her long-used modern overlay. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern recognition and cadence shift rather than external plot reversals—and the lens is taught early and held to the final image. No orientation debt; anchoring (who/where/when) is clear by line 30.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Station stilts, sunrise angle, and the ripped atlas function as micro-setting objects that constrain choice: she can only tape the page where glass catches dawn light, making the gesture irreversible. Sensory hierarchy is scientist-practical—temperature readouts, current overlays—never tourist catalog. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly: railing → desk → window → headset exchange. Environment supplies the final image (station swaying but moored) that literalises “drifting moored” and charges closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—professional obligation to interpret ocean change—tightens when her existing predictive model collapses; the atlas offers a costly alternative path (abandon modern overlay). Escalation is intellectual, not action-adventure: each datum strip subtracts certainty until the old map becomes the only viable lens. Agency is decision/renunciation rather than external confrontation; price is surrender of career-long framework—visible when she tapes atlas over screen. Coincidence absent; pressure is internal-consistency of pattern recognition.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges as “recovery is not rewind but remembrance”—ocean and scientist jointly slough off anthropogenic rerouting. No thesis statements; meaning accrues via the atlas’s dated currents and the bleaching-dots that now read as adaptation attempts, not mere loss. Final image (station swaying while fixed) offers resonant, non-literal answer: progress means learning to drift within ancient moorings. Ambiguity stays productive—reader left to question whether coral will truly remember—avoiding moralising.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Maya’s perceptual tics: numerically coded tides, salt-metal smell, rhythm-counting. Diction is scientist-lean but never jargon-drunk; “gardens of color” and “empty blue corridors” show lyric reach without purple overflow. Dialogue fragment with Jin carries subtext of mutual monitoring rather than information dump. No head-hop; psychic distance compresses naturally under data-pull tension.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm mirrors tidal ebb: clusters of short percussive clauses, then longer reflective cadences. Information density high—“migration routes…vanished next, leaving only empty blue corridors where whale songs should echo” does three jobs in one line. No scaffold loops; “three-two” refrain is purposeful pattern, not artifact. Figurative language sparse and precise; mixed-metaphor zero count. Final paragraph earns its graceful periodic sentence that lands the conceptual turn.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: climate-recovery tale that rejects heroic restoration in favor of oceanic deep-time memory; atlas-as-talisman feels novel, not eco-token. Tapping-code as personal algorithm linked to tidal pulse is a risk that pays off by crystallising the reveal. No derivative near-echoes; premise would not survive transplant to another biome without core collapse. Voice-level specificity (Coral Sea 2015, bleaching dot-sequence) grounds universals in unrepeatable particulars.</comment>
