<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is vivid—“I forgot how to feel until I found proof that others did” is a sharp, embodied turn—but her professional training never once complicates or resists the ritual; the inspector persona is announced yet never exerts pressure, so the final self-crowning feels pre-approved rather than earned through flaw or struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the report recommendation and self-crowning reconfigure Mara's duty→hope stance with visible cost (she breaks protocol). Accumulative lens holds: each shell/pearl adds density until the final image glows. The 120-word orientation anchor is met; no causal break.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Crystal topology and shell acoustics constrain the ritual; the caves’ latent glow literally charges the final image. Selective sensory filtering—headlamp facets, nautilus curve catching breath-light—anchors POV. Spatial choreography is clean; no white-room syndrome. Environment directly supplies the “resource” (radiance) that enables the crowning image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—whether Mara will uphold bureaucratic detachment or embrace communal vulnerability—emerges late (after shell discovery) but tightens decisively when she edits her report. One visible cost: she forfeits Commission protocol, placing her badge-weight behind preservation. Pressure accumulates rather than reverses; sufficient under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically from concrete ritual objects; no abstract sermon. The re-priced “world keeps beginning” lands via image, not dictum. Subtextual tension between inspection and intimacy is sustained through object handling rather than stated. Final line offers resonant, non-literal answer to fear-of-ending question.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited maintains tight psychic distance; perceptual signature—“frozen prayers,” “geometric hearts”—is character-specific and consistent. No head-hopping. Rhythm modulates: longer reflective sentences in circle versus clipped report cadence at close. Filter verbs are minimal; diction stays within inspector’s plausible lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>High information density: single sentences fuse setting, object, and emotional charge—“caught the cave’s latent radiance.” No scaffold loops or mixed metaphors. Minor register lift in “conceptual repricing” phrase, but it aligns with Commission voice. Final image syntax is clean, propulsive.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: bunker-as-temple, inspection-as-initiation. Cultivated pearl re-cast as coronation crown grows inevitable from grit→irritation logic. Risk taken with quiet, lyric closure pays off by reweighting kitsch “doomsday prep” into communal rebirth. Specific cave acoustics and nautilus spiral mechanics prevent swap-out.</comment>
