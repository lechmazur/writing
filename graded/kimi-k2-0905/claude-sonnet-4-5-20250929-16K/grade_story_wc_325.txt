<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Claustrophobia is shown through throat-closing and narrowing vision, but the interiority drifts into abstract “weight she felt in her bones” rather than body-specific immediacy. The contradiction—spelunker afraid of enclosed spaces—remains stated, never exploited for a beat where her skill actually worsens her panic. Micro-choices (sealing the pack, powering the station) are present yet feel functional, not value-hierarchy exposing. Closure cost is conceptual rather than embodied; the earned stasis is clean but the physical price of returning to terror is off-stage.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: sister’s disappearance → Maya’s return → data download → codex glow. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 3; no penalty. One meaningful tightening at the tide breach (water under the door) visibly forecloses escape options. Closure is Charged Poise: “Tomorrow she would return again” crystallizes cyclical cost. Persistent constraint (tide clock) shapes every move; cost is conceptual—perpetual exposure to panic—but legible in the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Facility-as-carcass metaphor is sustained, tactile, and filters through Maya’s spelunker gaze: “barnacled walls and rusted walkways like the ribs of some ancient creature.” Gold-flecked codex functions as micro-setting that constrains the final beat—its conductivity literally illuminates the exit. Spatial choreography clean: four descending levels, narrowing corridors, single junction room. Tide re-entry supplies live environmental pressure that forces departure; setting charges the ending image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recover sister’s erased truth—signaled early. Escalation under causal lens: anomaly patterns → consciousness hypothesis → erased researchers → Maya’s vow. One visible price: tide returning early forecloses thorough salvage, demands immediate retreat. Agency is endurance/attention rather than defeat of antagonist; still narrows future options by committing her to infinite return cycles.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of remembering the erased emerges through images—codex gold, drowned names, cyclical descent—not exposition. Subtext in “invisible things... using humanity’s own neural pathways against them” reframes cable grid as parasitic memory. Final line offers resonant non-moral answer: “Some acts of remembering required descent into the very spaces that terrified you most.” Avoids explicit moral; ambiguity lingers in whether witnessing is futile defiance or slow suicide.</comment>

<comment>Third-person limited stays tightly interior; perceptual signature is geological and electromagnetic—“crashing hush,” “electromagnetic whispers”—never drifting into generic thriller diction. Rhythm modulates: long sentence for descent claustrophobia, staccato clause when tide surprises. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk zero. Filter verbs minimal; phrase “vision narrow” is embodied, not diagnostic. Final image cadence mirrors opening metaphor, completing circular voice architecture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty: “water dripped from the ceiling in a rhythm like failing breath” marries sound to mortal stakes. Metaphor density peaks at two per paragraph but pattern is taught early and maintained, avoiding overwrite. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence adds new sensor or causal bit. Minor scaffold: “phase transitions” repeated thrice with identical noun phrase—could vary syntax. Closure sentence clean, no mixed metaphor, strong verb “spoke again.”</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fusion of medieval codex + undersea cable horror + claustrophobic tide-mill creates fresh conceptual space. Illuminated manuscript as electromagnetic map re-weights familiar treasure-hunt into epistemic haunting. Risk of cyclic return structure could feel repetitive yet mirrors tidal mechanics, making form serve concept. Derivative echo (Annihilation’s drowned chamber) is present but transformed through sister-specific stakes and DIY data archaeology. Final reconfiguration—witnessing as loyalty—feels inevitable yet non-obvious.</comment>
