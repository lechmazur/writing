<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Vesper’s immortal boredom is textured through lived detail—“seventeen thousand solar cycles,” “funeral after funeral”—but her interior contradiction is stated, not dramatized in-scene; the final step toward “spaces beyond goodbye” shows a micro-choice, yet the cost is more conceptual than corporeal, keeping the arc just shy of full pay-off.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure is an earned Resonant Reconfiguration: the magnetic staircase crystallizes a before/after in Vesper’s existential stance with undeniable conceptual cost. Causality is mostly steady, but orientation wobbles: “eastern wall suddenly opened” is a spatial leap without intermediate cue, and the dimensional rule-set is revealed retroactively, nudging the lens toward Accumulative rather than pure Causal.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The prismatic escondite and fragment act as micro-setting, directly shaping Vesper’s dimensional sight and the climax’s staircase; auroras and salt-from-elsewhere are vivid, selective, POV-filtered. Spatial anchors hold, though “three dimensions sideways” compresses scale. Final image re-weights the sanctuary as threshold, not backdrop.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—what lies after goodbye—arrives early; spatial mutiny supplies escalating pressure via corridor-opening and fragment-burn. One meaningful tightening: the staircase appears with a visible “hours” countdown, narrowing options. Cost is conceptual rather than tangible, adequate for length, though tension peaks in image, not visceral risk.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: immortality’s curse is not endless life but endless not-knowing; the final image re-prices “goodbye” as transition, not termination. Avoids moralizing; ambiguity (are the dead reachable?) lingers. Subtext lives in objects—fragment, staircase—rather than explicit statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person distant stays stable; diction—“prismatic escondite,” “spatial mutiny”—is elevated yet consistent with an ancient intellect. Perceptual signature is selective, cosmic, slightly weary. Syntax modulates with pressure: short pulses at the staircase, long lyrical coils in reflection. No head-hop or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Lyric density is high, but metaphor logic stays coherent; no contradictory vehicles. A few template cadences—“the fragment burned. / Vesper stood … the fragment burned hotter”—create rhythmic stack, yet repetition is pattern-taught, paying off in final pulse. Information dense, largely propulsive; minor scaffold in “magnetic fields were creating…” constructions.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Fusion of solar-storm physics with dimensional insurrection feels fresh; immortal-as-detective of death’s geography is non-obvious. Specific cosmology—“spaces where time ran differently”—anchors abstraction in lived rule-set. Risky lyric escalations pay off without obscuring clarity; avoids stock immortal tropes beyond the premise itself.</comment>
