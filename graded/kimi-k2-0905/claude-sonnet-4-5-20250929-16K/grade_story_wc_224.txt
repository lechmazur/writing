<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Isla’s interior contradiction—yearning to forget yet nightly returning to the stone—drives every beat; the feather-touch breakthrough is credibly foreshadowed by her mercury-glass habit. Emotions stay embodied (“cool mercury glass,” “hollow ache”) without label-speak. Final renunciation of exile-identity carries visible cost: she surrenders the safety of forgetting and accepts the pain of memory. Micro-choices (pressing palms, tracing grooves) reveal value hierarchy: memory > pain > erasure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the stone’s final symbol reweights “home” from fixed valley to portable practice, cost felt in the audible quieting of the thunder-grief. Accumulative lens holds: every texture-read memory layers density until the cadence shift (“belonging is what you carry”) crystallizes options. No orientation debt; mountain-bookstore, night-cycle, and three-year span are anchored by word 80. Persistent constraint—language must be touched, not seen—shapes tactics and final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Mountain-bookstore is not postcard backdrop but navigational crucible: seventeen turns, poetry corridors, and greenhouse level supply the only path to the stone and later the only soil for seeding the book-textures. Ventilation shaft delivers the feather as causal aperture, not coincidence. Micro-setting of stone grooves plus feather barbs constrains the breakthrough beat. Final reprise of “spring rain” outside recharges the terraced-valley memory, locking setting to theme.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can Isla bear the cost of remembering?—tightens when tactile reading forces the choice: keep amnesia’s comfort or reclaim exile’s pain. Agency drives escalation: her decision to trace the stone via feather ignites memories that narrow options; retreat is impossible once drought images return. Visible price paid: the thunder-grief that had been “constant” audibly quiets, proving the emotional tax. Coincidence (falling feather) complicates but does not resolve; resolution comes from her stance crystallization.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</question><comment>Theme emerges organically: home as portable practice seeded through touch-language. No thematic echo—final symbol is read by texture, not stated. Recurring “seed” image shifts from loss (scattered people) to agency (planting new book) without authorial comment. Ambiguity is preserved: new home will differ from the valley, exact shape left charged but open.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays lashed to Isla’s perceptual bias: books “grew like mineral deposits,” grief “a hidden thunder.” Syntax lengthens during memory flood, then shortens at decision (“She descended…”). No dialogue, so voice coherence judged through interior metaphor; mercury-glass and feather motifs remain consistent. Free-indirect “she understood—this wasn’t merely writing” slips cleanly into her recovered idiom.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero boilerplate; no paraphrase loops or template cadence. Sentence rhythm accelerates through enjambed clauses during memory rush, then slows to final declarative. Figurative language stays accurate: feather barbs “catching on carved grooves” is tactile and precise. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image (“new words were already beginning to sprout”) that recharges earlier seed motif.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fusion of tactile language with exile-recovery is fresh; no prior template matches “reading stone through feather texture.” Mountain-bookstore as living archive plus greenhouse library feels inevitable yet surprising. Risky compression of three years into accumulative shards pays off by mirroring memory-geode structure. Transformation test fails—names/places could not swap without shattering texture-based logic.</comment>
