<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Vessa’s motive—mercy that costs truth—holds across every beat; the steel-hands/sparrow-egg contradiction is dramatized, not declared. The final renunciation (pocketing the tessera) is the direct culminative payoff of her augmented gentleness and her commander’s guilt. No interior label-speak; the emotional arithmetic stays messy and embodied. Micro-choices (kneeling, prying, pocketing) visibly enact the hierarchy of values under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a perfect Charged Poise: the plaza will bear Davos’s name while Vessa alone carries the contradictory truth, cost felt in the weight of the stolen shard. Causal chain never breaks: retrocognition → revelation → internal conflict → quiet sabotage. Lens is causal throughout; each beat narrows her moral options until the final refusal to speak. Orientation locked by word 30; shattered sky + mosaic cue anchor time and place instantly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Shattered sky and plaza mosaic are not backdrop but tactical instruments: the cracked glass sound-track underscores the knife-edge tension, while the tessera’s physical fracture is the literal trigger for retrocognition. Micro-setting (single stepping-stone) constrains the entire conflict. Sensory economy obeys Vessa’s prosthetic sensors—temperature differential, tremor calibration—so every detail is POV-filtered. Final image reuses both environment and object to crystallize the new moral configuration.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—shield survivors’ need for hero vs. personal need for honesty—tightens the moment she touches the tessera; each vision escalates the cost of either choice. One clear reversal: decision to expose → decision to conceal, paid for by breaking the mosaic link. Price is legible: she forfeits both justice and the community’s possible catharsis, keeping the burden in her steel hand. Agency remains hers; no external coincidence resolves the tension.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through the impossible moral math of “aberrant mercy”: acknowledging atrocity yet choosing collective hope. No character articulates the thesis; the idea is performed when Vessa pockets the guilt-evidence. Final image—shattered sky finding “temporary harmony”—reweights the entire story without stating a moral. Ambiguity is purposeful: reader must decide whether her mercy is cowardice or civil grace.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays welded to Vessa’s perceptual gear: temperature-calibrated palms, tremor sensors, retrocognitive flickers. Syntax is metallic-lyric, mirroring the prosthetic/grace duality: “warm coldness,” “cradle empathy in arms of steel.” No filter-verb stacks; metaphors are clean and consistent (glass-sky, mosaic-memory). Voice modulates under pressure—short, clause-sparse sentences during vision beats, then longer cadence for moral reckoning.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is lean yet textured; every sentence advances knowledge or atmosphere. No paraphrase loops, no scaffold. Figurative language is sparse and purposeful—two extended metaphors (sky as cracked glass, guilt as tessera) that pay off at closure. Opening and final lines act as symmetrical brackets anchoring voice and stakes. Micro-rhythm breathes with escalation: clipped fragments during retrocognitive flashes, expansive syntax during ethical reflection.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fusion of post-cybernetic body-mod culture with ancient-site retrocognition feels inevitable, not grafted. “Gentle radical” is a fresh inflection in the prosthetic-warrior trope; mercy as aberrant而非redemptive subverts expectation. Conceptual risk—withholding justice from a war-crime revelation—pays off in moral complexity that lingers. Specificity (blue tessera, torch order, plaza renaming ceremony) prevents universalized anywhere setting.</comment>
