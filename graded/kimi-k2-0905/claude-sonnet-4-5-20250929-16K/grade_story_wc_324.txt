<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Mara’s “persistently curious” trait is repeatedly named but never dramatized through risky trade-offs or visible cost; her interiority is vivid (“chest tighten”) yet stays aligned with a single emotional register. The final beat—realising the call is a warning—rings as a knowledge leap rather than a contradictory impulse acted out. Because no micro-choice visibly forecloses a path for her (she simply phones authorities), the earned-change bar for 9+ isn’t cleared. Still, her perceptual signature holds, and the young voice’s vulnerability tightens her mission credibly.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands cleanly: the hearing-aid silence signals message delivered, and Elena’s live rescue reweights all prior pulses with undeniable cost to Mara’s archive of “quieted devices.” Causal chain—pulse → trace → warning → find girl—holds under the inferred causal lens; no teleporting facts. The “reeling hush” tone answers the twilight rule, offering a Charged-Poise exit rather than mechanical wrap-up. A half-step shy of 9 because the protagonist’s own stakes never narrow; she risks nothing tangible beyond curiosity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Mist-clad atrium is more than scenery: its glass walls “pressing…like something trying to get out” mirror the dead boy’s urgency and Mara’s containment of voices. The decades-old hearing aid acts as micro-setting—every temperature shift grounds us inside her tactile process. Space stays coherent across the single scene; potted ferns “lean toward secrets,” an image that quietly prefaces the later reveal of voices leaning on her. Setting thus constrains and charges the final quiet image, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—deliver vulnerable last words—tightens when the pulse shifts from routine to life-saving, a meaningful escalation under causal lens. Pressure is coherent: each deeper listen makes the device hotter, time narrows with Elena flagged suicidal, and Mara’s agency (illegal record dive, urgent call) drives the reversal. Cost is visible—Mara’s hands shake, the aid burns—but the price is borne by Elena’s safety, not by Mara’s own foreclosed path, keeping it just below high-band. Still, one clear intensification satisfies length-appropriate demand.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of unheard voices inheres in the literal device rather than an appliquéd moral; the final image of “quieted devices” stored like hearts reconfigures listener-as-archivist without sermon. Subtext lives in gesture—photograph duplicate, Ferris-wheel stance—allowing reader to feel transmission rather than be told meaning. Incidental heroism emerges through action, not label, satisfying complexity. Only a hair of sentiment drifts in “he loved her until the very end,” preventing perfect 9.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Mara’s perceptions; no head-hop. Diction—“electromagnetic signatures of grief”—sounds like her professional lexicon, maintaining POV plausibility. Rhythm modulates: longer clauses when she listens, staccato phone lines when she acts. Voice remains distinct and purposeful under pressure; experimental elision absent, so no deductions.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and sensory-dense: “device trembled with a rhythm” does double duty (object + emotion). No scaffold loops; each sentence advances knowledge or atmosphere. Figurative language is spare, avoiding metaphor clutter at climax. A lone “seemed to” hedge on ferns is microscopic; clarity, propulsion, and ear-test pass near-flawlessly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Contact-tracer for post-mortem heartbeats is a fresh supernatural slot; coupling it with obsolete hearing-aid tech feels specific and inevitable. The photograph reprise at abandoned carnival avoids mere symbol by becoming geographical rescue map. Risk—illegal hospital breach—supports stakes without gimmick. Premise could drift to shtick, yet grief authenticity grounds it, earning the high-band bump.</comment>
