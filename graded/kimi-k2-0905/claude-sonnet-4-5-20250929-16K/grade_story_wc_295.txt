<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mira’s interior contradiction—dream-worker drawn to hard science—surfaces early and powers the final collaboration, but the “healing voice” is asserted more than dramatized. Kove’s guilt is concrete in the telegram scene; his micro-choice to stay and share data earns the shift. No stock labels, emotions stay body-anchored. The cost—Chen’s death, their joint years ahead—is felt, though Mira’s flaw-to-action chain could be one beat tighter.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal lattice holds: variable-star pattern → Chen’s solitude → telegram → shared data → harmonic decoding. The telegram’s arrival is the motivated hinge that forces Kove’s confession; the dawn realization reconfigures their future with undeniable conceptual cost. Orientation is clean by word 80; no teleporting props. Closure lands as Charged Poise: they face “years more” together, path foreclosed from solo science.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Observatory is lived-in: dome motors, red night-lights, eyepiece breath-fog. Winter mountain cold noses into skin and metal, guiding the decision to stay inside and talk. Telescope and telegram function as micro-settings that constrain choice—no single observer can hold the data. Final image of converging starlight fuses place and theme without overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—decode versus survive obsession—is signaled in paragraph one and tightens when Kove admits he “can’t” watch another death. The harmonic realization is the single meaningful deepening that reweights options: collaboration becomes necessity, not virtue. No fake reversals; coincidence only complicates (telegram found now). Visible price: fifteen lost years, future years pledged.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme—knowledge requires shared witness—emerges from star patterns, not exposition. Subtext in Kove’s trembling fingers and the brittle petals carries guilt better than any apology. Final image of converging light reweights earlier solitude without moralizing. Daylily telegram serves as silent irony: the invitation Chen never received becomes the one they finally accept.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays snugly in Mira’s perceptual filter: “celestial breath,” “daylily rust-color” are her translator’s metaphors. Psychic distance tightens under stress—sentence fragments appear when she sees the harmonic overlay. Kove’s dialogue is distinct: shorter, more staccato, scientific diction fraying into grief. No filter-verb padding; free indirect style stays clean.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Prose breathes with scene tempo: long clauses for slow tracking, clipped fragments at telescope epiphany. Metaphors stay consistent—stars as language, light as breath—no mixed vehicles. One scaffold spotted: “shared burdens” is repeated in narration and then quoted by Kove; trimming the second would sharpen. Otherwise high density, zero paraphrase loops, strong verbs anchor every sentence.</comment>

<grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Fusion of lucid-dream chronicler with hard-science star mapping is fresh; variable-star language as temporal code avoids stock first-contact tropes. Telegram pressed with daylilies offers tactile specificity unseen elsewhere. The harmonic decoding requires two lifetimes—an elegant, non-obvious constraint. Slight risk hedging: retreat to gentle dawn solidarity rather than darker cost keeps it from full 9-band boldness.</comment>
