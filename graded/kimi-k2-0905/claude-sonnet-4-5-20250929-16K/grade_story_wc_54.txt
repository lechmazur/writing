<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Maya’s curiosity-to-action arc is legible, but her “functional creativity” is asserted rather than dramatized in key beats; the interiority drifts into thesis-speak (“puzzle out new equations for hope”). The renunciation of carnival transience for rooted stewardship lands as a resonant reconfiguration—yet the cost (lost mobility, institutional friction) is only implied, not felt on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: discovery of sextant → mapping flows → redirecting them → community resurrection. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the sextant plaque reweights the terminal from abandonment to navigation point; the visible cost is the irrevocable conversion of departure gates into gardens, but the lens stays Accumulative/Textural—no single decisive act, only steady flow realignment.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Spaceport carcass is tactile—trampled grass, ghost calliope, broken skylights that “let in precisely the right amount of rain.” The northwest water-stain map and dead batteries constrain her retrofit choices; the sextant’s brass arc charges the final atrium image. Minor imprecision: “ghost-blueprints” is metaphorical surplus that doesn’t guide choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prove adaptive reuse is possible—tightens when permits and volunteers must be recruited; each system redirected (water, heat, solar) forecloses the original aerospace function. No visible personal price (tuition, sleep, reputation) is dramatized, so escalation feels civic rather than visceral; still, the cumulative loss of launch capacity supplies conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through infrastructural metaphor: abandonment vs. cultivation. The sextant’s plaque re-prices “navigation” from outer space to sustenance—an earned, non-moralizing insight. Avoids explicit thesis until the final line, where “quiet, certain, vast as the space stations that had never been” crystallizes the reconfiguration without sermon.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person close stays anchored in Maya’s perceptual filter—engineering gaze maps stains as “existing flows,” sees wetland as circuitry. Syntax is controlled, rhythmic compression in “roots growing in concrete” matches calm final cadence. Distinct diction slips once into corporate—“filed permits, called in favors”—but recovers with tactile immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentences pivot on semicolons to mimic flow redirection. High information density—“dust motes danced in shafts of light piercing the broken skylights” does three jobs. No mixed metaphors, no filter-verb stacks. Final paragraph’s repetition of “vast” is purposeful, not algorithmic.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Freshens the well-trodden “save the ruins” arc by treating ecosystem services as literal navigation: water stains become river blueprints, heat becomes greenhouse. Sextant-as-talisman could feel contrived, yet its antique terrestrial origin links space-age hubris to Age-of-Sail risk, a synthesis that feels inevitable at close. Risk taken: civic stakes over personal, and it pays off.</comment>
