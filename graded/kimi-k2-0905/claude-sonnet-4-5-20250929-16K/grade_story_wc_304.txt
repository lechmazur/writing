<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Kael’s double vocation is never used to create friction or choice; she moves through the ritual without interior contradiction or visible cost. The lucid-watchful trait is named but never complicates her perception or forces a micro-error. Because no secondary character appears, status/relationship crucible bullets are N/A; the lone weakness is that her motive—capture the spark—never meets an on-page obstacle or sacrifice, so the endurance feels frictionless.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the released body carries the infused spark into the dark, reweighting Kael’s vigil. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern-build through aurora, static, and ritual—held without contradiction. Cost is conceptual (another life gone, another spark released), but the price is vicarious rather than personally felt by Kael, so the resonance is luminous rather than wrenching.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The skyborne grotto, aurora light, and emerald chip form a micro-setting triad that actively constrains every beat: altitude dictates breathless hush, aurora supplies the only illumination for pigment choice, the chip is the literal tool of translation. Spatial choreography is immaculate (table descent through floor aperture). Sensory economy—smell of dyed wool recalled, touch of calluses—mirrors weaver’s life without tourism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Single dominant stake: harvest the last spark before obliteration; no external antagonist or reversal, but pressure tightens once as the aurora brightens and the chip clouds—visible sign that the window is closing. Agency is pure attention/ritual precision; cost is off-loaded onto the dead woman rather than Kael, so the tightening is aesthetic, not personal. Sufficient for lyric mode but keeps the score below 8.0.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Theme emerges obliquely: the dignity of being truly seen before erasure. Subtext lives in gesture—positioning the fingers as if still weaving—never sermonized. The aurora’s final green-gold wash reconfigures the earlier color motifs into a wordless answer: identity persists only through another’s lucid witness. No moral is stated; silence carries the after-effect.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Kael’s professional lens; diction (“lucidly watchful,” “threshold of stillness”) is bespoke to her craft. Rhythm tightens during the static-listening paragraph, then loosens into lyrical release, mirroring inhale/exhale of ritual. No dialogue, so voice purity is unbroken. Perceptual signature—reading calluses as biography—remains consistent and particular.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sentences vary from short pulse (“Time contracted.”) to long, aurora-lit clauses without algorithmic pattern. Figurative language is sparse and precise: “static...like constellations” is the only metaphor, taught early and paid off. Zero scaffolding, synonym loops, or filter verbs. The final line’s cadence—“lucidly watchful. Always listening for the patterns.”—achieves Charged Poise without flourish.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fusion of beautician-mortician is fresh; use of aurora as both lighting rig and spiritual gate enlarges the frame. Conceptual risk—quiet ritual without external jeopardy—pays off in mood but stops short of a revelation that redefines Kael. The emerald chip obeys its own logic yet feels like a distilled cousin of familiar soul-catchers, preventing a higher band.</comment>
