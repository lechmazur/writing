<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Mira’s “fool” persona is embodied in micro-choices—cookies, giggles, harmless embroidery—while her interior contradiction (urgent dread vs. forced lightness) stays vivid. The final pivot to warning the palace guard is earned: every prior stitch and eavesdropped silence compounds into a single, costly act of exposure that forecloses her invisible safety. No secondary on-page relationship pressures her, so status crucible is inactive; her solitude is the point. The only drag is a faint hint of author-narration in “wisdom disguised as foolishness,” but it’s brief.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: Mira’s new map (a literal embroidered warning) crystallizes the stakes and reconfigures her role from passive listener to clandestine actor—cost is her lost anonymity, felt in the candle-shadow dance. Causal chain holds: each overheard fragment → stitched star-route → assembled coup pattern → decision to speak, all under an Accumulative lens that tightens density rather than flipping events. Orientation anchors who/where/when within 50 words and never wavers. No lens ambiguity; pattern is taught early and paid off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The eternal candle is handled in every beat: light passes through fabric to reveal hidden constellations, governs work hours, and finally silhouettes Mira’s decisive shadow—its flame literally projects her now-visible danger. Observatory walls fade from cobalt to gray, enacting the same stealth-to-exposure arc. Autumn leaves outside echo the falling-away of secrecy. Micro-setting qualifies and constrains: only by that candle can the reverse-pattern be seen, so the final image is inseparable from the tool.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preventing the coup—emerges gradually but legibly; each cartographic tidbit tightens the noose around the capital. One meaningful deepening occurs when candle-backlight flips the stitched map, turning decor into intelligence and forcing Mira’s hand. Cost is palpable: she forfeits her protective invisibility the instant she decides to “giggle” her warning to the guard captain. Agency is accumulative rather than explosive, fitting the lens, but the shift from passive to active is unmistakable on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of hidden knowledge versus performed ignorance emerges through recurring light/shadow, front/back fabric, and the silence between spoken words—never stated aloud. The final image of Mira stitching a “map of convergence” reweights all prior galaxies as battle plans without moralizing. Subtext in dialogue—scholars’ casual nebula routes, admirals’ travel schedules—carries the real menace. One soft echo: the phrase “adjacent possibilities” edges toward authorial thesis, but it’s embedded in Mira’s own metaphor loop, so it reads as character idiom, not lecture.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person omniscient stays tightly pinned to Mira’s perceptual filter: silver thread, cookie shapes, the way silence “echoes differently.” No head-hop; even the admirals’ motives are inferred only through what she overhears and stitches. Syntax grows shorter under pressure (“Before the coup.”) mirroring her mental snap-to-focus. Free indirect diction (“Adjacent possibilities, Mira thought”) keeps interior texture coherent. The rhythmic repetition of “synchronize” is pattern-taught and paid off, not algorithmic clutter.</comment>
