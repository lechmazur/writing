<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Sera’s interiority is concrete—her fingers stiff from knots, her skin tasted by monarchs—and her micro-choices (gathering wings, threading them, sitting still while proboscises probe) reveal a hierarchy of values without diagnostic label-speak. The flaw–virtue ledger stays balanced: she is competent yet powerless, meticulous yet resigned, and the moment she completes the spiral she accepts the cost of witness over intervention. No contradictory impulses are shown in simultaneous scene; the reflection blocks are anchored but do not tilt present tactics. The renunciation is credible, yet the absence of a second live option keeps the score just below the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the final image of orange wings against orange sky reweights the premise with undeniable conceptual cost—the last migration carries its own ended future. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural; density increases through moth-wing knots until the spiral crystallizes meaning, and the price (Sera’s transient rootedness, the structure’s three-week lifespan) is visible on the page. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no teleporting props or causality breaks occur. The tightening is singular yet sufficient for this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The grotto itself constrains choice: its moss-soft floor accepts dowels, its elevation isolates Sera from intervention, and the aerial garden supplies the only available building material—fallen moth wings. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven; she notices proboscis pressure, wing paper-whisper, amber sunset reflection on orange wings. Spatial choreography is clean across the single scene; weather is static but thematically apt. The setting charges the final image by supplying the only possible palette for the last migration’s witness.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The dominant stake—witness versus rescue of the final migration—is signaled early and tightens once: Sera’s choice to build, not breed, forecloses intervention. Agency is durational (knotting, enduring stillness) rather than reversals; cost is the irreversible surrender of scientific intervention. Escalation is textural: each knotted wing adds weight of extinct histories until the spiral becomes unbearable testament. The price is legible; a second option was never entertained, so the single tightening suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the accumulation of humble wings: extinction deserves witness, not solution. Subtext operates in gesture—knotting death to death—rather than declaration. The final image reweights prior material without moralizing; no character articulates “this is about memory.” Counter-readings linger: is witness enough, or complicity? The spiral’s impermanence enforces the theme that remembrance itself is transient.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Sera’s perceptual signature—esoteric realist diction, precise biological terms, tactile metaphors (“paper made from whispers”). Rhythm modulates: long lyrical sentences for stillness, clipped fragments under knotting fatigue. No head-hopping or register drift; filter verbs serve voice (“she understood what drew her”). The closing sentence mirrors opening cadence, teaching the transient pattern.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High information density: single sentences layer sensory, emotional, and conceptual work (“orange wings against orange sky, carrying their ended future”). Metaphors are coherent—no mixed vehicles—and serve POV bias. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or stakes. Minor scaffold in second paragraph (“She was an esoteric realist by trade and temperament…”) is strategic exposition, not artifact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis—using moth-wing knots to monumentalize the last monarch migration—feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Risk lies in the quiet ending and textural escalation; the payoff is a final image that reconfigures meaning without spectacle. Fresh inflection: extinction memorial built from already-dead moths, not the butterflies themselves. Conceptual integrity holds; no retreat into hope or sentimentality.</comment>
