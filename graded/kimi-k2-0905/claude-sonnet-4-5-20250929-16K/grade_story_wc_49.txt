<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Maera’s interiority is rich—her tactile attentiveness, the “whimsical tinkerer” label, and the quiet cost of her three-year quest all feel embodied. The earned final hush and her decision to let credit remain unnamed show a credible renunciation. Flaws: no second character on-page, so status/relationship pressure is absent; the “golden stories” trait is named twice but never dramatized in a choice. Still, her micro-choices (selecting tendrils, singing cracked-voice) are specific and tied to the remedy’s cost, satisfying the single-POV crucible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The lens is Accumulative/Textural: pressure mounts through pattern (moon + dawn + songs) rather than causal reversals. Anchors (who/where/when) are clear by line 30; no orientation debt. Closure is a Charged Poise: the land “remembers,” the moon fades, and Maera accepts anonymity—conceptual cost is felt. One minor causality wobble: “the land suffered in ways people couldn’t quite name” is asserted, not shown, but it doesn’t break the lyric accumulation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The arbor is not backdrop but instrument: tendrils warm, pulse, glow; dew, moonlight, and birdsong are filtered through Maera’s tinkerer senses. Spatial choreography is clean—her knees, palms, bag, and the vine’s spiral all track. The vine itself functions as micro-setting that constrains the final act of singing. One missed chance: the “scrap-metal butterflies” are mentioned once but never re-enter to charge the ending image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restoring forgotten songs to heal land/spirits—is signaled early and tightened by the moon-dawn deadline. Agency is present: each song increases tendril response, culminating in the golden glow. Cost is conceptual (she will never be credited), but no tangible resource is lost, keeping the price ethereal. Escalation is steady but single-thread; no secondary opposition or reversal beyond the moon’s inevitable fade.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete particulars: erosion of attention, not catastrophe, killed the rites. The final image—people celebrating “without knowing why their hearts felt suddenly fuller”—delivers a quiet CR that reweights the premise. No moralizing; the hush itself is the answer. Subtext is in gesture (winding vine round her hand) and silence withheld from birdsong, not exposition.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person close stays inside Maera’s perceptual filter; diction (“weathered hands,” “fat and amber”) is tactile and tinkerer-specific. Rhythm modulates: longer cadence for reflection, shorter bursts for song urgency. No dialogue, so no voice convergence issue. One micro-drifts: “she spins golden stories” slips into grandmother’s voice without quote marks, but the free-indirect tag is brief and coherent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is lush yet propulsive; figurative density is patterned early (moon as “fat and amber”) and paid off in the golden vine glow. No synonym loops or template cadence; sentence openings vary. Micro-slip: “harvests that nourished bodies but left spirits hollow” is abstract; a sharper image would tighten. Filter verbs minimal; “she felt” appears only when the tactile shift is the point.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Forgotten-songs-as-infrastructure is a fresh angle on eco-fantasy; the vine-instrument concept feels inevitable yet new. Risk: lyric accumulation instead of causal duel could have felt list-like, but the moon-dawn constraint and cracked voice keep stakes intimate. The “golden stories” epithet is transformed from boast to inheritance, a small reweighting that lands. No close echoes of famous scenes; the hush-before-words ending is quiet but memorable.</comment>
