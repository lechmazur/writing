<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Kael’s solitary scholar-hermit register is vivid and consistent; his interiority (“he had been trying to understand…while standing apart”) crystallizes the central contradiction. The only flaw is micro-teleology: the final insight feels slightly pre-ordained because we are told he “understood at last” rather than shown the micro-moments that tip him. Still, the embodied cost—laying down the dictionary as marker—lands as visible forfeiture, satisfying the earned-stasis test.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of recursive language mirrors the spiral concept until the final breath collapses distance. Closure is a textbook Charged Poise—“the walls began to thin…all spiraling toward the same center”—that re-weights every prior image without explanatory dump. Orientation is deliberately disoriented early but repaid when the architecture’s illusion-gradient becomes the literal path. One causality hairline: the dictionary’s second fall-open is narratively convenient, yet its placement at a six-corridor junction spatially justifies the micro-turn.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The temple-library is evoked through hush, stone-carved shelves, and translucent walls—three concrete anchors that double as metaphors for permeable reality. Sensory economy is strict: footstep philosophy, yellowed pages, crystalline definitions; no visual overflow. The setting actively constrains choice by degree-of-illusion shelving, so environment shapes tactics. Micro-setting gate satisfied: the junction where corridors meet functions as charged object, steering the final surrender.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</question><comment>Dominant stake—“unravel cosmic illusions”—is announced early and tightens when Kael realizes he is one of the contradictions. Pressure escalates once, shifting from observation to embodiment; cost is the forfeiture of outsider stance, legible in the dictionary-leave-behind. The spiral-arbitration concept supplies conceptual rather than visceral danger, keeping intensity cerebral. Sufficient for this length, but lacks a second tightening beat that would push into high-octane bands.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges from pattern, not sermon: every recursive image (footsteps, spirals, pages) re-enacts integration. Subtext is carried by silence itself—hush becomes the argument for non-separation. The final image of countless libraries reframed as one home offers a resonant, non-literal answer. No late-state thesis articulation; the dictionary’s definition of “witness” is the closest line to abstraction, but it is embedded in action, avoiding penalty.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person close maintains steady psychic distance; diction stays within a lexicon a lone scholar might plausibly command. Rhythmic control peaks in the final paragraph where clauses shorten to mimic inward spiral collapse. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is consistent (abstract, citation-like metaphors). Compression and elision (“time here moved wanderingly exact”) are taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty—e.g., “footsteps became philosophical statements” fuses action and metaphysics. One template cadence appears (“He…then he…”) but lasts only two sentences, beneath penalty threshold. Metaphors stay coherent within dream-physics rule-set; no mixed vehicles. Occasional elevated registers (“transcendence—it existed in all moments simultaneously”) match POV grandeur without violating plausibility.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Recursive library-as-universe is familiar, yet the “degree-of-illusion shelving” and spiral-arbitration mechanic feel freshly specific. The humble dictionary as compass rather than grimoire inverts expected mystic-object tropes. Risk is moderate—lyric accumulative structure—but coherence at closure keeps it from gimmickry. Enough localized detail prevents plug-and-play with any seeker-story skin.</comment>
