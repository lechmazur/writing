<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is specific—her regret over Kael’s disappearance is embodied in the forge-cold anvil she circles and the wedding-ring gold she sacrifices. The contradictory pull between scientific detachment and maternal guilt is dramatized when she whispers the forgotten birth name while melting her own. Micro-choices (coin spin, gold tracing, naming) reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost. Closure is earned: her stance crystallizes into a lived acceptance of fracture-as-identity, not an abstract epiphany.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: because Kael vanished during her experiment, therefore Mira redeems by re-enacting it with her own named gold. The mid-scene kintsugi mechanics are taught early and repay at closure when golden scars literally mark both forge floor and Kael’s skin. Orientation is anchored within 50 words (rain-stopped foundry, wet rafters, cold anvils). Closure lands with undeniable conceptual cost: Mira’s identity is permanently fissured—her wedding ring is gone, her apprentice is back but changed, and the coin is now inert—creating a Resonant Reconfiguration under Charged Poise.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The foundry is not backdrop but instrument: rain-cooled anvils dictate her slipper tread, forge heat governs coin temperature, dripping rafters meter her guilt. Micro-setting—the zodiac coin—constrains every tactical move; its spiral angles are measured before gold dust is laid. Sensory hierarchy is character-bound: alchemist notices metallic tang over rain scent. Final image recharges setting: gentle rain on iron roof leaves “essential scars untouched,” welding environment to theme.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recover Kael while redeeming her failure—is signaled in para 2. Tightening occurs when she trades her wedding ring for gold powder, narrowing options: she can’t undo the sacrifice. Escalation is causal under lens: each measured zodiac angle raises spiritual cost until the spin consumes her last named metal. Visible price—loss of ring, permanent golden scars on Kael—alters tactics and charges final image.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: naming as vessel, not label, is earned through the coin’s spiral, the forgotten birth name, and the golden fracture lines. Subtext lives in gesture—Mira’s fingertip tracing ash—rather than thesis. Final image of rain on scarred iron offers non-literal answer: identity is the beautiful break, not the intact whole. No moralizing; complexity lingers in Kael’s plural names and Mira’s irretrievable ring.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays strictly inside Mira’s alchemical percept: she “notices metallic tang,” “measures angles,” hears rafters drip. Diction—“coagulation,” “celestial correspondences,” “molecular dance”—remains within alchemist lexicon. Rhythm accelerates under pressure: short clauses when coin spins, longer coils during reflection. No head-hopping; apprentice’s interiority is filtered through her wondering gaze. Voice is distinct, not generic fantasy narrator.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm mirrors forge pulse: longer anaphoric coils for guilt, staccato beats when gold hits coin. No template cadence or synonym loops; “golden lines,” “golden ash,” “golden mark” recur with escalating meaning, taught pattern. Mixed metaphor check clean: “luminous regret—bright and aching as dawn” holds. Closure line “washing everything clean while leaving the essential scars untouched” is crisp, propulsive, irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Alchemical kintsugi is fresh synthesis: fracture-as-repair married to star-forged metallurgy. Zodiac coin functions as both scientific instrument and spiritual vessel, avoiding gimmickry. Risk taken: mystical mechanics are “factually” testable yet remain mysterious—bold commitment to premise. Specific detail—wedding ring sacrificed for gold dust—prevents generic template; removal would collapse causal redemption.</comment>
