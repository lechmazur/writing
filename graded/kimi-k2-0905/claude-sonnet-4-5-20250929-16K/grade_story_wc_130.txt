<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Marius’s interior contradiction—mathematician vs. conjurer, husband vs. man who can’t name his loss—remains concrete and embodied (digging, watering, tear-filled cracks). The micro-choice to plant the glass eyes is both ritual and experiment, foreclosing skepticism at a palpable cost: the eyes dissolve, the flower stays. His flaw—needing to quantify the unquantifiable—drives the climax and produces the earned insight that absence can be a variable. Voice never slips into label-speak; grief is shown through tactile patience, not diagnosis.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds: each dripping drop, each cracked tile, each line of the Fibonacci bloom adds density until the final image reweights “loss” as “negative space in the equation.” The Orientation Test is waived: cavern/orchard/moon anchors arrive by line 30 and the deliberate soft-focus on wife-as-absence pays off when the mosaic face resolves into her erased smile. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the eyes’ dissolution is the visible price, and the new geometry of tears-in-cracks makes absence legible as presence. Cost is unmistakable in the final sentence—“the pattern continued, dovetailing loss and hope”—where pattern itself becomes the enduring constraint.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The cavern orchard is not backdrop; its glowing fruit and drip-rate literally nourish the experiment that yields the answer. The chipped mosaic—half-eroded woman’s face—constrains Marius’s kneeling posture and later catches his tears, charging the final image. Stalactite water functions as both clock and reagent, its centuries-per-drop pace forcing Marius’s patience into bodily time. Spatial choreography is pristine: velvet bundle → dig → water → dissolve, every motion tracked against roots and stones.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—find the formula for forgetting—tightens when the flower’s dew displays numbers, forcing Marius to confront that love changes state rather than vanishes. The Fibonacci spiral is the single decisive intensification: it converts abstract grief into visual proof, narrowing options from “recover her” to “honor the pattern.” Cost is legible: the glass eyes dissolve, leaving him with an irreversible new geometry. Pressure remains accumulative; no coincidence resolves the conflict—only the internal shift from measurement to acceptance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the inversion of measurement: emotion is not a diminishing quantity but a phase-change whose mathematics is topology, not arithmetic. The chipped mosaic and Fibonacci bloom are particulars that generalize to universal loss without declaring it. Final image—“tears followed the chipped patterns exactly”—offers a non-literal answer: grief becomes grout, completing the picture. No moral is stated; the insight is felt as pattern-recognition, not thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains modest distance, never claiming knowledge Marius lacks; “he couldn’t say which” keeps POV honest. Perceptual signature is scientist-poet: mineral drops, negative space, Fibonacci spirals—idiosyncratic yet coherent. Rhythm lengthens under stalactite time, compresses in the rapid unfurling of the flower, mirroring emotional tempo. No filter-verb clusters; syntax stays clean even at peak revelation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image, concept, or emotion. Metaphors (tears as grout, patience as taste) stay physically coherent. Opening line anchors voice and stakes in 15 words; final line crystallizes the new equation without exposition. Density is high—e.g., “water had worn away her smile but left her eyes intact” performs erosion, memory, and thematic setup in one stroke.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>Premise—“mathematics of ambiguous loss grown in a drip-fed cavern orchard”—is non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Risk of preciousness is avoided by grounding every wonder in tactile action: dig, water, dissolve. The taxidermist eyes repurposed as seeds transform a gothic prop into a scientific instrument, fresh without gimmickry. Synthesis of math, grief, and horticulture feels singular and unreproducible at this length.</comment>
