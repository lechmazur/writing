<comment>Della’s contradictory drives—vengeance vs. mercy—are shown in embodied micro-choices (finger on recorder, hand on fob, final release of Kern). The heirloom’s weight and the recorder’s hidden button give tangible cost to her shifting stance. Interiority stays concrete: “the watch fob grew warm against her chest” anchors emotion without label-speak. Final renunciation is earned because the recorded confession is already in her pocket; letting Kern go feels like a visible forfeit of justice.</comment>

<comment>Causal lens holds: each false rumor acts as a tagged probe; only the north-caves lie reaches the revenue men, tightening the noose around Kern. Closure is a Decisive Change with cost—Della presses STOP, forfeiting hard evidence to spare a daughter—made legible in the single sentence “Go get Sarah.” No orientation drift; who/where/when anchor inside 120 words. Persistent constraint: the sunrise clock visible in “dying stars” makes the mercy window irretrievable.</comment>

<comment>Pirate-market micro-setting—barnacle-crusted ladder, throne of lobster traps—constrains choreography and social hierarchy; Kern’s literal elevation on traps mirrors his moral fall. Oil-lamp amber pockets against salt-thick darkness supply visual hierarchy that guides Della’s stealthy approach. Watch fob functions as micro-setting/object hybrid, its tarnished silver catching fragments of lamplight to signal heritage and ticking morality. Final climb “toward the dying stars” repurposes the vertical pier architecture as moral ascent after letting Kern flee.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—identify the traitor—tightens precisely: three tagged lies narrow suspects to one. Sunrise clock adds external pressure; “her time was almost up” coincides with moral climax. Agency is continuous: she engineers the trap, confronts Kern, then actively erases the evidence. Cost is paid on-page: deletion of the confession she risked her life to obtain.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of merciful silence emerges from reversal: pursuit of broken trust ends in restoration of hush. Subtext operates in gesture—Della’s hand leaves the recorder button, not her pocket, signaling mercy without stating it. Final image of swinging fob reweights heirloom from vengeance token to mercy talisman. No moralizing line; theme crystallizes in the action of letting Kern escape.</comment>

<comment>Third-limited stays tight to Della’s sensory filter: “salt-thick darkness,” “copper and grain alcohol” smell. Distinctive perceptual signature—time measured by heirloom, sound of trust literalized as recorded waveform—remains consistent. No head-hopping; Kern’s desperation reads only through Della’s perception. Syntax mirrors emotional compression: short sentences under pressure, longer reflective cadence at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>High density: single sentence slips in tagged-lie mechanic, paternal murder, and heirloom transfer. Figurative language is spare—“comforting unease,” “gray fingers of sunrise”—each image recurs to bracket mood. No mixed metaphors; watch fob light and sunrise light converge cleanly. Minor filter verb in “she felt its steady weight” but justified by tactile focus; no loops or scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>“Sound of trust breaking” as recordable macguffin is fresh; turns abstract loyalty into pirate contraband. Tagged-lie investigation method repurposes bootlegger tradecraft as detective logic. Final mercy twist flips revenge trope without nullifying prior stakes. Risky choice to withhold violence pays off; originality lies in restorative silence rather than cathartic gunplay.</comment>
