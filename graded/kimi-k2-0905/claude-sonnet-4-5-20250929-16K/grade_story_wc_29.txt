<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is concrete—her teeth ache, her vision blurs—and her micro-choice to weaponize the campus station feels earned by her private naming of “cosmic tricksters.” The cautious hope trait actually constrains her timing and risk calculus, showing contradictory impulses (dread vs. defiance) in scene. No other character steps onstage, so status dynamics aren’t tested, but her competence is nicely balanced by the untested math that could “amplify the tricksters’ power,” a tangible flaw. The ending’s steadiness—marking the victory “with steady hands”—pays a visible cost for her endurance, qualifying as Earned Stasis.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds throughout: because the signals turn conversational, Mara therefore studies correlations; because she discovers the discord amplifier, she therefore retasks the transmitter. Orientation lands by line 4 (who, basement studio, night of the counter-broadcast). The single-scene structure tightens once when Jupiter’s EM field is worked into the plan, narrowing escape options. Closure is a clean Decisive Change: the air thickens, the signals cut off, and the march stops—on-page proof her interference pattern worked, priced by the risk she might have “amplified the tricksters’ power.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The basement studio’s “dust and ozone” is filtered through an astronomer’s eye—charts red-inked with signal correlations—so setting guides her improvised antenna alignment. Jupiter’s position is not just color but a functional constraint that amplifies her hack, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography stays clean: headphones pressed, floor thrumming, charts trembling. No weather clichés; the only environment is circuitry and celestial geometry, exactly what the conflict needs.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</question><comment>Dominant stake—liberating the campus from alien-induced civil war—arrives early and tightens when Mara realizes the signals “amplify humanity’s worst impulses.” One meaningful deepening: the discovery that Jupiter can boost her counter-signal transforms a student-grade transmitter into a planet-scale weapon, foreclosing the option to stay silent. Cost is visible: she might wreck the station or empower the enemy; that tension stays live until the oscilloscope waveforms merge and the chanting stops. Escalation is causal under the chosen lens; no coincidence resolves anything.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges without slogans: manipulation exposed is manipulation defused. The tricksters’ delight in human confusion reframes prior campus fractures as externally puppeted, not organically political, landing a Conceptual Repricing at closure. Subtext lives in gesture—Mara marks victory on the same charts once used for star-mapping, quietly swapping cosmology for signal warfare. No final-paragraph moralizing; the dawn “slowly remembering how to think for itself” supplies resonant image rather than thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Mara’s perceptual signature: “whisper of stars,” “cosmic tricksters,” “rhythms that felt almost conversational.” Syntax lengthens when she theorizes, shortens under wave-form assault: “The generator’s pitch climbed higher.” No dialogue, so voice distinction test is waived. Filter verbs are minimal; sensory immediacy dominates. The elevated but plausible academic diction matches a grad-student radio astronomer.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Rhythm breathes with action: long sentences for theory, staccato for sensory assault. No paraphrase loops; “signals” is repeated but each iteration gains new data (random → conversational → weaponized). Metaphors stay consistent—celestial navigation language extended into electronic warfare. Opening and closing lines are crisp, the latter recharging “dawn” with new cognitive freedom. Minor scaffolding: “might wreck the station—or worse” could lose “or worse,” but it does not touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The alien-meme premise is familiar, but grounding it in a low-power campus radio shack modded into a planet-scale phase canceler is fresh. Astronomical charts repurposed as signal-attack blueprints supply a specific, non-obvious synthesis. The notion that discord is the desired harvest adds moral complexity—humanity’s worst impulses as crop. Risk is taken: hard-SF electromagnetics in under 800 words without exposition dump, and it remains legible.</comment>
