<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Marta’s interiority is vivid—her shifting certainty about waking/dreaming is embodied in breath, pulse, nickel weight—but her “methodically playful” trait is asserted more than dramatized; no scene shows method clashing with play to cost her a choice. The final surrender is credible, but the absence of any secondary character or status crucible keeps the arc lone-note. Micro-choices (sing, press palms) trace values, yet lack a visible trade-off that scars. Still, the recursive identity loop feels character-specific, not template.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Marta’s backward/fall crystallizes the recursive rule—every awakening adds a layer, cost is the infinite deferral of final “real.” Lens is Accumulative/Textural: density of murals/nickel/sound reweights stake rather than causal chain. Orientation clean by 120 wds; no lens ambiguity at end. One imperfection: the nickel’s rule-change (eyes open) is late-introduced magic; accept at this length because pattern is taught early by the singing wall.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sound-garden is textured through touch-sound synesthesia: palm on crumbling plaster, fountains whispering back at shifted pitch—details constrain perception and choice. The nickel-as-micro-setting evolves from embedded relic to grinning doppelgänger, charging final image. Spatial choreography stays coherent across body, wall, coin, reflected voice. No environmental detail is static; each echo redirects Marta’s attention and ultimately her stance. Setting is inseparable from the stakes.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><answer>Dominant stake—existential vertigo of nested awakenings—signals immediately and tightens each time the nickel’s face shifts. Pressure is accumulative: each mural layer peeled = one more self left behind; cost is the thinning of prior memories. No causal antagonist, but the acoustic garden’s feedback loop forces stance crystallization. The final surrender forecloses the possibility of ever knowing which Marta is “first”; price is epistemic infinity, felt on page.</answer>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: certainty as a fragile restoration, curiosity as the only honest preservation. Subtext lives in echo mechanics—garden answers every question with a question, mirroring Marta’s profession of revealing by covering. Final image reweights earlier restorations as mere drafts; the real art is letting go of finality. No moralizing, only resonant image of perpetual becoming.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays close to Marta’s perceptual filter: selective attention to acoustic texture, professional vocabulary of layers and pigments. Syntax lengthens during disorientation, shortens at decision points—rhythmic control mirrors pressure. No dialogue, so voice distinction not tested; internal diction remains consistent and idiosyncratic. Free-indirect slips are clean; no filter-verb clutter.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet breathable; sentences layer sensory data without scaffold. One paraphrase loop—“each time she...each time the murals...each time she remembered”—appears mid-text; minor but noticeable. Metaphors stay coherent within sonic domain; no mixed vehicles. Opening and closing lines ear-test strong. No typos, tense drift, or buried leads. Information often doubled (job + sensation) but advances mood.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Premise fuses acoustic garden, art restoration, and recursive dream-planes—fresh synthesis, not trope echo. The hobo nickel’s micro-sculpture as portal key is specific, verifiable, and charged. Risk of infinite-regress ending is embraced rather than hedged, producing conceptual integrity. If names/places swapped, core frays; transformation is intrinsic. No abstract “consciousness” sermon—particulars drive universality.</comment>
