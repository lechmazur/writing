<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maya’s interiority—her “sharply observant gaze” cataloging anomalies—stays concrete and causal; the moment she feeds the papers into the stove is a credible renunciation that costs her the identity she arrived with. The flaw: we never feel her body under stress; the night-long reconstruction is summarized, not embodied, so the price feels intellectual rather than visceral.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal chain is pristine: shredded memo → stillpoint equation → choice to burn. The Orientation Test is waived: the initial dust-flow-around-orchard image teaches the anomaly early and pays off when the stillpoint collapses if the diamond is removed. Closure lands with undeniable conceptual cost: “Some truths… better left buried” reweights her entire vocation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The orchard-as-micro-setting is the story’s engine: apples thriving in irradiated soil, dust skirting the fence, the buried diamond beneath the roots—each detail later constrains the choice to preserve or expose. Gate met: the final image of apple trees guarding their secret charges the closing beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—truth vs. survival of the last green place—tightens once: the reconstructed memos force a binary, publish or protect. Escalation is intellectual rather than visceral, but the cost is made legible on-page when Maya ignites the evidence, trading her life’s mission for the orchard’s continuance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: knowledge itself becomes a radioactive agent that can poison the last refuge. The final image of burning documents reconfigures the moral calculus—ignorance as mercy—without moralizing. Subtext lives in Vera’s quiet offer of tea while the pages flare, a silent covenant.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person close keeps a disciplined perceptual signature: Maya clocks “absence of radiation burns,” “dust seemed to flow around,” never venturing beyond her ken. Free-indirect cadence tightens under pressure—single-sentence paragraph “They weren’t trying to curse anything” cracks the rhythm open at the exact beat of reversal.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero scaffold or loop; each sentence advances knowledge or image. Metaphors are spare and physics-loyal: “rust-colored dust,” “terrible mosaic.” Opening line anchors voice (“pressed her goggles tight”) and the final line offers crystalline closure (“keep its curse”), satisfying the ear test.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The Krasnov Diamond as geometric anchor for a physics bubble flips the cursed-gem trope into eco-SF; the story’s originality lies in making truth itself the destructive force. Fresh inflection: the debunker becomes the final censor, a reversal seeded from page one yet still surprising.</comment>
