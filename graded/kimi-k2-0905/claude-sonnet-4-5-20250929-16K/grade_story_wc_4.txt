<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Interiority is lyrical but drifts toward label-speak (“the grammar of grief”), softening embodied pressure. Mira’s calm is shown through repeatable ritual rather than micro-choices that tighten risk. The townspeople arrive as a chorus; no single secondary character applies new pressure. She does not visibly pay a cost for her role; the closure remains communal, not personal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative lens: photo arrangement + gathering = pattern that reweights communal sorrow. Closure image—“something had shifted… rearranged into grace”—is a Resonant Reconfiguration with social cost felt through collective voice. Causality is interior and cumulative; no decisive external pivot required. The final beat is quiet but legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Lavender field, rusted factory, dove-gray case recur and constrain placement and mood; factory ruin literally frames the photo arcs. Sensory triad—purple bloom, rust scrape, lavender scent—mirrors the grief-to-garden arc without overt symbolism. Spatial choreography is clean: fence gap, kneeling, overhead photo plan. Setting charges final communal decision; environment = micro-tool.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</question><grade>Dominant stake: transform shared pain into visible communal form. Pressure is gentle—curiosity, shame, tentative return—not tightening stakes; cost is diffused across group. One meaningful cadence shift occurs when townspeople choose mural/garden, narrowing option from abandonment to stewardship. Agency is collective; Mira catalyzes rather than gambles.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from photo arcs → constellation metaphor → garden plan; no explicit moralizing. Subtext lives in Thomas’s lingering badge, lavender scent wrapping rust. Final image answers “what to do with ruin” with living memorial; ambiguity remains—loss not erased, only arranged. Slight thematic echo in Mira’s “transmute pain into masterpiece” risks −0.4, but late placement in reflective beat mitigates.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited hugs Mira’s calm, rhythmic, lyrical diction; perceptual signature consistent. Filter verbs rare; sensory attention selective. Dialogue minimal but natural, carries subtext: “Come see.” No head-hopping. The collective “they” at end is narrated from exterior; acceptable within accumulative closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is supple, rhythmic, image-rich; no loops or scaffold detected. Occasional elevated phrasing (“charged poise of grief”) borders purple but fits lyrical mode. Sentence variety; paragraph cuts clean. Some near-repeat of “arcs” and “arranged” across adjacent sentences (−0.2), not at closure. Clean mechanics; strong final cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Fresh lens: grief archivist who curates communal sorrow into spatial art. Factory-lavender reclamation avoids ruin-porn cliché via understated choreography. Concept of collective healing as tangible garden decision feels non-obvious. Risk is modest; premise could travel but local detail anchors it. No close echoes; earns originality through quiet scale and sensory specificity.</comment>
