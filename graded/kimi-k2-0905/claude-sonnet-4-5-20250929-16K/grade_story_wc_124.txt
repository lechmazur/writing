<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dalton’s contradictory impulse—seeking scent while fearing memory—drives every beat; the final refusal to swap vials crystallizes a hierarchy of values with felt cost. Interiority stays lantern-broker-specific (“grammar of loss,” “crystal patterns”) and viscerally embodied. Only micro-slip: “diagnostic” tag-line about “why I can’t stop” could be more embodied; still, the moment is saved by immediate tactile vial action. Earned stasis lands because prior beats foreclose any lesser comfort.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal chain is airtight: dead wife → vial → greenhouse wait → new bloom → identical scent → deliberate preservation. Closure is a Charged Poise: Dalton pockets the empty vial, reconfiguring grief from avoidance to stewardship; cost is the lifelong ache he now consents to carry. Orientation anchored by word 60; no prop teleport; UV reveal taught early and paid off. Lens holds as causal throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Greenhouse acts as crucible: sterile racks force Dalton to confront absence; UV light re-tools his authentication skill into emotional assay. Crystal vial micro-setting constrains the final choice—its emptiness is the only vessel that still “remembers” her. Sensory hierarchy obeys POV: lantern broker notices refraction angles before smell. No static cataloging; every detail (restoration lamps, sealed pod) advances stakes.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will scent reactivate grief?—tightens once: the moment new petals release fragrance alongside old vial. Agency is Dalton’s decision to keep the empty vial, trading future comfort for authentic memory. Cost is legible: he accepts permanent sorrow. No coincidence; escalation is purely because/therefore under causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly: memory resides in irreplaceable context, not molecules. Subtext lives in gesture—Miren’s tissue offered in silence. Final image of “light in a careful vessel” reweights lantern craft from commerce to elegy. No thesis statement; resonance is purely imagistic.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is lantern-broker vision: every gleam, shadow, and ultraviolet refraction is filtered through professional gaze. Rhythm compresses under grief—short clauses when scent hits; longer reflective cadences in lulls. No head-hop; free indirect style clean. Dialogue minimal but voice-distinct: Miren’s clinical compassion vs. Dalton’s clipped anguish.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Zero loops; high density—“lantern broker,” “crystal perfume vial,” “extinct blooms” each do double duty of world and psyche. Metaphors stay consistent (light/dark, vessel/flame). No register drift; “molecular structures” fits ex-lantern authenticator. Final line cadence slows to match enduring grief without syntactic monotony.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fusion of scent-science and lantern-trade feels novel; UV authentication trick repurposed for emotional epiphany. Conceptual risk—grief resolved by keeping absence—pays off without gimmick. Specificity of silverleaf oil, moonbell, singing willow prevents botanical genericism. Slight familiarity of “scent = memory” trope lowered from 9.0.</comment>
