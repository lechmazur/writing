<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Kael’s desire to return home is visceral and embodied in her defiant tears; Miren’s doubled exile shows in her compulsive backward steps and the shard she keeps for herself. The micro-choice to pour more tea after Kael drains the cup signals Miren’s mentorship motive with tactile specificity. The final backward walk by Kael crystallizes the transfer of resilience without speech. Only small slip: “exile is an invitation” dips into therapeutic paraphrase mid-climax, −0.2.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal lens holds throughout: each shard-touch and tea leaf pattern becomes a because/therefore step toward Kael’s earned exit. Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration—Kael steps out carrying her own shadow-glass, cost visible in the stilled swing. One causality micro-gap: we never learn why the library allows exile reversal, but the lacuna is minor and doesn’t break the final choice.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The forgotten library is evoked through tactility—dusty boards, chipped pot, warped windows—rather than catalogue. The playground swing functions as micro-setting: its creak supplies the hush-meter that times the scene and its final stillness mirrors Kael’s new poise. Spatial choreography is flawless; both women move in precise backward vectors that track across beats. Swing as time-device constrains the pacing of mentorship beats and charges the exit image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“can Kael go home?”—is signaled in line 3 and tightened when Miren names her own double exile. Escalation is accumulative: each cup of tea and shard-reading raises the cost of misunderstanding exile. The final narrowing is Kael’s choice to carry the shadow-glass, foreclosing the option to forget what she’s learned. Price is felt: Miren stays behind among dust and creaking chains.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the inversion of exile-as-punishment into exile-as-reshaping; the swing’s final stillness conceptually reprices “return” as active self-carrying rather than passive absolution. No overt thesis—wisdom is earned through tactile acts (tea, glass, backward steps). Subtext in dialogue—“You rush. That’s why you were exiled”—carries history and instruction in five words. Final image refracts earlier amber-shadow motif without verbal echo.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays welded to Miren’s sensory field: dust scuffs, steam geometry, chain rhythm. Distinct perceptual signature—she notices angles and shadows first, people second. Compression in “She appreciated the resistance” shows analytic distance even under emotion. No head-hop; when Kael exits, we only see her pause from Miren’s eyes.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with scene tension: longer sentences during tea annotations, clipped fragments at “Sit.” No metaphor clutter; single sustained amber image carries across beats. High information density—“defiant tears tracking” does three jobs in four words. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; even the repeated “backward” motif is purpose-taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The shard-mirror archive as emotional passport office is fresh; the tea-leaf geometry map of personal failure feels inevitable once revealed. Risk in making mentorship the entire plot pays off because the swing-time device externalizes progress. No derivative tropes—exile stories usually feature journeys, not static libraries. Specificity of “afternoon shadow caught like amber” anchors novelty in concrete sensory memory.</comment>
