<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Marina’s interiority is concrete—her noticing of the woman’s rib-cage breathing pattern, her own four-seven-eight count—yet the “past-life” motive is asserted rather than embodied under pressure. The elderly woman’s shift from panic to steady breath is dramatized and costly, earning the micro-healing. Marina’s final micro-choice—packing the warm crystal—shows earned renunciation, but the smoke-tasting name remains abstract, keeping the contradiction from fully acting in-scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the crystal image reframes “unused love” as breath-released light, with conceptual cost legible in the golden pollen drifting upward. Causal linkage holds—each breath tightens the knot’s dissolution—under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is anchored by line 6; transitions are smooth. One scaffold loop—“like ink in water, like stars in fog”—slightly dulls the final image, preventing 9.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The viaduct’s blooming wisteria constrains the healing ritual—petals drop into the camera’s inverted image, charging the final golden pollen. Spatial choreography is clean; the woman’s hand on ribs and the box placement track. Sensory hierarchy favors scent and color, filtered through Marina’s photographer eye. The crystal functions as micro-setting; its warming in her palm is a tactile cost at closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“where does unused love go?”—tightens when the dark knot appears in the camera; breathwork is the single meaningful escalation that forecloses the option of silence. Cost is visible: the woman’s tears and steady exhalation. Agency is shared; Marina’s instruction and the woman’s compliance narrow options together. Escalation is modest but coherent under Accumulative lens; no reversal, only deepening.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the inversion trope: love is not stored elsewhere but released inward—shown, not stated. The camera’s image reweights the premise at closure, a Conceptual Repricing. Subtext lives in breath-count silence and the crystal’s warmth. No moralizing; the final image of pollen-like light drifting upward offers non-literal answer to the opening question.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Marina’s perceptual signature—light through pinhole, violet waves, crystal warmth. Rhythm modulates: longer cadence for twilight description, clipped imperatives during breath instruction. Dialogue is sparse, goal-driven: “You reveal what’s hidden.” No head-hopping; elderly woman’s interior is read through breathing pattern, not ventriloquized. Register remains lyrical yet controlled, no filter-verb stacks.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentence openings shift from participial to subject-verb. Density is high—“dark and knotted like roots” does triple duty: visual, tactile, emotional. One paraphrase loop noted above costs −0.2. No scaffolding, no synonym churn elsewhere. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line crystallizes image without overwriting. Metaphors stay coherent under inversion physics.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: camera obscura as grief-venting stethoscope. The “pilgrim of sparks” concept is particularized through breath mechanics rather than label. Risk is taken—past-life frame could feel gimmick—but stays subordinate to present breath ritual. The inversion of storage→release feels inevitable in hindsight. No close echoes of famous scenes; wisteria and Kwan Yin tear are integrated, not ornamental.</comment>
