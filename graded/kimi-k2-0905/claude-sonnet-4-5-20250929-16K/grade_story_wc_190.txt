<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Mara’s calm, ritualized caretaking is credibly lived-in; her micro-choice to remain silent with the grieving man embodies the “teach silence” motive. The interior contradiction—she guides others yet still learns from the storm glass—adds depth. Cost is soft (emotional labor), but the palm-press goodbye shows embodied gratitude that lands as payment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: the piece layers quiet images (gondola, prisms, crystals) until the final hush “vaults” upward—an earned intensification rather than causal reversal. Closure is a Charged Poise: the man leaves lighter, Mara returns to her log, cycle renewed; the cost is her perpetual emotional absorption. Orientation beats land by line 6; no debt. One paraphrase loop (“seven years… seven minutes”) is minor.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The terrace as floating auditory sanctuary is specific, improbable yet physical; wind across prisms supplies tactile immediacy. The storm glass acts as micro-setting that constrains Mara’s choices—she watches, decides silence is best. Train-whistle echo anchors time and valley depth. Final image of crystals “fluidly logical as breath” recharges the place with felt cost.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake: can Mara usher this stranger’s grief into usable quiet without fracturing her own composure? Tightening occurs when the crystals signal “difficult passages,” forcing her to silent intervention; the man’s exhalation drop marks visible price. No external antagonist—pressure is atmospheric and ethical. Escalation is modest but coherent under Accumulative lens; the hush vaults, options reconfigured.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</question><comment>Theme—grief processed through engineered silence—emerges via prisms, decibel numbers, and the man’s aborted sentence, never thesis-label. Subtext lives in gesture: palm on glass = recognition of shared wounded logic. Final line’s equation of silence to non-resistant echo offers resonant conceptual repricing without moralizing. Complexity intact: silence comforts but never erases loss.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays anchored to Mara’s professional perceptual filter—she notices wind noise, crystal shapes, passenger posture, not psychology jargon. Syntax is calm, cadenced, mimicking gondola glide; noFilter-verb clusters. Dialogue minimal and indirection-rich (“My sister,” full-stop). Voice grows slightly more metaphoric only at finale, mirroring release of held breath.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High information density: each sentence layers sensory, technical, and emotional data without pad. Metaphors are spare and coherent—“hand catching snow,” “slow water”—never stacked. One tiny paraphrase loop “seven years… seven minutes” flagged; otherwise no scaffold or synonym churn. Rhythm breathes with scene, accelerating slightly at whistle echo then settling.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Floating sound-terrace is fresh world-building; storm glass as grief-barometer feels inevitable yet new. Conceptual risk—quiet as transit technology—pays off by making silence legible infrastructure. Emotional specificity avoids generic grief tropes. Could swap gondola for cable car, so not absolutely irreplaceable, but synthesis of acoustics + crystallography + caretaker ritual is memorable.</comment>
