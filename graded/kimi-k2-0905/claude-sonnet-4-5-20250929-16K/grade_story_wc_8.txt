<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Helena’s “emotional rationality” is asserted repeatedly but never pressures her choices; the same beat—photograph, wrap, decide—could play with any temperament. Interiority relies on summary labels (“understood,” “balanced”) instead of contradictory impulses in-scene. She pays a social cost (career forfeiture), yet the prose announces rather than dramatizes the weight of that loss during the decisive beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Causal chain is clean: tip → discovery → recognition → exposure plan. Closure lands with visible forfeiture (“Her career … would end”), satisfying the cost test under a Causal lens. The single transition (station → drive) is legible; orientation anchors arrive at ~100 words. Escalation is linear rather than tightening; no second pressure pivot narrows options further.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Ivy-strangled Victorian station, broken glass, pigeons, rose petal—selective, sensory, filtered through Helena’s archival eye. Micro-setting (loose brick, gilt page edge) directly enables the inciting discovery. Spatial choreography holds: we track her boots, hands, scarf, car mirror. The station’s decay mirrors the theme of buried truth, but the environment never actively constrains tactics or charges the final image beyond backdrop.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—exposing institutional falsification—is signalled by line 3 and personalizes when her own book is suppressed. One meaningful tightening: Council suppression → Aldric evidence → decision to publish. Price is declared (career loss) but not felt in-scene; no live option is foreclosed on the page. Escalation stays intellectual; pressure plateaus after the manuscript is secured.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.6</grade>
<comment>Theme—truth versus sanctioned lies—emerges through parallel medieval/modern suppressions rather than authorial lecture. Final paragraph’s “pit of lies” drifts toward explicit thesis, blunting resonance. Subtext is thin; no gesture or image reconfigures meaning beyond what is stated. The concept is coherent yet competes with no counter-argument, yielding a tidy moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person close stays locked to Helena; perceptual signature—“peculiar attention historians give to endings,” “ivy strangled”—is crisp, academic, mildly sardonic. Syntax varies; paragraph rhythm breathes with scene beats. No dialogue to test voice distinction. Occasional elevated diction (“conceptual repricing,” “destabilizing to national heritage”) fits her scholar register but edges toward editorial essay cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, vivid, high-density; no loops or scaffold. Metaphors are controlled (“ivy…strangled,” “fingers from the past”). One mixed image—“truth from a pit of lies”—is tolerated at climax. Opening and closing sentences carry echoing rose/whisper motifs, supplying cadence lift. Minor filter slips (“she noted,” “she understood”) dilute immediacy but do not stall momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>Linkage of 1347 monastic censorship to modern Council suppression gives fresh historical hinge. Yet the “historian vs. censor” arc is familiar; beats follow template: tip → archive → sacrifice → whistle-blow. No risky structural or perspectival choice is taken. Specificity of Brother Aldric’s hand and gilt edges helps, but core plot could transplant to any era of suppression with minor edits.</comment>
