<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus’s contradictory interiority—engineered extinction vs. secret sentiment—is dramatized through embodied salt-kneeling and shaking hands. The final renunciation (walking away while the egg broadcasts) is earned by the prior causal chain of bribes, drought, murder of rivers. One decimal off 9+ only because the “sentiment” tag is once asserted rather than revealed through micro-choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: each paragraph layers density—salt, cracks, quantum device—until the release reweights the entire sculpted absence. Closure is a Charged Poise: the dove’s fractured call rings out while rain dissolves the map; cost is felt in the same instant beauty is rescued. Causality remains intact; no teleporting props or retro-patches.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Salt flat, egg, and thunder are not postcard backdrops: the crunching salt under knees literally constrains Marcus’s posture; the cracked riverbed pattern is the GPS he follows; the incoming rain will erase the coordinates. Micro-setting (egg cradle, resin shell) charges the final broadcast. Spatial choreography is clean—no floating objects.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve the echo—tightens once: the release forecloses the option to keep the egg intact. Visible price is dramatized: four murdered watersheds, seven bought countries, egg abandoned to rain. Escalation is accretive rather than multi-turn, sufficient for 700-word scope. Cost is unmistakable on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges without moralizing: the cost of rescuing beauty from oblivion is everything. Final image (extinct bird singing to thunder while rain erases the map) offers a non-literal answer—preservation and erasure simultaneous. No final-paragraph thesis statement; resonance is carried by salt, water, and fracture.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person close keeps consistent psychic distance; no head-hop. Diction—“crystalline silence,” “bruised purple,” “negative space where the dove’s song should have been”—is character-specific, not thesaurus churn. Rhythm accelerates into short clauses under storm pressure. Filter verbs avoided; perception stays embodied.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High information density: single sentences braid salt, geography, and moral ledger. No paraphrase loops or scaffold. Figurative language is selective; “salt that crunched like old bones” is precise, not purple. Closing cadence—“beautiful and broken, a grace assembled from fragments”—earns its lyric lift via prior pattern of fracture.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise—using continental drought as cartography to locate an extinct dove’s nesting ground—is non-obvious and inseparable from this character. Risky scale compression (geocide in 700 words) pays off through accretive sensory fragments. Final image feels inevitable yet fresh: rain dissolving the map while the recording persists.</comment>
