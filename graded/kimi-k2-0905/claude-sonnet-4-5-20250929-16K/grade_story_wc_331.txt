<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Meridian’s interiority is rich, embodied, and peculiar—her “tattered silk scarf” fidgeting, her preference for 3 AM’s “honest geometry.” The micro-choice to drape the scarf across the model dramatizes her value hierarchy and primes the final insight. Flaw: no second character on-page, so relationship crucible and status dynamics bullets are N/A; the grandmother is only memory, not present pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—density of translucent sheets and interference patterns tightens the dominant stake. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: “Stories live in the curvature” reweights the entire premise with felt cost (she abandons the Euclidean quest). Orientation anchored by word 65; no causality breaks; scarf as persistent constraint. Meets 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The converted-observatory library is rendered through Meridian’s professional eye—“villanelles of Maxwell’s equations,” “quantum sestinas”—and finally constrains her final gesture: the scarf settles into the predicted valleys. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible positions. Micro-setting (scarf) charges the final image; meets 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Single dominant stake: locate where stories live. Escalation is textural—each overlay increases density until voids appear, narrowing her options from “mapping” to “inhabiting the curvature.” Cost is visible: she abandons the indexing project, accepting unmappable space. Agency is attention/renunciation; meets Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete particulars: analog tactility vs. digital abstraction, curvature vs. flatness. Final image—scarf settling into saddle-shaped space—reweights all prior metaphors without stating a moral. No thematic echo or moralizing paragraph. Resonance is intellectual and emotional simultaneously.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person intimate maintains consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature is mathematically poetic—“hyperbolic curves through the stacks,” “saddle-shaped surfaces.” Syntax mirrors Meridian’s precision: long periodic sentences for theory, clipped fragments at discovery. No dialogue to judge; no head-hopping. Register stays within her scholarly lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; information density high—each sentence layers metaphor and physics. Zero loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. One near-purple stretch (“photons and paper”) but serves voice. No artifacts in final third; closure image is crisp. Minor filter-verb cluster (“she realized then that”) forgiven at lower pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Premise—hyperbolic geometry as literal story habitat—is fresh, non-obvious, and fully committed. Risk: dense scientific metaphor could alienate, yet emotional through-line remains legible. Transformation test fails if scarf/model removed; freshness arises from synthesis of math, memory, and textile. No close echoes of famous scenes.</comment>
