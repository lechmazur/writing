<comment>Mara’s interiority is vivid (“drowsy alertness… thoughts moved through honey”) and her investigative drive is consistent, but the story withholds any contradiction or micro-choice once she enters the tunnel; she only records what she finds. The decisive pivot—realizing guilt, not ghosts—occurs off-stage in summary, so the cost feels reported rather than embodied. No visible renunciation or charged refusal lands on the page; the backpacked valve wheel is evidence, not a totem that forces a new stance. The character texture is strong, but the arc is observation-heavy, choice-light.</comment>

<comment>Closure arrives as Conceptual Repricing: “the living haunted themselves…” reweights the entire premise with undeniable social cost. Causality holds: the valve wheel → radio confession → EPA decision chain is legible, and the ghost-shift motif is retrospectively repriced. The lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern is taught early (“callers’ frantic consistency”) and pays off in the final paragraph. Cost is felt, but because the confession is disembodied radio static and Mara’s agency stops at documentation, the price is vicarious rather than personal, keeping the score just shy of 9.</comment>

<comment>Setting is textured and selective: condensation “thick as wool,” rust “consumed everything,” the beaded wheel’s “welded beads—some machinist’s craft project.” Sensory hierarchy follows Mara’s fatigue and reporter eye. The tunnel constrains movement—single file, no side exits—so the discovery feels inevitable. The valve wheel re-enters the final image (“clinked against her back with each step”), charging the exit with tangible evidence, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—truth vs. self-protection—is signaled early via callers’ guilt. Pressure tightens when the radio confession airs live in the tunnel, narrowing Mara’s options to “photograph everything” and escalate to authorities. Cost is visible: she accepts the moral burden of exposing thirty-year-old murders, forfeiting neutrality. Because the price is moral rather than physical, and the men’s stakes overshadow hers, the escalation peaks at 7.6 rather than 8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: collective guilt manifesting as spectral labor. Subtext operates in silence—workers’ “mouths moving in silent conversation”—and in the beaded wheel, a relic of industrial craft turned murder weapon. The final reconfiguration (“the living haunted themselves”) reweights every prior ghost image without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers: Mara’s own complicity as ratings-chaser is implied but unspoken, giving the theme texture beyond the single revelation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Distinct perceptual signature: reporter’s cataloguing eye, metaphor drawn from textile lexicon (“darkness thick as wool”). Syntax lengthens under fatigue, fragments under radio static. No dialogue on page, so voice coherence is internal; free indirect style stays clean. The diction “religiously skeptical worldview” is self-diagnostic but earned within her journalist persona, not therapy-speak. Rhythm modulates: long sentences for descent, staccato for confession, final cadence for exit.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Momentum is high: every sentence advances discovery or atmosphere. No synonym loops; “drowsy alertness” appears once and crystallizes state. Metaphors are coherent (wool, honey, sediment) and tied to mill imagery. Minor scaffold: “She continued deeper… the tunnel opened into…” is functional transition rather than clutter. Final clink of valve wheel provides auditory closure, avoiding generic last-line uplift.</comment>

<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Familiar trope—urban-explorer ghost hunt—flips into collective-guilt haunting, a fresh synthesis. The valve wheel as both craft object and murder instrument is specific, not ornamental. Risk lies in the disembodied radio confession; the story teaches early that callers are the engine, so the device feels earned, not cheat. Fresh inflection: ghost labor as nightly penance, not spectral revenge. Could edge higher if Mara’s own skepticism were more painfully repriced.</comment>
