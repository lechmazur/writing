<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Mara’s blind expertise is credibly embodied through touch-water diagnostics and tool memory, but her interiority stays safely on the surface—no contradictory impulse or visible flaw complicates her calm. The repair beats show competence, not struggle; the “magnetic calm” feels like a resting state rather than a cost-laden stance. Because no credible mistake or trade-off appears, the arc is flat: she fixes the drone and feels satisfied, but nothing is foreclosed. The artisan trait is vivid; the person remains untested.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The piece follows a clear accumulative/textural lens: each sensory layer adds density until the final image of the restored drone reweights the stake of “making broken things whole.” Orientation is immediate; causality is internal to the craft logic and holds. Closure arrives as Charged Poise—the hummingbird hums, Mercantile departs, mist lingers, options reconfigure around her continuing labor. Cost is felt obliquely (she stays while the world sails), but the beat is soft; hence not yet 7+.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The rail-depot-mist harbor is rendered through tactile, sonic, and thermal detail; every descriptor is filtered by Mara's non-visual attention. The basin of water becomes a micro-setting that actively constrains and enables her diagnostic choices, qualifying for 9+ gate, yet the environment never tightens or endangers—it merely hosts. Spatial choreography stays clean; fog, tracks, and ship horn track logically across paragraphs. The atmosphere is immersive but static; it supports mood more than stakes.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The dominant stake—“restore this drone to wholeness”—is signaled early and deepened through micro-obstacles (wing crack, motor stutter), but pressure stays technical, never personal or urgent. No visible price is paid: time, money, reputation, or physical risk never tilt. The Mercantile’s departure offers a tonal contrast, not a complication. Escalation is present but gentle; the final hum feels like expected success, not narrowed options.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges quietly: translation of invisible damage into reparable form, paralleling Mara's own adaptation to blindness. The hummingbird’s restored flight and the departing freight ship create a resonant counter-image of mobility versus rooted craftsmanship. No statement of meaning is imposed; the reader completes the equation. The after-effect is contemplative rather than charged, keeping the score shy of 8+.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Mara's tactile perception; diction favors concrete verbs (“whispered,” “whirred,” “refracted”) and avoids visual clichés. Rhythm modulates between long sensuous sentences and short repair commands, mirroring the work’s flow. No dialogue means no voice convergence issue. A perceptual signature is clear, but syntax occasionally drifts into workshop-manual register (“thorax panel,” “synthetic feathers”) that flattens lyric possibility.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, with high information density: each sentence advances tool, body, or atmosphere. Metaphors are spare and accurate (“mist like a breathing thing”). Paraphrase loops are absent; no filter-verb clusters stall immediacy. Minor scaffold appears in repeated “she adjusted / she selected / she returned” triplet, but it lies outside the closure beat and does not obscure causality. Overall read-aloud rhythm is controlled and propulsive.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>The blind-artisan-meets-broken-drone premise is fresh, yet the execution follows a familiar restorative arc without surprising turns. The water-refraction diagnostic method is the story’s most original inflection, specific to Mara’s blindness and tightly shown. Freight-ship horn as temporal heartbeat is evocative but not transformative. Risk level is moderate: concept delights, yet plot and emotional arc could transplant to another broken object with minimal revision.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Setup: “Mara's repair shop” first line. Development: every tool choice and water test is filtered through artisan knowledge. Closure: the final hum validates her craft. Cost: perpetual labor while the world sails. Indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Present in opening beat, drives two diagnostic turns (wing patch, motor sweep), returns in closure with reweighted meaning—now flight-ready. Its iridescent fragility mirrors theme. Swappable object would lose precise avian imagery.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Shop governs spatial logic, tool access, and social identity (“her shop in the rail depot”). Tactics—basin, microwelder, charging station—are shop-bound. Final image roots her in place while the world leaves. Central to logic.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Blindness is not label but method: water-refraction reading, fingertip welds, auditory drop-test. Constrains every move and enables the diagnostic brilliance. Closing smile carries quiet cost: she will never see the drone fly.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Patch act is the story’s middle hinge—wing integrity restored, refraction pattern changes. Without it motor fix would fail; story would stall. Physical detail (“microwelder to the wing’s edge”) is specific and non-generic.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Method seeded in paragraph 3, executed in two beats, determines success. Mechanics—sun angle, ripple temperature, vibration geography—are shown, not told. Final smooth refraction confirms closure. Could not swap for generic scan.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.3</grade>
<comment>Mist and depot supply sonic/tactile texture but never constrain choices or impose delay; they serve mood. Horn echo provides temporal marker yet alters no tactics. Setting is vivid but replaceable without plot break.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Maiden-voyage horn creates a living clock, marking story’s duration and offering symbolic counter-motion. However, Mara's workflow proceeds unchanged; anchor lift does not tighten her deadline or force speed. Timefelt but not pressuresome.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Desire to “decode feedback into direction” is stated and dramatized in every diagnostic micro-choice. No competing want complicates it; hence lacks friction.Still, the motive directly pilots every beat and the ending hum.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>Magnetic calm governs Mara's interior weather and prose cadence, modulating slightly under weld heat but never breaking. Tone remains steady while world moves, creating a Charged Poise closure. Could use modulation under obstacle to earn higher band.</comment>
