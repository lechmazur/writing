<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Maya’s quietly rebellious trait is shown through her forbidden visit and obsessive drumming; her interiority is sensory and specific ("sound waves bloom like flowers, like ghosts, like her grandmother’s hands"). The braided memories create a credible layered self, yet the 13-in-1 chorus stays observational—no single memory forces a micro-choice that changes her next move. The ending’s "she would return tomorrow" is an endurance stance, but the cost feels assumed rather than freshly paid on this page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens: the piece accumulates sensory memory-fragments until the final drumming crystallizes a Charged Poise—Maya accepts the crushing/beautiful load and vows to keep returning. Causality is interior and recursive rather than linear, satisfying the lens. Orientation is swift; the garden, lagoon, and silent-hour rule are anchored by line 5. The cost is legible in the closing image of sore fingers and auroral sorrow, foreclosing the option of letting the chorus fade.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Sound-wave garden and auric lagoon are built through touch and vibration, not postcard visuals; their physics ("sound sculpted reality itself") constrain what Maya can do—only drumming lets her meet the dead. Micro-setting of her body (aching fingers) becomes the final anchor. Starlight and dawn are used sparingly to shade temporal edges. No environmental detail is wasted; each ripple or color is paired with an action that advances memory-bleed.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake: can Maya keep the 13 entangled souls alive inside her without shattering herself? Pressure escalates through density—each paragraph adds another voice until "the weight of it bore down with auroral sorrow." The tightening is her sore fingers, the dawn deadline, and the vow to return; no external antagonist, but the internal load visibly costs. Agency stays internal and accumulative, matching the lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges as the price of voluntary surrogacy for the dying: "that’s what guinea pigs do—they survive the experiment, and then they prove what’s possible." No moralizing; the final line reweights the premise, turning consent into cyclical duty. Subtext lives in the drumming—an act of creation that is also gradual self-erasure. The auroral sorrow tone carries the conceptual cost without needing to name grief.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Lush yet controlled lyric third-person stays close to Maya’s sensory filter; diction ("cosmic hush," "tissue-paper boundary") remains within a poet-patient’s lexicon. Rhythm swells and contracts with the drumming beats, echoing the wave imagery. No dialogue, so voice distinction is judged through interior cadence alone—consistent. Minor register lift in "conceptual hush" is earned by the speculative frame.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong read-aloud rhythm; sentences vary in length to mimic wave crest and trough. Information density is high—every line performs at least two jobs (e.g., "She drummed her way deeper… watching the sound waves bloom"). Two near-metaphors ("colors that shouldn’t exist," "impossible moment") are allowed lyric heightening. No loops or scaffold; one mixed vehicle ("auroral sorrow, beautiful and crushing as the northern lights") is permissible in accumulative mode.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: memory transplantation rendered as visible sound sculpture. The "sound wave garden" trope is transformed into a tactile memory-lagoon where grief becomes percussion. Stakes hinge on volunteered entanglement rather than dystopian coercion, giving the premise moral complexity. Final reprise of guinea-pig agency flips lab-subject trope into existential choice.</comment>
