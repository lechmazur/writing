<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The carpenter’s muteness is more atmospheric label than operative flaw; her “quietly persistent” trait is shown in steady work, but no contradictory impulse ever jeopardizes that steadiness, so interior conflict stays flat. The seven-year silence is cited repeatedly yet never complicates the present action—she never hesitates, doubts, or chooses speech at cost—so the renunciation feels pre-paid rather than earned in-scene.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands cleanly: the manual crank becomes the Decisive Change—song released, ride turning—charged by the halo’s refracted light as visible cost. Causal chain is slim (wrong turn → find ride → restore → sing) but sufficient for the lyric-accumulative lens; the “wrong turn” is foreshadowed by vanished paths, so coincidence is framed, not cheats. Orientation is secured by word 50; no ambiguity at end.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Micro-setting mastery: the crimson car, brass poles, and wind bells are not backdrop but tools that constrain her repair sequence and refract the final gleam. Blackberry thorns, mist, and willow shade are sensory selected to mirror her sealed throat and later opening. The halo fragment’s material properties (gilt, half-circle, light-catcher) charge the closure image decisively; remove it and the resonance collapses.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“can she coax sound from silence?”—is signaled early and tightened once: the moment she hums, stakes flip from mechanical restoration to self-restoration. Cost is legible—her own body becomes the instrument that risks breaking the seven-year vow—but external pressure is muted; no consequence looms if she fails, so escalation is poetic rather than tactical.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: restoration is translation of absence into motion; the final spinning carousel re-prices silence as generative, not vacant. Image-pattern (mist, dust motes, halo gleam) recurs to reweight meaning at closure; no moralizing sentence mars the exit. The tacit equation of broken horses / broken voice gives the concept bite beyond metaphor.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric voice sustains a hushed, consonant-rich cadence that mimics breath held then released; diction stays within a carpenter’s sensory lexicon (wire, gears, polish). No filter-verb stacks; elision (“tools clinked softly in their leather roll”) is taught early and paid off in the final soft throat-song. Perceptual signature is unmistakable: she notices grain, paint fade, brass dullness—never tourist vistas.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies from long mist-laden clauses to clipped tool-verbs; no template cadence detected. Figurative control high—“mist threading between cattails,” “sound like water remembering music”—and never mixed. One scaffold spot: “she cleaned each horse, repaired the broken drive chain, oiled the ancient gears” could compress, but it falls outside the closure beat, so artifact does not touch final image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Familiar trope—mute artisan revives ruined carnival ride—is transfigured by sensory specificity and the hinge that her own voice becomes the missing component. The halo fragment as half-ring crowned on the ride offers a fresh physical object that literalizes “restoring the crown” of speech. Wrong-turn discovery risks cliché, but the wind-bell oasis and crimson car’s impossible freshness recast it as lyric inevitability rather than contrivance.</comment>
