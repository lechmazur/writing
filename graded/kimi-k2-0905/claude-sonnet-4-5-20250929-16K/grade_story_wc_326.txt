<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Marcus’s post-mortem counting tic is concrete and idiosyncratic, anchoring interiority; the porcelain shard functions as an embodied bridge to grandmother, motivating the ink ritual; the renunciation—placing the shard in the mandala—earns resonance because the beat links prior grief to present release, showing visible cost as the ink darkens the fragment. Yet the “digital ghost” is explained away clinically, never acting as contradictory impulse or error, so the interior conflict stays single-note; the therapist label “chaos magic” momentarily flattens voice into diagnostic speak during the pivotal ritual, keeping the score shy of 7+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: Marcus stops counting—an Earned Stasis that costs him his numeric shield and reconfigures survival as acceptance; the porcelain shard embedded in fading ink makes the price visible. Orientation is secure by 120 words (observatory, snow, radio telescope). Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: heartbeat tally and ink patterns accumulate until pattern break (stillness) reweights stakes. No causality break; the ghost is explanatory texture, not plot hinge. Meets 9+ quick test except the cost sentence is implicit in image rather than declarative, so caps at 8.4.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Opal floor, dome glazed with moonlight, sub-zero air biting palms, radio hum—selective sensory triangulation guides ritual choice; the shard’s jagged edge and ink’s viscosity constrain gesture, while winter cold limits duration of exposure. Micro-setting (shard and ink) literally charges the final image when the shard drinks the mandala. Observatory scale is sketched, not over-toured; cold and silence externalize the internal defragment process, tightening atmosphere to theme without overwriting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: reassemble identity after death-error; pressure tightens when ink hits opal—only one shot before pattern evaporates. Micro-turn: seeing grandmother’s pattern forces renunciation of counting safety. Cost is credible (loss of numeric armor, shard surrendered to void). Agency is attention/ritual endurance rather than external battle; escalation accrues via heartbeat tally and ink spread until silence crystallizes stance. Could reach 8+ if cost were verbally acknowledged on page; as is, price is imagistic but legible.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</question><comment>Theme emerges organically: life/death borders are permeable, patterns temporary; wisdom is letting go of absolute certainties (counting, shard). Subtext carried in ink bloom and heartbeat silence; no moralizing final sentence. The fade of grandmother’s face reweights prior grief without statement; midnight solace tone underpins thematic acceptance. Ambiguity lingers—was vision neural or mystical—inviting reflection while remaining coherent.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</question><comment>Third-person limited adheres tightly to Marcus’s perceptual lens: numbers as breath, ink as cosmos, cold as thought. Diction—“opal throat of winter,” “fractals blooming”—stays within an obsessive, astronomy-tuned mind. Rhythm accelerates with parataxis during counting, then lengthens into stillness, mirroring cardiac slowdown. No head-hop; free indirect style clean. Distinctive, coherent, and purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</question><comment>Syntactic variety and vivid verbs (“dome catching moonlight like a pearl,” “ink splashed…fractals blooming”) propel reading. Occasional modifier stacks (“ephemeral patterns, fractals blooming and dissolving”) flirt with purple but fit ritual crescendo; no metaphor contradiction. One paraphrase loop: “since the hospital declared him dead, then frantically corrected the certificate” restates same fact; minor. No scaffold; information dense; final paragraph rhythm breathes effectively. Safe for 8- territory save for slight overgrowth mid-ritual.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</question><comment>Fusion of radio-astronomy, near-death admin error, and ink-pattern necromancy feels fresh; grandmother encoded in liquid fractals is not a trope catalog entry. Conceptual risk—lyric over causal—pays off via taught heartbeat pattern and final image. Specificity of observatory porcelain under snow ties scene to singular voice; premise could not swap settings without collapse. Minor echo of “static clears, hear universe breathing” motif in literary sf, but transformed through personal grief lens, so only light deduction.</comment>
