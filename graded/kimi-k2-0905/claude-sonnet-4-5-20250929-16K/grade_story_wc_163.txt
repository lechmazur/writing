<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Mara’s interior contradiction—astrologer turned marine-pattern hunter—lives in her handling of the burnt feather; her “softly ingenious” trait enables the power-core discovery we hear about but never see, muting cost. Chen is a courteous sounding board, not a pressure source, so relationship crucible is thin. The final shared exhale crystallizes belonging, but the earned price is atmospheric, not personal.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as resonant reconfiguration: artificial dawn + bioluminescent bloom reweight belonging without social negotiation; cost is conceptual—outsider identity dissolves in shared wonder. Lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern of cross-species correspondence tightens once, no causal reversals. Orientation anchors in first 120 w (feather, dome, depth, salt, twenty-year gap). No contradiction, but the missing on-page beat where Mar’s method actually finds the core keeps the cost softer than high-band hit.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Environment functions as micro-setting: observation dome glass and water column constrain what can be seen, force nocturnal schedule, and supply the bloom reveal. Barnacle density, kelp-coffee, salt-dark mystery—vivid selective detail filtered through professional curiosity. Spatial choreography clean; no impossible geography. Final image of choreography bloom charges closure; qualifies 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Single dominant stake—belonging—signaled in paragraph 1; tightens once when plankton bloom offers “recognition” rather than data proof. Agency is attention/renunciation of outsider stance; cost is conceptual, not tactical. No visible resource lost; hence stays below 8-band entry.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from convergent patterns: sky maps, jellyfish lanes, architecture as love letter to non-human navigation. Subtext in Chen’s hand-squeeze replaces declaration. Final image answers core question—belonging is spatial & mutual participation—without moralizing; ambiguity preserved. Avoids thematic echo penalty.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Narrative voice carries perceptual signature: star-terrain conjunction lexicon, salt-dark coinage, softly ingenious self-tag. Free indirect clean; no filter clutter. Compression in kelp-coffee phrase teaches pattern early, paid off in synthetic dawn rhythm. Single POV stable; no head-hop.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</question>
<comment>Rhythmic variety: long lyrical sentences intercut with fragment beats (“Look,”). High density: feather image does triple duty—fire souvenir, magnetic echo, belonging talisman. One paraphrase loop: “rhythm of belonging” echoed without new pressure, mild. No metaphor clash; closure line crisp. Lyric prose stays legible under accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Synthesis of astrology + ley-line marine ecology feels fresh; reverse colonization of human city by non-human navigation routes. Risk in lyric density pays off without clarity loss. Could edge higher if the power-core discovery had been dramatized to prove method, but premise transformation clear.</comment>
