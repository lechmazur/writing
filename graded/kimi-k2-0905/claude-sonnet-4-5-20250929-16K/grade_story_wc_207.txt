<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Mara’s shift from factory commodification to reverence for unbottle-able scent is dramatized through micro-choices—squeezing sideways into the crack, uncorking vials of cavern breath. The “sensibly eccentric” label is shown: she keeps practical vials yet kneels to collect intangible stone tears. Interiority is specific—her fingers “catching on calcified protrusions,” the compass “trembled in her hand.” Cost is legible: leaving the compass, she forfeits certitude, accepting mystery as the new working material.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/lyric lens: scent motifs tighten from factory petrichor to cavern “stone tears,” re-weighting stakes without causal reversals. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—she seals vials of anti-commodity scent, foreclosing synthesis forever; cost is the compass abandoned to darkness. Orientation is clear by line 3; no teleporting props. One minor causal elision: how she instantly recognizes the lagoon as the compass’s destination reads as accepted psychometric logic rather than gap.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>The limestone quarry-cathedral, dripping weeping stone, and black mirror-lagoon are tactile, pressure-generating environments that constrain her sideways crawl and vial placement. The compass and vials act as micro-settings, their cold brass and glass dictating hand-position and ritual pace. Sensory selection stays POV-bound—she notices mineral moisture, not biology. Final image of compass resting on shore re-weights earlier “depths” motif, qualifying for 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</comment><comment>Dominant stake—can she collect meaning that refuses commodification—emerges in first paragraph and deepens when she chooses cavern breath over factory rain. Escalation is accumulative: each vial fills with progressively less marketable scent, tightening the paradox of capturing the uncapturable. The closing renunciation (leaving compass, sealing anti-product) pays visible cost: she exits with only experiential capital. No reversal, but a cadence shift from acquisition to relinquishment suffices under lyric lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</question><comment>Theme emerges from the pivot of scent itself: from sellable petrichor to stone tears that dissolve profit. No explicit thesis; the final image of abandoned compass and sealed unprofitable air re-prices her prior life. Subtext whispers in gestures—the compass quieting only after she abandons synthesis. Complex ambiguity lingers: mystery kept intact is both loss and liberation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</question><comment>Perceptual signature is chemically poetic—“bottling petrichor in sterile containers,” “electric anticipation before rainfall in a place that had forgotten sky.” Syntax mirrors mineral patience: long clauses accrete like limestone, then drop into single-sentence paragraphs that mimic water drips. No head-hopping; distance stays close-third. Register remains within ex-perfumer’s lexicon. Final cadence—“pure, patient singing of water against ancient rock”—is earned lyric climax.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</question><comment>Strong rhythm variety; sentence lengths replicate drip-pause sequence. No loops or synonym churn. Figurative language is sparse, purposeful—“cathedral-sized absences” condenses scale and sacred in one stroke. One mixed metaphor crack: “mirror of black water beneath a dome of weeping stone” stacks mirror/dome without visual contradiction, but still reads as intentional awe-build rather than clutter.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Fresh synthesis: industrial petrichor chemist meets psychometric caving to collect literally unmarketable scent. Compass-as-psychometric-key and seven vials for “seven hinges of awakening” avoid gimmick by grounding in sensory procedure. Risk of overt mysticism is countered by technical diction. Specificity makes the concept inseparable from this character/place; swap any detail and the emotional alchemy collapses.</comment>
