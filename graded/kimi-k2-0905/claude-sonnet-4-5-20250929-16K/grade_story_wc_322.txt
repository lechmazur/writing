<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Marina’s interiority is vivid—her calm methodical movements against the brother-loss ache—but the “texture of connection” quest is declared more than dramatized; no contradictory micro-choice on the final tying-off beat, so the renunciation feels slightly under-earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/lyric lens holds: each thread-layer thickens perceptual density until the gallery itself reconfigures; closure lands as Charged Poise—the shared pocket of reality is felt, not explained—cost is the gallery’s seizure of her future nights and the brother’s still-translucent presence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Optical-illusion gallery is sensuously traced: sinew glints, stairs loop, Penrose shadow sharpens into the boy; environment actively rewrites itself around her touch, constraining every subsequent threading motion and charging the final fold where walls breathe.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can she weave a space where two incompatible minds overlap—tightens as thread frequency rises; the single deepening (gallery turns living) forecloses retreat; price is her own absorption into the pattern, visible in her translucent older reflection.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without thesis: connection is an architecture you build, not a force you find; the closing image of handing warmth through non-touch reweights earlier metaphysics into tactile poignancy, avoiding moral sermon.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is controlled and lyric, favoring elliptical compression; perceptual signature—“rational enchantments,” “subsonic…through bone”—stays consistent; no head-hop; rhythm modulates from calm methodical to hushed awe without syntactic monotony.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud cadence varies; sentences carry double duty (density + atmosphere); occasional elevated register (“ineffable quality”) fits art-world POV; one scaffold echo—“thread began to sing / sang louder”—minor, doesn’t dull closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: preserved human sinew as sculptural medium + Escher topology = literalized empathy; brother-schizophrenia folded into optical illusion stakes feels inevitable, not grafted; risk in treating connection as weave-able pays off in final haptic epiphany.</comment>
