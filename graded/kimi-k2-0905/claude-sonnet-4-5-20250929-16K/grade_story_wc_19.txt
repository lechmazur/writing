<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Lina’s claustrophobia and hunger for “openness” supply a vivid contradiction, but the interiority drifts into lyric abstraction (“tasted like honey and sounded like light”) without embodied cost. No secondary character applies live pressure, so the crucible is self-only; the closing uplift feels willed rather than paid for by a visible forfeiture.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the gilded hush is physically harvested, re-weighting her father’s bunkered world. Causal chain is thin—flower sprouts because water was spilled earlier—but the pattern is taught early and the hourglass of inversion gives the beat its cost. Orientation is clear by line 5; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>The xenial trellis is both setting and tool: it literally suspends her above the inverted earth and furnishes the only place the gilded flower can bloom. Sensory economy favors touch and motion over visual catalog; spatial choreography never wavers. Micro-setting (porcelain doll) doubles as environment, constraining every silence-transfer beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—capture the gilded hush—signals early and tightens once when the gravity flip starts the flower. Escalation is situational: external pressure (inversion) forces stance crystallization rather than because/therefore turns. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral; hence entry-high but not apex.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Theme—compression vs. expansion—emerges through the father’s bunkers versus the sky-garden bloom; no final moral states it. The porcelain doll’s reprise at closure reweights “enclosure” from prison to vessel. Subtext stays in gesture: corking silence is tacit acceptance of her dread rather than cure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric tight to Lina’s sensorium; perceptual signature favors tactile and proprioceptive detail (“stomach float,” “vine loops”). Rhythm flexes with inversion—long clauses ascend, clipped fragments mark return of weight. No dialogue to test, yet voice remains consistent and patterned compression is taught and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>High information density: single sentences layer image, motion, and world rule (“clouds drifted below her feet”). One paraphrase loop (“silence…silence”) early; otherwise no scaffold. Figurative language peaks at the bloom beat but stays coherent. Final line cleanly recharges “stretching contracted” motif.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Gravity-inversion garden is fresh, but “flavor-collecting doll” verges on twee without deeper consequence. The synthesis of claustrophobia with anti-grav horticulture feels singular; however, thematic payoff is gentle rather than revelatory. Risk stays conceptual—safe terrain for elite venues, not boundary-breaking.</comment>
