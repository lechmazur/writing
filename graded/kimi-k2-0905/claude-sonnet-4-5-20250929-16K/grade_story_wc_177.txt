<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The protagonist’s interiority is evocative—“she let herself slip sideways out of time”—but remains atmospheric rather than contradictory; no concrete micro-choice under pressure shows her values colliding. The moment of revelation is passively received in dream, so the decisive change is not visibly earned by prior agency. Still, her perceptual voice is singular and consistent, and the final acquiescence carries a lightly felt cost. It suffices for a short lyric arc but stops short of crucible-level character work.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story lands a clean Conceptual Repricing closure: the rule-set reverses—paths dream walkers, not vice versa—delivered in a charged cadence with undeniable conceptual cost. Causality is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of “finding by not seeking” and storm timing tighten the stake without because/therefore turns. Orientation is swift; lens holds. The only drag is the dream-transfer beat that softens protagonist agency; luck, not decision, triggers insight, keeping it shy of 8+.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Vine-draped bunker, rain through ceiling holes, moss-thick murals—each detail is filtered through the seer’s bias and braided into action (she lies down where roots finger through). The bunker micro-setting literally enables the dream ingress and reappears in the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography stays crisp; no weather clichés. Economy is good; one paragraph could be cut without loss, capping at 8.3.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—why paths pick walkers—arrives early and tightens once: storm clock + fading directive create a now-or-never pressure. Protagonist’s agency is largely receptive (dream delivers answer), so the visible price is conceptual rather than a forfeited option. Escalation is atmospheric, not tactical; nevertheless the storm’s arrival coincides with seal-break, linking time to knowledge gain. Sufficient for 600-word lyric mode but lacks a mid-story pivot that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</question><grade><comment>Theme emerges obliquely—choice versus predestination—via concrete reversal rather than statement. Directive’s dying whisper and the closing “it hardly mattered which anymore” reweight earlier images without moralizing. No motif is forced; vines, storm, bunker all accrue rather than announce meaning. The conceptual bite is real, but resonance is brief; a tad more character-specific loss would deepen after-effect.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person omniscient stays close to seer’s synesthetic perception—electric smell, sideways slip—without head-hop. Syntax flexes from lush (“moss-thick and patient”) to staccato final line, modulating with pressure. No dialogue to fault. The one filter-verb cluster (“she understood… she saw…”) is justified by visionary content. Distinct, consistent, and teachable by line 3.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</question><comment>Prose is lyrical yet propulsive; mixed metaphors are disciplined (“canopy overhead into a churning green sea” reads fine). No loops, no scaffold, clean grammar. Two adjacent sentences open with “She…”—minor template cadence, not closure-touching. Information density high; each sentence layers image or knowledge. A near miss for 9+ due to slight overgrowth in figurative density during storm paragraph, slowing momentum a breath.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The “paths dream the walker” conceit flips a familiar fate debate into lived cosmic irony, then grounds it in tactile bunker detail. Synthesis feels inevitable yet non-obvious; no trope checklist residue. Risk—lyric dream ingress as climax—pays off via conceptual reprice. Freshness would sharpen further if one mundane object inside the bunker also inverted its expected use, but still comfortably publishable in top tier.</comment>
