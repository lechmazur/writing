<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority—the “anxious elation,” the memory of being dismissed as “purposefully curious”—is concrete and embodied. The scar-link with Chen crystallizes her drive and supplies a visible cost. The final renunciation (“we were never meant to stop the future”) is causally seeded. Minor slip: “root-bound visionary” is label-only until the final paragraph; still, contradiction and micro-choice are present under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the crystalline maze reconfigures their collective stance with undeniable conceptual cost (“the living intersection”). Causal chain holds: because they dreamed together, therefore the glade materializes; because they build, they reframe their brokenness. Orientation lock arrives by word 80. Lens is Causal throughout; no timeline or prop drift. Cost is palpable in the shared scar glow and the forfeiture of a normal body.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The cobalt glade is more than postcard: its light literally guides the maze-build and reflects their scar-glow, charging the final image. Wheelchair, clipping, and scar serve as micro-settings that constrain motion and tactile choice. Spatial choreography stays clean as Chen kneels, others emerge, and the crystalline maze grows from their hands. Dusk timing tightens the visual stakes without cliché.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—navigate the future by rebuilding the maze—is signaled in paragraph 2 and tightened when the scar-link proves the covenant real. One meaningful turn: Mara moves from isolated seer to co-builder, foreclosing retreat into mere prophecy. Cost is visible: bodies remain broken, pain re-ignited by scar-glow. Escalation is causal under lens; no coincidence resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: severed topiary, shared scars, and crystallized possibility argue that fracture can become map. Subtext is carried by touch and light rather than thesis. Final image reweights “purposefully curious” from insult to necessity without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers: the future is still lethal, but navigation is now communal.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Third-person close stays anchored in Mara’s perceptual bias: light shimmers “with an impossible luminescence,” shadows “like fingers toward her wheelchair.” Syntax lengthens under wonder, shortens under scar-jolt. No head-hopping; Chen’s interiority arrives only through the shared touch she experiences. Diction stays within her lexicon; no register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet fluid: “cobalt glade shimmered with an impossible luminescence” packs sight, color, and emotional charge in one stroke. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or choice. Metaphors are coherent—shadow-fingers, crystallized possibility—and culminate in the final maze without muddle. Rhythm modulates: longer lyrical cadence for awe, staccato for scar-jolt.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The “Acceleration” premise—future arriving forty years early—reframes familiar cli-fi trauma into body-horror epistemology: broken bodies become antennae. Using a topiary clipping as the seed for a time-map is fresh and specific. Scar-networking as somatic Wi-Fi transforms disability trope into visionary conduit. Risky crystalline maze pays off by reconfiguring stakes rather than explaining them.</comment>
