<comment>Marcus’s quiet competence and ghost-vision are credibly braided; the childhood memory of ceiling letters seeds his obsession without overtelling. His micro-choice to climb and expose the tin ceiling is the hinge that earns the ghost’s release. Interiority stays concrete—“buildings exhaled”—and the cost of carrying “weightless burden” into daylight lands. Voice slips once into averaged prose (“Some repairs…everything to do”), but overall he reads as a lone, specific man acting under spectral pressure.</comment>

<comment>Causal chain is clean: ghost appears → mainspring found → ceiling map read → box retrieved → truth released. Each step is because/therefore, no coincidence resolves conflict. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the elevator exhales, photos secure, ghost fades—cost is the lifelong secrecy Marcus now shoulders. The mainspring’s earlier mechanical grip and final loosening frames the before/after with felt, conceptual price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Ticket office reeks of rust/popcorn, elevator shaft glints with oily detail; body-as-setting shows dust patterns under nails. The mainspring-as-micro-setting literally jams then frees the pulley, constraining Marcus’s tactics. Spatial choreography holds: ladder, tiles, box, phone-cam all tracked. Final image of “weightless burden” recharges ceiling motif; environment enforces choice and closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—uncover buried truth—tightens once: ceiling fracture map read → box retrieved → insurance-fraud photos exposed. Escalation is causal, not repeated; each new discovery forecloses retreat. Ghost’s urgency supplies external pressure; Marcus’s professionalism supplies agency. Cost is legible: he alone will carry seventy-year guilt into daylight, a visible price paid on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from particulars: ceilings hide sins, elevators carry more than bodies, mechanical hearts remember. Subtext in the ghost’s flicker and the mainspring’s fused/loosened states comments on memory versus evidence. No moralizing; the final “weightless burden” reweights the premise without sermon. Complexity lingers: justice served yet scars remain unfaced by the living world.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person close keeps steady psychic distance; perceptual signature is tool- and dust-centric, never tourist-catalog. Syntax tightens under ceiling work: “He crouching…ancient mechanism.” No head-hop; ghost’s dialogue is spare, goal-driven. Register stays within repair-tech lexicon; final reflection drifts slightly editorial but recovers with image. Voice distinct enough to remember.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Prose breathes with scene needs: slow dust sentences vs. staccato tile removal. Density high—“horologist’s mainspring barrel, impossibly intricate, wedged…” does triple duty. One template cadence spotted (“Marcus nodded…Marcus asked…Marcus documented”) but short and early; closure beat is clean. Metaphors stay physical and consistent; no mixed vehicles. Read-aloud rhythm solid.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Ghost-seeing elevator tech + circus arson + mainspring evidence is fresh synthesis, not trope checklist. Specificity—“sequined costume flickering like damaged film reel”—grounds the spectral in mechanical decay. Risk of sentimental ghost story is averted by cold-tool POV and insurance-fraud cynicism. Transformation test passes: swap settings and the whole armature collapses.</comment>
