<comment>Marcus’s “resiliently positive” trait is shown through daily ritual (turning the empty hourglass) and active listening to the radio; his interiority stays concrete (“memorizing their faces, learning their stories”). The final choice—broadcasting passenger names in pattern—grows directly from these habits, paying a visible cost in three lost years. No internal contradiction is dramatized in-scene, and Captain Reeves remains a translucent accessory rather than a crucible, capping the upper band.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: sand grains re-appear while forty-seven passengers re-materialize, proving “nothing truly disappears.” The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern density (radio frequencies, seat rituals) reweights the stake until parallel timelines collapse. Causality is soft (the grotto channel “opens” without setup), but the final image reconfigures meaning with felt cost. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are clear by line 3; no teleporting props.</question>

<comment>The empty hourglass and bioluminescent grotto constrain Marcus’s tactics: he navigates by “currents only he seemed to sense” and times the radio broadcast to limestone constellations. Salt-spray, translucent captain, and noon-day stars create a tactile, unstable ferry that mirrors fractured time. Spatial choreography stays clean—seats 12, radio mount, channel in harbor wall track without drift. The hourglass’s final refilling charges the closure image, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—restore scattered passengers—signals early and tightens through pattern accumulation: coffee orders, seat numbers, newspapers. One meaningful deepening: Marcus realizes “each grain a passenger” in the grotto, shifting tactic from passive listening to active multi-frequency broadcast. Cost is visible (three years gone, captain half-ghost) and alters later tactics. No reversal or external antagonist, but accumulative pressure suffices under Textural lens.</comment>

<comment>Theme emerges non-literally: routine as cosmic stitch-work—daily commuter habits become the filament that rewinds fractured time. The hourglass reprises with reweighted meaning (empty → full) rather than authorial statement. Subtext in radio static—“voices from ferry routes that shouldn’t exist”—implies order within apparent chaos. Final line avoids moralizing, offering charged poise: “waiting for someone stubborn enough to call it home.”</comment>

<comment>Third-person limited stays tightly latched to Marcus’s perceptual signature: “salt spray,” “radio crackling,” “limestone constellations” reflect his mariner sensorium. No head-hopping; Captain Reeves is externally observed. Syntax grows clipped under pressure—“I’ve got something”—mirroring radio brevity. Distinct maritime diction (“pilothouse,” “deckhand,” “grotto”) remains consistent; no filter-verb clusters.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and propulsive: “The ferry shuddered. Mrs. Chen materialized…” uses sentence fragmentation to accelerate reintegration. Metaphors stay sensory and coherent—“outline shimmering like heat waves.” No paraphrase loops or synonym churn; information dual-loads (action + atmosphere) without scaffolding. Final line cadence repeats “waiting…call it home,” a deliberate echo that recharges the opening ritual.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: commuter ferry as quantum loom, where daily banalities (coffee orders, seat choices) become the map to splice timelines. Hourglass-as-dispersed-passengers re-invents the tired time-sand trope. Risky accumulative structure pays off when pattern, not punch-line, resolves the fracture. Specificity of ferry culture (tickets, violin case, unnamed businessman) grounds the speculative engine. Transformation test fails if moved to subway or airport—maritime circuitry is essential.</comment>
