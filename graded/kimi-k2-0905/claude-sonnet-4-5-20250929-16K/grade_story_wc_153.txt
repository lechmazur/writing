<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Isla’s longing is embodied in her clutching the unsent letters, and the memory-vision lets us see the trembling hope she once missed; the apology she chooses at the end is causally linked to that new knowledge, so the arc is earned. The medium stays more archetype than individual, but her function is to catalyze, not to decide, so the slight flatness is acceptable at this length. Overall, credible interiority and a visible cost on the page lift this above mid-band; only the medium’s lack of contradiction keeps it from 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Closure is clean and resonant: the final image of Isla running “toward reconciliation” crystallizes a Charged Poise—options re-weighted, cost felt—under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality holds: the shard + moonlight beat evokes the memory, which re-visions the moment before choosing, which in turn authorizes the apology now speaking itself through her. No orientation debt; anchors (who/where/when) land by line 5. One minor slack: the “letters as portals” rule is asserted rather than dramatized in advance, but the condensation window pays it off vividly enough. Cost is unmistakable in the final stride toward the living world, foreclosing continued silence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The mangrove roots, brackish silver water, and hanging window are selective, sensory, and filter through Isla’s urgency; the gargoyle shard is handled twice and its eight-century storm memory directly charges the closure image. Spatial choreography stays clean—no impossible positions—as the path of spirits’ song guides her out. Environment functions as micro-setting that alters tactics: the spirits literally provide the exit route once the apology is voiced. Meets the 9+ gate requirement that a recurring object constrain choice and charge the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—will she reclaim the unspoken apology?—is signaled in paragraph 1. Pressure tightens once: the shard’s moon-lit memory forces a re-seeing that collapses her old self-justification. Cost is visible—she runs, letters in both hands, toward an uncertain living encounter—but the tightening is single, not iterative, so escalation is modest but sufficient. Under Accumulative lens, the cadence shift from spectral stasis to forward motion re-weights the stake cleanly.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: silence versus spoken tenderness is enacted, not preached, through the mirrored unsent letters and the condensation reply. The final image of “fierce tenderness that had survived everything, even silence” offers a non-literal, resonant answer without moralizing. Subtext lives in gesture—her sister’s trembling hands seen only in hindsight. No thematic echo penalties; the one line approaching thesis (“The apology isn’t waiting unspoken—it’s speaking itself…”) is justified by the medium’s cryptic voice and is not a closing sermon.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tightly glued to Isla’s perception; no head-hops. Diction is lyrical yet precise—“brackish water silver,” “crystalline and perfect”—matching the ghostly aperture mood. Rhythm modulates: longer clauses for trance, short bursts for the final run. Dialogue is minimal but carries layered song-like indirection consistent with the medium’s oracle tone. Meets 9+ quick test: perceptual signature is distinct and stable under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm is fluid with varied sentence openings; no template cadence detected. Figurative density is high but patterned early (“roots twisted like frozen thoughts”) and paid off in closure condensation image, so no −0.3. No mixed metaphors or synonym loops. Information density strong: one sentence often does scene + metaphor + interiority. Tiny scaffold: “the space where…” phrase repeats twice; barely grazes −0.1. Closure beat is crystalline and uncluttered, satisfying high-band entry.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>The unsent-letters-as-portals + gargoyle-memory + spirits’ song synthesis feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight; no direct pop-culture echoes. Risk-taking (lyric ghost-vision, non-causal memory ingress) heightens meaning without obscuring clarity, earning the within-band +0.3. Could edge toward 9 if the medium’s shells or the cathedral’s provenance were tied to a sharper, non-generic mythology, but specificity is already above median.</comment>
