<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Vera’s contradictory impulses—guilt over the Meridian seeds and her addiction to quantum uncertainty—play out in embodied beats: she physically tests the pen against the console, fingers the split nib, rewrites the data. Her micro-choice to send all seven contingent histories at once crystallizes her hierarchy of values: truth-as-multiplicity over single-score success. The cost is legible: she forfeits the safety of one “right” answer and accepts permanent professional ambiguity. Interiority avoids label-speak; “confidently uncertain” is shown through repeated on-page wagers, not self-diagnosis.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the final image of the double nib catching bent starlight reweights every prior misreading into deliberate plurality. Causal chain holds: pen triggers screen flicker → rewritten signals → settlers adapt → Vera’s stance crystallizes. Orientation is clean by word 60. No teleporting props; the pen’s exotic metal is seeded in grandfather’s box before it alters the console. Cost is unmistakable—she abandons the possibility of ever being simply “right,” a conceptual forfeiture rendered in the last sentence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Gravitational anomaly functions as micro-setting: its warped light literally bends the pen’s trail across the screen, constraining how edits can be drawn. The cramped observation pod is sketched through selective sensory load—ache-inducing light, sulfur scent memory, flickering console—rather than inventory description. Meridian’s acidic soil is never seen, yet its consequences pressure the pod via polite settler messages, keeping geography functionally off-stage but causally active. The split-nib pen’s physical oddity anchors spatial choreography each time it touches the console, charging the final star-caught glint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can she still be useful after a catastrophic misreading—tightens when the pen reveals her error was only one branch of truth. Agency drives the escalation: she chooses to propagate seven histories instead of hiding behind a single corrected version, narrowing her future to perpetual contingency. The price is dramatized: settlers’ polite gratitude becomes the mirror that forces her to own uncertainty. One meaningful deepening suffices; no external coincidence resolves the tension.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: meaning is relational, not absolute. The pen’s double line becomes the literalized motif—truth is forked, not fixed—reweighted in the final glint. Subtext resides in silence: settlers never blame her aloud, yet their courtesy accuses more than rage. The emotional aftereffect is concrete: reader feels the vertigo of letting go of singular narrative, mirrored in Vera’s soothed headache amid bent light.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tightly pinned to Vera’s perceptual signature: light “bent in ways that made Vera’s head ache,” “startled birds” for data shifting. Syntax mirrors her looping thoughts—long sentences for uncertainty, abrupt fragments when the console flickers. No head-hopping; grandfather is filtered through her memory, not given independent interiority. Diction remains within her professional lexicon—“quantum superposition,” “celestial signals”—without academic drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies: opening sibilance (“bent light…Lacuna”) gives way to hard plosives when she edits history. No paraphrase loops; each sentence adds new causal or sensory information. Figurative language is sparse and purposeful—“startled birds,” “unbend reality’s rigid spine”—never clustering into purple. Information density high: in 740 words we traverse three decades, one colony disaster, and a quantum epistemology without expository drag.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Freshest synthesis: archival fountain pen as quantum-eraser, turning pastoral disaster into multiverse comfort. Split-nib image is particular and irreplaceable—no generic stylus could perform the same conceptual work. Risk taken in relativizing agricultural tragedy pays off because the human cost is felt in Vera’s chest-weight and settler emails. Familiar “gravitational anomaly” trope is retooled into ontological copier rather than mere space-warp.</comment>
