<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vess’s interiority is rich and specific—her three-century memory, the scanner glove, the tear she can’t date—but the final renunciation, while credible, is telegraphed so early (“she didn’t sit”) that the cost feels pre-absorbed rather than freshly paid. Contradictory impulses (claim vs. guide) are named, yet the beat where they collide is summary, not dramatized. Still, her perceptual signature is strong enough to reach the 9- gate; the gap is a micro-choice absent on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is immaculate: the ruby shard’s homecoming reconstitutes the throne and re-prices Vess’s mission from possession to stewardship; the sunrise image makes the cost (eternal vigilance) undeniable. Causal chain holds throughout—pixel waterfall → orchard → mural → stair → throne—each step a because/therefore linkage. Orientation is anchored by word 30 (“the canyon’s edge”) and never loosens. No lens ambiguity; the accumulative design tightens into a conceptual repricing that reframes every layer of paint as eras of renunciation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The throne chamber’s compressed-starlight materiality, the scanner glove’s readout, and the paint strata each constrain tactics: only the glove can parse the waterfall, only the mural reveals the stair, only the ruby re-awakens the throne. Sensory hierarchy skews visual but is justified by a data-ghost world. Spatial choreography is pristine: Vess never floats, the flake’s temperature is tracked by touch, the staircase names are read by fingertip. Environment and tool jointly charge the final image—no 9-barrier breach.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—reach the throne before sunrise—tightens exactly once: the mural-stair reveal forecloses abandonment and forces the ascent. Cost is visible: each peeled paint layer warms the flake, literalizing the price of history. Agency is hers—she chooses to peel, to climb, to refuse the seat. Under an accumulative lens the escalation is modest but sufficient; a second compression or external obstacle would have pushed it into the 9-band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of succession-as-renunciation emerges wordlessly: every paint layer is a civilization that chose memory over monarchy, and Vess’s refusal extends the pattern. The throne’s re-activation reweights the orchard from mythic prize to guardian’s watchtower. No moralizing, only the sunrise image that answers the implicit question “who will rule?” with “the empty seat itself.” The ruby’s fusion is the concrete particular that universalizes the theme.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person intimate stays locked to Vess; perceptual signature is archaic-scientific (“cataloging the memory-circuits,” “wisely adventurous steps”) without slipping into genre pastiche. Syntax lengthens under wonder, shortens under climb pressure. No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks. Free indirect (“she could guide others here when the time came”) is clean and earned. Voice modulation matches physiological stress—breathless ascent rendered through parataxis.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is near-flawless: high density, zero loops, metaphors coherent (“compressed starlight and human ambition”). One mixed vehicle—“kaleidoscopic waterfall” jostles with “living color that sang”—is minor. Paragraph cuts are surgical; each advances knowledge or charge. Final line cadence mirrors sunrise swell. No scaffolding, no redundancy, no artifact touching closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fusion of post-digital ruin with Arthurian grail quest feels inevitable yet fresh; the paint-layer archaeology as stair-finding method is a specific inflection not seen in prior throne-seeker tales. Risk—renunciation rather than coronation—pays off by reconfiguring the reader’s desire. Could swap Vess’s name, but the throne-as-empty-repository concept and orchard-behind-pixel-waterfall are inseparable from this piece. Slight deduction for leaning on familiar “last archivist” trope without subverting it further.</comment>
