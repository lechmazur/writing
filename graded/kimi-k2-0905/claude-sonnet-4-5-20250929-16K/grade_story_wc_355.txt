<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and character-specific—Marcella’s purple-stained fingers, her taxonomy of silences, her theatrical murmurs all ground her eccentric pacifist genius. Contradictory impulses (curiosity vs. dread of violence) coexist in real time as she tunes, and the final renunciation—choosing to witness rather than shield—is earned by the causal chain of frequencies tried. Micro-choices (each dial adjustment) visibly cost her stamina and emotional safety, fulfilling the 9+ test. The minor slip into diagnostic-speak “understanding blooming” is the only hairline flaw touching the climax beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the clasp’s click reweights the entire story’s rule-set—empathy is not protection but witness, and the diary now opens willingly forever. Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the tightening is the final frequency “felt more than heard,” which crystallizes options and leaves Marcella in Charged Poise under fireworks. Persistent constraint: once the clasp yields, her prior pacifist method is validated yet charged with the cost of bearing atrocity’s opposite. Cost is legible in the single sentence “She read with tears streaming,” making the reconfiguration undeniable.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Workshop’s copper coils, salvaged war radios, and star-vented roof constrain every tactical move—equipment limits which frequencies she can try. Micro-setting of the brass clasp charges the final image: its molecules warm under fingertip perception, becoming the embodiment of Elena’s intention. Sensory hierarchy is biased to sound and touch, matching Marcella’s profession; fireworks’ red-gold light is filtered only at the end, mirroring revelation without overt symbolism. No spatial drift; every object’s placement is tracked cleanly across the single scene.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recover the diary—signaled in paragraph two and narrowed to a single live option: find the frequency or forsake Elena’s voice. Escalation is textural: each silence-sample deepens the emotional density (hesitation → protection → exhausted love) until the last vibration reweights what empathy costs. Agency is pure—every dial twist is Marcella’s choice, and the visible price is her trembling stamina and the tear-streamed reading that follows. No coincidence; the clasp yields only because she earns it.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: the taxonomy of silences maps directly onto the taxonomy of resilience inside the diary, forbidding tidy moralizing. Final image—diary now opens “whenever asked”—offers a resonant, non-literal answer: empathy is ongoing, willing exposure, not a one-time unlock. No abstract thesis statements; insight is earned through the concrete struggle of tuning. The only minor echo is the phrase “varieties of silence / varieties of resilience,” which edges toward symmetrical profundity but is saved by prior pattern.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is distinct—Marcella’s scientific-poetic diction (“resonance chambers,” “granite silence”) and theatrical cadence remain stable under pressure. Perceptual signature is selective: she notices molecular warmth, star-pulsing, and fireworks smoke in audio-tactile terms. No head-hopping; single POV holds. Micro distance shifts—“she could feel its molecular structure”—are purposeful, compressing time at peak beat. Rhythm accelerates with sentence fragments during tuning, then exhales into longer clauses at closure, mirroring revelation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings avoid template cadence. Information density is high—each sentence layers tool, emotion, and atmosphere. Figurative language is selective and coherent (no mixed metaphors). Only one paraphrase loop: “empathy doesn’t require protection, it requires witness” is essentially restated in the next paragraph; −0.2 applied. No scaffold, no filter-verb stacks. Grammar clean; pronoun reference unambiguous. Final line resolves by image without expositional tag.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: pacifist lock-picker who literally picks locks with sound-waves, not force. Conceptual risk—using “frequencies of silence”—is fully committed and paid off at the click. Specific detail (theremin from grandmother’s copper pipes) anchors novelty in lived history. Transformation test fails if names/places swapped: the copper coils, star-roof, and fireworks are irreplaceable. No close echoes of famous scenes; avoids tidy “science solves grief” trope by leaving empathy as ongoing burden.</comment>
