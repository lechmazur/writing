<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Kael’s interiority is vivid—“brittle awakenings” and “breaking bones to reset them” give us embodied stakes—but her arc tilts toward thematic statement rather than a visible micro-choice that costs her on the page. The final stance is clear, yet the beat that locks it in is summarized, not dramatized, so the cost is felt abstractly.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Kael places the sundial on the map and chooses to stay, crystallizing independence from isolation. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of tidal rearrangement and mirrored light reweights meaning—and the price (accepting permanent strangeness) is legible in the final image. Causality remains intact; no prop or rule teleports.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Environment is protagonist: atomically reflective floor guides navigation, brass sundial constrains path-finding, tidal clouds force vertical escape. Sensory hierarchy is biased to Kael’s urgency—photon reflections and vapor density matter more than catalog visuals. Setting directly shapes tactics and is inseparable from the closing cartography act.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</question>
<comment>Dominant stake—translate isolation into independence—is signaled early and tightens once: avoiding the cartography wing becomes impossible when the sundial shadow points there, forcing confrontation with old-world loss. Agency is internal—renunciation of escape—yet cost is visible in the final acceptance of perpetual displacement. One meaningful deepening satisfies length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from pattern: extinction, reflection, tide, map—all re-weighted into “second chances built from brittle awakenings.” No moralizing; the final image of charting her own territory on an impossible map offers conceptual repricing without thesis statement. Ambiguity lingers—coexistence includes predation—yet coherence holds.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Voice is perceptually specific—photon capture, atomically reflective surfaces, striped thylacine backs—and rhythm modulates with pressure: short declaratives during first tide, longer reflective cadences at closure. No head-hopping; lexicon stays within Kael’s reconstructed knowledge. Free-indirect style remains clean and character-bound.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and imagistic—“clouds roll like white oceans beneath atomically reflective floors”—yet avoids purple overload by anchoring every metaphor to Kael’s navigation task. Minor loop: “brittle awakenings” is repeated twice in close proximity; otherwise rhythm varies, sentences do plural jobs, and no mixed metaphors obscure causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Premise—after-death library where extinct species shelve knowledge—risks abstraction but grounds through tactile detail: tide schedule, sundial shadow grammar, quagga rescue. Synthesis of reincarnation memory with cartographic independence feels inevitable in hindsight. Risky elevated diction (“atomically reflective”) is pattern-taught early and pays off at closure.</comment>
