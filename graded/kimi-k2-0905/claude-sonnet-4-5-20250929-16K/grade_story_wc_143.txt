<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Maya’s contradictory impulses—scientific reverence vs. filial duty—are dramatized in the embodied gesture of planting the grain; the micro-choice to press it “gently into the dust” crystallizes her values and foreshadows the Earned Stasis. Her curiosity is not label-only: it drives the chemical-set choreography and the decision to endure the consortium’s erasure. The cost is visible in the final image: she walks away knowing Valentina will be “golden, eternal, and hers” only in photographs. Interiority stays concrete, never lapses into therapy-speak, and the flaw (idealistic inability to stop corporate force) compounds realistically.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the crater is already lost, but the chemical sunrise reweights the stakes, making preservation-by-light an irrevocable, costly substitute. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—each beacon adds density until the dawn flares create the resonant reconfiguration. Causality holds: every placement of a capsule is a because/therefore step toward the final portrait. Cost is legible in the line “Valentina was golden, eternal, and hers” where the past tense “was” admits the impending bulldoers.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The moonlit summit and crater walls are filtered through Maya’s professional eye—shocked rock, melted glass, regolith prints—so topography guides every step. The hourglass grain functions as micro-setting/object that constrains the final ritual; its absence from Earth sand charges the “one grain among billions” moment. Spatial choreography is flawless: descent, heart-plant, ascent, rim-sit track cleanly. No tourist-catalog; each detail (300-degree swing, magnesium ribbons) earns its keep by enabling the chemical sunrise.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</question><comment>The dominant stake—last untouched crater vs. corporate erasure—is signaled in paragraph one and tightens as each beacon is planted, foreclosing the option of physical salvation. Escalation is textural: the dawning terminator literalizes the countdown, turning temperature into a live fuse. Agency remains with Maya; no coincidence rescues her. The visible price is the swap from real terrain to photographs, a felt forfeiture under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Theme emerges without sermon: impermanence vs. memorial, progress as erasure. The hourglass grain’s reprise at the end reweights “time measured by moon-sand” into a elegiac irony—time now measured by light, not sand. No final-paragraph moralizing; the resonance is in the image of “chemical fire” dressing a grave. The reader is left to contemplate whether data-preservation is victory or consolation, satisfying complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</question><comment>Third-person intimate sustains a scientist-poet diction—regolith, ejecta, thermochromic—yet stays within Maya’s plausible lexicon. Rhythm compresses under pressure (“She planted… climbed… sitting”) then widens for reflection, mirroring her pulse. No head-hop; perception stays strictly bounded to her suit-level senses. Final line cadence slows into iambs—“golden, eternal, and hers”—earning lyrical poise without voice drift.</question>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</question><comment>High information density: one sentence can anchor time, body, and tool (“She planted the first chemical beacon at the crater's heart…”) without scaffold. Metaphors are controlled—“asteroid’s kiss,” “waterfalls of light”—and remain physically coherent. Zero paraphrase loops; each sensory stroke is new. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line delivers the charged image that revalues prior motifs.</question>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</question><comment>Fresh angle: crater preservation via pyrotechnic photography fuses planetary science with funerary ritual. The hourglass grain inversion—using lunar sand to stop lunar time—feels inevitable in hindsight. No derivative YA rebellion; the conflict is adult, asymmetrical, unwinnable. Risk of chemical sunrise pays off thematically and visually, not gimmicky.</question>
