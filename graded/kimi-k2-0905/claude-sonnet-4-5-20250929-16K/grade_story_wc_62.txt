<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elena’s interior contradiction—clinging to solitary carving while craving communal grief—is vivid early, but her shift to “connection-mapping” is declared more than dramatized; the final stance lacks a micro-choice that shows cost on the page. Thomas’s flickering mentorship supplies pressure, yet their dialogue drifts into sage pronouncements rather than concrete give-and-take that would sharpen Elena’s decision path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the unrolled ribbon exposes grief-as-network, reweighting every prior stone. The Accumulative/Textural lens coheres—butterfly arrivals thicken pattern, ribbon repetitions accrue—but the causality of Elena’s leap from isolated craft to communal design is compressed into a single summarizing paragraph; a dramatized beat of her first risky “echo-carving” would have sealed the change with visible cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Greenhouse glass, rust, and monarch wings are filtered through Elena’s mason-eye for texture and fracture; the cracked panes mirror her cracked certainty without overt symbolic nudging. Spatial choreography stays clean as ribbon, bench, and tools move from prop to prop under Thomas’s shimmer. The final image—Elena exiting into “gathering dark” while clutching the mapped ribbon—lets setting bite back, implying the cemetery will now physically enact the connectivity she has internalized.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—how to carve grief’s communal flow—surfaces early and tightens when each dusk lesson threatens Elena’s solitary identity; the meaningful turn is the ribbon’s reveal, narrowing her options to connected design. Cost is conceptual (she forfeits the safety of isolated sorrow) rather than viscerally felt; a single beat of public testing—e.g., a family reacting to her first linked headstones—would have made price tangible on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Collective grief emerges through concrete craft shift rather than thesis: ribbon imperfections = sorrow’s non-uniformity, monarch migration = sorrow’s communal motion. The ending’s reconfiguration avoids moralizing, offering instead a spatial map that re-prices every prior grave. Minor drift toward abstract “shape of collective grief” phrasing in late paragraphs keeps it from full resonance, but particulars remain privileged over platitude.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Narrative voice carries stone-dust specificity—“granite and marble into vessels for remembrance”—and modulates from weary precision to hushed revelation. Free-indirect style stays clean; no POV leakage. Thomas’s diction is slightly too poet-generic (“gentle as settling dust”), but his cadence distinguishes him enough for a spectral mentor. The closing sentence’s quiet backward glance achieves Charged Poise without overwriting.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose rhythms echo stonework—measured, tactile, with sentence variety that breathes between description and revelation. No loops or scaffold; information is layered (ribbon as ruler, then map, then grief-music) without redundancy. Metaphors stay physical—“water rings” for cemetery layout—maintaining credibility. One clause of near-simultaneity (“as orange light filtered… she came here”) is minor; otherwise syntax is crisp and propulsive.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: monarch migration + grave-carving + woven imperfection = grief-as-network. The ribbon’s re-appropriation from tool to cosmology feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Risk-taking—spectral mentor in under 800 words—earns its keep by supplying craft pressure rather than cozy wisdom. Minor familiarity of “mentor ghost teaches life lesson” template caps the score below 9.0, but specificity of trade and metaphor transforms the trope sufficiently.</comment>
