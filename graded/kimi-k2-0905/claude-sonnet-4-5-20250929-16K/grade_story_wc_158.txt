<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The poet’s three-century insomnia is declared rather than dramatized; we never see her waiver or micro-choices under its accumulating cost. Mira arrives more vividly—“shyly unstoppable” is embodied in her concrete entry and dirt-under-nails presence—but the poet’s arc still leans on abstract longing. The final “something close to rest” lands as thematic label; we get no embodied contradiction or visible price for the shift from solitary verse to shared planting, so the change feels gentle rather than inevit-able.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure is a quiet Charged Poise: the shared planting reconfigures the poet’s centuries-long isolation and gives the moment palpable conceptual cost—“for the first time in three centuries.” Accumulative/Textural lens holds: tension thickens through layered postcards, spiraling descent, and humming harmony with the off-key wind. Orientation is achieved by word 60, teaching the shell’s tilt and starlight; no mis-anchoring penalties apply. One minor causality gap: the postcard’s arrival “on a Tuesday” is never tethered to an in-scene trigger or cost, but it does not derail the final reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The shell operates as a micro-setting that constrains every move: starlight down the spiral dictates visibility, the deepest chamber’s soil enables the planting, and the wind’s off-key song becomes the harmonic tool they join. Sensory triage is POV-driven—pearlescent interior, reef-shadow joy—rather than tourist catalog. Spatial choreography is flawless: tilt, spiral descent, bulb placement track cleanly. The environment’s scale and ruinous beauty mirror the poet’s internal ache without overt symbolism, satisfying the 9+ gate for setting-as-constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: can beauty still be cultivated after centuries of global death? Pressure tightens once—postcard constellation → living gardener with real cherry bulb—moving from received beauty to co-created act. The poet’s agency is reactive (accepts bulb, agrees to plant) rather than a decisive gamble with visible loss; the tightening feels lyrical, not tactical. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral: shared future vs. solitary past, but no concrete resource or body-risk is hazarded on-page, keeping the score sub-8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete images—postcards as “small defiance,” falling petals as brevity treaty—never sermonized. Final image of bulb in darkness “dreaming of spring” offers non-literal reprise that reweights prior loss. Subtext lives in gesture: dirt under fingernails, folded fifty-year poem, harmonized humming—all evoke survival without naming it. No tidy moral; ambiguity lingers on whether blossoms can really outlive them, giving honest aftertaste.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays close to the poet’s perceptual filter: star-thick sky, reef-shadow joy, off-key wind read as music—distinctive, compressed, pattern-taught. Syntax flexes with pressure—long breathless sentence of longing collapses into simple “Yes.” Dialogue sparse but voice-differentiated: Mira’s concrete humility vs. poet’s imagistic diction. No head-hop; psychic distance tightens from cosmic postcard to soil under thumbnails.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is rhythm-varied, largely loop-free; only minor scaffold: “longing—for rest, for peace, for the world” could be one phrase. Metaphors stay coherent—“seedlings push through concrete”—no mixed vehicles. High information density: each sentence layers history, sensory detail, emotional stance. Closing line “she felt something close to rest” lands with cadential exhale, avoiding overwriting. A few adjectival boosts (“reef-shadow joy,” “velvet black”) verge on purple but pattern-earned by accumulative tone.</comment>

<question>8</question><question>7.6</question><comment>Post-apocalyptic cherry blossom planting is fresh; trope of gargantuan shell repurposed as sanctuary feels specific to this text. Accumulated postcards as proof-of-beauty economy is a novel social logic. Concept of “blossom armistice” offers non-obvious ethics: peace with impermanence. Risk taken with centuries-long insomnia accepted without explanation; world stays consistent. Final synthesis—shared planting as photosynthetic answer to centuries of pain—feels inevitable yet not predictable.</comment>
