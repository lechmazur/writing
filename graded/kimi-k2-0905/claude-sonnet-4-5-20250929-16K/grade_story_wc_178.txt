<comment>Interiority is concrete throughout (“counted each candle stub,” “pulse quickened”), and the frugal, starved-scientist trait stays consistent. The final quiet endurance—tucking the tile away for tomorrow’s scarce observations—earns its cost under the Accumulative lens. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene; reflection dominates action, so the arc is more stance-crystallization than overt change, keeping it from the 9-band.</comment>

<comment>A single causal chain—tile discovery → schematic decoding → recognition of impossible heliocentric POV → covenant claimed—holds cleanly; each step tightens the stakes of intellectual possession. Closure is a Charged Poise: the morning-star image reweights prior beats and forecloses surrender to any coming regime. Persistent constraint (scarcity of paper/candles) shapes every tactical choice. A 0.3 reserve because the “ancient astronomers couldn’t possibly” realization is told more than dramatized.</comment>

<comment>The re-imagined palace is evoked through tactile salvage—reclaimed stone, lattice dust, cooling floor—never in catalogue. Environment and tool (candle stub, notebooks, tile) directly constrain action: she saves the candle, draws on precious paper, pockets the tile. Spatial choreography is exact; no object drifts or changes state off-stage. Final image—telescope climb at dawn—caps the setting’s dual role as sanctuary and observatory.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—possession of forbidden knowledge—is signaled by line 3; pressure escalates via each schematic page consuming an irreplaceable resource. One meaningful tightening: realization the square encodes an off-world sky forces the choice to smuggle/continue, not surrender. Cost is visible: candle stub snuffed, paper supply dwindling, dawn bringing unknown enforcers. Agency is interior (endurance) under Accumulative lens; externally she is passive, preventing 9.0.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme—devotion to cosmos outlasts regimes—emerges through concrete repetitions of frugality, light-saving, and off-world coordinates, never authorial thesis. Final dawn-star image reweights prior candle-light beats with quiet cosmic constancy. No platitudes, only patterned particulars. Subtext of encoded love across millennia is implied, stated only in the covenant she pockets.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is scientist-poet: precise lexicon (“celestial coordinates,” “orbital mechanics”) braided with lyrical cadence (“vacant palace,” “dusty amber glow”). Perceptual signature—every resource measured by scarcity—colors every observation. Tense and psychic distance stay stable; no filter-verb clusters. Rhythm modulates: longer reflective sentences build to short percussive clauses at “pulse quickened.” Nearly flawless; withholds 9.0 only for faint echo of template cadence in “between the fall… and the rise…” opener.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>High information density—each sentence layers new detail on tile, history, resource scarcity—yet remains lucid. Metaphors are sparse and clean; no mixed vehicles. Rhythmic variation mirrors contemplative drift and the eventual dawn lift. Only hairline flaw: “reimagined Babylonian palace” phrase repeats twice within 90 words; does not obscure closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fusion of post-collapse solar-punk observatory with Mesopotamian magic-square astronomy feels inevitable and fresh. Risk of off-world perspective for ancient tile is embraced fully and paid off. Specificity of “seventeen light-years distant” counters generic “ancient aliens” trope. The synthesis of frugality-science-devotion across epochs is non-obvious yet coherent.</comment>
