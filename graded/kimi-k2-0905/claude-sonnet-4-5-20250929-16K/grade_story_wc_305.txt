<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mei’s interiority is concrete—hairpin touch anchors memory without label-speak; forgiveness is shown via micro-choice (offering him the Path) not speech. The “kindly decisive” trait is dramatized when she immediately steers the killer-soul after personal shock. Cost is felt: handing over the hairpin knowledge breaches her private wound yet completes her purpose. One beat of contradictory impulse (hand tremble on hairpin) would have lifted this to 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Mei renounces private retribution, forecloses vengeance path while charging the final image with conceptual cost—she keeps tending. Lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern of luminous-dark imagery tightens until final “quiet work” re-weights stakes. Orientation anchored by line 6; no teleport props. Only micro-slippage: “three hundred cycles” is told not demonstrated, a hairline scalar issue, not causal break.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Grotto’s mist-stone walls, pearl-bark trees, and Pool of Reflection are not postcard scenery—they channel souls and physically position Mei (ascend to think). Hairpin micro-setting re-appears at closure. Sensory economy favors hush and vineyard-like growth metaphors, aligning with tone. Could gain 0.2 if one tactile detail of condensed mist on skin constrained her next gesture.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake: can she stay true to caretaker purpose when faced with daughter’s killer? Pressure tightens once—hairpin reveal; option of private justice is foreclosed by her guided act. Cost is legible: she relinquishes personal retribution, retains burden of service. Agency is renunciation rather than confrontation—valid under Accumulative lens; still, a sharper external complication (soul resisting guidance) would have pushed 8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of forgiveness-as-praxis emerges through action, not sermon: guiding the killer herself. Hairpin return reframes grief into generative duty—quiet resonance without moral stated. Final image of ascending tree while clouds roll “endlessly” offers Charged Poise on endless cycle. Avoids “thematic echo” trap; no character articulates thesis verbatim.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tightly in Mei’s perceptual palette: cloud-time, pearl-bark, vineyard hush. Rhythm modulates—long vines of sentence for contemplation, short beats at recognition. No head-hop; diction (“scalloped pattern,” “vineyard hush”) feels idiosyncratic to her, not thesaurus drift. Dialogue minimal but voice-driven: “You destroyed much” carries subtext of maternal restraint.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is rhythmic, loop-free; figurative language is patterned—grotto as cathedral, cycle as wheel—so density feels deliberate. No mixed metaphors; “scalloped away the excess barnacles” is crisp. One paraphrase loop spotted: “ darkness and light embraced, where ending and beginning were the same threshold” restates prior duality—minor −0.1. High information ratio; every sentence layers image or motive.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Afterlife-as-gardener is familiar, but fusion with “vineyard hush” and scallop-coral-barnacle marine metaphors gives fresh texture. Moral risk is bold: caretaker mentors her own child’s killer without melodrama. Specific ladder-of-cloud ascension, pearl-bark cognition trees feel non-generic. Transformation test passes—Mei’s specific endurance arc could not swap with another grief tale without rewriting key metaphors.</comment>
