<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is vivid—her palm’s worn cork, the garden scent that “hurt so much it came out as violence”—and the apology she whispers at the end is a credible micro-choice that costs her seven years of pride. The contradiction between performed rage and hidden tenderness is embodied rather than diagnosed. Secondary pressure from dying Silas is present but off-page, so relationship-as-crucible is only partly activated; still, the sister-to-sister dynamic under pressure lands. Knowledge stays bounded: Mara never claims to know Vera’s mind, only her own belated recognition.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Causal lens: because Silas is dying and gives the vial → Mara opens it → garden scent strips armor → Mara whispers apology → Vera hears. Closure is Charged Poise: the whispered “I’m sorry” reconfigures seven years of silence with felt cost (Mara’s “impossibly small” words). Orientation is anchored by line 3—cobalt lighthouse, dawn, cork vial. No lens ambiguity; each beat tightens options until the final whisper forecloses the shout-stance forever.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>The cobalt lighthouse, salt-scrubbed soil, and night-blooming jasmine are specific, POV-filtered, and return in the final image. The beacon lit at dawn is a micro-setting tool that charges closure: Mara ignites it even after sunrise, externalizing her new visibility. Spatial choreography is clean—dock, stairs, cottage track without drift. Environment constrains choice: only dawn wind can carry the scent; removing the lighthouse color or garden would weaken the emotional alchemy.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: can Mara abandon the shout-stance and risk being unheard? Pressure tightens once: scent strips armor → apology becomes inevitable. Cost is emotional visibility—Mara trades righteous anger for naked vulnerability. Agency is hers alone; no coincidence resolves the rift.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the scent-driven reversal: fury as love-armor, whispers as truer carriers than shouts. No moralizing; the final image of two sisters walking toward the cottage lets the reader weigh silence versus softness. Subtext lives in gesture—Vera’s face “crumpled” shows she received the vibration, not the decibel. The garden’s night-scent reweights earlier rage without abstract assertion.</comment>

<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Mara; perceptual signature is marine—shells, salt, tide. Diction is precise without purple drift: “cobalt,” “rattling like shells,” “screaming tenderness” is a coined oxymoron that fits her psyche. Rhythm accelerates up the lighthouse stairs, then breathes into the whisper. Dialogue is minimal but carries subtext (“I heard you” implies years of listening for any signal).</comment>

<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>High density: one sentence can do three jobs—“The scent spiraled upward, caught by the dawn breeze, and Mara felt something shift in her ribcage” moves prop, setting, interior change. No loops or scaffold; metaphor vehicles stay coherent (scent as voice, beacon as visibility). Opening and closing lines are image-anchored and ear-tested. Occasional elevated phrasing (“screaming tenderness”) is earned by interior logic.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Familiar sibling-estrangement scaffold is refreshed by the olfactory conduit and the inversion that softness outperforms volume. The garden-at-night scent as translator of intention is a fresh inflection; remove it and the story collapses. Risk is moderate—quiet reconciliation instead of cathartic fight—but specificity of lighthouse and scent keeps it from generic template. Whispers-travel-farther rule is reprised in the final line, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
