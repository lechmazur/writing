<comment>Mara’s grief-anchored vocation and the embodied moment of micro-choice (offering the tooth, asking about shared laughter) create a credible, felt shift; the interiority stays concrete, no tidy epiphany. The “modestly fearless” trait is shown, not labeled, when she descends alone into the cold gorge and lets warped notes touch guilt. One hairline slip: “healing required more than medicine” edges toward diagnostic-speak, but is instantly re-anchored in the daughter-memory cue. Crocodile-tooth gesture and harp music together earn the ghost’s release—cost is the continued solitude and broken instrument—so the change lands with proportionate weight.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a clear Resonant Reconfiguration: the final image of “laughter threaded through tears” conceptually re-prices grief, with the gorge chorus permanently minus one voice—cost is audible and felt. Causal chain holds: damaged harp → wrong-note filter → memory prompt → ghost laugh → release; each step is because/therefore. Orientation anchors who/where/when before word 120; misaligned harp and “spectral confessions” teach any necessary disorientation early. No teleporting props; the tooth is introduced, withheld, then wielded exactly where its bite-metaphor pays off.</comment>

<comment>Echo Gorge functions as both acoustic trap and emotional crucible; its stone walls literally shape the tactic of “pursue by sound” and determine the vertical, twilight geography. Micro-setting objects—warped harp, crocodile tooth—constrain handling and become extensions of Mara’s body under pressure. Sensory economy is tight: cold exhalation, ink-like shadows, water-over-stones laughter, each filtered through Mara’s attuned ear. Final image of sound ascending the golden rim re-charges the setting with earned transformation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—free one ghost to prove grief/joy coexist—tightens the moment Mara chooses to interrogate the script (“did you ever laugh together?”), narrowing the ghost’s options from endless confession to released memory. Protagonist agency drives escalation: every deeper note, every question increases the risk the confession-loop could swallow her too. Cost is visible: the gorge relinquishes a voice, the harp stays warped, and dawn’s advance signals she must repeat the labour for the rest—no all-cure.</comment>

<comment>Theme emerges without statement: guilt is an echo chamber until met by an equally true joy frequency. The crocodile-tooth motif reframes remorse as proof of prior appetite for life; laughter is not denial but counterpart. Final image offers non-literal answer—“healing sounded like laughter threaded through tears”—a Conceptual Repricing that lets both emotions coexist, no moral preached. Ambiguity lingers: Mara’s own healing is incomplete, gorge still holds dozens, joy remains labor.</comment>

<comment>Third-person limited stays welded to Mara’s perceptual filter: “she heard them… spectral confessions” grounds the voice, diction never exceeds her grief-worn lexicon. Rhythm modulates—long liquid sentences for descent, staccato for the laugh-break. No head-hop; ghost speech is overheard, not interiorized. Misaligned harp serves as prose metronome, its wavering notes echoed in syntactic slips that feel intentional, not artifact.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>High-density lines: “confessions repeated endlessly, trapped in the canyon’s acoustic peculiarities” does world, conflict, and theme in one stroke. Figurative language is selective—twilight suspended like ink, laughter like water over stones—never clogs urgency. No filter-verb stacks, no synonym loops; paragraph cut-test passes. Minor alliteration drift (“luminous ache… laughter… broken”) but pattern is taught early and pays off in final cadence, so reads as control, not affectation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: soul-collector + broken harp as tuning fork for grief is non-obvious yet inevitable once heard. Gorge-as-choir turns familiar afterlife trope into acoustic physics. Crocodile-tooth reminder of “you once had teeth” delivers primal surprise that reweights guilt. Risk taken with lyric repetition, but resonance lands—story would collapse if tooth or warped notes were swapped for generic relic or flute.</comment>
