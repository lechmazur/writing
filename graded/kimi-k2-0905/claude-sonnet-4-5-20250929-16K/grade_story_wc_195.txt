<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The knight’s grief and isolation are vivid and embodied; her reawakened hope is dramatized through the apple-pluck. Yet her interiority is sometimes abstract (“shape of possibility”), and the absence of a second character means status/relationship crucibles are inapplicable.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: a Resonant Reconfiguration charged by cost—she forecloses her exile and claims the night as canvas. The causal lens holds: each unsnap tightens possibility under the program’s diagrams; orientation is anchored within 120 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Greenhouse-as-micro-setting constrains every move: the liquid-starlight bark, hourglass fruit, and permeable walls shape what can be unsnapped. Sensory economy is tight, and the final transformed orchard recharges every prior sensory seed.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>One dominant stake—possibility versus isolation—tightens through each unsnap; the orchard’s expansion visibly raises cost. Agency is interior but legible; the final apple-pluck crystallizes the trade-off under the causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the image-string: marionette controlling its strings, night turned canvas. No overt thesis; the final silver apple reframes exile as authorship without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers—she may still fail—but the reconfiguration is felt.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lyrical third-person distance is stable; diction stays within the knight’s arcane register. Rhythm modulates—long breaths for grief, staccato for unsnaps—without monotony. No dialogue to test, but perceptual signature is distinct.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong density and propulsion; occasional metaphor stacks (“terror and ecstasy braided like electricity through copper wire”) flirt with overwriting but stay pattern-taught. Minor scaffold: “possibility” and “pattern” echo, yet no loops obscure the final image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Alchemical orchard + marionette metaphysics graft fresh angles onto post-war isolation. Transformation test passes: swap apples or diagrams and logic collapses. Risk in lyric world-building is rewarded by coherent closure.</comment>
