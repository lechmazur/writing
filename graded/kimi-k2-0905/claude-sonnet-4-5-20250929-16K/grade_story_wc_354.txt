<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Katrin’s exile-origin and “beauty in difficulty” creed are anchored to the basalt stone and chess set, giving her interiority a tactile loop; the contradiction between her dismissed aesthetic and the life-or-death task is dramatized in scene, not told. Micro-choices—arranging pieces, correlating patterns—track a believable competence/struggle balance. The final acceptance costs her the safety of orthodoxy and leaves her literally charged with teaching a new language: a visible, felt price. Only the “ten thousand anxious moments” cliché and one stock phrase (“heart raced with hopeful melancholy”) keep this from the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the nexus stabilizes, but Katrin is now bound to an endless, precise stewardship—cost is legible in “pressed her thumb into the dent… smiled through tears.” Causal chain holds: chess demonstration → geometric response → covenant refinement → new living balance. Orientation is clean by word 60; no prop or rule teleporting. One micro-turn (beings re-shape the board) tightens options rather than inflating them. Only the single cliché phrase prevents a perfect 9.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The magnetic nexus is rendered through iron-tasting air, spinning compasses, and geometric song—details that actively block conventional navigation and force Katrin’s chess translation. Micro-settings (basalt stone, weighted pieces) function as portable terrain that constrains every tactical move. Final image re-uses “constellation come to earth,” re-weighting the earlier star-field motif. Spatial choreography stays coherent across bodiless forces moving pieces.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—city-saving covenant—signals in paragraph 2; escalation occurs through each chess demonstration that either compresses or expands magnetic geometries, narrowing Katrin’s options to “keep demonstrating or lose everything.” Agency is continuous; she initiates each correlation, pays with escalating exposure of her dismissed philosophy. Cost is felt when the beings re-arrange the board: she must now live inside an endless, thoughtful precision. One meaningful tightening is sufficient; no coincidence resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: beauty resides in systems that demand continuous, difficult attention rather than fixed rules. Subtextual turns—sacrifice reads as expansion, protection as compression—reprice the chess ethic into diplomacy. Final image of geometric dance around her body offers a non-literal answer to “can beauty hold a city?” No moralizing sentence or echo of prompt language appears.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays strictly inside Katrin’s perceptual filter; no head-hop. Syntax leans into chess lexis (“position from memory—Petrov”), mirroring her calculative mind. Rhythm accelerates into short paratactic clauses under magnetic glare, then widens into lyrical final cadence. One micro-register lift into “constellation come to earth” is earned by earlier astral imagery.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero paraphrase loops; every sentence advances knowledge or image. Metaphors are precise: “air tasted of iron and ozone,” “patterns sang in frequencies beyond hearing.” No filter-verb stacks; verbs are strong (worrying, compressed, wove). Opening and closing lines re-charge dents and stars without repeating phrases. Read-aloud rhythm modulates from wary scan to harmonic hum.</comment>

<grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses geomagnetic diplomacy with chess pedagogy—fresh, non-obvious, yet inevitable in hindsight. Risk of translating silence through spatial sacrifice is followed through without retreat; no prior template matches this exact synthesis. Specificity of Petrov endgame and basalt dent prevents generic swap-out. Final reconfiguration turns exile into indispensable office, reframing “dismissed aesthetic” as civic salvation.</comment>
