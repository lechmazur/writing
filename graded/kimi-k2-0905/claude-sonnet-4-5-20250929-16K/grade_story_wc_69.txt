<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira’s “expectant resignation” is stated repeatedly but never dramatized in a moment of costly choice; her interiority stays at label level (“travelled stillness,” “patience”) and the climactic transfer of the zither carries no visible sacrifice or risk, so the arc feels observed rather than earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The closure image—voices braiding under Mira’s watch—delivers a gentle Resonant Reconfiguration, but the lens is Accumulative/Textural, not causal; stakes tighten only by repetition of rehearsals rather than a decisive beat that forecloses an option, keeping the cost conceptual rather than felt on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The velvet library’s filtered amber, oak table, and frost-laced windows are selectively sketched and return to charge the final choral moment; the zither itself functions as micro-setting, its carved petals guiding the “subtracting” exercise, so environment subtly constrains method and mood.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can these divided kids sing together?—is clear early, but pressure escalates only by accretion: more weeks, more voices, no single beat where a student must choose harmony over loyalty or pay a price for doing so; the final braid is lovely but not a tightening turn.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of harmony-through-subtraction emerges organically from the zither’s vanishing craft and the choral method; the ending lets the braided voices stand as wordless answer, avoiding moralism, though the absence of any student’s sacrificed stance keeps the resonance gentle rather than searing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-limited stays anchored to Mira; diction (“travelled stillness,” “expectantly resigned”) creates a consistent lyric-teacher cadence that modulates into quieter wonder at the close; no head-hopping or register drift, and the choral instructions read like lived pedagogy, not exposition.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and image-dense without purple overload; occasional soft repeats (“travelled stillness” twice, “velvet” thrice) are minor, and no mixed metaphors or filter-verb clusters mar the climax; final paragraph lands with cadenced lift rather than artifact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>The “subtract noise to braid voices” method feels fresh against typical conflict-resolution plots, and the endangered zither rosette grounds abstraction in tactile specificity; yet the refugee/local divide and autumn-library rehearsal are familiar tropes, slightly blunting the overall surprise.</comment>
