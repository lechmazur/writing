<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Asha’s interiority is textured—“She was nothing if not patient” shows a lived trait—but “kindly methodical” is asserted more than embodied. The seed-reprieve is a single micro-choice; no contradictory impulse is dramatized under pressure. Closure is acceptance rather than costly renunciation, so the change feels gently accumulative, not scaldingly earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of seed-planting failures → breakthrough holds. Orientation anchors by line 4; no drift. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: “nothing ends, only transitions” reweights grief. Cost is diffuse (intellectual awe) rather than viscerally felt—keeps it under 8.8.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Magnetic arbor’s electromagnetic hum and cloud-floor are concrete, bias-filtered through Asha’s scholar-eye. The seed-as-micro-setting is tactile—clay dust mixed into soil—and directly enables germination. One slip: “platform hummed with a frequency” is generic; exact sensory signature (pitch, bone feel) missing. Still, environment constrains the final miracle, satisfying 9- gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—bridge grief/knowledge—clear from paragraph 2. Escalation is iterative (seed after seed) rather than option-narrowing; no reversal or price paid by Asha until the plant grows. Tightening is conceptual (“magnetic gate” insight) not tactical; cost is observational. Sufficient for short-form but lacks a visceral trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of transition-as-continuity emerges through seed→tree image rather than statement. Final sentence moralizes the insight aloud, slightly diluting resonance. Subtext lives in the cuneiform-botany parallels; no pseudo-profundity. Would hit 8.5 if last line had let the image stand uncommented.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Third-person close maintains stable psychic distance; perceptual signature is scholarly-sensuous (“clouds rolled like thoughts trying to form words”). No dialogue, so voice carries entire load—rhythm is lull-cadenced, fitting grief-work. Filter verbs minimal; diction stays within archaeo-lexicon. Could be more shard-edged under breakthrough moment, but cleanly controlled.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies; no template cadence detected. Figurative layer is dense—mixed metaphors (“roots in clay, branches in starlight”) yet internally coherent. One scaffold: “She was nothing if not patient” is a cliché stem. Information density good—each paragraph advances botany or grief linkage. Closure line is clean; no artifact touch.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fusion of Assyriology + electromagnetic cloud-lab feels fresh; “physics of transition” reframed through botanical analogy is non-obvious. Tropes (mystical seed, mentor’s last gift) are re-grounded in cuneiform concrete detail. Risk is conceptual not plot-bold, but synthesis is memorable. Hovers at 8.8 edge; would need one more sensory or ethical risk to breach 9.</comment>
