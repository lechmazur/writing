<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Mei’s interiority is textured through marine-tinged perception (“cataloging the small dramas”) and embodied micro-actions (handing back the cicada). The renunciation of holding Lin here is credible, foreshadowed by the hermit-crab shell test. Minor slack: Lin’s risk is asserted more than dramatized, trimming the highest band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the tide’s imminent return reweights “pause” from loss to shared threshold, felt cost in Mei’s relinquishing control. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—shell-crab, cicada, and tide build density until the final cadence shift. No orientation debt; anchors clear by line 4. Causality intact; the aunt’s surrender grows sideways through observed metaphors.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Grotto, starlight, and thumbnail cicada constrain choices: the cramped pool limits retreat, the jade’s “interior weather” reframes transition. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven—Mei catalogs by touch and star-glow, not tourist visuals. Environmental mirroring (crab shell ↔ niece departure) is embedded in action, not symbol tacked on.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—Mei’s urge to freeze Lin in the tidal moment—tightens once when she concedes “time moves like tides.” Price is conceptual but legible: Mei forfeits the chronographer’s illusion of capture. Agency sits in attention and renunciation; escalation is modest, fitting accumulative design. Would edge higher if Lin’s departure risk carried an on-page obstacle Mei must overtly release.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme of transition emerges through recurrent thresholds—tide line, shell swap, cicada emergence—never named as thesis. Final image of “learning the particular texture of pause” reweights prior material without moralizing. Subtext in silence and starlight invites reader inversion: human departures are natural molts. Near 9.0 but slight thematic echo in “creatures of the threshold” line costs −0.2.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays snug to Mei’s marine-taxonomist gaze; diction (“thumbnail,” “interior weather”) is hers. Rhythm mirrors tidal breathing—long sentences in calm, clipped fragments at recognition (“No.”). No dialogue, so voice purity remains unbroken. Filter verbs minimal; perception rendered as action.</answer>

<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry dual duty—e.g., “She had been a tidal-pool chronicler for three decades” seeds occupation, time-scale, and obsession in one breath. Figurative layering (“stars wheeled”) is sparse, reserved for closure beat, avoiding purple drift. Zero paraphrase loops; each image advances pool or emotional state. Read-aloud cadence ebbs and flows with scene tension.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh angle: using intertidal science as emotional vocabulary for family letting-go. Hermit-crab shell test as micro-macro lens feels inevitable yet un-clichéd. Risk is quiet—no plot pyrotechnics—coherence over novelty keeps it from 9-band. Could verge higher if cicada lore had been seeded earlier with grandmother’s field notes rather than delivered as heirloom reveal.</comment>
