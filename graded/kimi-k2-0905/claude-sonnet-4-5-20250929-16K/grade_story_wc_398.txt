<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elena’s contradictory impulses—burning Dimitri’s letter yet keeping the fragment—are dramatized in the opening beat and pay off when she lets the char fall. Marco’s “gently persuasive” trait is shown, not labeled, in the grafting monologue that shifts her stance. Both families’ feud is externalized through the vineyard water-rights history and the lantern-lit pavilion space, giving their union a felt social cost. The final micro-choice—staying for the night—forecloses the morning-bus escape and is earned by the prior vine-graft logic.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: burned fragment → graft metaphor → shared night. Orientation is clean within 120 words: hillside path, amber pavilion, dusk lantern. Closure is a Charged Poise: “we have all night to tend this particular graft” crystallizes options with the cost of family feud and lost city future. Persistent constraint—the feud—shapes every tactic; no off-stage resolution.</comment>

<comment>The amber paper walls filter lantern light into honeyed suspension, mirroring the stalled decision. Autumn wind rattling the panels externalizes Elena’s internal waver and literally cools the intimacy, forcing them to speak closer. The burned letter fragment is handled twice—first examined, then dropped—its charred edge a micro-setting that charges the final image. Vineyard below acts as off-stage future resource and social battleground, constraining the match.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—escape vs stay—tightens once: next bus not till morning. Grafting parable escalates by reframing family feud from fatal to “tension waiting to become complexity,” narrowing Elena’s options. Cost is legible: she forfeits city security and family approval. No coincidence; pressure is purely interpersonal and cumulative.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of destined mismatches emerges through the grafting speech and the charred letter; no explicit thesis. Subtext lives in silence after “That’s a terrible metaphor”—laugh as relief signals acceptance. Final image of “destined mismatch silently proving” reweights the families’ water-war history without moralizing. Complexity preserved: no guarantee the graft will take, only the night to try.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited hovers over Marco with perceptual signature of vine-pruning precision: “choosing words with the precision he used when pruning.” Elena’s interior accessed only through gesture and laugh, maintaining distance. Dialogue carries subtext: “May I?” asks for letter and for her. No head-hopping; lantern-light imagery stays in Marco’s sensorium.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose breathes: long sentences for vineyard meditation, short fragments at “She laughed.” No synonym loops; “amber” recurs with purpose. Mixed metaphors avoided—grafting logic stays consistent. One filter-verb cluster (“he saw her decision taking shape”) but does not stall momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Familiar star-crossed vineyard romance is refreshed by viticultural grafting metaphor as relational argument. Burned letter edge as tactile relic of rejected practicality feels specific, not stock. Risk is moderate: quiet lyric closure rather than kiss or confrontation. Could transpose names but vineyard metaphor would collapse, so freshness holds.</comment>
