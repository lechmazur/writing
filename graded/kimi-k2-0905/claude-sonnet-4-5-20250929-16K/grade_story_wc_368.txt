<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The dye master’s interiority—rooted in color, light, and the morpho wing—remains vivid and embodied; her quiet “why me” conflict is credibly contradictory. The final acceptance of the inherited listener-role is micro-choices-driven, but the beat is compressed into a single nod; cost is felt yet not fully dramatized, capping at 8.7.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the morpho wing on the sill re-casts her vigilance into service, with conceptual cost acknowledged. Accumulative lens holds throughout—pattern of strangers’ confessions tightens until stance crystallizes; proprietor’s reveal is the causal fulcrum that re-weights her role, not an external rescue.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Floating rock on chains, dawn mist, and sun-trail geometry are sketched with economy yet return to constrain her daily ritual; tea-house interior is tactile. Morpho wing as micro-setting charges the final image; specificity of “cups thin as whispers” and moss-thick chains keep world-rules consistent without exposition dump.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Central stake—why stories stick to her—escalates through accumulating confessions rather than reversals; proprietor’s disclosure tightens the pattern into inherited duty. Cost is conceptual: she forfeits anonymity of observation; escalation is coherent under Accumulative lens, but no tangible resource is lost, keeping it just shy of 8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Theme of “iridescent caution” emerges from the morpho’s structure and her shift from detachment to compassionate witness; final image re-prisms the wing’s meaning without moralizing. Subtext of transplant as legacy of attention feels inevitable; ambiguity lingers—she neither embraces nor rejects the role, only sees it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited sustains a perceptual signature steeped in color, light, and textile delicacy; no head-hop. Dialogue is spare and goal-driven—proprietor’s lines carry the buried reveal; diction stays within a craftsman’s lexicon. Rhythm modulates from contemplative opening to shorter, charged final paragraph.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet lyrical; figurative language is selective (“steam rose like valley mist”) and paid off. No loops or scaffold; sentences vary in cadence; pronoun tracking clean. Minor elevated phrase “nameless” hue is allowable under poetic license and does not obscure causality or closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Transplant-as-listener-magnet is fresh; morpho wing repurposed from science fact to metaphor of witness. Concept synthesizes color-craft, cardiac legacy, and confessional gravity without gimmick. Risk of quiet ending is taken and earned; specificity of dye-craft keeps it from feeling generic.</comment>
