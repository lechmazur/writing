<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mirena’s grief-carved clipboard and ritualized memory give her a sharp, specific interior; the moment she touches Kordas’s shoulder embodies “operatively gentle” with visible cost.  The final kneel is earned because the text has shown her decades of failure etched in ebony.  What keeps this from the top band is that Kordas and Threll remain functional symbols rather than fully contradictory people under pressure—their dialogue states pain more than it reveals new, complicating layers.</comment>

<comment>The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the mixed soil and seeds crystallize a fragile shared practice whose cost is the irreversible past still carved on the clipboard.  Causality holds: the seventeen-year celestial window forces tonight’s choice, and the recovered ritual text motivates the planting.  The lens is cleanly causal—each beat narrows options until the final promise to “return tomorrow” forecloses indefinite hatred.  A hairline slip: the clipboard’s shift from catalogue of defeat to ledger of possibility is asserted rather than dramatized in a single visible micro-gesture.</comment>

<comment>The terrace is anchored early and re-used as tool: the altar, urns, and moon-lit silver constrain the choreography of enemies who must kneel together.  Valley geography is sketched only as needed—“before the first battles burned them away” links setting to stakes.  The missing valleywood trees haunt the scene as negative space that the seeds must refill, giving the place a palimpsest history.  Sensory range is narrow (mostly visual moonlight and tactile soil), but selection fits the ritual focus; a second sensory channel mid-ceremony would have pushed this higher.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—end the forever war—tightens through ritual deadline: moons align once at midnight, so refusal tonight wastes the next seventeen years.  The planting is not symbolic window-dressing; it is the only on-page tactic that makes tomorrow’s coexistence unavoidable because living trees will require shared tending.  Pressure escalates when Threll names her dead gardener daughter within arm’s reach of the bomber-general, forcing the group to decide whether memory will be compost or poison.  Cost is legible: they kneel, mix enemy dirt, and verbally commit to return, foreclosing the option of perpetual boycott.</comment>

<comment>Theme emerges from practice versus proclamation: peace is not a treaty line but daily dirt under fingernails.  The clipboard’s reweighting—now recording a beginning instead of failures—lets the ending answer the thematic question without moralizing.  Subtext lives in gesture (the shoulder touch) and object (seeds from extinct trees), not exposition.  The final image resists tidy comfort: tomorrow’s return is promised, yet the valley remains scarred and the moons are already separating, leaving honest ambiguity.</comment>

<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Mirena’s perceptual filter: orbital “ballet,” clipboard “worn smooth,” soil that must be tended.  Syntax lengthens and quiets under moonlight, mirroring the slow celestial dance.  Dialogue carries regional diction without caricature—Threll’s “brittle as old parchment” and Kordas’s skeptical grunt feel spoken.  Voice modulation peaks in the spare final line—“a fragile beginning”—where restraint earns poignancy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and propulsive: every sentence advances memory, ritual step, or relational pressure.  Figurative language is selective—moonlight “washing” the terrace, grief “carved” on wood—never clogging the ceremonial tempo.  No paraphrase loops or scaffold; each clause adds new information or tactile detail.  A single mixed metaphor (“brittle as old parchment” for voice) is minor enough to leave closure untouched.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of celestial alignment, horticultural restoration, and grief-etched clipboard feels specific to this world rather than borrowed fantasy furniture.  Ritual-as-practice rather than magic is a fresh inflection on the familiar “plant a tree for peace” trope.  Risk is taken by keeping the climax a quiet kneel instead of a signed charter, yet coherence holds.  The piece does not quite reach the 9-band because the geopolitical backdrop (two nameable nations, war logistics) remains schematic, limiting the sense of lived inevitability.</comment>
