<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mira’s need to locate deleted minds is personal and legible; the brother reveal lands late but pays off. Interiority is concrete (“ran her fingers over the embroidered Artemis-7 insignia”) and choices escalate. Still, the final extraction decision is declared rather than dramatized with visible cost, so the arc crests just short of earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: patch photo → disappearances → 2347 trail → null-state discovery → extraction decision. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the “coordinates” re-weight the premise and the cost is conceptual—she will breach corporate walls. One minor causality bump: supervisor confrontation is skipped, so the lie beats lack external pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Archive is sketched through sensory micro-details—“abandoned playlists,” “server cluster that officially didn’t exist”—that double as plot vectors. The cubicle patch serves as embodied micro-setting and final talisman. Spatial clarity is maintained; no environmental detail is wasted.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recover erased minds—tightens when Mira learns they’re quarantined, not deleted, forcing an irreversible trespass. Pressure escalates via pattern recognition rather than external opposition; the cost is implied (job, safety), but not yet felt on the page, keeping it just shy of the 8.8 band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of digital afterlife versus corporate erasure emerges through plot particulars, not lecture. Final image of “coordinates” as promise reweights earlier number motif into ethical imperative. No moralizing paragraph; ambiguity lingers about what “bringing them home” means.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Mira’s perceptual filter—numbers “felt like a message” is her inference, not authorial truth. Syntax is controlled, rhythmic, and free of filter clutter. No dialogue to test, but internal voice is consistent and specific to her archivist mindset.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, and image-dense; no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is sparse and purposeful—“ghost-paths,” “digital grave”—never overwrought. Opening and closing lines frame stakes and reverb cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Consciousness backups trapped in null-state is fresh SF territory; the astronaut-vanishing hook reframes real-world data deletion dread. Recurrent 2347 evolves from Easter egg to map coordinate, making the gimmick indispensable. Risky concept carried off with emotional specificity rather than tech expo.</comment>
