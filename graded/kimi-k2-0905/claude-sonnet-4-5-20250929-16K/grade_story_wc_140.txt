<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The legally-nameless protagonist is vividly particularized through her tidal rituals and sensory filter of rust, salt, and poison; her contradictory impulses (yearning for justice yet accepting erasure) are dramatized in her nightly climb to the container roof. Micro-choices—tucking the label into the notebook, timing her eavesdropping to low tide—reveal a hierarchy of values that culminates in Earned Stasis: she accepts perpetual ghosthood to keep excavating truth. The missing 0.3 comes from the absence of any on-page relationship crucible; pressure is entirely atmospheric, not interpersonal.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Drive lens = Accumulative/Textural; closure is Charged Poise with conceptual cost. Pattern taught early: each fragment of overheard dialogue is a sedimentary layer that accrues until the final image of “toxic truths that refuse to dissolve.” Orientation is clean by 40 words; causality is internal but coherent—because she is dead on paper, therefore she can haunt the archive. The ending’s reweighting is unmistakable: the port becomes “a repository of erased histories” and her ghosthood the price; cost is felt, no cap triggered.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Container labyrinths, barnacled pilings, and sodium-cyanide texture are filtered through the POV’s obsessive professional gaze; the setting literally constrains her tactics—she can only move at low tide, must climb rusted walls to eavesdrop, and stores evidence inside a metal box. The final image of poison refusing to dissolve in salt water recharges every earlier sensory cue. Micro-setting (the label itself) doubles as tool and talisman, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake: resurrect the buried toxic history before memory fully rots. Escalation is textural—each overheard fragment tightens the noose of proof, culminating in the generational mutation anecdote that makes the cost bodily. Agency is observational but not passive; she risks exposure every time she climbs, and her final stance to “continue across the rhythm of tides” forecloses re-entry into legal life. One tightening beat suffices; cost is embodied in her permanent exile.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</question><comment>Theme emerges from sediment: erasure is itself a slow-acting poison that migrates through bodies, bureaucracies, and coastline. Subtext in dock-workers’ casual asides (“baby came out wrong”) carries more weight than any manifesto. Final image reweights the premise: the port is not moving goods but storing deadly residue; ghosthood becomes civic service. No moralizing, only charged poise; ambiguity lingers—truth may never outlive the rust.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person intimate sustains a salt-corroded diction—“aluminum canyon walls,” “barnacled secrets”—that is consistent, rhythmic, and specific to a chemist-turned-ghost. No dialogue, so voice distinction is intra-narrative: technical precision (sodium cyanide, non-disclosure agreements) collides with lyrical fragmentation. Compression taught early (“She had no name anymore, not officially”) pays off in the final cadence of “toxic truths that refuse to dissolve.” No head-hopping; perceptual signature remains steady.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet breathable; figurative language is selective and pattern-linked—“repository of erased histories,” “sedimentary evidence.” No mixed metaphors or template cadence. Two minor paraphrase loops (“listened… collecting fragments of overheard stories” echoed later) and one filter-verb cluster (“she felt its texture in her memories”) keep it under 9.0, but artifacts never touch closure. High information ratio: every sentence layers container, body, or poison.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fusion of toxic-archive noir with tidal ghost story feels fresh; premise turns bureaucratic erasure into literal haunting. Container port as memory landfill is non-obvious and specific; label fragment as both clue and wound is elegant. Risky choice—protagonist remains observer, not rescuer—heightens stakes without gimmickry. Synthesis inevitable in hindsight: the only place an erased woman can live is inside the city’s own rusted forgetting.</comment>
