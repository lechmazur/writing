<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marina’s obsession with “borrowed” life and her methodical, almost numb calm under pressure read as a lived, embodied contradiction. The moment she recognizes the snow-globe and chooses to secure it crystallizes her hierarchy of values: knowledge-over-safety, witness-over-extraction. Interiority stays concrete (“hands trembled inside the submersible’s controls”) and the final renunciation—accepting transformation instead of solving loss—carries visible cost in the gesture of shaking the globe while ascending. Minor slip: the grandmother’s theoretic voice is filtered through Marina’s paraphrase, blurring the generational interior boundary by a hair.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a textbook Conceptual Repricing: the log lines re-weight the entire quest by revealing that “letting go” is not an action but a refusal to keep preserving. The causal chain holds—descent → discovery → reading → ascent—each beat changes knowledge; the final image of swirling snow re-cues the grandmother’s question with the price now legible (the ascent itself is the renunciation of treasure). Lens: Causal held throughout; no orientation debt; no teleporting props. The only hairline slip is the off-stage sinking voiced through a document, but because that document is the sought-after transmission, causality remains intact.</comment>

<comment>Submersible cockpit, collapsed library shelves, and the slowly tilting floor form a micro-setting that literally constrains reach and sample collection. Brass cylinders scattered “like dropped cigarettes” and the waterproof radio housing give tactile specificity that guides Marina’s mechanical-arm choices. Spatial choreography is flawless: lights catch spine → shelves collapsed → captain’s quarters behind → snow globe anchored. Glycerin snow suspended mid-fall re-appears in the final image, charging closure by re-pricing the same object.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: will Marina find—and accept—her grandmother’s last message? Pressure escalates methodically: each cylinder collected tightens the possibility of failure (oxygen, visibility, sub limitations). The decisive turn is reading Marsh’s note; it forecloses her implicit hope that the equations “solved” grief and instead forces acceptance of perpetual transformation—cost paid on-page in her deliberate shake of the globe during ascent. No off-stage resolutions; coincidence only places the globe where promised by earlier manifest.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as “witnessing transformation beats solving loss.” Every particular—brass cylinders, snow storm inside glass, radio handwriting dissolving—rehearses the idea that patterns exist only in our holding them. Final image re-weights all prior metaphor without declaring a moral: snow keeps falling yet the lighthouse stands unchanged, offering a visual answer to the grandmother’s question. Subtext is carried by object handling and silence rather than articulated theory, resisting the requested −0.6 thematic-echo penalty.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays welded to Marina’s perceptual filter: she notices “barnacled spine,” “geometric avalanches,” “dropped cigarettes” imagery—no external lectures. Syntax lengthens and breathes during discovery, contracts during ascent, matching emotional tempo. No dialogue, so voice distinctness is judged solely on internal texture: the calmly analytic diction mirrors her professed stance while betraying trembling hands, a clean contradiction. Filter verbs are minimal; free indirect discourse is stable.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Rhythm flexes from long clause-catalog of findings to clipped clauses at ascent (“She shook it gently”). Metaphors are sparse, precise, tested against physical logic: cigarettes for cylinders, cathedral ghost for library—each serves discovery mood, never stacks. No synonym loops, no template cadence, no mixed metaphor. Information density high; one sentence often does two jobs (“Marina maneuvered…the mechanical arm with quietly analytic precision, collecting cylinders methodically, scanning each seal…”). Copy is clean; only nit is an extra comma after “4:47 AM” but clarity unharmed.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The Earhart–physics-of-grief fusion feels fresh and specific to this family; the sunken-library premise could have been pulp but is recast as conceptual archaeology. Snow globe transforms from kitsch gift to philosophical instrument—inevitable in hindsight, never gimmicky. No derivative phrasings or echo-famous scenes. The risk of a quiet, almost essayistic ending is embraced and paid off by a final image that re-weights everything without verbal moralizing, satisfying the +0.3 bold-use bonus.</comment>
