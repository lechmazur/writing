<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Vera’s terror of erasure and her pivot toward embracing dissolution are embodied in the mirror beat; the clasp pulse against her skin shows micro-choice hierarchy. Interiority stays concrete (“silver warm against her skin,” “repulsive, beautiful green light”) rather than label-speak. The final refusal to solidify is earned by prior causal chain—each confession literally blurs her further—so the renunciation carries visible cost. Advisor remains functional catalyst, but his absence of motive or status shift keeps relationship crucible slightly under-served.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: Vera’s face becomes “everything fear could never contain,” reweighting the curse rule-set with undeniable cost (she can never be photographed again). Causal lens holds: because she speaks fear to the mirrors, therefore her image dissolves. Orientation (who/where/when) is anchored by word 60 (“abandoned carnival funhouse”) and never breaks. Advisor’s teleporting entrance is the one unmotivated beat, but it complicates rather than resolves, so keeps ≥8.8 eligibility.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Opera-clasp-as-micro-setting constrains every beat: its green glow supplies the only light for the mirror confrontations and pulses brighter at the climax, directly charging the final image. Funhouse geometry is kept tactically specific: warped glass multiples, Vera leans closer, reflections shift to smoke. Weather and broader carnival remain off-stage, appropriate economy for 750-word count. Spatial choreography is clean—advisor steps between two mirrors, Vera pins clasp to collar without drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“will she keep hiding from erasure or embrace it?”—is signaled in paragraph 1 and tightens once: the dictionary entry forces the choice to speak. Cost is legible on-page: each confession literally erases more facial detail, foreclosing the option to ever be seen clearly again. Escalation is causal under chosen lens; no coincidence resolves. One meaningful turn satisfies 600-word scope; secondary stakes (advisor’s motive, carnival back-story) remain optional.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of “dissolution as liberation” emerges via image chain—blur, smoke, negative—never thesis statement. Final smile “not quite her, not quite anyone” offers resonant non-literal answer without moralizing. Dictionary paradoxes feel earned because they foreshadow the reversal Vera must perform. Repulsive-allure tone stays consistent, charging the closure image rather than decorating scenery.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited clings to Vera’s perceptual filter (“repulsive yet magnetic,” “overexposed negative”) with stable distance. Syntax mirrors her loosening self: clauses lengthen and fragment as face dissolves. Advisor’s voice is silk-on-glass distinct from Vera’s smoke-vision register. No head-hop; unreliability accrues only through Vera’s dawning misreading of curse-as-blessing.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies: short sentences under mirror pressure, then lyrical cascade during confession. No synonym loops; “green light” recurs with escalating charge rather than churn. Metaphors stay coherent (blur = smoke = possibility). Information density high: single sentence often anchors setting, emotion, and prop state (“She pinned the clasp to her collar and faced the nearest mirror”). Only micro-slip: “like silk dragged across broken glass” edges purple but is voice-motivated and paid off.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Photographic-curse-as-portal-to-formlessness is fresh synthesis of funhouse & photographic tropes. Grandmother actress back-story supplies specific historical root rather than generic curse. Final image of unfixable face catching dawn light reweights entire premise. Risk—refusing any solid visual of protagonist—pays off by making dissolution the stakes themselves.</comment>
