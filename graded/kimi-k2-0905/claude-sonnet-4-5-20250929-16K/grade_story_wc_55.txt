<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Maren’s retreat-from-music wound is vividly embodied (trembling hand, tear-wet cheeks) and the micro-choice to play anyway crystallizes her hierarchy of values; the renunciation of virtuoso dreams is earned, visible, and carries a felt cost in the final cadence.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the hush, crystals, and violin return in a charged final image that reweights silence from prison to chosen refuge; cost is legible when Maren decides she will “not become the virtuoso” and walks away bearing the instrument “differently now.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Crystal forecourt operates as micro-setting that constrains the choice—its echoing hush and rain-wet facets literally absorb and return her first note, making the act of playing irreversible; petrichor and moist stone are filtered through her sensory hierarchy, not tourist catalog.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—can she break her vow of silence—tightens once when the bow meets string; the price (public shame of imperfect sound) is named and paid on-page, though escalation is single-turn rather than progressively complex.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of “quiet chosen over acclaim” emerges from concrete particulars (clock-scribe solitude vs. violin dream); final image reframes silence as gift rather than failure, avoiding moralizing—resonance built through morning-song lullaby rather than assertion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Maren notices time, moisture, mechanical heartbeats; syntax elongates then fragments under bow-pressure; no head-hop; lyric compression (“glacial hush,” “crystal whispering”) is pattern-taught early and paid off in echoed final hush.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Strong read-aloud rhythm, sentences vary; occasional soft scaffold (“excruciatingly gentle” repeated thrice) but never obscures causality; no mixed metaphors; high information density in violin-unwrapping beat; prop tracking clean—bow, velvet, crystals stay spatially coherent.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: clock scribe + abandoned violin + singing stones; conceptually integrated but premise edges toward familiar “artist reclaiming art” arc—specificity of clocks vs. crystals keeps it from feeling template, yet transformation test shows plot could transplant with cosmetic edits.</comment>
