<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interior monologue is rich, idiosyncratic, and constant; the “grip reality loosely” mantra underwrites every micro-choice, culminating in the earned renunciation of exact memory. No contradictory impulse is dramatized in scene, however—only recursive affirmation—so the arc is flatter than a true 9-band. Still, the stance is lived-in, specific, and consistent under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens is declared early (“chronicle of metamorphosis”) and holds: each sensory block adds density until the origami re-folds, re-pricing the premise. Closure is a Charged Poise: the keeper will forget yet feel weight, a felt cost legible in the final image. One causal micro-gap—how the stone initiates the origami fold—is waved by lyric contract; the pattern is taught and paid off.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Catacomb library is not postcard backdrop; mushroom-eaten shelves, root-split ceiling, and ink-fed flowers actively constrain what can be archived and when sky will intrude. Micro-setting (swan, stone, desk) is handled in tactile loops that charge the final shelf placement. Sensory economy is impeccable—every detail either decomposes or seeds future growth.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—witness without judgment—tightens once: the stone offers deeper witness, she accepts, and the price is future oblivion. Escalation is textural density, not causal reversal; the library’s slow collapse is the pressure. Cost is conceptual (loss of precise recall) rather than visceral, adequate at this length but not punishing enough for 8.8+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of composted knowledge emerges from decaying paper → fungus → flowers; no editorial commentary required. Final image of “weight without memory” reweights all prior folds without moralizing. Ambiguity is purposeful: letting go is both loss and liberation. Nearly earns 9 but lacks a counter-argument on the page.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person lyric remains inside the keeper’s perceptual filter: syntax elongates and contracts like breath, lexicon stays archaeological/medieval, no filter-verb clutter. Rhythm mirrors underground hush—long sentences for descent, staccato clauses for fold-moments. Voice is unmistakably singular and stable under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet never purple; metaphors (ink as soil, silence as hum) stay coherent with ecosystem logic. Minor template cadence in “she had watched… she had witnessed…” loop (−0.2). Information density is high—each sentence at least doubles duty (setting + interiority, or object + theme). Closure line is clean, no artifact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>“Overgrown archive that eats its own books” is fresh synthesis of ruin-porn and eco-SF, made specific through fungal botany and paper-folding memory system. Risk—lyric stasis over plot—is justified by accumulative lens and pays off in conceptual re-pricing. Could edge higher if the stone’s origin carried any socio-political wrinkle, but within-band excellence achieved.</comment>
