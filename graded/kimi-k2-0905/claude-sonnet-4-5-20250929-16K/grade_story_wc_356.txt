<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Lirien’s interior contradiction—gifted nose that cripples her—is dramatized in every beat: she plants the seed, stays put while retching, and re-weights her sensitivity into serenity. The micro-choice to press the petal inside her journal crystallizes a hierarchy of values with visible cost. No secondary character applies pressure, so relationship bullets are waived. The only slip is a touch of therapeutic self-diagnosis (“this is the work”) that slightly flattens the peak moment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Lirien forecloses flight, pays with three days of nausea, and re-weights her lifelong affliction into mastery. Accumulative lens holds: each journal scrap and doodle accumulates density until the final “wildflower hush” re-prices presence over escape. Causality is clean—no teleporting props or retroactive knowledge. Minor waver: “wisdom had always flowed…like an underground river” is an abstract coda that slightly blunts the image-cost, keeping the score just sub-9.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The treetop village is never generic postcard: swaying platforms, rope bridges, and cedar scent constrain every move; wind direction decides where the stench drifts and where Lirien plants the pot. Body-as-setting is vivid—her stomach lurches, hands tremble, breathing shallows—anchoring spatial tension. The pressed petal inside the journal serves as micro-object that recharges the final image. One minor spatial fuzz: “platforms away” is imprecise distance, but it never confuses choreography.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can she endure her own sensitivity—tightens once when the bloom begins and again when she chooses to stay, narrowing her options from flight to witnessing. The reversal is internal but legible: nausea escalates from “faint musk” to “overwhelmed” and is paid for with three days of voluntary exposure. No coincidence resolves the conflict; the cost is visceral and persistent. Stakes remain personal, but the on-page price is unmistakable.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: serenity is not odorlessness but attuned presence. The corpse-flower-as-teacher motif is specific and re-weighted at closure when the stench becomes the instrument of stillness. Subtext resides in the doodled vines—an ancestral coping technology that silently transmits endurance. Final image avoids sermon, instead letting the swaying village mirror her internal poise. Only minus: the “underground river” metaphor drifts toward pseudo-profundity, slightly diluting earned resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Lirien’s perceptual signature: olfactory adjectives dominate, syntax lengthens under nausea, then tightens into staccato witness-notes. Diction—“journalize,” “olfactory,” “treetop”—remains within her herbalist lexicon. No dialogue appears, so voice contamination is impossible. Rhythm modulates with stress: clauses compress during the three-day bloom, then exhale into the dawn coda, achieving textured control without head-hop or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence or synonym loops detected. Figurative language is sparse and targeted—“like distant thunder,” “wind through branches”—never clogging the peak nausea beat. Information density high: one sentence often layers scent, bodily reaction, and spiritual note. Only micro-slip: “crystallized during a particularly chaotic monsoon season” compresses backstory into a single adverbial lump; a sharper image could replace “particularly chaotic.”</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Corpse-flower-as-spiritual-mentor is fresh; the inversion of affliction into curriculum feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Treetop village avoids twee eco-fantasy by grounding every botanical detail in Lirien’s trade. Doodled wrapping-paper ritual is a specific cultural invention that could feel gimmicky but earns closure weight. Risk is moderate—quiet ending, interior stakes—yet specificity and sensory inversion keep it north of median freshness.</comment>
