<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Maren’s interior contradiction—obedient copyist vs. clandestine archivist—drives every micro-choice; the “dust learns to remember” motive is vivid, embodied, and scales to the final cost. No second character on stage, so relationship crucible waived; solo POV sustains pressure. Final renunciation (banking the radio, accepting continued peril) is earned and foreclosed. Interiority stays concrete; only minor label-speak glint (“confirmation”) keeps this from 8-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure is a crisp Charged Poise: the amber after-glow and brighter dust crystallize risk and reconfigure meaning (“stories persist”). Causal chain intact: because she copies, therefore the code spreads; because the patrol passes, therefore she accepts perpetual danger. Orientation anchored by word 60; no lens ambiguity. Cost is felt—glow leaking through her fingers—yet the constraint (radio must stay hidden) shapes every tactic. Minor non-closure slip: “thistled calm” tag is tell-adjacent, not dramatized.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Ember alcove, mist, and chimney pocket act as micro-setting: warmth allows nightly work, mist cloaks the illegal dial, dust becomes mnemonic medium. Sensory hierarchy obeys Maren’s copyist attention: coal scent, scratch of pen, amber dial. Spatial choreography clean—radio beneath floor, desk above, boots outside. Final image—glowing dust—recharges setting as memory substrate, passing 9+ gate by a hair; earlier detail could have constrained a mid-scene choice more explicitly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—keep the stories alive under state surveillance—tightens when patrol nears; option set narrows to “risk capture or silence.” Agency is continuous (encoding lyrics, cloaking dial) rather than one decisive beat; the pattern intensifies rather than reverses, satisfying Accumulative lens. Cost is visible: glow leaks, dust brightens, danger persists. No causal reversal, but deepening suffices at this length; could enter 8.8+ if a single beat forced an irrevocable trade-off on page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges—memory’s indestructibility—via concrete motif chain: radio → encoded notes → luminous dust. No moralizing; final sentence merely images the promise. Subtext lives in silence (Archivist never speaks) and in pen-strokes that speak forbidden lines. “Thistled calm” line is the closest to overt thesis, but it is brief and charged by immediate peril; resonance lingers through the reweighted dust, not assertion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person close maintains consistent psychic distance, filtered through Maren’s copyist perceptions: “soft and amber, a second heartbeat.” Syntax grows clipped during patrol beat, mirroring pulse. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk zero; diction stays within plausible craft-worker lexicon. Patterned repetition (“stories persist, stories return”) is brief and payoff-linked, not algorithmic; rhythm breathes with scene tempo.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, high-density, no scaffold loops; figurative language is spare and coherent (“leaked through her fingers like captured fireflies”). Sentence variety good; opening and closing lines carry image-ear punch. Two near-adjacent “glow” mentions could have been varied, but do not stall momentum. No mixed metaphors or register drift; minor typo risk zero. Read-aloud rhythm solid; qualifies for 8.8+ if final image carried more syntactic surprise.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fusion of music cryptography + mnemonic dust + pirate radio in a post-story-famine world feels singular; none of the tropes arrive pre-chewed. Conceptual integrity holds—every fantastical element (luminous dust, lyric cipher) is causally tethered to Maren’s transcription craft. Risk—quiet lyric ending—pays off by reweighting dust as future speaker. No derivative scent; if names were swapped, the cipher mechanics would collapse, passing transformation test. Minor freshness dip in “kingdom that forgot its name” ballad trope, but it is one fragment among many, not the spine.</comment>
