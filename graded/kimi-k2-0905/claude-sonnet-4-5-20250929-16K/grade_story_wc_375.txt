<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Maya’s interior contradiction—memorializing strangers while burying her own gift—grounds every beat. The embodied smudge of charcoal on cold stone crystallizes grief; her choice to climb back up is earned by the letter’s weight and the docent’s pressure. Flaws (guilt, mnemonic curse) actively complicate the moment she touches the canvas again. Dialogue is sparse, but the docent’s intrusion supplies external pressure that forces status shift.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Maya accepts the gallery but the cost—exposing her buried grief—remains visible in the smudged frame. Causal chain is tight: docent’s discovery → confrontation → offer → ascent. Crystalline cave as hidden studio is anchored by ~120 words; no orientation debt. Lens is Causal; each beat narrows her options until refusal becomes impossible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Crystal cave fractures headlamp into “spectral shards” that mirror her emotional refraction; this micro-setting directly charges the final ascent. Charcoal smears on stone and broken lock are tactile, character-specific tools. Sensory hierarchy obeys an artist who notices light and texture before sound. Space is coherent: panel behind rock, distance tracked as she spins, climb back up literalized.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—bury or release her art—tightens once: lock broken, painting gone, docent’s offer. Agency: she chooses ascent, paying the price of exposure. Cost is visceral: charcoal fingers leave literal trace of grief on the frame. No coincidence; escalation driven by her buried secret surfacing.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the image of breathing—“stop holding your breath” reconfigured as leaving the tomb. No explicit moral; resonance carried by the final climb toward light. Subtext in the broken lock: her own mechanism of suppression sabotaged. Aurora sorrow remains coherent, shifting to wary hope without sentimental toggle.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Third-person tight sustains artist’s perceptual bias: light, texture, pigment. Phrase “auroral sorrow” risks purple but is isolated and voice-motivated. Rhythm modulates: long sentence of memory collapses into staccato “Show me the gallery space.” No head-hopping; docent’s dialogue carries subtext of maternal transfer. Filter verbs minimal; “felt the letter’s weight” is justified by tactile obsession.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Strong information density: one sentence slips lock, letter, memory, and future in a single breath. Occasional elevated diction (“spectral shards,” “auroral sorrow”) flirts with over-figuration but stays within POV’s artistic lexicon. No loops or template cadence; each sentence advances. Opening line anchors stakes and place; final line resolves by vertical motion—resurrection literalized.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Fresh angle: sidewalk portraitist as ghost of her own buried gallery. Transformation test passes—swap artist/cave/lock and the emotional math collapses. Risky metaphor “auroral sorrow” is earned by cave optics. Docent as ghost-mother avoids sentimental rescue by admitting intrusion and theft.</comment>
