<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Mara’s refusal to reproduce is stated early and reiterated, but the interior contradiction—her need to “listen” versus the family’s greed—remains summary until the final beat. The embodied tremble when she lifts the deed supplies the first visible cost, earning the quiet renunciation. Still, the dynastic flaw is told more than dramatized; one extra micro-choice under pressure would have pushed this past 8.5.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the safe opens not to gold but to moral absolution, reversing four generations of perceived failure. The causal chain—crank → standing waves → hidden panel—remains tight under the Accumulative/Textural lens; each tonal pulse thickens the dust motes, reweighting the stake without dialogue. Orientation is swift; “first yawn of evening” anchors time and the sepia room by line 3. The only drag is a mid-scene lull while Mara “muses”; trimming one reflective sentence would clear 9.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The curved walls and brass horn are not backdrop; they are the lockpick. Every sensory pick—dust motes thickening, golden shadows pooling—directs Mara’s finger to the depression beside the dial, making environment the active agent. The micro-setting of the gramophone bolted to one spot literalizes the family’s fixed guilt. One more tactile beat (heat of the brass, vibration in her palm) would have nudged 9+.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will Mara find proof that the dynasty was already bankrupt—tightens when the standing waves reveal the safe seam, foreclosing the option to keep blaming herself. Pressure escalates via density, not violence: each sustained tone adds visible mass to the air, making the hidden document feel inevitable. The cost is conceptual rather than corporeal, but the family’s century of litigation is rendered moot on the page, satisfying the lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as the inverse of the expected treasure hunt: inherited wealth was already given away, so Mara’s “failure” to perpetuate the line becomes the ethical triumph. The golden shadows shift from nostalgic patina to moral illumination without a single explicit thesis. Subtext sits in the gramophone’s silence after the deed is read—absolution louder than any tone. Only the faintest whiff of final-sentence uplift keeps this from 9+.</comment>

<question>6</question><<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person interiority stays close to Mara’s perceptual filter—“listening with your whole soul”—and never drifts into family gossip’s POV. Syntax lengthens during the drone, then fractures into short gasps at the reveal, mirroring sonic pressure. The diction (“sepia,” “standing waves”) remains within the lexicon of a physics-savvy heir. One passive clause (“had been bolted”) could be cut, but voice control is otherwise exemplary.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sentences do double duty: “amber light slanting…to paint everything in sepia tones” sets scene and moral tint in one stroke. No paraphrase loops; each clause advances image or decision. Metaphors stay coherent—sound becomes canvas, dust becomes pigment—without purple overload. A single adverb (“precisely”) is expendable, yet momentum never stalls.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The heirloom-safe-via-soundwave reveal feels fresh because the treasure is moral, not material; the genre of ancestral mystery is inverted into anti-inheritance. Specificity—1903 worker-bond ledger, textile-mill geography—grounds the twist so it cannot be ported unchanged to another family saga. Risk is taken by making the climax a quiet unfolding of paper rather than a confrontation; the payoff is earned stasis rather than catharsis.</comment>
