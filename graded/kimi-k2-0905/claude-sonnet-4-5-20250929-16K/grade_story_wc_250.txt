<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mara’s guilt, silence, and eventual confession are kinesthetic and embodied; her throat-stone and the act of running to the harbor master crystallize cost. The guardian’s still-water eyes and mirrored choreography externalize motive without slipping into expositional interiority. Interior contradiction—wanting absolution yet fearing voice—drives her micro-choice to place her own mirror at the end, earning the Earned Stasis coda. Only lapse: the brother’s off-page rescue is heard, not paid for in visible consequence to her body/stance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Mara’s spoken truth reconfigures the canal’s light-network and her own agency, mirror-to-mirror. Causal chain—guilt → silent patterns → confession → downstream rescue—coheres under Situational lens; coincidence (brother found alive) complicates rather than resolves. Cost is legible in the final image: she stays to learn the patterns, trading silence for perpetual vigil. Minor slack: orientation is complete by line 6, but the guardian’s first mirror angle could be cued one beat sooner.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Cobalt dock after rain is not postcard backdrop; its wet planks refract both twilight and guilt, forcing the mirror’s necessity. Micro-setting excellence: the dental mirror’s circular glass becomes a moveable star, constraining every tilt and flash; the shutter grid across water functions as a living keyboard. Spatial choreography is immaculate—rope coils, pilings, and window angles track without drift. Only micro-slip: “shuttered buildings that lined the canal” repeats twice in close proximity.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will Mara break silence before darkness drowns her—is signaled in paragraph 3. Escalation is textural: each mirrored pattern thickens communal witness, tightening her throat-stone until speech is the only remaining option. The final tightening (her sprint to the harbor master) is driven by guardian gesture, not her own prior plan—slight agency dip yet cost remains visible as she volunteers coordinates that could indict her. Mirror-to-mirror inheritance at end reweights stakes from rescue to perpetual stewardship.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges without thesis: light is meaningless without something to silhouette—guilt becomes the necessary shadow that gives conscience shape. Subtext pulses in gesture—mirror flashes replace absolution, shutters replace jury. Final image of her placing her own mirror re-prices silence as an ongoing debt rather than a paid one. Avoids moral arithmetic; complexity lingers in the possibility that future complicity will again need stars.</comment>

<comment>Third-person lyric stays tight to Mara’s perceptual filter: “fragments of twilight like scattered coins” codes her guilt-as-currency. Sentence rhythm mirrors canal motion—long fluid clauses broken by staccato flashes (“opening and closing, shadow and illumination”). Guardian’s silence is never ventriloquized; his POV remains opaque, preserving distance. Zero head-hopping; compression (“spiralingly calm”) is taught early and paid off in final cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose density is high—almost every sentence twins sensory image with emotional charge (“cobalt dock glistened…reflecting fragments…like scattered coins”). No filter-verb stacks, no synonym loops; metaphor vehicles stay internally consistent (light = currency, stars = guidance). One mixed image—“stillwater tension: surface calm concealing profound depth”—slightly abstracts the guardian’s eyes, but it is brief and recovered. Read-aloud rhythm accelerates across the confession paragraph without tumble.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: dental mirror + Venetian-shutter semaphore = wordless confession protocol. Guardian trope is inverted—he teaches others to speak rather than speaking for them. Conceptual risk—silence as instructional medium—pays off without gimmickry. Specificity of canal etiquette (residents decode flashes) roots invention in lived world, resisting allegorical drift.</comment>
