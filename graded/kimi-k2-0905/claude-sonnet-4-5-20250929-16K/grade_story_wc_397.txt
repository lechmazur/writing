<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Vera’s contradictory impulses—scheduled death versus the will to keep helping—co-exist in scene, not exposition. The micro-choice to ferry the stranded family crystallizes her new hierarchy of values. The parasol’s cracked tip embodies earned endurance rather than easy symbolism. What keeps this from 9-band is that the grandmother’s “crossed over” line is the only external pressure testing Vera’s stance; a second on-page challenge would have foreclosed the Nuuk option with sharper cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the open laptop and un-pressed cancellation button reconfigure stakes with felt cost. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—ice sounds, database trawling, and parasol handling accrue until a cadence shift (“in no particular hurry”) reframes the dominant stake. Causality remains intact: because she ferries one family, she postpones her own ending. Cost is visible in the un-pressed button; no lens ambiguity at end.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The drift-ice marina is not backdrop but active constraint: cracking bergs dictate rescue routes, shrinking floes force the pick-up, wind temperature decides parasol use. Body-as-setting works too—gloved hand, salt-spray face—filtering every detail through Vera’s exhausted感官 hierarchy. Spatial choreography is flawless from dock to prow to shelter. The parasol’s cracked tip is the micro-object that charges the final image; without it, the closing beat loses its physical metaphor for fragile persistence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“learn the sound of approaching endings”—tightens when the grandmother’s song literalizes that sound while Vera ferries life instead of waiting for death. Escalation is textural: each ice crack, child laugh, and keystroke adds density until the un-pressed button becomes the decisive cost. Agency is present but quiet; a louder external jeopardy beat (e.g., panicking child, capsizing risk) would have pushed this to 9-band. Still, the accrued texture reweights options under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from Vera’s changed posture toward time: letting go and holding on become the same gesture. No character states this; the grandmother’s song and the un-pressed button carry the reconfiguration. Subtext is richest in the parasol’s fracture—an image that moves from prophetic guilt to earned resilience. The refusal to name “what came next” avoids moralizing and lets the reader feel the conceptual cost of indefinite patience.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Vera’s perceptual signature: she interprets ice noise as “sheet music,” notices lace fracture before structural integrity. Syntax lengthens and relaxes in sync with her loosened grip on reality. No head-hopping; Marcus’s dialogue is filtered through Vera’s ears. Free indirect style is clean: “She would stay through summer, she decided” marries interior cadence to narrative tense.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm mirrors melt-and-refreeze cadence: long clauses crack into fragments at moments of loosened grip. Information density is high—one line can do weather, body, and metaphor without padding. Zero filter-verb clusters; no mixed metaphors. Minor paraphrase loop in “she told herself… but truthfully” is voice-motivated and paid off by the un-pressed button, so no deduction touches closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The euthanasia-tourist-turned-relief-volunteer frame is fresh, and the parasol cracked by Arctic utility transforms the heirloom trope. Vera’s “fold in patience” offers a non-obvious emotional technology: enduring by loosening grip. Risk—lyric accumulation instead of plot reversals—pays off when the final cadence reconfigures meaning. If the rescue scene had carried a sharper physical jeopardy, this would breach 9.5.</comment>
