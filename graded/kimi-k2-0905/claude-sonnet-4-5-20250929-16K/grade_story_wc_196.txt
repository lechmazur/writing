<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Sarah’s grief-widowhood and meticulous record-keeper nature are anchored in concrete gestures—dust-reading, button-turning, lamp-lighting. The decisive pivot from private mourning to public historian is earned by the causal chain button→list→new file, with visible cost: she stays after dark, heart still broken but hands now tasked with resurrecting twelve erased lives. Interior contradiction (“broken heart / steady hands”) is held in scene, not declared. The only minor slip is a trace of therapeutic self-diagnosis (“she had found her way to hope”) that slightly blurs the embodied moment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the button pinned to the desk lamp re-weights the entire archive—soldier J’s erased kindness is now physically and narratively irrecoverable part of the city’s record. Causal linkage holds: each discovered document tightens Sarah’s options until the only ethical move is to create the counter-file. Orientation is secured by word 80 (“Philadelphia Foster Care Bureau, six months after Andersonville”). Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, the dust-to-button pattern accumulates density then crystallizes meaning, paying off with undeniable social cost—J’s court-martial remains irreversible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The file room functions as micro-setting: dust thickness becomes a legible map, brass button a portable spotlight, lamplight a timepiece. Sensory hierarchy obeys Sarah’s archival gaze—visual dust geography, tactile paper brittleness, auditory silence of basement—each selecting detail that later constrains her choice to keep working after closing. Spatial choreography is flawless: folders are stacked, rolled documents slipped, button travels from crack to palm to desk-edge. The tiny attic of artifacts (button, lamp, dust) stands in for Civil-War-era Philadelphia without tourist landmarks, and recharges the final image when the button catches the lamplight—setting literally illuminates the reconfigured meaning.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—magnifying erased kindness—signals early. Pressure escalates texturally: each new document (James→Ruth→list) thickens the moral density until Sarah’s only route is to sacrifice evening/rest and author the counter-file. Cost is visible: she lights a second lamp, accepts open-ended workload, pins the button—an implicit promise that her nights will now be spent in unpaid historiography. Coincidence (finding the list inside the second folder) complicates rather than rescues, forcing the climactic choice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Theme emerges from particular to universal: dust patterns→button→twelve names→“someone should know they existed.” No moral is stated; the final image of the button catching lamplight is the non-literal answer—small kindnesses literally shine once archived. Subtext resides in objects: the button is both military honor and foster-care promise, its tarnish matching the bureaucratic erasure of J.’s desertion. The piece invites counter-reading: is Sarah healing or substituting one obsession for another? Ambiguity lingers without confusion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</question><comment>Third-person intimate stays locked to Sarah’s perceptual signature—dust as text, button as “near-black,” lamplight as moral gauge. Syntax lengthens with archival care (“layer by delicate layer”) then tightens under discovery (“She held it to the lamplight, turning it slowly”). No dialogue, so voice carries all subtext through free-indirect filtration. Diction remains period-plausible; no corporate register intrusion. The only hairline slip is one passive clause (“had been forgotten”) that could have been active, but it does not occur under peak pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</question><comment>Prose is dense yet breathable: one sentence often simultaneous jobs—world-build, characterize, advance. Metaphors are coherent (“dust settled like benedictions”) and sparing; no mixed vehicles. Rhythm modulates: long cadence for grief-catalogue, staccato for discovery beats. No synonym loops or template cadence detected. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image that recharges earlier motifs. Minor scaffolding: “she thought” could be trimmed, but it falls outside the closure beat and does not obscure causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</question><comment>Freshened Civil-War orphan trope by focusing on post-war bureaucratic limbo and the archivist who reads dust as cartography. Button-as-archive-device is specific: Union eagle stamped on a foster-care promise, its tarnish an index of erased Black soldier sacrifice. Synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight—of course the record-keeper would resurrect the deserter who saved children. Risk taken: 100% interior, no external antagonist, yet pressure holds. The only near-echo is “Andersonville” as shorthand grief, but it is grounded in Sarah’s pocketed letters, not borrowed gravitas.</comment>
