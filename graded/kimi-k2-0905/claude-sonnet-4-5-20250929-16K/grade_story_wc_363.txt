<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The loom-spinner’s interiority is concrete—bleeding fingers, the amber bead lifted from her neck, the loom’s silence—yet her motives stay elemental (save daughter, give life) rather than contradicted under pressure. The single contradiction we see is the memory of laughter that “cut deep” while her face stays “stoically sparkling,” a nice fracture, but it never complicates the onward plan. Her final renunciation is earned and costly, yet because no secondary pressure (another person, a ticking resource) ever tests her, the arc is linear rather than genuinely crucible-forced.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the tapestry lifts, she pays with “the essential warmth that had kept her breathing,” daughter receives knowledge—an earned Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout: each shuttle pass thickens pattern and stakes until the seventh-day cadence releases the message-mist. Cause-and-effect is internal (memory → puzzle edges → loom bridge) rather than external, but the piece teaches that logic early and pays it off in the final image of the dimmed amber bead.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Environment is never backdrop: the bamboo forest presses light into “filtered sun,” the orchard’s oldest tree literally yields the puzzle box, the loom’s warp constrains every tactical move. The amber bead itself becomes micro-setting—its century of sunlight is spent—so setting charges the final image as required for 9-band entry. Only the daughter’s village remains off-stage, but that omission is purposeful, keeping the lens tight to the spinner’s pocket of time.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—message must cross impossible distance—is signaled in paragraph four and tightens through the seven-day weave; each day is a beat that forecloses stamina and life-force. The price is relentlessly visible: “fingers bled; she didn’t stop,” culminating in the chest-loosening departure of her own animating warmth. No coincidence intrudes; escalation is purely accumulative intensity ratcheted by repetition and bodily attrition.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the twin strands of transmission and erasure: what is preserved (remedy, love) is exactly what is expunged (the spinner’s life-light). Subtext lives in gesture—puzzle edges once played with by a laughing child now become mortal anchors—no need to state the paradox. Final image reweights the premise: the orchard glows “as if accepting her into its own timelessness,” a conceptual repricing that lets silence knit itself closed, leaving only the knowledge in the daughter’s tears.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person omniscient stays at an austere lyric distance that matches the mythic task; diction is controlled (“raveling silence,” “threadbare time”) without drifting into purple. Rhythm swells and breathes with the shuttle: long sentences for the weave, clipped fragments for the seventh evening release. No head-hop, no filter-verb clutter; the voice is consistent and particular.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is almost loop-free; only tiny scaffolds (“the edges—the edges remained intact”) are purposeful emphatic repetitions. Metaphors stay coherent (loom = prayer = time) and do not stack during the climax. Information density is high—each sentence threads setting, emotion, and stake together. Final line lands clean with no artifactual drag.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The puzzle-piece/loom interface feels inevitable and fresh: childhood relic repurposed as temporal conduit. Sacrifice-through-craft reverses typical quest tropes without irony, embracing latent rather than heroic sacrifice. Risk—the lyric, non-character point-of-view in a 750-word piece—heightens mythic coherence rather than obscuring it. Specificity of the amber bead’s “trapped sunlight from a century past” anchors the fantastical in tactile detail.</comment>
