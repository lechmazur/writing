<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mara’s “chronically curious” nature is dramatized in her wading through tide, cross-referencing charts, and finally pressing the fairy ring; the return of the seventeen-year-old’s choice shows a believable arc. Interiority is specific (salt-apple smell, the gap “like a missing tooth”) and her flawed earlier cowardice complicates the present. The earned cost—accepting the burden of memory—lands cleanly. Only minor drift: “documenting everything” is told, not embodied, in the final beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Mara’s palm on the fairy ring recovers memory and reweights her life’s work with undeniable cost—she is “whole again” yet burdened. Causal chain holds: curiosity → return → chart study → ring touch → flood of memory. Orientation anchors within 120 words; the moonlit greenhouse and knee-deep tide ground who/where/when. Lens is Causal; every beat narrows options toward the single irrevocable key-turn.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The shattered greenhouse panes, moon-fractured glass, and salt-apple air are lived-in and pressure choices—she positions herself at the pentacle they form. The sunken orchard’s biology (roots gripping underwater) and the accidental “cathedral” of shipwrecks constrain movement and echo the memory-cathedral she enters. Micro-setting (star chart, fungal halos) is handled, not catalogued. Final image of broken constellations recharges the setting with cost.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recover stolen memory—signals early; the autumn equinox tide acts as a ticking clock that forces tonight’s attempt. Escalation is the mounting alignment of mushroom rings with fractured constellations, narrowing to the single key-press beat. Cost is visceral: the memory floods back with the weight of decades, foreclosing her earlier ignorance. No coincidence; the tightening is entirely driven by her detect-study-act agency.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly: knowledge demands payment, and forgetting is only a deferral, not escape. The fairy-ring-as-archive motif reweights at closure without moralizing. Crisp nostalgia is earned through sensory particulars (salt air, apple smell) rather than abstract longing. No thesis statement; the final smile documents rather than explains.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-limited stays tight to Mara; perceptual signature is folklorist-technical (“pentacle,” “bioluminescence”) fused with teenage awe. Syntax clusters under pressure—“She looked up…saw them”—then lengthens during memory flood, mirroring cognition. No head-hopping; even the guardian woman is filtered through seventeen-year-old Mara’s recall. Register holds: no drift into academic jargon beyond what the POV owns.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet fluid—“moonlight like scattered pearls across dark water” packs image and mood in one stroke. No synonym loops; each fungal/celestial reference adds new structural data. Rhythm breathes: short sentences for ring-press shock, longer cadence for memory tide. Only hairline slip: “documenting everything” briefly abstracts an action that could be micro-scene’d.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Fairy-ring-as-memory-archive feels fresh; the submerged greenhouse cathedral is a vivid synthesis of maritime-gothic and folk-horror. The Hebridean star-chart method particularizes the global trope of star-magic. Risk—using fractured constellations visible only through broken glass—pays off by making setting active in the revelation. Transformation is strong: swap any detail and the mechanism collapses.</comment>
