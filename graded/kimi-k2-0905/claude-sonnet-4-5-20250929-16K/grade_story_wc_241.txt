<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira’s contradictory impulses—intellectual scorn for her father’s gambling yet emotional compulsion to finish his cipher—are dramatized in the notebook scene and the decision to co-author recovery. The final micro-choice (packing lantern & notebooks to visit him) crystallizes a hierarchy of values with visible cost: she accepts the same “uncalculable” wager he once did, inheriting risk rather than merely critiquing it. Interiority stays concrete, no label-speak. One hairline slip: “wanted to widen perspectives responsibly” is stated motive, not embodied; keeps it just under 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the lantern-light transferred from father to daughter reweights the premise—probability is no longer abstract but a shared, living stake in his recovery. Causal chain holds: notebooks discovered → interpreted → syllabus drafted → visit chosen; each because/therefore narrows options toward joint risk. Orientation anchored by word 80; no lens ambiguity. Cost is legible in the final image (“mathematics wouldn’t save them…might help them understand what needed saving”). Minor time-gap ellipsis between drafting syllabus and receiving text is fully motivated.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Rain, skylight glass, and unmowed clover function as micro-setting that constrains attention: the downpour traps her inside long enough to decrypt the notebooks; the clover’s “tiny prisms” refract the emotional cost in the last paragraph. Candle lantern is handled twice—lit, then packed—its mica pane clouding and clearing parallel her shifting certainty. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: academic mind notices watercolor blur of green, then seizes on quantifiable raindrops. Environment is not backdrop; it licenses the reflective space required for the syllabus beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether to repeat or break the father’s contradiction—tightens once: decoding shifts her from observer to participant. The syllabus draft is the irreversible choice that forecloses pure critique; visiting him will expose her to the same stochastic abyss. Pressure is internal yet coherent and cumulative under the Accumulative/Textural lens. No external antagonist needed; the “conditional probability” of recovery supplies sufficient jeopardy. Cost is felt: she shoulders the burden of proof—literally carrying the notebooks—accepting potential failure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: knowledge does not immunize against compulsion; transmission of risk across generations is the price of love. Subtext lives in objects—lantern, notebooks, clover—each re-priced at closure. Final image reframes earlier “Expected Feeling of Aliveness: Incalculable” as filial bond rather than casino thrill. Ambiguity remains: reader cannot know if her course or his rehab will beat the odds, yet the emotional aftereffect is concrete. No moralizing, only reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature is mathematically poetic—rain as “steady percussion,” clover holding “tiny prisms.” Syntax lengthens during decryption, then shortens at decision, mirroring cognitive load. No dialogue, so voice carries all subtext; diction stays within Mira’s lexicon (“probabilistic mind,” “conditional probability”). One clause drifts toward editorial we—“we statistical models”—but reads as free-indirect scorn of her father’s lecture voice, so allowed.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet breathable: “watercolor abstraction,” “psychological cartography,” “compressed symbolic language” all twin image with idea. No scaffold loops; each sentence advances stakes or texture. Metaphors are coherent (rain as percussion, notebooks as prison graffiti) and do not overpopulate high-pressure beats. Clause rhythm modulates: cumulative anaphora in notebook list, then clipped final line. Copy is clean; only nit is minor over-modification “clean-washed air,” but it occurs post-closure and does not dull the image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh angle: uses probability theory itself as inherited addiction, turning abstract math into visceral family legacy. Notebooks-as-cipher and lantern-as-risk-token feel inevitable, not gimmicky. Synthesis of academic rigor with casino pathology is specific to this father-daughter dyad. Risk is taken—quiet lyric ending instead of casino relapse—but coherence rewards the gamble. Could edge higher if clover motif were seeded earlier; as is, originality is high but not genre-bending.</comment>
