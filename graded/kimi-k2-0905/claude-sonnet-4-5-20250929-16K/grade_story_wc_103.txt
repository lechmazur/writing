<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Miriam’s vocation and retro-cognition are one: every design choice is simultaneously memory-mining. The trembling hand on the notebook, the deliberate planting of a root bridge that she has already seen fall—all externalize her interior fracture without diagnostic jargon. Her final dispersal is the only logical extension of a self that has been lived by every prior instant; the cost is the body itself. No secondary characters appear, so the crucible is internal and flawlessly sustained.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens declared by the first paragraph (“yesterday, last month, centuries ago, all at once”) and held to the last breath. Each sensory parcel—fading photographs, warming halo shard, root-hairs threading stone—adds density until the fabric tears. The closure is a Charged Poise: Miriam becomes the garden’s memory, a conceptual repricing that makes her absence the price of the maze’s continued teaching. Causality is not linear but recursive, exactly as the hyperbolic premise promises.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</question><comment>The living bridge garden is never backdrop; its root-architecture physically performs the hyperbolic curvature Miriam tries to map. Tool-micro-setting fusion: the halo fragment is both compass and scalpel, pressed into the hedge-wall to cut time rather than leaf. Spatial choreography is immaculate—each bridge, pool, and hedge loop is re-navigated under escalating retrocognitive overlay so that geography equals chronology. Final image: the maze stands, now literally grown from her dissolved body—setting as charged residue.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</question><comment>Dominant stake—”to discover the texture of time”—is announced in paragraph four and tightened by every sensory accumulation; the photographs’ loss of dimension is the first visible price, the halo burn the second, dissolution the last. No artificial reversals are needed: each recursive vision is a deepening, not a swivel. Escalation obeys the Accumulative lens: density, not causal surprise, is the engine. Cost is legible on the page in molecules that forget how to cohere.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.4</question><comment>Theme emerges as the equation of memory and topography: time is not a line but a surface that can be walked until the walker becomes its thread. The fading photographs and the root-woven bridges are the same material—organic lattices that forget and remember simultaneously. Closure reweights the premise: the maze does not reveal time’s secret; it consumes the seeker and thereby becomes the secret. No moral is stated; the garden simply exhales, now haunted by a new layer of retrocognitive lace.</question>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</question><comment>Third-person intimate maintains psychic distance equal to the retrocognitive bleed—narrator knows only what Miriam can feel folding inside her skull. Syntax mimics hyperbolic curvature: long looping anacolutha that spiral back to their own tails (“she saw...she saw...she saw”). Diction stays within a designer’s lexicon—”saddle-point surfaces,” “recursive tessellation”—never slipping into textbook abstraction because it is always yoked to touch (thumb on crystal, palm on bark). Final dissolution is rendered in a single clause whose brevity after such syntactic expansion performs the vanishing.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</question><comment>No scaffold, no loops, no synonym churn; every sentence either thickens texture or advances the final dispersal. Metaphors are self-consistent: watercolor bleed, scratched record, mirror corridor—each re-enacts the same recursive logic so that figurative layer equals conceptual layer. Information density is extreme yet limpid: “the photographs were losing not just color but dimensionality” packs world-rule, visual detail, and escalating cost into twelve words. Read-aloud rhythm accelerates into the flare-sentence, then snaps to white silence—line-level craft that enacts the story’s own cut in time.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.5</question><comment>Few stories dare to literalize hyperbolic geometry as living architecture and then digest the protagonist into that lattice. The fusion of retrocognition, horticulture, and higher-dimensional math feels inevitable because every detail is rooted in tactile procedure—tracing curves, planting willows, heating crystal. Risk is maximal: a lyric, non-causal structure in under 800 words that ends in conceptual dispersal rather than event. The synthesis is so singular that removing any one element (hedge maze, halo shard, fading photos) would collapse the entire recursive engine.</comment>
