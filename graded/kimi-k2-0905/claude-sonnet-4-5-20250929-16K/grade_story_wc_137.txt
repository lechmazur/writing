<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elena’s interiority is vivid—‘kindness hollowed her bones’—and her micro-choice to palm the tile launches the visions. The empathy-overload flaw is credible, but the grief-to-hope swing is compressed into a single epiphanic beat; we are told she feels ‘less guarded’ rather than shown a concrete behavioral shift that costs her something on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: Elena stays to transcribe, foregoing the escape she once sought. The tile’s causal chain (whale song → crystalline recording → number shift → memory bleed) is legible and the lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds; the cost is the acceptance of perpetual exposure to others’ grief. Orientation is anchored by line 4; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The tower’s crumbling stone that ‘carry whale songs inland’ is a living instrument; the obsidian tile is a micro-setting that literally rewrites itself, constraining Elena’s choices. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven—she notices medical steadiness in her own hand. The final image keeps the tower humming as a recording device, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: can she bear to keep feeling others’ pain? Escalation occurs when the tile’s shift forces her to relive her own failures; the tightening is the realization that the library is endless and her transcription will never finish. The price—staying—lands on the page. One meaningful deepening is sufficient for this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the accumulating metaphor of recorded resonance: memory outlives the individual. No explicit thesis is stated; the final image of ‘unheard symphony’ reweights her earlier flight as purposeful endurance. Subtext in Amit’s disappearance implies suicide, adding moral complexity without moralizing. Minor edge: ‘space between skepticism and faith’ flirts with Echo but is embedded in action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric remains close to Elena’s surgical eye: ‘steady from years of surgery.’ Syntax lengthens under whale-song crescendo, then shortens during transcription beats. No dialogue, so voice distinction is internal; perceptual signature is strong. Filter verbs are minimal and justified (‘she felt it in her teeth’).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm modulates: long sinuous sentences mirror whale song, staccato clauses during tile shifts. No mixed metaphors; ‘frequencies just beyond human perception that made the ancient observatory hum’ is precise. One paraphrase loop: ‘memories crashed… not her own’ / ‘she saw through Amit’s eyes’ could merge. Information density high; each sentence layers sensory, emotional, and conceptual work.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>The whale-song-as-data-storage premise is fresh, grounded in piezoelectric logic. The tile’s shifting numerals translate vibration into memory, avoiding convenient magic. Risk: grief-as-library could feel abstract, but Elena’s surgical past and Amit’s suicide anchor it. The synthesis of astrophysics, marine biology, and medical burnout feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
