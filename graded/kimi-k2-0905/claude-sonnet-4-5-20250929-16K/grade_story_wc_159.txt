<question>1</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Miren’s quiet stewardship is rendered through tactile micro-choices—rotating humidity, cradling the cracked tube—that betray a latent contradiction: she conserves feelings she can no longer feel. The foxglove regret is embodied, not labeled, and her final act of forging a new chime from a dead orchid crystallizes a renunciation that costs her the last illusion of perfect preservation. Interiority stays concrete and character-specific; no stock caretaker tropes intrude. The only flaw is a slight over-sweetness in the closing “love directed toward ghosts,” which edges toward abstract sentimentality rather than embodied ache.</comment>

<comment>The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: the narrative accumulates sonic and luminous textures until the new chime re-tunes the library, reweighting the stake with felt cost. Anchors (who/where/when) are clear by line 3; the floating library and seventeen-year tenure ground orientation without debt. Closure is a Charged Poise: the orchids blaze, the library sings, and Miren’s purpose is reframed as eternal custodianship of loss—cost is the unending ache she now names. Pattern holds; no lens ambiguity at end.</comment>

<grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The opal library above the clouds is not mere postcard beauty; its altitude and translucent walls literally permit the dawn light to fracture and re-tune the orchids, constraining how Miren can sound them. The cracked bamboo tube becomes a micro-setting that forces her invention of the glass chime; the shattered orchid shard is handled on-page and its re-purposing alters the final harmonic. Sensory detail is selective—rose/amber fractures, copper sunset—always filtered through Miren’s curator eye rather than tourist catalog. Environment, tool, and recurring object meet the 9+ gate by shaping tactics and charging the last image.</comment>

<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—preserve the orchids’ emotional frequencies—signals in paragraph 2 and tightens when the cracked tube threatens total dissonance. The meaningful deepening occurs when Miren realizes the fracture has birthed an unnamed emotion; this reweights the stakes from salvage to creation. Agency is her systematic sonic mapping and glass-chime forge; price is the admission that some feelings are now hers alone to host. Escalation is textural rather than causal, but the final cadence shift lands with undeniable cost under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the inverse relation between preservation and erasure: the more perfectly Miren saves extinct feelings, the more she becomes the sole vessel of their loneliness. The foxglove regret motif ripens into a quiet thesis that memory itself is a doomed horticulture. No final-paragraph moralizing; the last image of starlight through opal walls reconfigures the cost without naming it. Subtext in the phonograph lullaby-dirge lets reader decide whether consolation or mourning is uppermost.</question>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited adheres to Miren’s perceptual signature—opal shadows dance across her palm, glass petals “sing back”—without POV leakage. Syntax flexes under pressure: long, humid sentences during cataloguing tighten into clipped fragments when she hears the new frequency. No dialogue, so voice distinction is judged solely on interior coherence, which holds. The lyric register stays curator-precise rather than purple, though “multitudes of feeling” skirts excess.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm is varied; sentence lengths swell and contract with Miren’s attention. Figurative language is sparse and purposive—fractures of rose/amber, burning copper—never clustering into purple haze. Information density high: one sentence can anchor setting, object, and emotional tilt (“She held the broken tube to the light, watching opalescent shadows dance across her palm, and felt foxglove regret”). No synonym churn or template cadence; only a single paraphrase loop (“feelings that now existed only here...in this library above the world”) costs −0.2, capping Q7 at 8.5.</comment>

<grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The crystallized-emotion orchids and phonograph of pre-Severance lullabies synthesize freshness from familiar lyric-science-fantasy tropes. The inversion—losing the capacity to feel, yet tending the glass blooms—feels inevitable once the bamboo fracture births a new unnamed emotion. Conceptual integrity holds: every metaphor (foxglove regret, opal light) is re-invested with sonic consequence at closure. Risk in the floating-library premise is embraced, not hedged, and the final re-pricing of solitude as vocation is non-obvious yet earned.</comment>
