<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira’s guilt-born drive to “translate” lost sound into re-connection is concrete; her micro-choice to crack the amber and tattoo her arm with its dust embodies the cost. Interiority is lyric yet specific—ink “the color of nebulae,” the firefly as “promise that light could survive entrapment.” Contradictory impulses (flight vs. self-tethering) compress into one visible act, earning resonance without therapy-speak. The only bar to 9+ is that the mother remains off-page, so relational crucible pressure is implied rather than staged.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of preserved/trapped media (amber, firmware, letters) tightens until the amber’s dissolution reweights meaning. Closure—tattooing spiraling timefolds with firefly dust—lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the lab shifts from tomb to temple, dissonance quiets, cost is the emptied pendant. Causality is lyric but coherent: each artifact returns charged (letters in wet ink, firmware spitting her own infant cry). No orientation debt; anchors (who/where) taught in first 60 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>“Laboratory of lost sounds” is more than postcard: shelves of obsolete decks, meteor hush at 2 a.m., ink nebulae—each detail filtered through Mira’s synesthetic vocation. The mahogany desk drawer hides future/past letters that literally change her workspace posture. The amber isn’t scenery; its port-fit forces the climax. Micro-settings (firmware slot, tattoo needle) constrain final choice, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</question><comment>Dominant stake—hush the lifelong dissonance of being “untranslatable”—is signaled early. Escalation is accretive: phantom firmware message → impossible handwriting → raw infant cry beneath collected frequencies. Each layer deepens emotional cost rather than narrows external options. Tattoo act crystallizes stance with felt price (emptied pendant, skin forever spiraled), fulfilling lens-consistent tightening.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</question><comment>Theme of self-forgiveness emerges from the iterative preserve/release pattern (amber opened, firmware quieted). Final silence after echo fades offers non-literal answer to “how to forgive untranslatable guilt.” Subtext resides in objects rather than exposition: firefly light survives being trapped; Mira’s skin becomes a living antenna for her own voice. No moralizing—wisdom is charged image, not stated thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person intimate maintains nebula-ink lexicon and synesthetic perceptual signature throughout. Lyric sentence rhythm mirrors the folding-time motif without drumbeat monotony. Compression (“meteor hush”) is taught early and paid off in final quiet. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk null; narrative diction stays within Mira’s artist intellect.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet read-aloud musical; no synonym churn or template cadence detected. Metaphors (amber holds light like promise) stay coherent under internal logic. Information carries double duty—e.g., “ink the color of nebulae” shows both vocation and cosmos-obsessed worldview. Minor purple tint in “susurration of a thousand intimate moments” but justified by accrual texture, does not dull closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fusing constellation tattooist with haunted baby-cry firmware, time-looped handwritten letters, and amber-as-storage is a fresh synthesis. Risk of over-concept is embraced: firefly ink enters bloodstream via tattoo, making metaphor literal without safety hedging. Emotional specificity (guilt as untranslatable noise) keeps premise from gimmick. Without these exact elements the story collapses, satisfying transformation test.</comment>
