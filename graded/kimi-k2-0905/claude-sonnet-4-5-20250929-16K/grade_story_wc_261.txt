<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Maya’s interiority is vivid—her guilt over the botched miracle and the plant telepathy are embodied rather than labeled—but her change feels externally narrated (“Her hands warmed”) rather than dramatized in a decisive micro-choice. The “grief-and-gift” contradiction is present but never collides on the page; the scar-palm moment is summary, not a charged beat. We witness her realization, not the internal hinge that irreversibly reweights her stance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The causal chain is legible: distracted thought → sideways miracle → loss of healing → tower study → coffee-ring epiphany → ivy healing. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration—she accepts an altered gift—and the unfrozen hourglass offers visible cost. Orientation is clean; paragraph one anchors who/where/when by word 40.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The tower room is economically sketched through sensory hooks (frosted hourglass, pressed ivy, coffee rings) that double as mood mirrors. The body-as-micro-setting works: the fresh abdominal scar constrains posture and attention. No external environment alters tactics, so the 9-gate is missed, but the selective detail is atmosphere-rich without momentum drag.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recovering the ability to heal without harming—arrives early. Pressure tightens once: the coffee-ring reading forces her to reinterpret the displacement as love-split focus, not carelessness, which then enables the ivy healing. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral; a tangible forfeiture would sharpen the turn.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</question><comment>Theme—woundedness as ongoing openness—emerges through recurring scar/coffee-ring/hourglass images rather than dictation. The ending’s shift from “displaced” to “delivered exactly where needed” reweights prior guilt without moralizing. Subtext in plant telepathy (green joy) is understated; still, the insight feels earned from concrete particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</question><comment>Third-person intimate maintains steady psychic distance and a lyrical, slightly elegiac cadence that matches post-surgical suspension. Syntax favors short, imagistic sentences; no filter-verb clutter. Diction stays within Maya’s plausible lexicon; “meteor hush” risks poetic overreach but reads as her perceptual idiom. Voice is consistent, not strikingly idiosyncratic enough for 9-territory.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.0</question><comment>Prose is clean: high sensory density, no scaffold loops, strong paragraph cut efficiency. Occasional stacked metaphors (“tunnelled sideways through space,” “delivered to the incorrect address”) compress two vehicles into one beat; slightly muddled but not closure-touching. Final line achieves image-propelled cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.5</question><comment>“Botched miracle” and plant telepathy freshen familiar recovery arc; coffee-ring augury as diagnostic tool is a nice folkloric twist. Combination feels organic, not checklist. Risk level is moderate; concept stays safe rather than pushing formal or speculative boundaries into surprising territory.</comment>
