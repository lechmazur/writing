<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Mira’s “gently persistent” trait is shown through repeated night runs and the bell-ringing ritual, anchoring motive; the final declaration is prepared by weeks of embodied action. Interiority is concrete (“heart hammered against her ribs”) and stays inside her perceptual bounds. Cost is legible—dwindling savings, frost-risk, public exposure—so Earned Stasis feels earned. Secondary characters remain sketches, but since they function as collective pressure rather than relationship crucible, the arc coheres.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal lens dominates: each bell-ring is a because/therefore trigger that eventually forces the public reveal. Orientation is swift—ridge, sanctions, night—well inside 120 words. Closure is on-page (collective shift from anonymous to communal care) and carries social cost (“not secret anymore”). One minor causality gap: how flour-sack donor knew to use the arbor is elided, not motivated, but it doesn’t touch the decisive beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Terra-cotta arbor and tarnished bell are tactile, weather-reactive, and spatially tracked; they constrain where gifts must be left and where revelation must occur. Moon-lit ridge and “breath forming clouds” supply sensory economy without cataloging. At 778 words the world is necessarily sketch-wide, yet the micro-setting (arbor as lantern-stage) meaningfully shapes the climax, satisfying the 9+ gate for this category.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—community survival via mutual aid—is signaled in para 2 and tightens when youths plan exodus. The midnight runs escalate risk (money gone, frostbite, exposure) and the bell ritual increases social stakes each night. Thirteen-ring climax crystallizes the “stay or leave” option set under public gaze; cost is visible in Mira’s exhausted savings and forfeited anonymity. Escalation is linear but sufficient for 778 words.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of collective care emerges from repeated anonymous acts rather than thesis statements; final line reweights “darkness” from threat to shared space. Subtext in the bell’s silence-then-sound charts community readiness. No moralizing summary—Mira’s last sentence invites continuation, not closure of meaning. Irony survives: the leader who never sought authority must relinquish secrecy to keep authority.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-limited stays glued to Mira; perceptual signature filters through quiet determination (“whispered secrets” on silver). Free-indirect cadence mirrors her patience: long sentences for trudging nights, staccato at reveal. No dialogue until the gathered scene; when it arrives, diction differentiates Sasha’s blunt youth from Petrov’s gnarled brevity. Rhythm control peaks in the thirteen-ring sentence run, breath-tracking commas matching crowd tension.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentences open with changing parts of speech, no template churn. Figurative layer is selective (“moonlight like whispered secrets”) and never clots action. One mixed metaphor—“silver thread trying to stitch scattered fabric”—but it lands mid-story and doesn’t obscure the final image. High information density: single clauses carry motive, sensory, and thematic freight; no scaffold loops detected.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Exile-on-ridge trope is refreshed by sanctions-era supply runs and anonymous mutual-aid mechanics rather than heroic rebellion. Antique bell as communal Slack channel feels novel and specific. Synthesis of generational fracture + covert food network grows organically from setting constraints. Risk is moderate—straight chronology, familiar collective-action arc—but execution is particular enough to avoid stock.</comment>
