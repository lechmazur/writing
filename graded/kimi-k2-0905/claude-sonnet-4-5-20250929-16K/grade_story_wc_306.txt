<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mara’s “conscience-for-hire” label is vivid, but her interiority drifts into tidy aphorism (“doubt isn’t a burden…”) rather than embodied contradiction. Keegan’s collapse is credibly raw, yet the double-fee motive never exerts new pressure; their power shift is legible but not costly to her. The earned beat is Keegan’s surrender, not hers, so the arc feels half-resided-in.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: Mara’s shard provocation → Keegan’s fracture → her exit, each tightening his options. Orientation clean inside 120 words; closure is Charged Poise—Keegan left in glowing chimes with doubt now “worn,” cost legible. The paper-order beat is slightly tell-heavy but still forecloses retreat; persistent constraint (his public mea culpa) is implied, sufficient for this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lighthouse, wind chimes, and concave mirror constitute a tight micro-setting that actively reframes faces and choices. Dawn light and salt air are filtered through Mara’s professional gaze; brass tubes become an “instrument” she reads, a tool that constrains interpretation. Spatial choreography is clean; no object teleport. Final glow on chimes recharges the motif, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—Keegan’s need for absolution—tightens when Mara refuses to give it, forcing self-confrontation. One crystalline reversal: certainty → permanent doubt, paid immediately in his collapsed posture. Agency is his, cost is felt; escalation is single but decisive under causal lens. No off-stage rescue; coincidence only complicates via honest wind.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges inductively: doubt as ethical garment, not enemy. Subtext lives in chime cadences and the empty mirror—no neon signage. Final image of glowing brass reweights premise without moralizing. The “cloak” metaphor is stated once, early, then left to resonate; avoids echo-penalty.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-limited stays locked to Mara; perceptual signature sharp in “wind chime selections” and coat-snag against railing. Syntax flexes with pressure—short staccato when she prods, longer lilt during lull. Dialogue sparse but carries subtext: “You paid” vs “I wanted to help them.” No head-hop, no filter-verb clot; distinct rhythmic control.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm varies; no template cadence runs. Information density high—one line often layers setting, tool, and emotional cue. Figurative control tight: “cloak of doubt” appears once, no mixed-metaphor pile-ups. Minor paraphrase loop on “wind says you’ve been lying” / “listen to what you already know” (−0.2); not in closure beat, so 9+ still open.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>“Conscience for hire” + hollow mirror + wind-read ethics fuses into fresh conceit; not a trope checklist. Conceptual repricing of doubt as apparel feels inevitable yet surprising. Risky compression to sub-800 words succeeds—no dilution. Specificity of chime cipher and dawn lighthouse grounds novelty in sensory truth.</comment>
