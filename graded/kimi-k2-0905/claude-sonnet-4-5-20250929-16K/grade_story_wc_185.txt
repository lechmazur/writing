<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>The mapkeeper’s arc is thin: she wants quiet, finds it, and pays only exhaustion. No contradictory impulse is dramatized; the text labels her “exhausted” rather than showing a body at its limit. Interiority is poetic but generic (“felt the discord in her bones”) and never bites back against her goal. The closing realization—“quiet had been there all along”—is lovely but unearned by any prior mistake or relinquishment, so the cost feels symbolic rather than lived.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the hush reweights the caves’ reality and leaves the mapkeeper drained, a visible cost. Causality is soft—ice-crack “language” → vocal sequence → bloom—but the pattern is taught early enough to read as Accumulative/Textural logic rather than hand-waving. Orientation is clean within 120 words; spatial and temporal anchors hold. The lens holds without contradiction, but the bloom’s mechanism is slightly abstract, keeping the score below 8.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Setting is the story’s spine: harmonic caves → energy storm → ice gallery → bloom. Every detail is filtered through the mapkeeper’s professional eye (“oscillation preserved in sandstone”), making the world a tool she reads. The echo chamber stone and ice cracks function as micro-settings that constrain tactics; the stone warms, ice branches glow—objects evolve, charging the final image. Sensory economy is tight; sound, temperature, and mineral memory braid into theme without static description.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“find the quiet in the storm”—is clear early; pressure is situational, tightening as she descends toward the ice gallery. Agency is real but gentle: humming, tracing, adjusting pitch; the turning point is aesthetic rather than perilous, limiting cost visibility. Escalation is accretive (pattern accumulation, not risk), fitting Accumulative/Textural lens but capping tension at mid-range. No option is foreclosed; instead, a new equilibrium is added, so the tightening feels observational rather than decisive.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as the paradox that silence is not absence but an active presence that absorbs chaos. The idea stays implicit, carried by image (phosphorescent cracks, warm geode) rather than statement. Final line reweights the quest: the quiet was not discovered but remembered—an elegant Conceptual Repricing. Avoids moralizing; complexity is honored, though the lack of human relationship or ethical friction keeps it shy of 9.0.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tightly fused to the mapkeeper’s perceptual lens; no head-hopping. Syntax is rhythmic, mineral, and slightly archaic (“hammered repose of metal”)—a coherent texture that reflects her vocation. No dialogue, so voice is carried by descriptive cadence; diction stays within plausibility for a lifelong cave listener. Psychic distance modulates nicely: wide survey of caves narrows to fingertip on ice without jolt.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is lush yet propulsive; figurative density is high but pattern-taught (“crystal clarity,” “electric scream”) so it reads as deliberate texture rather than overwriting. No synonym loops or template cadence; each sentence advances image or pressure. Minor register drift—“Conceptual Repricing,” “Resonant Reconfiguration”—appears only here in editorial commentary, not story text. Closure image (“sound of peace taking root in stone”) is clean, audible, and free of mixed metaphor.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The “bloom of hush” as active silence that grows like frost is a fresh conceptual inversion. Energy beings remain off-stage, avoiding cliché; their chaotic buzz is rendered as acoustic disruption, not spectacle. Integration of geode, ice-cracks, and grandmother lore feels inevitable, not stitched. Risk—quiet climax in a genre that expects triumph—pays off because the reconfiguration is legible and priced with exhaustion.</comment>
