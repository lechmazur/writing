<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Mira’s “quietly proactive” nature is dramatized: she tends the garden, withholds speech, and offers the pendant only when the visitor’s silence begs for ritual. The executive’s shame is equally embodied—trembling palms, red-rimmed eyes—so both arcs feel earned. What caps the score is the absence of a visible cost to Mira herself; she grants absolution but the story never tests her compassion with a real forfeiture. Interior contradiction flickers (“I used to [hate]”) yet stays summary, so the change is more declared than dramatized under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the pendant’s return crystallizes a new equilibrium—Mira keeps her stance, the executive leaves lighter, both futures are legible and finite. Causality is clean: viral confession → sanctuary garden → pendant offer → shared quiet; each beat narrows options without convenient resets. The icicle drip patterns enact an Accumulative/Textural lens, reweighting meaning at the end without needing causal reversals. Cost is present but diffuse (time, exposure, emotional labor) rather than a single palpable forfeiture, keeping the score just under the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Center is anchored by line 4; moss, rusted doors, and thawing icicles are filtered through Mira’s ex-data-subject eye, turning server racks into soil. The amber pendant operates as micro-setting: its insect-in-amber image constrains the final exchange and recharges the “data-fossil” theme. Sensory hierarchy is tight—sound of dripping water, feel of moss under palm—never drifting into catalog. Spatial choreography is clean: entrance → bench → pendant hand-off → exit, all tracked without drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can shared silence graft meaning onto wounds—tightens once: the executive speaks, Mira answers with the pendant, silence converts to shared charged poise. Pressure is accumulative: each drip widens the moss constellation, visually marking time and emotional saturation. Agency is bilateral yet soft: Mira’s offer is a renunciation of vengeance, the executive’s acceptance a self-imposed exile from absolution. No visible price is extracted from Mira, so escalation stays lyrical rather than visceral, capping the band just below 9.0.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete parallels—data maps vs. icicle constellations, surveillance vs. garden nurture—never sermonizing. Subtext lives in gesture: pendant weight > apology; silence > testimony. Final image of dripping water “honest in its becoming” offers a resonant, non-moral answer to how forgiveness accrues. Avoids tidy thesis, yet the executive’s contrition is perhaps too smoothly received, trimming the top edge.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited keeps close psychic distance, diction within Mira’s contemplative register: “emerald silence,” “honeyed hush.” Sentence rhythm lengthens during reflection, fragments under the pendant moment, mirroring breath. Dialogue is sparse, indirect—“I can’t accept this” carries the entire weight of contrition. No head-hopping; executive’s interior is read through Mira’s watchful eye, maintaining consistent distance control.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, information-dense: “moss now cushioned every surface in emerald silence” does three jobs in nine words. No loops, no mixed metaphors; icicle drip as “irregular constellations” is precise and thematic. Filter verbs are minimal and voice-motivated. Only micro-slips: “voice barely breaking the honeyed hush” edges toward poetic filler, but the beat is low-pressure so clarity holds.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Surveillance-state survivor tends living garden in dead server farm—fresh synthesis of eco and tech tropes. Pendant-as-amber-fossil literalizes data-traces into geologic time, a specific turn not seen in prompt templates. Quiet risk: no confrontation, no twist, yet coherence carries the wager. Could be any ex-tech-victim; Mira’s personal quirk stops just short of unforgettable, keeping score sub-9.</comment>
