<comment>Kael’s interiority is precise—“mapping absences,” “respectfully rebellious”—and his micro-choices (pausing under the arch, cradling the bottle) embody the mailman credo. The final beat crystallizes his hierarchy of values: seventeen more deliveries before dawn, endurance as cost. Mira remains functional; her eyes “glisten” but we get no contradictory impulse, so relationship crucible is only lightly touched. Still, the single-POV restraint and embodied emotion hit the 9− threshold without a second character fully in the crucible.</comment>

<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each object-laden beat thickens the texture of separation until the thunderstorm bottle becomes the charged reprise. Closure is a Charged Poise—“the brittle hush settled around him like a blessing”—that reweights the entire premise; cost is the lifetime of pre-dawn absences he must keep mapping. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) arrives by line 6; no penalty. Drone beat complicates without breaking causal logic; ellipsis is motivated. One shard, one transitionless scene, meets scope default.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Cobalt arcade’s blue glass and shuttered shops are filtered through Kael’s caution—sensory hierarchy biased toward sound (brittle hush) and tactical movement. Micro-setting works: the defunct fountain as territorial line constrains the hand-off. Environment recurs in the final image, now recharged as “blessing.” No spatial drift; weather is bottled, literal, and causal. Lacks a 9-level environmental twist that actively blocks an exit, hence 8.4.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: keep the human chain of memory alive across a lethal border. Escalation is textural—each forbidden object intensifies the moral cost—until the thunderstorm bottle becomes the final, irreversible test. No reversal, but a deepening: the storm’s alive flickers foreshadow the emotional voltage he must deliver. Cost is legible: Kael commits to seventeen more pre-dawn runs, sleep forfeit implied.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through the refrain of “evidence that people don’t forget,” culminating in the non-literal answer that broken promises heal only when someone carriers their absence. Subtext in gesture: Mira cradling the bottle replaces spoken thanks. No final-paragraph moralizing; the thunderstorm itself is the thesis made weather. Ambiguity lingers—will the girl open it?—but cost is undeniable.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person close sustains a restrained, postal lexicon—“official channels,” “territorial line,” “weather-weaver”—that distinguishes Kael’s bureaucratic lyricism. Rhythm modulates: long sentences for twilight calm, clipped fragments when drones pass. No dialogue contamination; speech is sparse and subtextual. Filter verbs rare; perception stays embodied. Voice never breaks to omniscient exposition.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>High information density: “whisper-engines,” “disputed territory’s only mailman,” each noun carries world data. Metaphors are consistent—border as “brittle hush,” absence as geography—no mixed vehicles. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or stakes. Final line earns cadence uplift without overwriting. Minor −0.1 for “oceanic shadow” (slightly expected), else clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: postal noir meets bottled meteorology in a bifurcated arcade. Thunderstorm as bottled paternity letter is non-obvious and inevitable in hindsight. Risk of sentimentality is averted by Kael’s weary professionalism. Conceptual integrity holds—every speculative element obeys internal physics of weather-weaving. Memorable without gimmickry.</comment>
