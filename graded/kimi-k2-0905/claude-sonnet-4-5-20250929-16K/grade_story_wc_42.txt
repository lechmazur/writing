<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mira’s quiet, tactile competence and jeweler’s loupe shorthand her life-long craft; the seismic tremors force her to act, not merely muse. Her mid-scene micro-choice—re-gear the escapement to honor the tremor rhythm—crystallizes a believable hierarchy of values (craft over clock-face order). The final “leaf-falling” auditory epiphany carries visible cost: she forfeits canonical time, accepting perpetual instability. Interiority stays sensorial, not therapeutic; no stock labels undercut the peak beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: tremor cadence and clock pulses accumulate until a pattern break reweights meaning. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—the re-tuned clock becomes a seismograph, Mira accepts unfixable flux—and the cost is legible in the final auditory image. Causality holds: each tremor deepens the stakes for tonight’s lunar transit photos, so the clock mod matters. No late rule changes; orientation anchors (who/where/when) are cleanly in place by line 4.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>“Above the clouds” lunar observatory and groaning mountain bones are sketched in three crisp strokes yet constrain every action—equipment must be earthquake-proof, staff trapped on a peak. Micro-setting succeeds: the spinning brass hand, jeweler’s loupe, and seismic dampener camera-part are tactile tools that charge the final fix. Weather (churning cloud-ocean) evolves with each tremor, mirroring internal pressure without overt symbolism. Spatial choreography is flawless; no impossible object positions during the rebuild.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Single dominant stake: synchronize telescopes before lunar transit or lose data—tight, time-boxed, and repeatedly shaken. Escalation is textural: each new tremor increases pressure on the clock fix; no arbitrary reversals. Mira’s agency drives the turning point—she renounces standard time, choosing tremor-time, foreclosing any return to “correct” chronometry. Cost is felt: the clock will never again tell human time, a loss dramatized in the closing auditory image.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme—time as unstable flux versus human hunger to freeze moments—emerges through concrete action, never sermon. The spinning minute-hand reprises at closure as a seismograph, reweighting “escape velocity” from speed to acceptance of recurrent pull. Luminous ache stays implicit in Chen’s voice and the Moon’s patient distance; no character spells out the moral. Final leaf-through-clouds image crystallizes the tension between permanence and ephemerality without abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person close stays anchored in Mira’s tool-handed perception; diction (“tarnished brass,” “paper forest”) is filtered through jeweler’s tactile precision. Rhythm accelerates during tremors, then breathes in the final window gaze, mirroring emotional cadence. No head-hopping; Director Chen’s dialogue carries subtext of unreachable moons without ventriloquizing his interior. Filter verbs are minimal and voice-motivated (“she heard something else”) rather than explanatory.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Varied sentence openings and paragraph lengths create natural momentum; high information density with minimal scaffold. Metaphors (“wind through a paper forest”) are spare and coherent, never stacked. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or pressure. One minor overwritten stretch—“luminous ache heard in all astronomers” skirts close to abstract profiling but recovers immediately via sensory follow-through.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Fusion of horology, seismology, and lunar astronomy feels fresh; premise could collapse into gimmick yet stays grounded in Mira’s craft logic. Transformed trope: the “broken clock” becomes a seismograph, upending the fix-it plot. Risk—the clock remains wild—pays off by redefining freedom as cooperation with instability. Specific detail (Geneva stops, camera dampener) prevents generic anywhere setting.</comment>
