<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is vivid and profession-specific, but her decisive shift—accepting the burden of belief—rests on an off-stage empathy for Eleanor rather than a dramatized clash of values; the “visible cost” is asserted (“she understood”) not embodied in a micro-choice that forecloses an alternative path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: ivy, diary fragments, and pulse-echo pattern tighten the stake from curiosity to stewardship; closure lands with Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the corridor “sighs,” reweighting Mara’s vocation. Cost is felt—she shoulders eternal witness—but the causal link between detecting the pulse and choosing lifelong custodianship is compressed into one reflective paragraph, blunting the decisive beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Ivy-veiled passage and fireplace micro-setting constrain movement and supply the diary catalyst; sensory hierarchy (sound mapping, charred paper texture) is filtered through Mara's cartographer gaze, charging the final acoustic image. Spatial choreography remains clean; “ivy parted” elegantly externalizes the building’s consent. Environment passes the 9+ gate by shaping tactics and final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve architectural consciousness—tightens when the corridor’s breathing pulse is detected, foreclosing disbelief. Escalation is accretive: ivy response → diary fragments → anomalies → pulse → custodial vow. Cost is conceptual (lifelong burden) rather than tangible, limiting upper-band entry but satisfying accretive lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of caretaking for unseen life emerges through acoustic metaphor without sermon; “honoring the dreams of walls” reprises in final line, reweighting Mara's job from data collection to hospice. Ambiguity is preserved—readers may doubt the pulse—yet story commits to its premise. Avoids explicit thesis; emotional aftereffect is hush-like reverence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Lyrical, slightly elevated diction—“acoustic archaeology,” “confession interrupted”—suits the contemplative concept; rhythm modulates from exploratory long sentences to clipped sensor data. No dialogue, so voice remains cohesive. Occasional poetic filter (“ivy seemed to whisper”) is tolerated under accumulative design; perceptual signature of sound-centric cartographer is distinct and consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High information density: each sentence layers setting, character tool, or metaphor; no paraphrase loops or template cadence. Mixed metaphor check: “flora…like refugees” and “corridors sighed” coexist without contradiction. Opening and closing lines are crisp hooks/echoes. Minor nominalizations (“acoustics,” “consciousness”) unavoidable for concept but kept lean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: climate-grief sci-fi meets Gothic psycho-architecture; corridor cartography is an original occupation that externalizes hauntology. Film-negative motif and ivy-responsive building feel inevitable in hindsight. Risk—lyric stillness over plot—pays off via charged final image. Near-echo of “Buildings Dream” trope is transformed through sonic science lens.</comment>
