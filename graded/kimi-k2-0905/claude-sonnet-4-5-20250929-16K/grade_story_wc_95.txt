<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theodora’s mechanical-arm micro-choices (catching the blade between fingers, gentle cleaning) embody her philosopher-tinker duality with visible cost; the interiority stays specific, not diagnostic. Her refusal to finish the sundial is a credible renunciation that forecloses safety. Venn’s curiosity cracks her diplomatic mask, but the beat is told, not shown, so the relationship shift feels reported rather than lived. No internal contradiction is dramatized on the page, capping the arc just below elite.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a crisp Resonant Reconfiguration: Theodora’s offer of amnesty in exchange for public debate crystallizes options and reweights the sundial from cipher to civic platform. Cost is legible—“you know where to find me” couples invitation with exposed vulnerability. Causal chain holds: card → sundial → duel → offer, each because/therefore link tightening stakes. Lens stays situational-philosophical throughout; no ambiguity at end.</comment>

<comment>Glass atrium refracts light onto marble and amplifies steel clashes, literally guiding footwork and sound design; brook murmur threads every lull, binding time to waiting. Mechanical arm’s brass gears function as micro-setting, clicking status and threat. Half-painted sundial is spatially tracked and finally reweighted, passing the 9+ gate. Idiom stays steampunk-philosophy without anachronism jolt.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Single dominant stake—free assembly versus state control—tightens when the duel becomes a live test of wills; the card’s cipher raises personal exposure. Escalation proceeds via blade pressure and verbal ripostes; no coincidence resolves anything. Felt cost arrives only in the final salute, slightly late for top band. Agency is high: every parry and argument is Theodora’s tactical choice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</question>
<comment>Theme of inquiry-as-destination emerges through sundial angles and blade angles, never sermonizing. Subtext lives in gesture: catching the blade between clockwork fingers enacts the mechanization of debate. Final image of amber possibility reweights “waiting” from stasis to generative pause, satisfying CR. No echo-line articulates thesis, avoiding thematic-label penalty.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice fuses Enlightenment cadence with steampunk diction—“philosophically bankrupt,” “dignified chaos”—and sustains perceptual signature of refracted light and gear ratios. Compression like “questions are destinations” is taught early and paid off. Dialogue carries subtext: “Still confusing patience with weakness?” is simultaneously threat and compliment. No head-hop; psychic distance tightens cleanly under blade pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Rhythm modulates from long, light-threaded openings to staccato blade beats; no template cadence detected. Single paraphrase loop: “waiting—always waiting” is intentional thematic refrain, not artifact. Metaphors stay coherent—light, gears, brook—no mixed vehicles. Proofing clean; pronoun “its” always snaps back to intended referent.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fencing philosophers using an unfinished sundial as cipher feels fresh yet inevitable; premise commits fully without late rule changes. Mechanical arm as both foil and philosophical prosthesis transforms familiar duel into conceptual combat. Risk-taking in hybrid action-ideologue scene pays off under situational lens. Minus fraction for near-archetype of rebel professor, though arm and code specificity rescue it.</comment>
