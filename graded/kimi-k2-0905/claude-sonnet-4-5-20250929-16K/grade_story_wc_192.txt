<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Maya’s “surgical” self-immolation is vivid, but her turn to mentor is declared (“She recognized this linkage”) rather than shown in contradictory micro-choices; Sienna remains a passive mirror, trembling but never deciding under pressure. The final beat asks us to believe Maya re-opens her cauterized life because she sees shallow breathing, a motivational leap not grounded in prior scene evidence.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: the ash, starlight, and doorknocker accumulate a charged void that crystallizes when Sienna steps across. Closure—shared ignition of the phone—offers Charged Poise, cost legible, though the causal “why now” for Maya’s pivot is elided, not earned.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Micro-setting triumph: brass ring on a solitary charred gateframe acts as both shrine and tool; ash under starlight is sensorily selective (cold metal, glowing screen-obscene) and steers the final gesture. Spatial track stays clean across the single threshold.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—disappearing versus being found—tightens once when Sienna crosses, but escalation is atmospheric, not tactical; the phone burn is the first visible price and arrives at the final beat, so earlier pressure feels abstract.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Loaded emptiness theme emerges through concrete ash rituals and the ring’s swing, avoiding thesis lines; final mutual arson reframes loss as craft. The concept that obliteration can be tender lands without moralizing, though late arrival of Sienna’s agency blunts counter-readings.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Close third with controlled psychic distance; metallic cold, screen glare, and breath-in-ash details carry perceptual signature. Dialogue stays minimal, edged with threat (“Teach me”), no head-hop; registers hold, even if cadence edges toward liturgical repetition.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Strong imagistic density (ash like silver, obscene glow), but metaphor strings in consecutive sentences create mild clutter; scaffold lines (“She thought she had found peace… Then Sienna arrived”) feel template-ish. Closural image avoids muddle, keeping momentum intact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: sanctuary as deliberate scorched-earth retreat, tender shadow-keeper as self-exile mentor. The premise is memorable, though the dyad mentor-recruit structure is recognizable; specific ash/ring rituals elevate it above trope.</comment>
