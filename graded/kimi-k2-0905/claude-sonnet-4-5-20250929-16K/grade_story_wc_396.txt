<comment>Kael’s calm-intuitive peacekeeper trait is dramatized—she unfurls shadows, chooses the fragment, steers the elders with a visible micro-choice (“hold this”) that forces their stance shift. Interiority stays concrete, avoids label-speak; her empathy is mapped onto action, not declared. The elders’ sudden convergence is too friction-free—decades feud dissolves in one shared smile—but Kael’s cost (exposing her shard, risking failure) is legible, and her shadow-sense gives her a consistent, particular perceptual signature. Flaws are accepted: her calm is a tool, not perfection, and the ending forecloses continued enmity without tidy forgiveness.</comment>

<comment>Causal lens holds: because Kael shows the shard-glimpses, therefore the elders feel the web of debt, narrowing options to “tell us how.” Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration—Charged Poise crystallized in the final line “we begin,” with conceptual cost: the ice keeps fracturing, the fragment will never be whole, peace must be endlessly re-constituted. Orientation anchored early (lighthouse orchard, two clan leaders, present dispute). No teleporting props; shard is handled in every beat. Persistent constraint: the ever-shifting ice and the irreparable crystal literalize that any peace here is provisional—this reweights the final gesture under the same metaphoric logic.</comment>

<comment>Salt-wind apple trees, tarnished mirror-creatures, and groaning ice are vivid, selective, and filtered through Kael’s shadow-biased perception. Micro-setting objects—fragment, mirrors—constrain tactics: she can’t “see” without the shard, can’t reveal without mounting the mirrors. Spatial choreography is clean: circular room, west window, boys visible outside. The lighthouse orchard is more than postcard: its impossible fruit thriving in cold becomes the metaphor engine for peace that shouldn’t grow yet does. One minor slip—“vintage store mirrors” is told, not shown through tactile detail—but the mirrors’ later agency compensates.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—feud may fracture future generations—is signaled in paragraph three and tightened when the elders handle the fragment; option to keep hating is foreclosed by felt shared memory. Pressure grows causally: each mirror glimpse increases emotional cost until the final apple-grab image crystallizes the trade-off. Visible price: Kael risks her authoritative mystique by letting them feel her power; elders pay with public vulnerability. No coincidence; escalation is driven by her agency and the shard’s glimpses. Sufficient for 600-word scale.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: peace is not fusion but perpetual re-constitution—like ice and crystal—held together by empathic labor. Subtext lives in gesture: the boys协作摘苹果镜像 elders’ unspoken desire. Final image reweights the premise: “piece by piece, truth by truth” becomes practical instruction, not platitude. No moralizing; complexity kept—feud scars remain visible, only the collision is paused. Resonance lingers through the shard’s irreparable fracture and the ice’s endless shift.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Kael’s perceptions; no head-hop. Voice texture is shadow-drenched, maritime, orchard-salt: “twilight through trees,” “salt-wind and cold.” Syntax modulates—long breathless sentence during shadow-unfurl, then clipped imperative “hold this” under pressure. Dialogue minimal but distinct: elders move from formal accusation to cracked confession in three lines, each carrying subtext. Filter verbs (“she understood”) are rare and voice-motivated. No register drift; peacekeeper diction stays grounded, never academic. Rhythm supports beats—final paragraph cadence mirrors the crystallizing moment.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>High information density: single sentences do triple duty (set, body, mood). No loops or scaffold; no mixed metaphors—shadow, ice, crystal logic stays coherent. Figurative language peaks at mirror-glimpses but pattern-taught early, paid off at closure. Strong verbs (“unfurl,” “groaned,” “fracturing”) replace modifiers. Paragraph cuts pass—each advances knowledge or emotional charge. Opening line anchors stakes; final line recharges “reconstitute” motif. One typo-risk: “impossible fruit that thrived” could tighten to “thrives” for present-tense consistency, but reads as intentional historical present.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: shadow-wielding peacekeeper + ice-shift orchard + broken crystal as truth tech feels inevitable yet new. Risk taken—quiet mediation instead of violent showdown—yet coherence heightened because stakes remain existential (children’s future). Specific detail: mirrors backed with extinct sea-creatures, apple variety unnamed but “impossible,” all particular to this world. Trope (wise mediator) is deepened by her power source being darkness fragments, not light. Conceptual integrity kept—ice keeps moving, peace stays partial. Transformation test fails if relocated: only this shard-mirror-ice nexus enables the plot.</comment>
