<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The operator’s interiority is richly layered—borrowed gestures, embodied precision, fear of incompleteness—each choice visibly costs him identity. The moment he admits “mine is incomplete” renounces the safety of masks; the halo-press page becomes a literal skin he can no longer hide behind. Mira functions as crucible: her reading of the page crystallizes his gamble and forces mutual recognition. Micro-choices (type selection, fragment placement, lever pull) all encode self-solve urgency; no stock phrasing, competent struggle throughout.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the fragment’s destruction binds borrowed emotion into ink, making the operator’s private equation publicly legible at the price of the shard’s annihilation and his last mask. Lens is Accumulative/Textural—each sensory layer (star-loss, halo glow, ink bleed) intensifies the central stake until the press pull reweights meaning. The timeline is anchored within 40 words; geography stays tight to the workshop and sky. Pattern taught early: “whose precision he couldn’t say” cues the fragmentary POV; payoff in final “own uncertain hands.” Cost is unmistakable: another star vanishes, walls dim, irreversible simplification looms.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Topaz walls, cold metal type, and the thumbnail halo fragment constrain every tactical move; the fragment’s glow literally guides ink placement and final press pull. The vanishing sky functions as environmental countdown—each wink-out dims the room and tightens available light for work. Micro-body setting: the operator’s fingers become calipers, pressure gauges, then tremblingly uncertain once he owns them. The workshop’s amber light is charged in the final image, reflecting both ink glow and cosmic loss.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—map emotion’s math before celestial collapse—stays front-and-center; each star-loss beats like a metronome. Escalation is textural: halo on press bed + ink + fragment shatter fuses emotion into printable medium, foreclosing retreat. Operator’s agency drives the turn: he alone pulls the lever, pulverizing the fragment to bind empathy into paper at the cost of his last borrowed persona. Price is visible—walls dim, star gone, page now radioactive with shared loneliness, options narrowed to either solve or perish.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: interior algebra versus cosmic erasure; no final moral spoon-fed. Subtext carried in gesture (press lever pull as both creation and self-exposure) and silence after Mira reads. Ambiguity is purposeful—angel/tech halo shard resists resolution, forcing reader to price the unknown. Final image of glowing page pressed to chest reweights prior masks as porous, not dishonest, but insufficient against universal subtraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person indirect attains a perceptual signature: astronomical diction mixed with printer’s jargon—“constellations wink out,” “pressure translates to permanence.” Rhythmic control: long breathy sentences for sky-loss contract to staccato type-clicks, mirroring operator’s borrowed personas snapping into place. Halo fragment observations read like calibrated measurements, reinforcing scientific-mystic hybrid. No head-hopping; Mira’s interior accessed only through her surface dialogue and facial shift, maintaining POV modesty.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>High density: “topaz under the unraveling heavens” does color-work and stakes-work simultaneously. Varied sentence rhythm supports tempo of precision vs. dread. No paraphrase loops; each metaphor (grief in clenched jaw, joy’s propagation speed) advances concept. Minor register lift—“negative space,” “interiority”—is justified by operator’s scholarly detachment; does not obscure causality or closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fusion of letterpress nostalgia with astrophysical countdown feels non-obvious yet inevitable: ink becomes emotional substrate as stars vanish. Borrowed-personality trope flipped into methodological necessity rather than gimmick. Fresh inflection: empathy mechanized via movable type, turning sentimental goal into engineer’s proof. Specificity of halo shard as both sacred relic and data chip resists cliché, recharges familiar angel/tech binaries.</comment>
