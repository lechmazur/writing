<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Vera’s loneliness and visionary drive stay credible; her refusal to pick sides is a believable flaw that costs her freedom under the portico. Interiority is rich (“laughed at the absurdity—how lonely it was to be claimed…”) yet never slides into self-help jargon. No contradiction under pressure, but the absence of a second on-page character keeps the crucibal relationship test idle. The final smile and switch-off land as Earned Stasis with visible cost, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each dawn fragment tightens density rather than causal chain, and the final “You have always been both the question and the answer” crystallizes Charged Poise with undeniable conceptual cost. Orientation is anchored by word 50 (cloudline, cobalt portico, Tuesday ozone). The portico as both pulpit/prison is a persistent constraint that shapes tactics and final image. Closure is legible without explanatory dump; cost is felt in her isolation and choice to fall silent.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stormlit observatory, cobalt glass, lightning taste, and copper-ozone air are selectively re-used to pressure her confinement and charge the final image. Micro-setting succeeds: the portico itself functions as tool/prison that constrains every broadcast and final silence. Spatial choreography is clean—no impossible moves between peaks, camps, transmitter. Weather is not backdrop; storm spikes force her to shelter under the glass while transmitting, integrating setting into beat-by-beat action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—maintaining visionary neutrality while prophecies intensify—is signaled in paragraph 2 and tightens when soldiers arrive. One meaningful deepening: realization she is vessel, not source, narrows options to silence. Cost is legible: loss of personal agency, physical peril from warring camps, final renunciation of voice. Escalation is textural—accumulation of followers, stakes, storm intensity—rather than causal reversals, consistent with inferred Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</question><comment>Theme emerges from pattern: shadow vs. light, ancient vs. dawn, interpreted anew in each broadcast fragment. No moral sermon; final line reframes prior transmissions as self-addressed, a Conceptual Repricing that reweights her solitude as answer. Subtext runs through silence—her refusal to interpret keeps theme alive in reader’s gap. Resists tidy binary: both factions wrong, both need her, prophecy remains ambiguous.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person lyric voice is stable, perceptual signature sharp: “Tuesday that tasted of ozone and burnt coffee,” “rusted crown.” Diction stays within Vera’s technician-poet lexicon; no filter-verb clusters. Compression taught early (“lyrically prophetic cadence”) pays off in final unfragmented line. Rhythm modulates: longer rolling sentences for storm, abrupt switch-off for closure. No dialogue, hence no register mismatch penalty.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density: copper coils, vacuum tubes, fragmented frequencies advance atmosphere and world in single phrases. Figurative language is patterned (lightning, shadow, dawn) rather than ornamental overload; no mixed metaphors. Scaffolding minimal; only “she transmitted one morning” could lose “one” but rhythm justifies. Read-aloud cadence peaks in final storm line, then cuts to silence—syntax mirrors content. Proofing clean; no typos or paraphrase loops.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: obsolete radio tech + storm-oracle + refusal to choose sides in civil war. Portico as both sacred relic and sniper-magnet feels inevitable, not gimmick. Prophet who will not interpret her own prophecies offers new angle on visionary trope. Specificity: “vacuum tubes,” “northern bridge collapse,” “three armed camps” ground abstraction. Risk—lyric accumulative structure—heightens coherence; closure still legible.</comment>
