<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Kira’s barefoot ritual and opera-glass habit sketch a consistent, idiosyncratic mind, but her interiority drifts into generic reflection (“righteousness without direction was just noise”) that tells rather than embodies contradiction. The decision to “gather the others here at twilight” is credible yet lacks a visible, page-cost—she risks nothing concrete tonight. Earned stasis is implied, not dramatized; the hum’s peace substitutes for personal price.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Kira reframes the rebellion’s silence from failure to “paused,” crystallizing new purpose under starlight. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of stone hum + opera-glass reprise reweights stakes rather than causal chain. Cost is conceptual (accepting indefinite wait) and felt through the final barefoot walk home; no contradiction under inferred lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Spaceport ruin is vivid, selective, and filtered through Kira’s barefoot soles; micro-setting (warm concrete, oil stains) constrains her pacing and mirrors internal fatigue. The stone circle’s hum is tactile, not catalogued, and charges the final image. Environment directly enables the closing epiphany, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—find meaning to restart rebellion—is signaled early; pressure tightens when opera glasses reveal hidden glyphs, converting abstract grief into actionable ritual. Agency is attention/interpretation rather than external deed; cost is conceptual (accepting patient cycle). One meaningful deepening suffices under Accumulative lens; escalation is legible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of cyclical resistance versus cosmic patience emerges through stone/stars pattern, not assertion. Final image reweights prior “failure” as “resonance,” avoiding moralizing. Insight is earned via concrete telescopic reveal and barefoot grounding, giving non-literal answer to thematic question.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays anchored to Kira’s perceptual quirks (soles, lens, hum); no head-hop. Syntax flexes with cadence of dusk, mirroring her waxing certainty. Diction (“ribcages of extinct animals,” “thunderous serenity”) is controlled, character-apt, and recharged at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong read-aloud rhythm, varied sentence openings, high density. One scaffold cluster—“righteousness without direction was just noise” followed by near-paraphrase—drops score fractionally. No figurative muddle in peak beats; metaphors stay coherent and physically grounded.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Post-rebellion lull + neolithic star circle is fresh synthesis; opera glasses as archaeological lens rather than mere prop. Risk lies in lyric stillness over action; coherence holds. Specificity of barefoot stargazer offsets any template echoes.</comment>
