<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Vera’s interiority is vivid—her noticing as attention, her muteness as care—yet the climactic decision to return weekly is declared more than dramatized. The final whisper “I see you” is embodied, but the enduring pledge lacks a micro-choice that costs her something on the page. Still, her contradictory impulse—silent by habit yet driven to speak into darkness—carries real character tension.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each letter-and-stone accretion reweights the stake until the darkened lens reveals years of etched pleas. The closure is a Charged Poise—Vera pocketing the sea-glass and vowing return—crystallizing her new stewardship with felt cost: perpetual solitude chosen to keep guardianship alive. Causality is lyric rather than event-based, but the pattern is taught early and closure re-prices the rule of the tower.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lantern room as micro-setting constrains every move: spiral stairs force single-file solitude, glass panels become the archive of keeper-ghosts, the extinguished lamp creates the literal dark that lets graffiti speak. Sea-glass finally crowns the cairn, turning environment into votive. Sensory detail is selective—brass warmth, breath on glass—filtered through Vera’s habit of quiet attention.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—answering the unseen keeper—tightens when the lamp dies and the final letter announces surrender. Escalation is accretive: each stone tower raises Vera’s implied promise, until the dark room forces her to verbalize commitment. Cost is present but soft: she pledges perpetual return, yet no immediate consequence (time, danger, reputation) is dramatized on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges obliquely: guardianship is reciprocal; protectors need witness too. Subtext hides in gesture—stacking stones instead of speech—so the final whisper feels earned. The closing image of pocketed sea-glass reframes every prior cairn as a votive for the protectors, not the ships. One faint moral overtone (“the dark would never be empty”) is brief enough to avoid sermonizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Third-person partial clings tightly to Vera’s perceptual filter—syntax quiet, maritime precise, rhythm tidal. No dialogue, so voice carries through attentive, salt-stripped diction: “blue as forgetting,” “glass seemed to hold voices.” Register remains consistent; lyric compression taught in first paragraph pays off in final sea-glass image. Filter verbs minimal; metaphors stay physical and sea-bound.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, mostly loop-free; occasional cadence echo (“stacked the stones,” “stack three”) is purposeful ritual refrain. One mixed metaphor cluster—“luminous conversation across the border of existence”—skirts purple but fits climax. High information density: maritime chores, graffiti, stone mechanics woven through action. No typos or pronoun drift; paragraph cuts tight.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh angle: ghost-story inverted—ghosts aren’t menace but lonely watch-keepers who need rescue. Stone-messaging as non-verbal correspondence feels specific and maritime-folk. Accumulated graffiti inside a Fresnel lens is an image not seen elsewhere. Risk is lyric stillness rather than plot twist; emotional reconfiguration sustains novelty. Core could transplant, but sea-glass + lighthouse + reticent woman combo is distinctive enough.</comment>
