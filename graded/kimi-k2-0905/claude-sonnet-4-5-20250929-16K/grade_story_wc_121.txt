<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Maya’s interiority is vivid—her contradictory impulses (“gift and curse,” “complete and fractured”) play out in embodied micro-choices like letting gravity reclaim her. The tablet’s infinite catalogue of selves supplies relentless externalized pressure, so each flicker she notices is a micro-choice that tilts her stance. The final renunciation—accepting that she is the labyrinth—carries visible cost: the viaduct dims beneath her and the tablet falls silent. What keeps this from the top band is slight over-cranked diction (“periodically eternal,” “conceptual repricing”) that edges toward diagnostic label-speak rather than strictly lived sensation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly as Conceptual Repricing: the runes’ new sentence reweights the entire quest from conquest to habitation, and Maya’s fall upward crystallizes that shift with undeniable cost under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality is interior but coherent—each 43-day return accretes density until the pattern breaks in the final beat. Orientation is quick: inverted on a viaduct, tablet humming, timelines branching—reader is anchored by line 3. The only minor scuff is the late-run abstraction “labyrinth of self” repeated; it slightly dilutes the moment of lived reversal.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The glowing viaduct after rain is not mere backdrop—it constrains every move: appear only then, defy gravity only there, lose the power once the ripple forms. Rain dripping upward, boots unmoored, tablet phosphorescence—all are tactile, selective, and filtered through Maya’s trained attention. The micro-setting (underside of a bridge that exists “only between the drop and the ripple”) functions as both stage and countdown clock, forcing her final stance crystallization. Spatial choreography stays clean: inverted walk, sideways traverse, fall upward—each position tracks logically.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—find the perfect self or accept fragmentation—tightens via procedural overload: each new timeline consumed corrodes hope, a visible price paid in the viaduct’s perceived dimming. One meaningful intensification occurs when she reads the new rune sentence; it forecloses the conquering path and reframes her only option as endurance. Agency remains hers—she chooses to fall, to inhabit, to walk home. Cost is legible but not viscerally physical; the loss is conceptual, sufficient under an Accumulative lens yet just shy of the 8.8 gate that demands a more acute felt wound.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges without sermon: the impossibility of totalizing the self is dramatized through the tablet’s merciless exhaustiveness rather than asserted. The final image—Maya walking home through ordinary rain—non-literally answers the central question: identity is lived iteration, not solved puzzle. Subtext operates in gesture (letting go of gravity) and object (quiet tablet) rather than exposition. Minor deduction for the phrase “conquer the labyrinth of self,” which flirts with thematic echo; still, it is embedded in a rune, not narrator moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Voice is dense, lyrical, and internally coherent—syntax elongates and compresses to mimic obsessive cataloguing (“Timeline 847…Timeline 2,193…”). Perceptual signature is sharp: Maya notices gravity vectors, phosphorescence decay, procedural mechanics. Experimental compressed diction (“periodically eternal”) is taught early and holds. No dialogue to test naturalism; interior monologue avoids filter verbs. The final short sentence “That would have to be enough” delivers clean cadence drop that mirrors her acceptance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is lean yet textured: “rainwater dripping upward past her boots” packs motion, orientation, and world-rule in eight words. Rhythm modulates—long anaphoric chains of timelines give way to abrupt final declaratives, propelling the close. One mixed metaphor cluster (“labyrinth...minotaur...recursion with no base case”) is earned by context and does not obscure causality. No loops or scaffold detected; information density stays high. Slight overuse of Latinate abstractions (“phosphorescence,” “procedural generation”) keeps it from the 9+ band where every barb must feel inevitable.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fusing the infinite-timeline trope with an inverted viaduct that exists “only between the drop and the ripple” feels fresh and specific, not gimmick—gravity rules invert without exposition dump. The tablet’s procedural cruelty becomes a metaphor for self-acceptance rather than sci-fi MacGuffin. Risky second-person plural echo of omniscient Mayas (“she saw herself…”) pays off by making the fractal self literal. Transformation test fails: the piece collapses without this exact gravity-defying, rain-drenched, tablet-driven mechanics. Emotional specificity (“she was the one darkening”) prevents abstract sterility.</comment>
