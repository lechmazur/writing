<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Mira’s interior contradiction—her “reckless idealism” versus the fresh knowledge that her trades scar the fabric of fate—drives every beat once Kael confronts her. The moment she fingers the burned Tower card, her body trembles and later she “calculates” the root-web, showing embodied, conflicted agency rather than abstract guilt. Kael’s demand forces her to a micro-choice—try the impossible reversal—whose cost is legible in the final line “ready to unmake what never should have been made,” an earned endurance that forecloses her former certainty. Dialogue carries distinct status shift: her whispered “I only wanted to help” against his corrected “You saved a life” crystallizes power transfer under the orchard’s glow.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Mira and Kael step together into the root-web, accepting the visible cost of “unmaking,” a Charged Poise that reweights the premise with undeniable social/spiritual peril. Causality is causal-lens clean: because she stole Senna’s life, therefore Kael arrives, therefore Mira now risks tearing open the same wound to restore balance. Orientation is anchored within 120 words: who (Mira), where (catacomb orchard), when (night of the burned card) are all lit by lantern and bone-root image. No plot amnesia or teleporting props; the tarot cards arrive, burn, and return as motive engines.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The catacomb orchard is not mere backdrop; its phosphorescent fruit and root-threads literally constrain Mira’s next tactic—she maps the exchange on living trunks. Sensory hierarchy obeys POV: Mira’s fingers on carved symbols narrow attention to tools she can repurpose in the final beat. Spatial choreography is surgical: lantern angle, root-skull density, and the oldest tree as rendezvous point stay trackable. Environment thus charges the final image with conceptual cost: stepping into a soil of bones to unmake a destiny is irreplaceably specific.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“can destinies be patched without tearing the fabric?”—tightens when Kael reveals the emotional hole where Senna should be, forcing Mira toward an irreversible trade-back attempt. Escalation is a single causal tightening instead of a swirl of reversals, sufficient at this length. Agency is renunciation-driven: she chooses to risk obliterating her life’s work, a visible price paid on-page. Coincidence is absent; the confrontation is the inevitable repayment of her earlier theft.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the concrete paradox of roots feeding on bones yet bearing luminous fruit—life-death interdependence—never stated but reconfigured in the final image of two living hands entering the bone-fed web to undo a life. Subtext is carried in gesture: Kael’s “gentle but firm” hand on her wrist communicates both accusation and need. No closing moral, only the resonant question of whether some holes must be earned, not patched. The tarot cards’ burn pattern (Tower→Lovers) supplies a quiet, non-literal answer about destroyed and desired union.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Mira’s perceptual signature: “amber shadows,” “curious fingers,” “she calculated,” producing a diction slightly archaic, slightly occult, consistent with her vocation. No head-hopping; Kael’s interior is accessed only through his dialogue indirection (“You saved a life”). Rhythm modulates: longer, clause-rich sentences for orchard descent, shorter exchanges under the tree where breath shortens. Filter verbs are minimal and voice-motivated; metaphor density drops in the confrontation to keep subtext clean.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm is varied: sentence openings rotate among prepositional, participial, and direct subject without algorithmic feel. Information density is high—one line can set atmosphere, advance plot, and foreshadow (“roots threading through ribcages like curious fingers”). No paraphrase loops or template cadence; metaphors stay coherent (lantern/amber/shadows) and do not violate orchard physics. Copy-clean: no homophones, pronoun confusion, or tense drift. Final line supplies a resonant cadence that reprises “unmake” as closure drumbeat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The destiny-exchange orchard grown from corpses feels genuinely fresh, a synthesis of necromantic and horticultural imagery that would fail if swapped to generic graveyard. Emotional truth—survivor guilt as a literal hole—grounds the speculative frame. Burned tarot cards reweight from prophetic cliché into invoices for stolen futures. Conceptual integrity is total: the story commits to barter metaphysics and follows them to the brink of self-negation. Risk is bold yet coherent: a quiet, non-violent climax that still threatens universal unmaking.</comment>
