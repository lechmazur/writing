<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Meridian’s interiority is rich and embodied—“her movements slow from decades of laying the drowned to rest” shows lived weariness. Her stubborn mis-practice is shown through the lens revelation, not told. The final shift to eternal keeper is credible, though the cost is more conceptual than viscerally felt on her body.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the lighthouse lens reframes burial itself, turning the library into an endless crypt. Causal chain holds: lens → signals → recognition → spatial re-use → rest. The “impossible spaces” rule is taught early and pays off at the end. Orientation is secure by line 3; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Kelp-wrapping, barnacle seals, phosphorescent light, and folded architecture are vivid, selective, and filtered through Meridian’s professional eye. The library’s non-Euclidean geometry is shown by how she hesitates at the four-place reading room, integrating setting into action. Environment directly enables the climax: impossible spaces become tombs. Micro-setting (the lens fragments) charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—giving the drowned rest—tightens once the lens reveals her past error. Escalation is accumulative: each fragment placement increases the clarity of distress signals, reweighting her moral load. The cost is conceptual but legible: she forfeits the surface world forever. Agency is present in every spatial choice she makes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: rest belongs to the element of death, not to human custom. No moralizing; the final image of “profound quiet” reweights the premise without statement. Subtext operates in the shift from “calling out” to settled silence. Stubbornness and stillness are reconciled through spatial rather than ethical repair.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Voice is textured, lyrical, and consistent—“books floated in their cases, suspended in preservation spells that had outlasted their casters.” Syntax stretches underwater: long sentences mirror pressure. Perceptual signature is unmistakably Meridian’s—cataloging grief in spatial terms. No dialogue, so no register clash.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic—“distress signals... layering over each other in cascading light.” Mixed metaphors are avoided; kelp/barnacle/lens imagery stays coherent. A few adjectival stacks (“impossible spaces seemed thinnest”) approach overwriting but remain purposeful. No loops or scaffold detected; final line lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Underwater necropolis as infinite mausoleum feels fresh; folding library into ossuary is a non-obious synthesis. Risk taken with non-Euclidean space pays off logically. The broken lighthouse lens repurposed as soul-beacon transforms trope. Specificity anchors novelty—barnacle seals, kelp twine—preventing generic allegory.</comment>
