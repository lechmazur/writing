<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Celeste’s contradictory hunger—to stop being a hollow tool yet remain a locksmith—drives every beat; the vial micro-choice (uncapping starlight) is an embodied, perilous act that crystallizes her shift to repair-mender. Flaw remains active: she risks freezing her own agency by literalizing prophecy instead of questioning it, but the text lets that ambiguity stand. Cost is visible: the gears now hum against her heartbeat, signaling lifelong altered perception. Internal voice stays concrete, never drifts into therapy-speak.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the mirrored corridor reweights her vocation from opener to listener-of-silence, felt cost is the audible gear-heart sync that follows her down the stairs. Causal chain intact: prophecy scraps → mirror test → starlight spill → audible rhythm, each step because/therefore. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) hit by line 3; no penalty. Lens ambiguity zero; drive is causal throughout. No teleporting props; gears and vial seeded early.</comment>

<comment>“Frozen library above clouds” is not postcard; the ice-encased shelves and amber dawn constrain movement (slippery floor, frost-numb fingers) and shape the hush needed to hear gear-ticks. Micro-setting object—the brass gear assortment—becomes the tactile ground she walks on once spread on the table; its evolving chill mirrors her warming understanding. Spatial choreography clean: entry → table → shelves → hidden chamber → descent, all tracked. Final image of synchronized heartbeat and gears is charged by environment’s cold acoustics.</comment>

<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—will she learn repair or remain a passive opener—tightens when mirror-reflection forces her to hold one gear and hear silence-between-ticks; that moment forecloses the old identity. Escalation is one meaningful deepening, not multiple reversals, sufficient at 700 words. Cost is conceptual but legible: perpetual auditory double-heartbeat she can never un-hear. No coincidence; starlight spill is her deliberate agency.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from specific pattern: gears = broken time, mirrors = doubled reflection, silence = repair space; final image reweights “breakage” as necessary prelude to wholeness without moralizing. No abstract thesis stated; insight stays in the sensory gear-heartbeat. Driftwood simile at end feels earned because earlier library is “washed by unfamiliar shores” of cloud-light. Ambiguity lingers: prophecy may still control her, yet story accepts that unease.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-limited clings to Celeste’s tactile diction: “metal singing softly against ice,” “liquid starlight spilled,” perceptual signature precise. No dialogue, so no voice convergence risk. Syntax modulates: longer clauses for climb, fragment bursts during mirror disorientation. Filter verbs minimal; “she understood” is earned, not explanatory. Register stays within lunar-locksmith lexicon; no academic drift.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies: spondaic “ice-encased shelves gleamed” vs. trailing participial “casting everything in pale amber.” No scaffold loops; each sentence advances image or causality. Mixed metaphors zero; “visual symphony” stays within mirror/gear sound logic. Information density high: one sentence can set spatial relation, temperature, and emotional tilt. Closure line “rhythm of repair… as driftwood washed to unfamiliar shores” is crisp, non-generic.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: eclipse-locksmith + frozen polar library + mirror-as-clockface feels inevitable post-factum. Risk taken with starlight-as-liquid but rule established by mentor vial early. Not derivative; horology-fantasy rarely weds vocational epiphany to sensory metronome. Specific detail: gear teeth etched with grandfather’s unread markings; that specificity prevents template feel. Transformation test fails if names/places swapped—heartbeat-acoustics depend on altitude chill.</comment>
