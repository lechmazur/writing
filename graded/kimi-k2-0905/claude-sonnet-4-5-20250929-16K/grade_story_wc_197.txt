<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mira’s “carefully resourceful” trait is shown through the archive hunt and key use, but interiority stays generic (“she remembered,” “she felt”) and the climactic upload happens off-stage, so the cost is declared rather than embodied. The beat where she presses the key into the stone is the only moment where contradiction and choice visibly collide; more of that texture would push her past the 8-threshold.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal chain is clean: key → puddle-map → hidden archive → upload → escape, each beat tightening the noose. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—the transmitted memories reweight the city’s reality—cost is legible in the Bureau boots overhead and her exile into the lagoon. One minor causality bump: the courier’s riddle is introduced late yet instantly decoded; still, it doesn’t break the final reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The auric lagoon is more than postcard: its doubled starlight literally hides the submerged exit route, and the rain-grooved stone supplies the tactical map that unlocks the archive. Sensory selection stays filtered through Mira’s urgency—golden plankton, salt smell, cold stone under knee—anchoring time and body. The hidden server room is sketched with functional minimalism; enough to believe, not enough to slow momentum.</comment>

<question>4</question><question>8.1</question><comment>Dominant stake—collective memory vs. erasure—is signaled in paragraph two and escalates as raids shrink Mira’s clock. Uploading the archives is the single decisive act that forecloses her safety; the price (permanent fugitive life) is felt in the underwater exit. One tightening move suffices at this length, and it delivers.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—“memory as resistance to curated indifference”—emerges through the puddle-map and the broadcast, never sermonized. The final image of doubled starlight quietly reweights the premise: truth now circulates above and below the surface. A hair more specificity in how the uploaded files alter one lived street would nudge it into the 9-band.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-limited stays tight to Mira; no head-hop. Syntax lengthens under stress (“She surfaced quietly among the golden waters…”) mirroring breathless swim. Occasional elevated diction (“auric,” “conceptual repricing”) feels authored rather than Mira’s, but the slip is brief and doesn’t contaminate the final beat.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, high-density; no scaffold loops or metaphor pile-ups. The single potential overwrite—“the comfortable tyranny of indifference”—is earned by prior world-building and doesn’t stall momentum. Clean mechanics; strong paragraph cut test.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The puddle-cipher and obsolete phone-tech give a fresh twist to the familiar “rebel archives” template; the lagoon-as-memory-interface feels specific to this piece. Risk is moderate but successful: the water-map could have read twee, yet it is set up by the courier line and paid off with tactile insertion of the key.</comment>
