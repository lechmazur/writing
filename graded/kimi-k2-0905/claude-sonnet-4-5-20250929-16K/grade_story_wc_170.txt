<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Aina’s contradictory stillness vs. the singing compulsion is embodied in shoulder-perching birds and cracked voice; the borrowed heartbeat constrains nightly vigils and steers the final wrap-up of mirrors. The moment she sinks onto wet stone pays the cost of this endurance, foreclosing rest. Interiority stays concrete, but the calm trait is asserted more than tested—no visible trade-off under pressure. Motivation is legible; a hair more enacted contradiction would clinch 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as genuine Conceptual Repricing: “mirages of hope rather than grief” reweights the entire ritual and charges the final image of cloth-wrapped mirrors. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: cadence of encoded lullabies, prism light, and heartbeat pulse thickens until the smallest mirror’s vision crystallizes meaning. Causality is intact—each vigil is because of the borrowed pulse, the final wrap is because the vision re-priced her stance. Cost is felt in bodily exhaustion and the unspoken admission that tomorrow’s return is also a life-sentence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prism parapet splits twilight into ribbons that literally steer mirror angles; wet flagstones and bell hush anchor the temporal window. Micro-setting (tarnished-rim mirror) becomes the sole vessel for the decisive vision, charging closure. Sensory economy is high—“birds sometimes landed on her shoulders” shows stillness without saying it. No environment details sit inert; all refract into Aina’s ritual tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—seeing Maya again—tightens from encoded songs to the single mirror’s vision; option space collapses when only the smallest mirror answers. Escalation is textural: color ribbons, heartbeat pulse, and bell hush intensify until the vision offers one fragile possibility. Cost is legible in knees on wet stone and tomorrow’s promised return. Agency is present—she angles each mirror and chooses to wrap and return—but coincidence (only one mirror replies) slightly blunts full 8.8+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through refracted light and mirror logic: grief can be re-angled into generative mirage. The shift from “grief” to “hope” is never stated outright; instead, the final image of cloth-wrapped mirrors re-prices the ritual. Subtext hums in altered lullaby codes—possibility sung into being rather than declared. Complexity stays: hope is not healing but an endless vigil, making the moral thorny and earned.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Aina’s perceptual filter—sound folds, prism splits, heartbeat timed to her breath. Syntax lengthens and compresses with song cadence; diction stays painterly (“beveled stone edge splitting the emerging twilight”) yet avoids purple overload. No head-hop; focalization is steady. The slight poetic overwrite in “mirage painter” is early and pattern-taught, paid off by closure’s shift to “mirages of hope.”</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Rhythm modulates—long anaphoric song lines vs. stark final sentence—propelling the bell-countdown. Figurative language is dense but purposeful; density decreases into the clean final line. No loops or synonym churn; “heartbeat” repeats only when it reweights meaning. One mixed vehicle (“time deposited into her chest”) barely grazes clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: encoded nursery rhymes as séance code, prism terrace as optical loom, borrowed heartbeat as durational engine. The concept risks gimmick yet stays grounded in maternal specificity. The final turn—“mirages of hope” re-angles the entire grief genre—feels inevitable in hindsight. Slight risk hedging in keeping Maya off-stage keeps it from 9-band.</comment>
