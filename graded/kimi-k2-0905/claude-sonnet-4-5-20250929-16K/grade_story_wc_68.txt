<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcellus’s rational-rebel stance is consistently embodied through tactile micro-choices—thumb-flicking the brass cog, sealing the archive above the waterline—so his endurance feels earned. The interior contradiction (calm vs. seething contempt) stays alive in scene, not summary. No secondary character appears, so relationship crucible is N/A; headcount waiver applies. Cost is visible: irrelevance = philosopher’s death, and he accepts it in the final image.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each descent tightens because/therefore linkage—archive → patrol threat → higher hiding. Closure lands as Earned Stasis: sealing the cylinder forecloses public vindication with felt cost (“abrasive calm” crystallizes the stance). Orientation anchored by word 80 (“storm drain…sunken district”). No telegraphing or lens drift. Persistent constraint—waterline and patrols—shapes tactics to the end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setting is specificity engine: brass teeth catch green-filtered light, coral on subway tiles, hospital records in silt. Chronometer cog acts as micro-setting that charges final image. Spatial choreography clean through submerged arches to highest pipe. Environment constrains every tactic—diving, hiding, archiving—so 9+ quick test met.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</question><comment>Single dominant stake—preserve epistemology vs. Council erasure—signaled in paragraph 1. Tightening beat: patrol shadow overhead narrows options to conceal-or-die. Cost legible: he trades relevance for continuity, paid in the final cylinder placement. Escalation driven by his agency (excavate, ascend, seal); coincidence complicates but does not resolve.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme—knowledge vs. sanctioned forgetting—emerges through sedimentary image pattern, not lecture. Final image of cogs “patient as mathematics” reweights earlier strata metaphor, achieving Conceptual Repricing. No final-paragraph sermon; silence after patrol lets resonance breathe. Ambiguity remains: future readers may still choose mysticism.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</question><comment>Voice carries distinct perceptual signature: nautical precision metaphors, sewer-philosopher diction, abrasive calm cadence. Compression taught early—“Great Forgetting” line—and paid off in final cog patience. No dialogue, so dialogue bullets N/A. Psychic distance stable; no POV leakage. Rhythmic control peaks in short, hammered clauses under patrol threat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</question><comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies: long aquatic sentences vs. staccato patrol beat. No paraphrase loops or scaffold. Information-dense lines double duty: “seventeen brass teeth that once worked in concert” = count + metaphor + theme. Mixed-metaphor watch: “coral grew on subway tiles” keeps marine logic clean. Minor filter verbs (“he could make him irrelevant”) stay in character’s lexicon; register intact.</question>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</question><comment>Fresh synthesis: drowned archive + longitude cog + rational rebellion = non-obvious angle on post-catastrophe knowledge politics. Transformation test fails if names swapped—specificity of gear, strata, sewer cell is the story. Risk-taking (sewer-philosopher, abrasive calm) heightens stakes without gimmickry. No close echoes of canonical scenes; image of cogs waiting underwater feels new.</comment>
