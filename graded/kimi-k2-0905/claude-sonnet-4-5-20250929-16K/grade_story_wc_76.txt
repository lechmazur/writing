<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Silas’s interior contradiction—devotion to backward clocks vs. hunger to reverse lived loss—drives every beat; the trembling fingers, dawn smile, and jeweler precision show embodied cost. No second character, so status lens is waived; his micro-choice to throw the yoyo crystallizes values hierarchy with irreversible felt price. Motivation scales cleanly from hobbyist rebellion to existential gambit. 9+ quick test met: contradictory impulses in scene and causally earned renunciation.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the final snap rewinds the world’s gears with conceptual cost—“something fundamental clicked counter clockwise” reweights all prior rules. Causal lens holds throughout: because he finds the yoyo, therefore he dismantles, therefore he reassembles, therefore he initiates, therefore time recoils. Orientation anchors (lighthouse, low-tide rocks, night) are clear by word 50. Persistent constraint—reversed causality now governs his life—shapes the closing image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The lighthouse workshop, wet rocks, and hunger stone constrain movement and supply tools (bronze axle, beacon wire). Micro-setting of the yoyo’s bronze axle serves as the pivotal arena. Final image of the stone blazing beneath rising tide is recharged by earlier description. Environment shapes tactics and charges closure, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“step beyond fate’s design”—is signaled early and tightens through each tide cycle. Reversal at the throw: future pulls, then option narrows to one irreversible recall. Cost is legible in the “thread by thread” unmaking of his life. Escalation is causal and sufficient for 800-word scope.</question>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through the spiral-not-line metaphor and the yoyo’s return: time is construct, fate is rewindable, but every retrieval demands self-dissolution. No moralizing; final image offers conceptual repricing without statement. Particulars (clock gears, crystal seed, hunger stone) carry expanding symbolic mass. Resonance reweights prior material with chilling exhilaration.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Silas’s jeweler perception; diction (“latent radiance,” “compressed moments”) fits obsessive horologist. Rhythm accelerates with dismantling beats, then snaps back mirroring yoyo motion. No dialogue, so voice purity is maintained. Compression and ellipses are consistent and taught early.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary from short gasps to winding clauses; no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is sparse, precise (“gray tooth,” “coiled in time”). Density high—each line advances image or causality. Final beat free of overwriting; click of reversal is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Reverse-engineering an ancient yoyo into a time-battery is non-obvious and inevitable once seeded. Combines horology, drought folklore, and metaphysical recursion in a singular synthesis. Risk-taking (causality runs backward) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Fresh inflection charges every prior image on second read.</comment>
