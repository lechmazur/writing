<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marina’s contradictory impulses—ex-dancer brawler turned gentle cargo-hauler—are dramatized in her body (the impossible grace, the kelp-brushing toes) and in the micro-choice to cradle then release the scrimshaw. The internal split between violent heritage and tender self-image is embodied, not labeled. What keeps this from 9+ is that the renunciation beat is slightly over-articulated (“I was never meant to be a weapon”) rather than left to the gesture and whale-song; the cost is felt but not given a persistent constraint that will shape tomorrow’s dock work.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the scrimshaw’s release and whale-dive reweight the premise—grief becomes freedom, the island sinks, Marina walks back “surprisingly spacious.” Causal lens dominates: because the Treaty severed violence, therefore the only combat left is self-forgiveness; because the bone is returned, therefore the false self drowns. Cost is legible in the cold wade back and the vanished island. One hairline slip: the line “furious love… the tender rage” edges toward diagnostic label-speak in the climactic paragraph (−0.1).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The sublittoral fringe is lived-in infrastructure: barnacled rock memory, kelp calves, tide clocks that decide when the island can be reached. Micro-setting (the whalebone tool, the ankle-deep pools) constrains every footstep and finally carries the scrimshaw away. Spatial choreography is flawless—no impossible positions as Marina wades, circles, releases. The cedar-twisted island recharges the final image by vanishing, reweighting the stakes: freedom is not a place but a subtraction.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: can Marina lay down the protector identity she never truly owned? Pressure tightens once: the early-surfacing island offers the scrimshaw, forcing a public-private choice under whale-witness. Escalation is accumulative-textural: tide, bone, and song layer until the only remaining tactic is release. Cost is visible—she forfeits the last relic of her brother and the alibi for hardness. No secondary reversals, but the single deepening is sufficient for 750-word scope.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without slogan: weapon vs. instrument, hardness vs. tender attention, story vs. sea-song. The whale’s call repurposes the pirate mark into an elegy rather than a war-cry; the island’s disappearance answers the question of where freedom lives—inside subtraction. No final-paragraph moral; the last image is footprints filling with tidal water, an non-literal answer that reweights every prior “dancer” taunt. Complexity is preserved: gentleness is not safe, it is the harder fight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person POV stays tightly lashed to Marina’s perceptual signature—rock memory, kelp language, cargo-harbor metaphors (“like a secret being exhaled”). Syntax lengthens and shortens with tide-breath; no filter-verb clutter. The one risk—lyric apostrophe to “twilight itself”—reads intentional, not ventriloquism, and is paid off by the whale-song that replaces human speech. Voice coherence survives the peak stress of release.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet buoyant: “anemones bloomed like fists waiting to open” does two jobs—visual and thematic—without metaphor pile-up. Rhythm modulates from long wave-sentences to the staccato of wading. No scaffold loops; each paragraph advances knowledge or stance. One near-mix: “tender rage” is abstract within an otherwise concrete peak beat, a microscopic register drift (−0.1). Otherwise ear-test passes aloud.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The Treaty-locked world where violence is neurologically dampened is fresh, yet the story’s real invention is using that premise to de-weaponize grief rather than stage rebellion. Whale-as-priest, island as confessional, scrimshaw as sin-eater—all transform familiar eco-poetic tropes into a private liturgy. The risk of soft surrealism is grounded by dock-worker muscle memory. Not quite 9 because the societal frame stays backdrop; the innovation is intimate, not systemic.</comment>
