<comment>Mira’s “empathetically decisive” trait is shown only in the council flashback; on-page she is gentle, reactive, and narratively flawless. No contradictory impulse or visible cost attaches to her final choice—she simply keeps singing—so the arc is warm but unmotivated. The promised grain-elevator conflict is off-loaded to the communities; she never confronts a dilemma that would test her trait under pressure. Interiority leans on stock abstractions (“her empathy sharpening”) rather than embodied contradiction.</comment>

<comment>Causal chain is clear: insist → retrofit → broadcast → coax response → receive song; each step because/therefore links. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—shared harmony reweights isolation—but the cost is delegated to the collective; Mira pays nothing, weakening the “felt” requirement. Orientation anchors inside 120 words; lens is Causal, held to the end. Biggest drag: the decisive beat (Tigrinya appeal) is oratory, not action, and the tower’s mechanical stakes disappear once the singing starts.</comment>

<comment>Clock-tower mechanics are tactile and specific: brass meridians, cuckoo weight, pulley, cupola starlight. Object handling constrains the broadcast timing and returns in the closure image, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography keeps seven off-page silos legible through distinct audio cues. Prairie night is evoked with economic sensory triangulation—cold, starlight, humming across distance—never slowing momentum.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—"bridge the silos"—is signaled early; escalation is the gradual audio recruitment of six elevators culminating in Seven’s song. Agency is mostly facilitative; Mira’s single risky act is the Tigrinya address, but it costs her nothing and failure is never tactile. Tightening occurs through sequential assent rather than narrowed options; coincidence is avoided. Cost is social but undramatized—no lost resource, no rebuttal, no fear of reprisal—so pressure plateaus rather than spikes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of polyphonic communion emerges organically from the multilingual singing; no explicit moral is stated. Final image—seven separate melodies braiding—reconfigures the opening isolation without sermon. Subtext operates in the silence of Elevator Seven, but the text later over-articulates “this was why she’d fought,” curbing ambiguity. Emotion is tender yet borders on sentimental because the librarian’s sacrifice is nil.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays cleanly inside Mira’s perceptions; perceptual signature is musical and mechanical. Sentence rhythm modulates—long lyrical clauses for song, staccato for switchboard prompts—without monoculture. No dialogue is attributed, keeping focus on collective voice rather than individuals; this choice supports theme but flattens character distinctiveness. Filter verbs are minimal; diction favors concrete Anglo-Saxon roots, avoiding register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, image-dense, and loop-free; only one paraphrase pair (“vigorous with conviction yet tender with understanding”) could compress. Figurative language is sparse and apt—starlight “borrowed,” melody “braided.” Opening line anchors voice and metaphor simultaneously. Final paragraph repeats “bridges from silos” phrasing already stated, a minor scaffold, but it does not touch the closing image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Premise—repurposing grain-elevator tech for refugee polyphony—is fresh, non-obvious, and deeply specific to Saskatchewan infrastructure. Mechanical clock / celestial metaphor harmonizes with audio circuitry, creating conceptual synergy. Risk of sentimentality is taken but mostly paid off through sensory restraint. Could swap librarian for another caring adult, but the elevator-to-choir conceit is irreproducibly local, earning the extra 0.2 risk bonus.</comment>
