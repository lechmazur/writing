<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Chen’s interiority is textured through tactile net-work and moon-tracking; her patience and “hidden effort” ethic are embodied, not declared. The withheld name and whistle-code give her a lived past, yet the piece stops short of forcing her into a high-stakes choice tonight—her decision to “show the whisk tomorrow” is preparatory, so the cost feels prospective rather than paid. Still, contradiction simmers: she prizes anonymity yet signals presence with melody, a tension the prose trusts us to feel.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Chen’s flick of whisk-water patterns the stone, crystallizing her intent to teach, with the firefly/moon/net map as visible cost. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern density escalates through nets, whisk, equations, fireflies—re-weighted in one final image that reconfigures tomorrow’s stakes. Orientation is swift: parapet, after-rain, night whistle within 60 words. No因果 reversal is required; the tightening is the recognition that the girl’s equations already rhyme with Chen’s craft.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Slick parapet stone, moonlit puddles, and hemp fibers provide tactile anchors; the bamboo whisk doubles as micro-setting that constrains Chen’s gesture and final image. Firefly season is sensed, not catalogued, and weather’s residual wetness lets moonlight “scintillate” while guiding Chen’s pattern-reading. Spatial choreography holds as Chen shifts from net to whisk to puddle—no floating props. Environment is inseparable from her method, not backdrop.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: transmit “hidden effort” sight to the girl before mentorship begins. Pressure tightens when Chen tests the whisk-shadow pattern—if the girl fails to see, Chen’s life-purpose stalls. The beat is small but decisive: one flicked scatter of droplets forecloses silence and commits her to disclosure. Cost is the vulnerability of being misunderstood, felt but modest; hence not quite the 8.8 band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: the dignity of invisible labor and the courage to write truth where walls—temple or societal—refuse ears. Subtext resides in whistle-code replies the fisherman never deciphers, in the asymmetrical wear of whisk-prongs. No character sermonizes; the final image of droplets mirroring fireflies lets pattern itself argue for recognition. Complexity lingers: vandalism as legitimate epistemology.</comment>

<comment>Third-limited stays welded to Chen’s perceptual filter—moon-path cartographer, net-finger, code-whistler. Syntax lengthens and breathes with her patience, then snaps short for the whisk-flick. No filter-verb clutter; “studying how its shadow created a map” keeps immediacy. Whistle-melody reported as remembered code, not transcribed notes, preserves idiom. Voice modulation under zero stress is subtle but controlled.</comment>

<comment>Prose is lyrical yet propulsive; each sentence advances image or stakes. Only one paraphrase loop detected (“hidden effort” twice in four lines) but it serves motif reinforcement, not padding. Metaphors stay coherent—moon-paths, knot-tension, firefly constellations—without mixed collisions. Clause rhythm varies; no template cadence. Final paragraph could lose one adjective (“scintillatingly somber”) without harm, but artifact does not touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Fusing net-mending with epistemology is fresh; making a bamboo whisk the lesson key elevates humble tool to text further distinguishes the piece. Risk lies in quiet, preparative arc—no clash, only poised anticipation—but the wager pays off in the final pattern-flick. Could edge higher if the girl’s equation graffiti had one concrete line on-page, grounding audacity in specificity.</comment>
