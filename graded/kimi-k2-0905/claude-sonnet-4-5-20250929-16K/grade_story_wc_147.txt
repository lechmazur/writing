<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Marina’s interiority—“instincts screamed… overriding instinct”—shows credible contradiction under pressure, but the pivot from solitary scientist to lone savior is compressed into one beat with no prior flaw or misbelief dramatized. Thalia’s centuries-long endurance is conveyed through gesture and the cracked helmet, giving visible cost, yet her priestess identity is asserted more than tested. The micro-choice to trigger the transfer is embodied and stakes-scaled to the length, earning the +0.2 over the 8.4 quick-test floor.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Causal lens holds: signal → descent → recognition → transfer → collapse, each step a because/therefore linkage. The crystallized-prayer mechanic is taught on-the-fly yet paid off in the final image of temple rubble, giving visible conceptual cost (“memory of those who refused to be forgotten”). Closure lands with Charged Poise: the vial glowing in ascent reweights the premise under the “preserved memory” rule. Only the thinnest setup for Marina’s competence edge keeps it shy of 9.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Deep-sea idiom is precise—preservation field, manipulator arms, energy probe—without faux-manual dump. The temple’s coral-encrusted pillars and collapsing rubble constrain the rescue window and physically charge the final image. Spatial choreography tracks submersible lights, field nodes, and ascending debris cleanly. Micro-setting cap waived: the vial operates as portable “environment” that reconfigures meaning at closure. Misses 9.0 because no sensory detail beyond the visual is leveraged under life-or-death pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—save Thalia before field collapses—signaled by line 4 and tightens through live countdown (“field would fail in hours”). Marina’s agency drives every escalation: she descends, touches, calculates, triggers; no coincidence resolves. The price is legible—temple destroyed, path foreclosed, knowledge lost except the vial—meeting the 8.8+ cost gate. Only one tightening cycle fits the length, satisfying the single-deepening allowance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of memory-as-survival emerges through the vial’s reprise rather than exposition; no explicit moral is stated. Subtext sits in Thalia’s silent plea and the cracked helmet—endurance as both triumph and wound. Final image of “stars” reframes lonesome splendor into shared ascent, reweighting isolation without sentimentality. Lacks a second motif layer to reach 9.0 band.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Third-person close keeps perceptual signature anchored to Marina’s scientific filter—light cones, energy ratios, “calculated trajectories”—with rhythmic compression under pressure. No head-hopping; Thalia’s thoughts remain externalized through gesture, preserving distance. Syntax tightens into fragment-leaning urgency during transfer sequence, mirroring stress without clutter. Voice distinct enough for high band but not yet unmistakable at 9+.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Zero template cadence, no synonym loops; sentences vary length and opening. Information density high—“coral-encrusted pillars that rose like bones” does triple scene-work in ten words. Figurative language is spare, pattern-taught early (“cathedral of stone and shadow”) and paid off in collapse image. Only a single simultaneity hiccup—“Energy coruscated… and for a heartbeat thought”—keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: deep-archaeology rescue merged with time-capture perfume vial converts sentimental object into hard-SF stakes. Risk of collapsing temple as rescue succeeds is bold yet causally grounded. Specificity—brass helmet cracked by pressure, crystallized prayer nodes—prevents trope drift. Feels inevitable in hindsight, earning the +0.2 risk bonus.</comment>
