<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira’s hybrid nature—leaves that physically respond to honesty—gives her interiority a concrete, idiosyncratic gauge that is shown every time her temples flare or wilt. The beat-to-beat alignment of her body with truth-telling keeps motivation legible and stakes personal; when Kade admits fear, the immediate unfurling crystallizes their first honest transaction. The only drag is the late-introduced neighbor: his turn from hollow banter to confession is credible but compressed, so the relationship-as-crucible effect is more asserted than dramatized. Still, her final micro-choice—to return and invite others—pays the cost of exposure in a city built on necessary lies, earning the story’s quiet but visible price.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Mira’s decision to carry the Archive outward reweights the premise—truth becomes portable, no longer sequestered. The cost is felt in the toxic sky still pressing above and in the implied social risk of circulating honesty; the final line’s restored inscription delivers the conceptual bill. Causality holds: fragment → map → depot → first etching → resolve to broadcast, each step a because/therefore linkage under the Causal lens. Orientation is seamless—who/where/when anchored by line 20—and the single transition from studio to depot is clean.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The greenhouse city is sketched with sensory economy—filtered amber, rust-colored weight, recycled-air hum—yet these details double as pressure gauges: the thicker the sky feels, the more deception is normalized. The Archive itself is rendered as tactile workspace: thousands of zinc plates, blank stylus, the hush of preserved intent; the body-as-setting (Mira’s gold-veined leaves) constrains every social interaction. Spatial choreography stays coherent through tunnels and conservatories, no floating rooms. Micro-setting bonus: the body/tool (leaves/plate) charges the final image when Mira’s leaves catch light “like stained glass,” re-infusing the toxic world with luminous candor.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—can candor survive in a society of necessary lies?—is signaled when the first fragment straightens her leaves. Escalation is incremental but coherent: each recovered shard tightens the possibility of public truth; the Archive scene forces the choice to keep hiding or begin speaking. Protagonist agency drives every turn: Mira decides to search, to bring Kade, to etch, to return. Cost is visible on the page: social risk (they could be ostracized for hoarding “emotional contraband”) and physiological drain (her papery fragility after years of wilting). No coincidence resolves; the depot discovery is earned by map logic.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without thesis statement: the emotional residue of unsaid truth becomes a literal archive, turning subtext into palpable artifact. The final restoration of the postal sentence re-prices candor as a circulating currency rather than a private refuge. Ambiguity is preserved—no guarantee the city will listen—yet the image of light through Mira’s leaves offers non-literal hope. No moralizing paragraph; insight is earned by the etching action and the shared fear Kade names.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays pinned to Mira’s perception; no head-hop. Perceptual signature is botanically slanted—“gold-veined,” “papery,” “unfurling”—creating a consistent vegetal filter. Psychic distance tightens effectively in the depot: “She ran her fingers over the plates” keeps us inside her tactile discovery. Dialogue is sparse but distinct: Kade’s hollow brightness vs. his later quiet “I’m scared” shows lexical shrinkage under pressure. No filter-verb clusters; rhythm breathes with the reveal beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and double-duty: “the toxic sky pressed its rust-colored weight” fuses visual, tactile, and symbolic information in one stroke. No scaffold loops; paragraph cuts are clean—removing any paragraph would erase knowledge or emotional charge. Figurative language is selective: “leaves… like stained glass” arrives only at the climax, recharging earlier light imagery. Sentence variety supports tempo—short revelation lines alternate with longer, air-filled clauses mirroring greenhouse atmosphere. Copy-clean: tense stable, pronouns unambiguous.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The “truth archive” concept freshens familiar post-collapse nostalgia by literalizing emotional residue into zinc plates. Postal routes as emotional veins is a specific, non-obvious synthesis. Transformation test fails if leaves & plates are swapped—hybrid botanic response is inseparable from premise. Risk is quiet but present: a lyrical, low-violence resolution in a genre that often defaults to brutalism. Fresh inflection: honesty as cultivated ephemera that must be re-sown each conversation.</comment>
