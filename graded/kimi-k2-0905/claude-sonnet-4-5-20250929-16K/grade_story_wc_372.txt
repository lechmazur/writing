<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Celeste’s life-long archivist calling and quiet, embodied diligence ("gently meticulous steps") stay believable and specific; her interiority never slips into label-speak. The renunciation—transforming the library instead of saving it—carries credible cost, yet her contradictory impulses (preserve vs. let go) are told more than enacted in scene; we’re not shown a moment where she wavers with visible friction, so the change feels lightly mediated rather than dramatically forged under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Drive lens is clearly Accumulative/Textural: density of decaying wonders builds toward a conceptual re-pricing—turning archive into seed. Orientation anchors within first 120 words; single POV, continuous scene, one meaningful tightening when she converts vows into transmissible code. Closure lands as Charged Poise: capsule falling, library doomed, Celeste inside the collapse yet having already paid by releasing the future; quartz-hush cadence makes the cost felt without exposition.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Frozen library, quartz chamber, amber clouds function as both spectacle and constraint—the slide must be re-coded before gravity wins. Micro-setting (Resonance Chamber) directly shapes her method and limits time; the lantern slide handled in tactile beats charges the ending image. Sensory selection stays POV-driven (archivist notices shelving hum, ink freezing). Spatial choreography clean; no anchor drift; world-rules (levitation via frequency) internally consistent.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—save meaning from extinction—signalled early; pressure deepens as frequency readings reveal doom, narrowing options to transformation vs. total loss. Escalation is textural: each sampled frequency tightens the library’s mortality. Protagonist agency appears in the re-weaving act, paid for by irreversible structural failure; cost is visible when the capsule is released as surrogate future.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: preservation through metamorphosis, memory as living code. Subtext carried in object handling—slide glows with response to sampling, embodying idea that knowledge survives by adapting not by stasis. Final image reweights premise: falling capsule = archive reborn as seed; no moralizing, only resonant charge. Some abstraction ("luminous vows") leans symbolic, but particulars of frequency sampling keep it grounded.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person close stays tight to Celeste’s archivist perceptual lens: "ink that froze almost as quickly as she wrote," "quartz hush" silence. Syntax elegant, rhythmic; no filter-verb clutter; metaphors precise (breath → constellations) without purple drift. Compression purposeful; lyric repetition ("gently meticulous") signals method and temperament. Voice modulation under pressure visible as sentences shorten during capsule release.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm varied; sentences layer sensory + causal info without scaffolding. No loops, no synonym churn, no mixed metaphors; "luminous vows," though abstract, is set up early and re-prices cleanly. Information density high—each sentence performs at least two narrative jobs. Minor overworld phrasing ("approaching their final collapse") skirts cliché but doesn’t obscure closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Cloud-borne crystalline archive seeded with frequency-based immortality feels fresh, not checklist. Transformation of library from fortress to pollen is earned and conceptually coherent. Detail particular to voice (frequency scanner needles, crystalline ink) prevents generic abstraction. Slight risk of familiar "dying archive" trope, but specific mechanics of sampling frequencies and quartz resonance chamber avert derivative feel.</comment>
