<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus’s inner contradiction—innocent tongue vs. inherited guilt—stays alive in every beat; the micro-choice to keep watching the drowning men while seeking his own “hush” crystallizes a hierarchy of values. The final stance (“hush wasn’t something you found, but something you became”) is earned by the accumulated silence he has practiced, with the cost visible in the bodies he refused to save. Father-shadow as flaw complicates every potential warning, making the refusal to cry out inevitable rather than convenient. Interiority avoids label-speak, instead using concrete images (hayloft, copper light, wooden diamonds) to embody shame.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: Marcus presses forehead to lattice, trusting someone might listen—an unmistakable reconfiguration of a lifetime of disbelief. Causal lens holds: because father’s lies made warning worthless, therefore Marcus withholds speech, therefore the three die, therefore he must become hush itself. Cost is legible in the same breath that names trust for the first time. Orientation is clean (“lighthouse prison…reef” by line 2).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The lattice functions as micro-setting: it constrains his vantage, frames the only light he receives, and finally supports his forehead in the closing beat. Copper light returns with shifting weight—first staining floor, later blessing words, lastly bathing his moment of trust—charging the final image. “Jagged reef” and “dying stone” are tactile anchors that guide the knowledge that bodies will emerge; geography never drifts. Sensory economy favors visual and tactile, narrowing to breath and wood at the climax.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can Marcus speak and be believed?—is signaled in paragraph two. Pressure tightens once: the falling tide literally bares the consequence of his silence, forcing the final stance. Protagonist agency drives every beat; even inaction (watching swimmers die) is a conscious tactic toward “hush.” The price paid—complicity in three deaths—alters the moral geometry and charges the final image.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: inherited guilt versus self-forged testimony, voiced through the paradox that silence can be a form of speech. The lattice’s reprise—window, confessional, forehead rest—reweights its meaning from prison bar to communion rail. Final image offers non-literal answer: becoming hush is the only available innocence. No moralizing sentence distills the paradox; the reader is left in the copper-lit irresolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Perceptual signature is consistent: Marcus notices light through wooden diamonds, counts scuffs on door-edges, tracks tide by color change. Syntax grows slightly breathless under final trust, mirroring risk. No dialogue appears; interior monologue stays in lexicon of son of village shepherd (“hayloft,” “Gregor”). Free indirect bleeds cleanly into lyric declaration at end, justified by dawn-long rehearsal of story.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary from short tremors (“The bodies would be found soon.”) to elongated coils that thread metaphor without clutter. No paraphrase loops; each metaphor advances the image (copper-stained walls → copper light → copperlight repose). Register stays inside rural-penitential idiom; no corporate drift. Opening and closing lines perform dual duty—anchor setting and re-cast stake.</comment>

<comment>Inversion of the wolf fable into a meditation on the cost of not crying wolf feels inevitable yet unwritten before now. Lighthouse-as-prison and confessional-lattice-as-window are fresh spatial metaphors that concretize the moral trap. Specificity of “copperlight repose” coins a new compound noun that could not be swapped. Risky quiet ending lands because prior beats have dramatized the lethal price of silence.</comment>
