<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Margaret’s contradictory drives—denying meaning while craving transformation—surface in her jazz metaphor and final smile; her micro-choice to keep writing crystallizes Earned Stasis. Interiority is concrete (“floor tilt slightly”), emotion embodied without label-speak. Flaw (restlessness) directly spawns the plot; cost is the lifelong accidental espionage she must now own. Relationship with the stranger is brief but pressure-charged, forcing her stance shift.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: “because” her cookies read as clues, “therefore” spies converge; the lighthouse beam’s regularity becomes Conceptual Repricing—open secrets stay open. Closure is clean: Margaret’s decision to perpetuate/own the flow lands on-page with the smile-as-cost. One shard, no teleporting props; microdot payoff seeded early. Minor slack: orientation (who/where) is implicit but taught by bar name & island by ~120 words, so waiver applies; no cap triggered.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Lighthouse beam and pub scarred wood are handled, re-handled, and finally reweighted as the charged image of open secrets. Spatial choreography clean: bar → window → black water → beam sweep. Weather and tide stay off-stage but the beam’s rhythm supplies temporal heartbeat. Sensory selectivity filters through Margaret’s photographer’s eye (“photography pun”) anchoring POV bias.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—authorship vs. consequence—tightens when the stranger reveals the espionage chain; options narrow to own or deny the flow. Escalation driven by Margaret’s stunned recognition, not coincidence; final choice to keep writing forecloses the “innocent” path. Cost is existential: she must live with accidental geopolitical weight. One deepening suffices; no repeated reversals needed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges non-declaratively: meaninglessness as camouflage for meaning, orchestration via surrender. Subtext in “transposed into a new key” recycles jazz metaphor into thematic payoff. Final smile enacts Charged Poise—ambiguity endured, not solved. No moralizing; irony staysfelt, not labeled.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person close stays tightly fused to Margaret’s perceptual signature: lighthouse beam = heartbeat, jazz transposition as life creed. Diction (“crake island,” “spycraft specs”) remains within her plausible lex without register drift. Rhythm accelerates slightly during revelation (“microdot, smaller than a pencil eraser”) then settles into contemplative cadence for closure. No dialogue contamination; stranger’s diction is distinct yet subordinated.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Varied sentence openings, no template cadence; information dense (“thirty-seven years… microdot… obsolete now”). Metaphors clean and consistent (jazz, lighthouse, tide). Zero paraphrase loops; final line re-energizes “familiar enigma” without redundancy. Clean grammar, pronoun reference, tense stable.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Premise—fortune-cookie zen as espionage breadcrumb—is non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Cold-War microdot tech wedded to coastal Maine micro-setting feels singular. Risk in letting climax be intellectual revelation pays off via conceptual repricing. No derivative echo; transformation test passed—story collapses if cookie writer replaced with baker.</comment>
