<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mara’s guilt-driven persistence and Lisel’s bristling resentment both manifest in embodied micro-choices on the beam; the grandmother’s tremoring knees and the granddaughter’s crossed-arm balance dramatize their hierarchy of values without label-speak. The final shared reach toward the flawed eye crystallizes a credible, costly reconciliation that is foreshadowed by the half-finished orb and the ribbon binding their wrists. Interior contradiction is vivid: Mara admits she “wasn’t completely absent” while still acknowledging the selfishness that fractured the family. No stock gestures; every tactile detail (polishing cloth, calibration rods, hairline fractures in quartz) is character-particular and pressures the present moment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: because Mara broke deciduous vows, Lisel fled; because Mara climbs, she can offer the unfinished eye; because the eye’s imperfection is embraced, a new joint apprenticeship becomes possible. Orientation is anchored within 120 words (cathedral stairs, orchard rumor, granddaughter’s ribbon). Closure is a Charged Poise: the same tools that once divided them now bridge generations, with the cost visible in the fractured eye they still must grind together. Persistent constraint—the ribbon tying their wrists—shapes the final image and forecloses return to the old Guild order.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The impossible orchard physically constrains every move: footholds determine dialogue pacing, rain-collection bottles dictate Lisel’s medicinal agenda, and dappled cathedral light becomes the workspace for eye-mending. Spatial choreography is flawless—branches as bridges, beams as perches—creating a living set that forces intimacy at height. The scent of pears and incense is filtered through Mara’s professional eye for refractive angles, fusing occupation with atmosphere. The final image of ripening apples above the shared toolkit recharges the setting as a cathedral of second chances rather than abandoned ruin.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—repairing the granddaughter’s eye and the relationship—tightens when Mara must admit fault while thirty feet above ground, foreclosing retreat. One meaningful reversal: Lisel shifts from rejection to collaboration the instant she sees the flawed orb meant for her; the cost is her damaged eye still unhealed and the Guild fees permanently forsworn. Agency is dual: Mara climbs; Lisel chooses to stay and stretch the ribbon. The price (shared exile from Guild approval) is legible in the closing vow neither permanent nor thoughtless.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of “flaws make alive” emerges through the unfinished quartz eye and deciduous vows rather than exposition. Subtext operates in silence: the ribbon tied around both wrists speaks reconciliation louder than apology. Final image reweights the premise—perfection is abandonment, imperfection is continuity—without moralizing. Motif of falling (apples, leaves, wisdom) recurs only when it reconfigures the stake at closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Mara’s perceptual signature—measuring light through facets, cataloging refraction—colors every description of the orchard’s dappled glow. Syntax tightens under height stress: “branch by careful branch” fragments mirror her ragged breath. Lisel’s voice carries medicinal bottle clinks and pragmatic braid tug, distinct from Mara’s craft idiom. No head-hopping; interior access remains strictly grandmother-bound.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “their roots threading through stone and timber” performs scenic and metaphoric work simultaneously. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances either peril of height or emotional stakes. Metaphors stay physically coherent (apple blossoms as shed vows) without mixed logic. Final line cadence—“apples ripened in cathedral light”—resolves with hymnal resonance that feels earned, not purple.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Combining ocular prosthetics with arboreal cathedral is a fresh synthesis that grows inevitably from the grandmother’s craft and the vow-shedding metaphor. Risk of magical orchard pays off by forcing literal high-stakes reconciliation. Transformation test fails if moved to mundane clinic—setting is inseparable from emotional arc. Deciduous vows repurposed as craft philosophy avoids familiar broken-promise trope.</comment>
