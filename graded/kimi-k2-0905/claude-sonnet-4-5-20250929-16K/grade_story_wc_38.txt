<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is vivid—her algae “syllables,” her pirouetted codes—and every micro-choice (rolling the dice, mounting the stairs) grows from the established lyrical-coder trait. The cost is palpable: she abandons the journals that anchored her years of captivity. What keeps this from 9-band is the slight over-tidiness of her emotional arithmetic: fear “crystallizes,” hope “becomes buoyant” in the same beat, a packaged symmetry where a messier contradiction would feel truer under imminent freedom.</comment>

<comment>The closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the rusted locks “recognize” her dance and open, re-pricing captivity as a mutable pattern. Causality is lyric-accumulative rather than thriller-tight—each journal entry, dice roll, and dance phrase layers until the environment answers—but the lens is declared early and held. Cost is on-stage: she relinquishes her elaborately built prison-algae and the safety of encoded secrecy. Minor over-cleanness in the final uplift keeps it just shy of 9+ perfection.</comment>

<comment>Kelp-draped cathedral, bioluminescent algae, corroded spiral staircase—every anchor is sensory, specific, and filtered through Mira’s coder-musician eye. The sunken lab constrains sound, movement, and breath, directly shaping how she must choreograph escape; the final image of seawater rushing past rusted walls re-weights the setting from tomb to portal. No spatial drift; bodies and objects track cleanly. Even without exterior geography, the micro-setting of staircase, bench, and dice suffices for 8+ band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—liberation via encoded dance—announced by paragraph three and sharpened each time she “writes” tide data that is really pirouette notation. Escalation is accumulative: every algae bloom, dice roll, and waltz across coral floor tightens the lattice until the walls hum back. The visible price is the forfeiture of her journals—years of coded self left behind—satisfying the felt-cost bar for this length. One soft note: external antagonists (guards, Ministry) remain off-stage props rather than adaptive pressure, slightly blunting the final release.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without sermon: the alchemy of turning vulnerability (imprisonment, fear) into choreography of strength. The spider-web refrain re-weights at closure—she has not broken free but rewoven the trap into a ladder. Subtext lives in gesture: fingers pressing invisible keys, dice that “listen,” algae blooming like private syntax. Only a whisper of thesis-statement in “liberation had always been about encoding herself” keeps it from a perfect 9; the line nudges the reader rather than trusting the image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Mira’s synesthetic coder ear: “current’s hymn,” “crystalline formations,” syntax flexing into musical cadence. No head-hop; perceptual signature is consistent—she interprets rust as notation, tides as tempi. Register never drifts into academic or corporate; every metaphor is grounded in marine or musical lexicon she would plausibly own. Rhythm scales with tension, fragments tightening as the walls begin to hum, then releases into the long final sentence of ascent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Strong kinetic verbs and sparse adjectives keep density high while sustaining lyric pulse; information often doubles (e.g., “swollen with seawater and secrets”). Metaphors stay internally coherent—no mixed aquatic/arboreal clashes. Occasional simultaneity hiccup: “She rolled the hangman’s dice one final time, watching how they fell—a sequence she’d orchestrated...” implies dice-throw and retrospective orchestration occur together; a micro-fix (“and saw”) would clarify. Artifacts never tangle the closure beat, so high-band remains valid.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The fusion of cryptographic escape with underwater ballet feels inevitable yet fresh; the dice-as-dance-key idea is a genuinely non-obvious twist on standard prison-break tropes. Risk is taken and paid off: lyrical accumulation replaces conventional action reversals, trusting reader to assemble the pattern. Specificity—“velocity seven” equates to arm angle, “sediment crystalline” to knuckle sequence—prevents concept from floating into abstraction. Transformation test passes: swap marine or musical frame and the entire scaffolding collapses.</comment>
