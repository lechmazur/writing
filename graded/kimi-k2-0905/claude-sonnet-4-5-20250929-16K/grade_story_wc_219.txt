<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Kira’s skepticism is credibly luminous—every beat filters the alien enigma through disciplined doubt, culminating in the kneel-and-formula moment. The “artificial pilgrimage” motive is dramatized by micro-choices (climb, descent, tactile contact with amber) rather than label-speak. Emotional arc moves from detached experiment to embodied recognition without tidy epiphany; the cost is the foreclosed option of remaining a detached observer. Interiority stays concrete, though a few phrases (“something crack open inside her chest”) edge toward cliché and keep this just shy of 8+ territory.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the rain, amber, footprints, and chemical formula accrete into a pattern that reweights “homecoming” as self-recognition. Closure is Conceptual Repricing: the equation scratched in dust makes the conceptual cost undeniable—the scientific paradigm she lived by is now a map of her own neural circuitry. Orientation is clean within 120 words; tower, spring rain, and alien contact are anchored immediately. One causality bump: the footprints appear “impossible” yet are instantly accepted without testing or doubt, a tiny motivational slack that nicks the top band.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Tower and garden are sketched with selective sensorial economy—dripping eaves, bronze quiet, moss-ghosted saints—each detail filtering Kira’s scientific gaze. Micro-setting (the dried fountain convergence point) literally constrains her final bodily stance and becomes the slate for the chemical formula; this satisfies the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography is immaculate: staircase descent, footprint tracking, kneel at center are tracked without drift. One minor lapse: “reddish dust” is introduced only when needed for the formula; earlier foreshadow of its color would sharpen specificity.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can alien science decode her own exile?—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens when the footprints emerge as empirical evidence she must parse. Escalation is textural: each new environmental layer (rain, dust, formula) reweights the same stake rather than pivoting plot. The tightening beat is the footprint discovery: it collapses observer/subject distance, forcing her to become the data point. Cost is legible but soft: intellectual surrender rather than concrete loss; this keeps it just below 8.8+ territory.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: homecoming as chemical self-recognition, not nostalgia. The amber fly is a perfect, returning image that reweights from curiosity to mirror. Subtext operates in silence—no dialogue, only footprints and weather—allowing reader space. Final image avoids moralizing; the formula “remains” implies universe-level law, not homily, giving resonance without pronouncement.</question>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person interiority sustains a scientist’s cool perceptual signature: pollen records, neural receptor sites, oxidation of memory. Syntax is controlled, rhythmic, slightly elevated but consistent with academic exile; no head-hopping. Filter verbs (“she realized”) are minimal and voice-motivated. One register drift: “homecoming as a chemical process” is alien exposition—could have been rendered through Kira’s interpretive paraphrase for tighter POV purity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is lean, high-density, no paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or concept. Metaphors are spare and precise—“rainwashed and gleaming,” “bronze quiet”—never clogging the narrow word count. Opening line hooks voice and stakes; final line resolves by image (formula remains) that recharges tower/amber motifs. Minor rhythmic repetition of “she could feel” twice in final third, but it occurs outside the closure beat and does not obscure causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Familiar alien-contact scaffold is inverted: gift is not weapon or wisdom but a method to read oneself. Choice to stage return as staged experiment freshens exile trope; synthesis of molecular neuroscience with mystical homecoming feels specific to this narrator. Risk is taken in quiet, lyric mode rather than spectacle—coherence intact. Does not quite reach 9+ because the conceptual turn, while elegant, is telegraphed early and lacks a secondary twist.</comment>
