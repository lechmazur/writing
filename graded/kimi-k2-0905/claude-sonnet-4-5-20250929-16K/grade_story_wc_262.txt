<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Marina’s interior contradiction—yearning to witness love yet fearing its weight—surfaces early and drives every tactile choice, but the final renunciation feels slightly under-causal; we’re told “she understood” rather than watching the micro-moments that tip her from collector to transmitter. Still, her embodied reactions to the celluloid (palms stinging, throat humming) keep emotion specific and non-diagnostic. The flaw that keeps her from 8+ territory: the climactic decision to thread and project arrives without a visible, on-page trade-off or new risk that makes the cost bite.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens is clear from the first paragraph and holds: each strip discovered layers density until the projector release provides the decisive cadence shift. Orientation is swift—who, where, when anchored by line 4—and causality stays intact (she touches → feels → chooses). The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration/Charged Poise: the booth fills with light that re-weights every earlier artifact. Only a micro-gap: the projector switch-on is narrated, not dramatized, so the “felt cost” is luminous but not bodily, keeping it just under 8.8.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The projection booth is rendered through hot-metal scent and sprocket-hole ache; every object (film strip, rewinder, aperture plate) is handled and gains emotional charge. Micro-setting triumph: the celluloid itself becomes geography—gaps between frames serve as chambers where love incubates, directly enabling the final act. Spatial choreography stays clean as Marina crawls, spreads, threads. Lacks a 9-push only because weather/outside city remains default-thunder wallpaper rather than feeding back into her choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—liberating unused love—signals in paragraph two and tightens once: from cataloguing to releasing. The tightening is meaningful (she forgoes private communion for public projection), but the price is poetic rather than practical: no external obstacle or finite resource is risked, so cost is legible but not materially scaled. Still, agency is hers; escalation under Accumulative lens satisfies.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</question><comment>Theme emerges without dictation: unspoken love does not die, it metastasizes into art. The goodbye-letter concept migrates from metaphor to literal light on screen, a conceptual repricing that re-weights every prior strip. Final image avoids moral lesson, offering instead the open-ended possibility that future strangers may receive the projection—ambiguity that invites reflection. Dock 0.3 for a faint platitude (“love that would now never entirely fade”), else 9.0.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet disciplined: rhythmic parallelism (“each frame a word, each reel a sentence”) is taught early and paid off at closure. Perceptual signature is consistent—Marina’s synesthetic metaphors (love humming like struck tuning fork) never leak into academic register. Filter verbs are few and earned; diction stays within her plausible lexicon. No dialogue, so no convergence risk.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</question><comment>Prose is dense but breathable: single sentences carry sensory, emotional, and conceptual freight. No scaffold loops or mixed metaphors; even complex figuration (“snow that would never melt” for dust) stays physically coherent. Occasional elevated phrasing (“spatially imaginative farewells”) is justified by the concept piece and pattern-taught. Final third is artifact-free, allowing high-band entry.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The psychometric projectionist who midwives orphaned love into light is a fresh synthesis; familiar tropes (abandoned theatre, psychic touch) are re-cast through cinematic metaphysics. Specificity of “twenty-four goodbyes per second” and the notion that emotion can soak into celluloid acetate feels inevitable in hindsight. Concept commits fully without late rule changes. Lacks the extra risk-flip or moral surprise that would push 9.0.</comment>
