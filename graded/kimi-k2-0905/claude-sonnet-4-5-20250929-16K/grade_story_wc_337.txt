<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mara’s tremoring hands, cracked mask, and vocational failure are concrete and embodied; her interior contradiction—restoring others while irreparable herself—drives every micro-choice. The decision to “drive the needle deep” is earned by the boy’s confession and her own stored silences, with visible cost: she adds another hollow quiet to her ribs. Relationship pressure is absent (only the ghost-boy), yet her self-conflict functions as crucible. Voice drifts once into diagnostic speak (“accumulates silence the way others collected scars”) but overall she remains a specific, flawed agent.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the boy’s release crystallizes Mara’s endless, self-damaging service under the accumulative/textural lens. Causality holds: each loosened knot literally exhumes a voice, tightening her own burden. Cost is legible in the final line—“she added it to her collection”—a charged poise that forecloses rest. No orientation debt; prism sanctuary, starlight, and vault are anchored by word 80.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prism sanctuary fractures starlight into “nervous colors,” an immediate sensory filter that later recharges the final image of her mask reflecting the same light. The salt-stiff net’s knot-by-knot resistance constrains her trembling hands and paces the beat-level action. Spatial choreography stays clean: vault → center → cliff above. Environment does not merely backdrop; its optical fragmentation mirrors the splintering of drowned voices and Mara’s own broken sightline through the mask’s missing eye.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—free the boy or leave him muffled—surfaces in line 4 and tightens when his patricidal truth emerges. Mara’s agency is iterative: each needle insertion narrows her own future silence, a felt price. Escalation is accumulative rather than causal-reversal; the final stab is a cadence shift, not a new turn. Cost is visible (heavier internal quiet), though secondary spirits remain off-stage, keeping pressure slightly abstract.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the motif of repaired/repairer: mending the dead breaks the living. Subtext lives in gesture—silver wire pulled through salt rope equalsvoice pulled through time. No moral sermon; the ending image simply reweights silence from absence to burden. The boy’s truth that a living brother still remembers complicates any redemptive reading, leaving plausible counter-readings intact.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Mara’s perceptual bias: starlight is “nervous,” net fibers “resist, then yield.” Syntax mirrors her shaky control—short, clause-fragments under pressure (“Her hands trembled. They always did now.”). No head-hopping; ghost-boy’s dialogue is external data she parses. Prism, porcelain, and salt-stiff rope diction stays within her restoration lexicon; voice never lapses into editorial explanation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence detected. Figurative layers (“interlaced hush,” “unfallen snow”) are sparse and tied to pressure, avoiding purple drift. Information density high: one line can advance action, reveal texture, and foreshadow cost (“each knot held a voice, a memory, a death”). Minor scaffold: “She understood then” could be cut, but it occupies low-stakes beat; closure line is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Premise—restorer of broken masks who unmakes nets to free ghosts—feels fresh yet inevitable. Salt-net as memory lattice is specific; not interchangeable with generic ghost-story props. Risk lies in lyric compression and quiet ending, but coherence holds. No close echoes of famous scenes; sibling murder via drowning and sixty-year guilt twist grow from established particulars.</comment>
