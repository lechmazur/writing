<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Adelaide’s interiority is vivid and specific—her “orbit of regret” and telescope-dome metaphors give her a distinct perceptual signature. The contradictory impulse to protect vs. expose her grandfather is dramatized in two beats: pocketing the nib as relic, then re-purposing it as evidence. Micro-choices (whispering “assume,” descending the stairs) embody the shift. The final renunciation carries visible cost—family credibility sacrificed for truth—earning the change.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: journalist’s call → contradiction exercise → decision to publish. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the nib’s meaning flips from legacy to evidence, social cost legible in “damage your family’s credibility.” One soft spot: the 1980s-photo forensics are told more than shown, but the contradiction method is dramatized twice, anchoring the turn. Orientation clean by line 10.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Observatory dome functions as micro-setting: acoustic echo mirrors inner chaos, aperture light frames the nib inspection, spiral stairs mark the moral descent. Cloud-sea vista supplies tonal lift at end. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible moves. “Rosewood pen nib” acts as portable setting extension, its vintage grain bridging eras. Weather/cloud shift is symbolic but timed with decision beat, earning its place.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—truth vs. family mythology—signaled in paragraph 2. Escalation tightens once: Chen’s proof collapses inherited innocence, forcing public recant. Cost is explicit: “damage your family’s credibility” and the metaphoric fall from cloud sanctuary to city lights. No artificial reversals; single meaningful turn suffices for 700-word scope.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from concrete pattern: orbits as inherited lies vs. stellar honesty. Nib’s reweighted meaning and Adelaide’s “fall back to earth” reprise the astronomical motif without authorial statement. Final image—evening star on honest orbit—offers non-literal answer: truth cycles on, untarnished by human betrayal. No moralizing, only resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</question>
<comment>Free indirect style sustains Adelaide’s filtered diction: “echoing dome,” “half-remembered lies.” Syntax lengthens under reflection, tightens during “Show me.” No head-hop; journalist’s dialogue carries subtext (“damage your family’s credibility” = threat + invitation). Filter verbs used sparingly and voice-motivated. Rhythm modulates with emotional altitude.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</question>
<comment>High information density: sentences carry double duty (“rosewood nib… bearing traces… editorial”). Varied sentence openers; no template cadence. Metaphors stay coherent (orbits/clouds). One paraphrase loop—“echoing dome… acoustic mirror”—but spaced 200 words apart, so momentum intact. Proofreading clean; no typos or tense slips.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</question>
<comment>Fresh inflection: using formal-logic “proof by contradiction” as emotional heuristic inside a family-myth exposé. Nib-as-evidence twist feels inevitable yet not telegraphed. Observatory-as-confessional is familiar trope, but acoustic-echo device and star-closure reweight it. Risk is moderate; no structural gimmicks, yet angle is memorable.</comment>
