<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Maya’s interiority is textured—grief embodied as “sudden weightlessness,” micro-choices like accepting the punch—but the guides remain functional archetypes; their “quiet wisdom” is stated, not dramatized, so relationship-as-crucible is absent. The final renunciation is credible because the vigil years are shown first, yet the moment of handing over the punch feels externally bestowed rather than wrested from contradiction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each star stamps a memory-layer, tightening the pattern until the card glows. Closure lands as Charged Poise—Maya sees the path “visible now, each stone distinct”—a reconfiguration of options with felt cost: she must now guide others. No orientation lapse; fog functions as taught disorientation that clears at payoff.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The veiled ridgeway remains postcard-fog until the final paragraph, where “each stone distinct” finally charges the image; until then, setting is atmospheric backdrop rather than tactical constraint. The brass punch serves as micro-setting and recurrent object, handled in every beat, so meets the 9+ gate even if landscape does not.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—permission to reclaim her own courage—is clear early. Escalation is accumulative: each stamp deepens the cost of the life already lived rather than narrowing future options; the seventh star crystallizes meaning but does not create new tactical pressure. No visible price is paid on the descent; the punch transfer is gift, not trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges inductively from the seven stars as quiet inventory of caregiving sacrifice; no explicit thesis is stated. The final image of “a new song hummed low across the water” reweights vigil into forward motion with earned lyric resonance, avoiding sentimentality. Subtext in guide dialogue—“the strongest thing was simply remaining”—is cleanly indirect.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Third-person lyric remains close to Maya’s perceptual filter: fog as “patient threshold,” stars as “map, promise, song.” Rhythm modulates from long clause spirals to staccato “Each stamp is a star,” mirroring ascent. Guides’ dialogue stays archetypal but cadenced like shoreline lullaby, consistent with tale-telling register; no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Lines carry double duty: “seventeen years…brilliant mind dim by degrees” compresses time and loss without scaffold. Occasional gentle abstractions—“the quiet closing of a bedroom door”—are compensated by sensory specificity of brass punch clicks and “sea-smoothed stones.” No mixed metaphors or loops; final hummed song is crisp closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Familiar “grief hike with spirit guides” is refreshed by star-ticket bookkeeping as quantified inventory of caregiving labor; the punch-as-constellation-map is a specific的新鲜 twist. Risk is moderate—quiet lyric rather than dramatic reversal—but coherence justifies the choice. Transformation test passes: the vigil years and stamp system are inseparable from this telling.</comment>
