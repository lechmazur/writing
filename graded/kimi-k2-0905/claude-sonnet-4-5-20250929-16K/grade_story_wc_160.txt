<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elena’s vocation and moral compass stay consistent; her micro-choices (palm on stone, ash-and-water test, three-day restoration) all flow from the same practical ingenuity. Interiority is concrete, never abstract—“paper trembled…fragile as hope” shows felt cost. The absence of on-page opposition dulls status friction, but her solitary problem-solving still forces a visible renunciation of simpler, zero-sum fixes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal chain is clean: empty envelope → adhesive analysis → 22-ft measurement → valve discovery → shared flow. Closure lands on the page with undeniable cost—ancestral compromise revealed, distrust dissolved, water re-allocated—and the lens holds. The “Compassion flows both ways” clue is the sole overt thematic echo, but it is dramatized, not sermonizing.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The amphitheater’s breathing stone is not backdrop; thermal expansion is the ticking clock that paces Elena’s labor and signals equilibrium achieved. Spatial choreography is precise—steps into orchestra, descent into channel, sixty-six feet of chain. Volcanic setting constrains her toolkit and provides the ash she mixes to decrypt the message, qualifying for the 9+ tool-use gate even if not quite a 9.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—balance flood protection with irrigation—locks in early and tightens through each beat. Turning the hidden valve narrows options from “either/or” to an enforced “both,” with visible price measured in sweat, time, and ancestral risk. Pressure never spikes dramatically, yet the single tightening choice is irrevocable and scales to village survival.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Theme of encrypted compassion emerges through engineered stone and hidden valve rather than statement. The reweighted surveyor’s chain—ornament turned key—mirrors societal rift turned cooperation. Final image of unified elders reframes prior conflict without moral summary, achieving Charged Poise.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays anchored to Elena’s perceptions; no head-hop. Diction—“microscopically,” “orchestra,” “thermal cycles”—mirrors a machinist’s precision without leaving her lexicon. Rhythm stretches for description, compresses for action, supporting pressure cleanly; no dialogue means no voice-drift penalty.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty—description braided with action—and avoid synonym loops. Occasional elevated phrasing (“shadows dappled…”) fits atmospheric opening, then yields to sparser mechanics. No mixed metaphors, no filter stacks; closure sentence (“building breathed, steady and eternal”) lands with cadence earned, not forced.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Flood-engineering mystery inside a volcanic amphitheater freshens classic “divide-the-water” conflict. The decrypt-by-adhesive method feels novel yet plausible for the vocation. While harmonizing villages recycles a familiar moral arc, the mechanical bypass and encoded ancestor twist lift the piece above template territory.</comment>
