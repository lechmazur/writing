<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira’s color-blindness and “innocently cunning” trait are shown through concrete bargaining and plant-messaging, not labels; her interiority is textured and drives every beat. Fen’s sleepwalking stagnation and final micro-choice to fetch the “failed” vase are believable, but his emotional shift feels compressed—one silent look at paintings and he pivots. The barter pact lands with mutual cost (her time, his lifetime habit), satisfying earned change. Still, the relationship crucible is under-pressed: status barely tilts, and Fen’s voice never fully separates from Mira’s poetic cadence.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the bent reed’s warbling note and Fen’s promise to “fill this courtyard with beautiful failures” reweight the premise with visible social cost under an Accumulative lens. Causality holds: plant message → Fen’s recognition → vase exchange → new pact. Orientation is swift (courtyard at dusk, post-phoenix ash). No plot amnesia or soft resets. The single tightening beat suffices for 700-word scope, though the reed’s prior setup could be slightly earlier to tighten escalation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Ash-flecked cobblestones, twisted glass, and the reed’s tactile ridges are filtered through Mira’s haptic bias; colorblind POV justifies sensory selectivity. The courtyard constrains choreography: plants arranged along perimeter, reed placed center, Fen’s exit from kiln—space stays coherent. Weather (fading light) times the final exchange. Glassblower craft details are minimal but accurate and choice-relevant. The micro-setting of the reed-as-object charges the closing image, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—awaken Fen or leave him ossified—is signaled in paragraph four. Pressure escalates via accumulative pattern: each plant element adds social scrutiny; the reed’s imperfect note provides the single deepening that crystallizes Fen’s stance. Cost is legible: Fen publicly abandons forty years of “perfection,” Mira risks her most prized tool. No coincidence resolves; the reversal is triggered by Mira’s deliberate reed gesture. Sufficient for 700 words, though a mid-scene obstacle could have sharpened tension further.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of “beauty in flaw” emerges through glass spiral, reed warp, and color-blind sight—never sermonized. Final image of “beautiful failures” reweights earlier perfectionism without moralizing. Subtext in plant lexicon lets readers decode urgency/contemplation alongside Fen. Ambiguity remains: we feel the cost of abandoning perfection but aren’t told it’s morally superior. No thematic echo in final paragraph. The concept integrates with character arc rather than riding on abstract phoenix metaphor alone.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-limited stays locked to Mira’s perceptual field—gray world, texture focus, sound of reed. Syntax mirrors her measured rhythm: long reflective sentences, punctuated by tactile verbs (“traced,” “pressed”). Fen’s dialogue is spare, older craftsman idiom (“I don’t understand these games”), distinct from Mira’s lyric interior. No filter-verb stacks or head-hopping. Reed’s “warbling note” recurs with consistent sonic description. Voice modulation under stress: final line short, sprig added—quiet cadence shift signals closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, varied sentence length, strong verbs (“scattering ash,” “weathered hands”). No paraphrase loops or mixed metaphors. Figurative language sparse and purposeful: “architecture of memory” fits Mira’s spatial mind. One minor scaffold: “perfect symmetry, its absolute uniformity” could compress, but it doesn’t stall momentum. No artifacts in final third. Dialogue tags minimal, punctuation correct. Opening line anchors stakes; final line offers image-based resolution.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Color-blind painter who trades awakenings for barter, using plant code and a damaged reed, feels fresh; trope of phoenix rebirth is subordinated to her haptic aesthetic. Barter conceit avoids generic gift economy; imperfect glass vase twist is specific to glassblower craft. Conceptual integrity maintained—no late rule changes. Risk is moderate: quiet, lyric resolution rather than spectacle. Could edge higher with sharper occupational detail or deeper glass-craft flaw taxonomy, but synthesis remains memorable.</comment>
