<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus’s contradictory pull toward the ridge and away from his father’s guilt is viscerally embodied; the porcelain box as tactile memory anchors every micro-choice. The final “I choose it knowingly” crystallizes the inherited bargain with cost felt in his scarred hand. Only minor slippage: the leap from reading the journals to total comprehension feels one beat rushed, blunting the full force of contradiction at climax.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis—returning the box reweights the entire lineage of bargains and carries undeniable conceptual cost. Causal lens holds: father’s self-offer → town saved → son’s inherited debt → son’s conscious acceptance, each step legible. The ridge and celestial return create a tight chronological loop that tightens rather than teleports. No orientation debt; spatial–temporal anchors are clear by word 80.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Moonlight on fracture lines, the Douglas fir as terminus, and the cracked box as micro-setting all constrain Marcus’s decision path and charge the final image. Sensory triage is firefighter-precise: visual fracture, kinesthetic ridge slope, thermal memory of scorched skin. Only the valley lights flicker toward postcard, but they serve as counter-image to the ember motif, so allowance granted.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“will Marcus repeat or repossess the bargain?”—is signaled by the first paragraph’s celestial clock. Tightening occurs when he traces the porcelain words and realizes the cyclical price; option space narrows to conscious continuation or paternal burnout. Cost is visible: the scarred hand that will keep taking burns. Agency drives the turn; no coincidence rescues him.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from iterated fire-to-hand translations rather than thesis: sacrifice is a first-degree burn you keep choosing. Subtext lives in the empty box once filled with flowers—grief as negative space. Final line’s “syntax of survival” reconfigures prior material without moralizing. Only withheld from 9+ because the therapist’s “pain journals” label edges toward echo.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Marcus’s firefighter sensorium—fractures read as lightning, time tracked by planetary orbit. Syntax lengthens under reflection, shortens during ridge descent, mirroring respiratory rhythm. No head-hop; celestial bodies remain external, indifferent counter-voice. Phrase “hard softness” repeats with accrued tonality, proving deliberate modulation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies: caesurae in “trading skin for salvation, trading truth for peace” echo heartbeat cadence. No scaffold loops; each sentence advances image or stake. Metaphors stay coherent—moonlight as silver, grief as negative space—without mixed spillage. Minor density spike in “topography of trauma,” but it’s earned by prior burn description.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Bargained innocence reframed as intergenerational scar tissue feels fresh against familiar firefighting backdrop. Celestial return every thirty years fused with porcelain heirloom creates a bespoke cosmology rather than trope check-box. Risk taken: almost no on-screen fire, yet heat persists as memory economy. Slight proximity to “pulling a child from fire” rescue cliché keeps it from 8.8.</comment>
