<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is textured—her fingers tasting static, her refusal to leave the dead city—but her contradiction (clinging to endings as beginnings) is stated more than dramatized. The decisive shift to “listening to silence” is prepared yet feels slightly teleological; the cost of abandoning old methods is named, not embodied. No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible absent. Still, her perceptual signature is consistent and the final renunciation carries credible weight.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Single-scene arc lands a clean Conceptual Repricing: the “shard of hush” reweights the premise—silence is the true signal—visible in the final image of Mira smiling at dawn, grid still dead, city still swaying. Causal chain is accumulative/textural: pattern of tuning deeper into valleys rather than peaks; no abrupt reversals, but the stakes tighten when the moon lens focuses the cosmic hum. Orientation anchored by word 80 (“abandoned radio tower city…”). Closure cost is conceptual yet felt: she forecloses the old interpretive paradigm. Minor slack: fragment’s agency leans toward magical convenience.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Selective sensory economy—copper housing, groan of cables, moonlight filtering through broken windows—grounds the tower as both cradle and antenna. The gorge’s invisible depth mirrors the unseeable cosmic depth she tunes into, charging the final image. No spatial contradictions; weather (lunar perigee) is causal, not garnish. Micro-setting (hollywood fragment) constrains the tuning action and returns reweighted.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—decode the universe’s true voice—tightens when she swaps peak-seeking for valley-seeking; the lunar perigee acts as live clock, intensifying the signal and narrowing her options. Escalation is textural: each paragraph deepens the silence rather than forcing external reversals. Cost is conceptual but legible: she abandons the professional identity that kept her here. No external antagonist, yet the pressure of cosmic indifference feels coherent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: abandonment as revelation, endings as frequency shifts. The hollywood star’s transformation from billboard glamour to cosmic conduit reprises the idea without overt statement. Final image—city swaying, cradle-like—offers quiet, non-moral repricing: human broadcast dreams were always dwarfed by stellar breath. No tidy maxim; ambiguity lingers in the unanswerable vastness she now serves.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lyrical, faintly archaic diction—“serenely electric,” “taste the earth’s breath”—suits a solitary signal-priestess. Rhythm swells and subsides with the signal cascade, mirroring her attention. No dialogue, so voice convergence absent. Filter verbs minimal; perception stays embodied. Distinctive metaphoric register is sustained without purple drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>High information density: one sentence often layers sensory, emotional, and conceptual work (“fragment…still held traces of celestial iron, making it perfect…”). Occasional soft abstract noun stacks (“the architecture of spacetime itself”) slightly dilute peak beats, but metaphor logic stays consistent. No loops or scaffold. Final paragraph’s cadence repetition (“Every ending promised…”) reads intentional, not artifact.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Collapses urban-exploration, cosmic-horror, and eco-poetics into a fresh synthesis: the abandoned broadcast tower as radio-telescope for the big-bang’s lullaby. Hollywood star fragment repurposed as alien tuner is a specific, irreplicable hinge; remove it and the entire concept fractures. Risk—lyric abstraction—pays off by crystallizing awe rather than exposition. No close echoes of prior stories; the shard-of-silence reversal feels inevitable yet unforeseen.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Setup: first paragraph labels her; Development: she actively retunes equipment and abandons peak-seeking method; Closure: her smile accepts the cosmic hush as vocation—three gates met. Cost visible: she forfeits former interpretive identity. Specificity high—no synonym for “celestial signal interpreter” could swap without breaking logic.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Present in opening beat (handling, copper housing), middle (warms under intent), and closure (records its translation). Enables the valley-tuning tactic and returns reweighted as cosmic listener rather than celebrity relic. Removing it collapses both plot mechanism and thematic repricing.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Concept drives the stake: silence as signal. Shapes middle tactic—discard assumptions, tune for hush—and lands the conceptual repricing at dawn. Not merely thematic echo; it redefines her job description on page.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>“Serenely electric” appears once as descriptor for cosmic tone; not a constraint but a mood filter. Swappable adjective pair would lose nuance yet not break causality. Serves atmospheric specificity more than tactical function.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>“Tune” verb recurs across three beats, marking each shift in method (peaks → valleys → silence). Action is causal, not ornamental; without retuning, no discovery. Specific enough to resist synonym swap.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Method signaled early (“Tonight, she would find her answer by discarding assumptions entirely”) and mechanics matter: she retunes for valleys, not peaks. Drives the middle turn and enables the hush discovery. Could swap phrasing but the discard-and-invert logic is structurally essential.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Setting supplies the swaying-cradle image that closes the story and the cable-groan texture that underpins atmosphere. Provides the only place where a copper-fragment tuner can resonate without grid power. Yet the gorge depth remains backgrounded; it pressures choice philosophically rather than physically.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade>
<comment>Lunar perigee is named early and intensifies the signal, creating a live clock (“as dawn approached and the moon began its retreat”). Timeframe alters tactics—she must record before retreat—but doesn’t tighten to the second; functions as window, not countdown.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Motivation frames every paragraph; micro-choices (stay, retune, record) enact the desire to find beginnings inside endings. Final smile crystallizes the stance with visible cost—she accepts endless listening as her new beginning. Drives the arc without overt statement in closure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Tone fuses pragmatic tech detail (copper housing, satellite chatter) with lyrical cosmic awe. Modulates under pressure: speculative wonder intensifies as silence blooms, yet stays grounded in tactile handling of gear. Charges the final cradle-image, reconciling fantasy vastness with lived practicality.</comment>
