<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Elena’s interiority is vivid—her academic skepticism collides with bodily disorientation in the garden, and the arrowhead’s edge against her thumb replays her intellectual pivot. The phone-call from her dead mother is the single allowed reflective dump; it tilts her present choice and lands cost—she pockets the antenna, renouncing reportage for conversion. Magda’s pressure as gate-keeper is crisp, but Magda herself remains functional rather than contradictory. The refusal is earned, yet we do not feel the price on Elena's career or identity beyond the symbolic gesture.</comment>

<comment>Causal chain holds: vanished townsfolk → garden phone → Elena’s mother → Elena’s renunciation. Orientation anchors by line 5; no penalty. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—upward snow re-weights the entire premise with undeniable surreal cost. One transition (surface → garden) is legible; lens stays causal throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The underground garden is not backdrop; its impossible gravitic vines literally steer Elena’s sensory disorientation and decide where she plants the confession pot. The copper-wrapped phone and bioluminescent moss are tools that constrain the only means of contact. Micro-setting (arrowhead among roots) is gripped in a choice beat and reappears in closure pocket. One minor slip: “snow falling upward” final image is conceptually charged but not pre-seeded in spatial layout, barely missing 9.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—whether to expose or join the harmony—surfaces early and tightens when Elena hears her mother’s post-mortem voice. The tightening is single but decisive: information vs. allegiance; she pays by pocketing the antenna, visibly foreclosing the expose-path. Pressure is coherent under causal lens; no artificial reversals. Cost is legible but understated—career/identity consequences are implied rather than felt on the skin.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: pain transformed when released, not solved. The phone confessions dramatize this without authorial thesis. Final image of upward snow re-prices the concept—cosmic joke literalized—rather than moralizing. No motif is imposed; the arrowhead and garden particulars carry the idea.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-limited voice is steady, with character-specific perceptual tilt—Elena clocks botanical impossibilities like an illustrator, not a lyric mystic. Syntax tightens under pressure: “Tears froze…in the garden’s strange microclimate” compresses physiology and setting. Dialogue is sparse but carries subtext (Magda’s frostbitten hope). No head-hop; diction stays within Elena's observational lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, information-dense: “moisture beading on limestone walls” does triple scene-setting work. No scaffold loops; metaphors are consistent (gravity, sound, light). Filter verbs appear only when voice-motivated. Opening and closing lines function as sonic bookends—descent vs. ascent—without overwriting. Minor intensifier “strange” could be cut, but it does not blunt closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fusion of cryptid tale with cosmic transformation metaphor feels fresh; reversal that the creature solves us reframes standard investigative plot. Specificity—copper-wrapped antenna, gravitic vine—grounds the surreal premise. Upward snow image is an inevitable-yet-surprising payoff. Risk is present but not self-indulgent; concept commits fully.</comment>
