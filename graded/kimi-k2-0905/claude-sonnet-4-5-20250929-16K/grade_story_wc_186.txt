<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mera’s custodian role is lived-in—her ritual of sweeping star-paths onto glass with diamond dust is tactile and obsessive—but her internal contradiction (retrocognitive visions vs. present isolation) is summarized rather than dramatized in scene. The “shard of hush” moment is the only beat where her body and choice visibly collide; everywhere else we are told her certainty rather than shown its cost. The ending’s Earned Stasis is credible because she forfeits the last silence she possessed, but the micro-choices that earn it arrive in a single paragraph. Still, the hierarchy of values (pattern over survival) is legible and idiosyncratic enough to feel individual, not archetype.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each motif (hum, crack, star map, thistle seed) layers density until the repaired prism reweights the dominant stake—meaning survives collapse. The closure is a clean Charged Poise: the instant the fracture seals, the pavilion’s hum harmonizes and the future beam is promised, with the conceptual cost that Mera’s own silence is now gone. Orientation is anchored by word 80 (“glass humming pavilion”), well inside the 120-word waiver window. One soft spot: the engineers’ whispered phrase “shard of hush” is imported without prior textual seed, a micro convenience that keeps the score sub-9.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The pavilion is more than postcard: its glass walls vibrate at a frequency that literally narrows Mera’s auditory perception, and the star-aligned crack in the prism functions as a celestial lock that must be physically matched—setting as puzzle. Micro-setting triumphs: the silk cushion, diamond-dust star charts, and the moment her shadow’s heart marks the dig-site are all handled, not observed. Thistle seeds clinging to vibrating glass fuse atmosphere with theme (hope needs a crack). Only the wasteland beyond remains generically “ashy,” but the story never needs to go there; the pavilion’s interior is the crucible.</comment>

<question>4</question><question>8.2</question><comment>The dominant stake—“prove coincidence is meaning”—is signaled in paragraph 5 and tightens when celestial geometry literally snaps the prism shut. The price is conceptual but legible: Mera sacrifices her literal silence (the shard) to let the tower speak again, foreclosing her withdrawal from a world that may never answer. No antagonist is required; the pressure is the universe’s indifference, and the reversal is that the pattern finally answers back. One escalation beat suffices here, and it lands with felt cost under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the iterative image set: vibration/crack/seed—all variants of “narrow aperture through which meaning can penetrate.” The closing image of light blooming “beyond herself” reweights the opening assertion that coincidences are just disguised meaning, now shown as a literal beam rather than a thesis. No moral is stated; the resonance is in the inversion—her private obsession becomes a public signal. The refusal to promise survivors keeps the theme taut and unsentimental.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person omniscient stays modest, rarely exceeding Mera’s perceptual reach; the one line “others would call it coincidence” is an allowable generalization because it defines her pariah status. Syntax flexes with pressure—short parataxis during prism insertion, longer sinewy sentences during star tracking—creating a rhythmic signature. No dialogue, so voice distinction is evaluated through interior diction: “retrocognitively blessed” is academic residue she clings to, marking her pre-collapse identity without overt label-speak. The glass hum becomes a metronome that modulates sentence cadence, a literal prosodic device.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is loop-free, with high double-duty density: “thistle seeds blew against the glass…tiny parachutes of hope seeking purchase” fuses metaphor, weather, and theme in one stroke. No mixed metaphors; the crack’s geometry stays physically consistent with star triangulation. Register remains within Mera’s salvage-world lexicon—no latinate overreach. Final line “hope, like thistle seeds, required only the smallest crack” is a deliberate echo, not a template, because it re-crackles the repaired prism. Alliteration is sparse and purposeful, never clogging forward motion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of post-collapse solipsist astronomer-custodian who uses broken star maps to re-ignite an extinct beacon is fresh; no familiar trope set carries this exact emotional math. The “shard of hush” literalizes silence into a manipulable object without reading like videogame loot because its discovery is tied to her own shadow’s geometry. Risk is taken in the lyric repetition of “coincidence,” but the pattern teaches the reader early and pays off optically. Transformation test fails only if you rename, proving the concept is inseparable from Mera’s idiosyncratic cosmology.</comment>
