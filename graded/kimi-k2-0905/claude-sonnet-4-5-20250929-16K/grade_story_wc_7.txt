<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara’s trait‐anchor (chef‐taster of memories) is vivid in the greenhouse, her pruning micro-choices track, and her final smile shows earned poise, but her interiority drifts into abstract “knowledge/hope” language (“taste of determination,” “recipe of hope”) rather than concrete palate-images under pressure; the contradiction is latent, not dramatized in-scene, so the arc feels observed rather than tasted.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Single causal thread holds: seed-plant → moon-fed surge → prune → fruit. Closure lands as Charged Poise—the greenhouse reborn as “beginning” with visible cost (her warm shears, moons parting). Orientation is clear by line 4. The over-cranked metaphor chain (“synaptic roots,” “neural pathways,” “proto-roots”) slightly blurs the physical logic of how pruning alters memory-feed, keeping it below elite-band precision.</comment>

<comment>The rusted greenhouse is tactile—glass shards, corroded frames, warm shears—mirrors the internal state and literally supports the stakes (“access to soil memories”). Three-moon light functions as both ticking clock and atmospheric filter. Micro-setting (shears, seed, soil) constrains every beat; no 9-band only because the moon alignment itself is described generically rather than through sensory specificity that could charge the final image further.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—clandestine restoration of banned knowledge—tightens once: Council threat → moon-window → irrevocable fruit. Agency is continuous pruning; each snip forecloses a toxic memory, narrowing future options toward the “beautiful” strain. Cost is legible: she forfeits anonymity and risks Council reprisal (“tomorrow, someone would taste”). Escalation is linear rather than a sharp reversal, adequate for 700-word scale.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: horticulture of memory = stewardship of collective truth. Subtext lives in the pruning cuts—“cruelty,” “willful ignorance” silently dropped—showing curation as political act. Final image of fruit gleaming in separating moons reweights earlier burned orchards without moralizing. One abstract line (“knowledge can’t grow wild”) nudges toward thesis-statement, keeping it shy of 9.0.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person close maintains steady psychic distance, filter verbs minimal. Diction is culinary–garden hybrid (“taste of metallic determination,” “synapses firing”) giving distinctive texture. No dialogue, so voice cohesion rests on narration, which modulates from wistful to urgent; final sentence lands quiet triumph. Occasional elevated register (“proto-roots,” “conceptual cost”) slightly drifts from grounded chef palate but remains legible.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is largely clean, rhythmic, high-density; sentences do double duty. Metaphor chain around “synaptic/plasticity/neural” repeats four times without new payoff, creating mild template cadence (−0.3). Opening and closing lines carry image-ear punch. No loops or scaffold beyond that cluster; clarity intact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: memory-gardening + gustatory synesthesia + synaptic botany feels inevitable in hindsight. Pruning as controlled revolution is non-obvious angle on rebellion trope. Specific lived detail (rusted frame, warm shears) grounds concept. Risk taken with “synaptic fruit” pseudo-science; partial over-explanation keeps it below top band, but transformation is evident.</comment>
