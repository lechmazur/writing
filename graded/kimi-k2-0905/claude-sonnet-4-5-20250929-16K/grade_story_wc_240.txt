<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mira’s spatial gift and grief-hardened vigilance are shown through laser-tracked air currents and the quiet calculus of breach points; the contradiction between her rule-bound job and her empathy for Marcus is embodied, not declared. The final choice—to open the farm rather than prosecute—pays off an earlier causal seed: her own recovery via relationship, not isolation. Interiority stays concrete (“seeing James everywhere… in the negative space where he should have been”) and avoids therapy-speak. Only the moment of recognition with Marcus edges toward tidy symmetry, keeping this just outside the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lattice holds: laser trace → hidden gap → Marcus revealed → Mira’s gate-opening decision, each step tightening options under a Situational lens. Closure is a Charged Poise: “we both need to leave this cave” crystallizes the new social contract and carries conceptual cost—her job security now depends on the man she once tracked. Time, place, and agency are anchored within 120 words; no orientation debt. The only hairline slip is a single explanatory line (“the mushrooms work through relationship…”) that slightly leans toward theme-statement, but it does not rupture causality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The bioluminescent farm is not backdrop: its permeable stone literally enables the breach, its glow guides Mira’s laser, and its medicinal purpose motivates her final leniency. Spatial choreography is flawless—laser dot, air currents, squeeze-through gap—each detail paid off in the climax. The mushrooms’ blue constellation light reappears in Marcus’s eyes at closure, recharging the opening image with new ethical weight. Environment thus constrains tactics and charges the final image, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—protect the farm from contamination—faces a meaningful tightening when the intruder turns out to be a grieving father replicating her own past need. Escalation is situational: each new physical fact (gap, Marcus, his motive) narrows Mira’s moral options rather than multiplying plot events. Cost is visible: she trades airtight security for compassionate permeability, foreshadowing a future risk (investors, Dr. Reeves) that remains legible at exit. Agency is hers; coincidence complicates rather than rescues.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the concrete metaphor of permeability—stone, grief, social barriers—never named outright. The final image of two people exiting the cave together re-prices the concept of “letting go” as shared risk rather than solitary release. No moralizing paragraph; the laser dot that first sought intrusion ends as invitation, reweighting prior material through action. Quiet wildfire tone sustains ambiguity: is this forgiveness or pragmatic redistribution of risk?—a question the story leaves smoldering.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is sharp: Mira thinks in trajectories, breach points, negative space—language specific to her spatial gift. Compression (“before the echo of morning birdsong”) teaches the pattern early and pays off in the final line. Free indirect style stays clean; no filter-verb stacks. Dialogue is minimal but distinct: Marcus’s exhausted short clauses contrast with Mira’s precise diction under stress. Voice modulation under pressure is evident as syntax tightens from reflective long sentences to clipped imperative at exit.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image, motive, or spatial fact. Metaphors are controlled and coherent—“living constellation,” “topology of desperation”—with no mixed vehicles. Rhythm accelerates naturally once Marcus is discovered, mirroring Mira’s tactical pivot. Final line lands with percussive brevity that re-illuminates the title image. Only a single near-cliché (“quiet between them felt like wildfire”) grazes purple, but it is earned by prior pattern and does not recur.</comment>

<question>8</question><question>8.5</question><comment>Fusion of intrusion-detection science with grief-therapy mushroom farm feels inevitable, not gimmicky. The “familiar stranger” trope is inverted: Marcus is stranger until the spatial logic of shared grief makes him neighbor. Risk is taken in moral calculus—security officer chooses permeability—yet the closure stays legible. Specificity of bioluminescent spore trails and laser-tracked airflow keeps the speculative frame grounded. The synthesis is fresh, but the premise nods to eco-healing tropes; a hairline deduction for proximity keeps it just shy of 9.</comment>
