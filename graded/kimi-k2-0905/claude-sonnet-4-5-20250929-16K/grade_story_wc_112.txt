<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Renna’s obliging nature is shown through repeated compliance, but the climactic reveal hinges on secret work already completed; the decisive moment is revelation, not a fresh choice under pressure. Interiority is concrete—grease-stained fingers, trembling hands—yet the core contradiction (meek mechanic vs. bold theorist) is told more than dramatized in-scene. Relationship with Voss supplies a micro power shift, but status dynamics stay polite; no cost is extracted from her meekness. Earned stasis is credible: she accepts exposure, but the cost feels intellectual, not personal.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the hologram proves sideways time, reframing physics with palpable conceptual cost. Causality is clean: secret experiments → illicit recording → lever pull → Voss confrontation → shared awe; each step because/therefore. Orientation is anchored by 120 words (station, twilight, mechanic task). One minor scaffold: “always ready to help” is summary before we see it. Lens holds causal throughout.</comment>

<comment>Crystalline moths larger than shuttles, triple sunsets, and magnetic shimmer create an alien viewport that directly enables the spacetime anomaly; environment is source of discovery, not backdrop. The maintenance bay’s disassembled projectors act as micro-setting that constrains her covert method. Sensory layering—silk-on-metal wing sound, cold-light hologram that feels warm—keeps perception embodied. Spatial choreography is clean: bay → deck → bay, no drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—prove time moves sideways—is signaled early and tightens when she must decide whether to expose her forbidden data. One meaningful turn: Voss’s arrival forces disclosure, narrowing options from secrecy to shared revelation. Cost is intellectual jeopardy (loss of anonymity) rather than tangible forfeiture; stakes would sharpen if career or relationship penalty were made vivid. Escalation remains causal and coherent under the inferred lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: the unseen laborer rewrites reality. Subtext operates in Voss’s “mechanically warm” smile—institutional kindness that still holds power. Final image of “tomorrow’s twilight” invites contemplation without moralizing. Recurring moth/hologram pair reweights from beauty to epistemic rupture, satisfying conceptual resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tightly bound to Renna’s perceptions: grease, shimmer, terror. Syntax mirrors her hush—“the world changed” stands alone as short declarative burst under stress. No head-hopping; Voss’s thoughts remain opaque, read through Renna’s watch of his trembling fingers. Distinct perceptual signature sustains through final beat.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is vivid yet disciplined: “light that felt somehow both cold and warm” compresses paradox without purple. No synonym loops; each sensory detail is new. Occasional template cadence—“They’re magnificent tonight,” he murmured… his breath fogging…”—slows momentum mildly. Otherwise rhythm breathes with scene shifts, accelerating at lever pull.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sideways-time thesis reframed through alien biology offers fresh conceptual angle; execution keeps human scale. Risk in blending hard-SF idea with lyric moth imagery pays off. Familiar “hidden genius mechanic” trope is personalized via tactile tool logic and twilight hush. Synthesis feels inevitable yet non-obvious.</comment>
