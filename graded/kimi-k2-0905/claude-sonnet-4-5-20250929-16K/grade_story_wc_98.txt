<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is concrete—her “luminous doubt” is embodied in trembling hands and soil under fingernails. The contradictory impulse to believe vs. measure is kept alive in scene, not summary. Yet the micro-choice to plant is solitary; no relational crucible tests her, so the full 9-band “cost on the page” is slightly blunted.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: blight → seed → planting → dream-mist pauses. Closure is a Charged Poise: “roots reaching deep” reconfigures hope with undeniable delay-cost. One small causality bump: the gray mist’s origin is asserted, not shown, but it does not rupture the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The ridge’s blooming iris carpet and dew-heft are filtered through Mira’s urgency, not tourism. The seed as micro-setting constrains the final gesture—she kneels in the very soil she alters. Monsoon clouds act as live clock, satisfying the 9-band “environment charges image” test.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Stakes—cultural memory specificity—tighten once: gray mist vs. seed. The planting act is agency under pressure, foreclosing abandonment. No visible resource loss (tool, stamina) is dramatized, so the cost is conceptual rather than visceral, keeping it just below the 8.8 gate.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from particulars: “honey and cardamom” vs. “something sweet.” Final image answers the thematic question—can specificity be replanted?—without moralizing. The ambiguity of “empirically whimsical faith” is honored, not tidied.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Mira’s perceptual bias—she notices petal weight, not tourist vistas. Syntax mirrors her measuring mind: clauses stack like data points, then loosen in prayer. No head-hop or register drift; lyric compression is taught early (“impossible colors that had names only in the old language”) and paid off at close.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Metaphors are selective, not cluttered; “gray mist…simplifying them” is precise. One scaffold loop: “memories trying to waken, struggling to remain real” restates in adjacent sentences. Otherwise rhythm breathes with pressure—short sentences at planting, longer coils in dream-space. Closure line is clean, no artifact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The collective-dream-memory premise is freshly grounded in biochemical botany (knowledge-fruit chemistry). Risky lyric escalation (“impossible colors,” translucent figures) is held coherent by causal stakes. Without the seed-specificity link the plot collapses, passing the transformation test.</comment>
