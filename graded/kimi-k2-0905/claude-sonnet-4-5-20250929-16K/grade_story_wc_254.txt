<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Interiority is lyrical but stays abstract—“tremor of certainty” named, not embodied. One micro-choice—paraphrasing the old text—decides the climax; stakes feel interior rather than endangering. Still, the shift from obedient reader to boundary-dissolver is legible and earned by her repeated, escalating translations.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Causal spine is clean: ban lifted → she enters → re-speaks verses → colonnade answers → she writes future. Closure lands as earned Conceptual Repricing: the boundary she “strides through” is the council’s prohibition itself, now reweighted as illusion; cost is implied exile from the grey world she leaves behind. Orientation is secure by line 3; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Cobalt atrium, quartz pillars, and frozen lake are etched in tactile, purpose-driven strokes; the colonnade’s warmth against winter cold is used to mark Lyren’s bodily risk and the moment of answered resonance. Micro-setting (her journal pages) charges the final image. No spatial drift; weather actively groans in response to speech.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will speaking banned beauty cost her?—tightens once: when the lake groans after her paraphrase, option of safe retreat vanishes. Escalation is single but sufficient for 750 words; agency is purely linguistic, yet irreversible. Cost remains conceptual rather than visceral, keeping score shy of 8+ band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme—beauty as unlicensed sacred—emerges through the act of translation, not sermon. Final image of writing “until the page filled” quietly reframes prior motifs: blankness becomes vessel, shadow becomes text. Subtext in the colonnade’s hum answers her without declaration. No moral line, but echo of thesis in last paragraph is a hairline over-articulation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person lyrical voice stays stable, cloud-shadow cadence mirrored in long rhythmic sentences that breathe with mist and winter light. Perceptual signature—sound just below hearing, color as temperature—is consistent and character-bound. No dialogue, hence no voice convergence; register never drifts above the POV’s poet lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong read-aloud rhythm and varied openings; occasional stacked qualifiers (“lantern-moth hush”) verge on purple but pattern-taught early and paid off. No loops or synonym churn; one mixed metaphor (“knowledge that vibrated at the edge of comprehension”) slightly blurs. Information density high; each paragraph advances stance or atmosphere.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Freshened fantasy-art-religion nexus: banned aesthetics as heresy, resonance stored in stone. “Cloud-shadow poet” and “quartz colonnade that answers paraphrase” feel specific to this world. Conceptual risk—poetry dissolves walls—could collapse into abstraction, but stakes stay personal. Final reprise of warmth/colonnade hum shows non-obvious payoff.</comment>
