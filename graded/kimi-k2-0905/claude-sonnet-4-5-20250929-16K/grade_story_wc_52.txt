<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira’s contradiction—grief’s need to preserve vs. carving’s need to subtract—remains active in every micro-choice, but the “hauntingly practical” label is announced, not dramatized; still, her embodied handling of blank and blade, plus the final earned stasis of keeping the laugh-figure, pays visible cost and caps the arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the laugh-figure crystallizes here-and-gone under the skylight, reweighting absence as generative; rain, kettle, and blank all constrain earlier tactics; cost is legible in the cold tea and “rust-hued peace” admission.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Ash blank, angled skylight, and kettle form a micro-setting triad that actively limits posture, light, and time; each prop’s state (rain-beaded, boiling, carved) is tracked across beats and charges the final image; no extraneous breadth.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can loss be contained without crushing?—tightens once: subtractive carving vs. irreplaceable Viktor; the laugh-curve becomes the irreversible narrowing; escalation is single but sufficient under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the recursive blank→figure→shelf pattern: impermanence can still be husbanded; no moralizing, only the final “rust-hued peace” image that reprices grief as craft; complexity lingers—she keeps carving tomorrow, forever unfinished.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is steady: rain-tracked glass = fleeting attention, ash grain = patience, kettle pitch = internal clock; no head-hop; diction stays within Mira’s artisan lexicon; rhythm breathes with carving strokes.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Zero loops; high density—“crystallized time,” “subtractive release,” “here and gone” all double as image and concept; figurative layers stay coherent (wood grain = time, laugh = curve); final line lands clean without scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: grief-management via backwards carpentry—remove material to preserve presence; circus-lion backstory is specific, not trope; ash blank as memory diegeticizes the prompt without gimmick.</comment>
