<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lien’s contradictory sense of service-to-master vs treason-to-state is dramatized through the bleeding thumb, loaded brush, and final quiet exit; interiority is concrete and embodied. Micro-choice of mixing blood into ink crystallizes her value hierarchy on the page. Final stance of “earned betrayal” is foreshadowed and paid for with the dulled thorn left behind—visible cost. No second character on page, so relationship crucible waived; headcount stays clean.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each drip, aurora shift, and pigment stroke layers density until the forged decree reweights history. Closure is Charged Poise—the thorn embedded in marble, document complete, kingdoms “unlink” with conceptual cost. Orientation anchors by line 3; causality of pigment-ritual to imperial authenticity is tight. No lens ambiguity; cost is undeniable in final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marble sanctuary, aurora ceiling, and dripping stalactites act as micro-setting that constrains ritual timing and pigment chemistry. Rose thorn and ink bowl function as portable setting-objects whose tactile handling alters tactics. Sensory hierarchy stays visual–tactile, filtered through calligrapher’s trained eye. Spatial choreography is stable; no impossible moves. Final thorn-in-marble recharges the whole space.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—free kingdom vs betray emperor—tightens with each brushstroke; visible price is her own blood and the dulled thorn. One meaningful escalation: refusal → reconsideration → execution under aurora shift. No coincidence; pressure is coherent and interior. Closure forecloses path: the decree is immutable once sealed, her innocence equally sealed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Theme of transformation vs permanence emerges through recurring images—dripping stone, shifting aurora, forged ink—rather than statement. No final moralizing; resonance is in the thorn fossilized in marble. Concept that forgery can serve truth is earned through concrete ritual. Ambiguity lingers: treason or fidelity? Both readings remain plausible.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</question><comment>Third-person tight interiority maintains consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature is calligrapher-attentive to stroke weight, pigment viscosity, stone temperature. Syntax modulates from long fluid sentences (aurora) to clipped brush-load actions under pressure. No dialogue, so voice contamination absent. Free indirect style clean; no filter-verb clusters. Diction stays within scholar-artisan lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</question><comment>High information density: one sentence often layers pigment chemistry, imperial history, and emotional charge. Varied rhythm supports breath vs acceleration; paragraph cuts are purposeful. Zero paraphrase loops or synonym churn. Metaphors (aurora as paint, thorn as key) stay consistent within physical logic. Closure line—“quiet certainty”—is crisp, propulsive exit.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</question><comment>Calligraphy-as-forgery premise is familiar, but synthesis with blood-ink ritual, aurora-lit sanctuary, and geological time-scale stakes feels fresh. Thumbnail image of thorn embedded in marble offers specific, non-obvious payoff. Transformation test fails if moved to generic studio; northern aurora and stalactite clock are irreplaceable. Risk in lyric accumulative structure succeeds without obscuring causality.</comment>
