<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mira’s interior contradiction—clinging to human form while hungering for reunion—drives every beat; the embodied spice-smoke transformation shows cost in sensorial detail. The final line crystallizes an earned hierarchy: love > self-integrity. Minor slip: “stubbornly human” edges label-speak, but is immediately enfleshed by refusal to change.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Mira’s luminous new form persists, cost paid in irreversible body-blur. Accumulative lens holds: each spice scent layers memory-density until the orchard reconfigures reality. Fortune-cookie seed pays off in final exchange, reweighting the rule-set. One micro-transition (orchard arrival) is legible; no orientation debt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Silver-apple orchard under deathless moon is not backdrop but active agent: branches bend, pollen answers her spell, constraining the transformation ritual. Spice vials function as micro-setting, their scents given tactile handling that alters physics. Spatial choreography clean; no white-room lapse. Environment directly supplies the bridge she becomes.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—meet dead brother—signaled early; pressure tightens when transformation becomes the only path. Reluctance escalates cost: each sensory step forward intensifies the threat of self-dissolution. Phoenix-lit world rule is persistent constraint, not coincidence. One meaningful deepening suffices; no false reversals.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges as the price of love-driven expansion: identity must dilate to span death, yet endurance is born of reluctance. Subtext operates in scent-memory synesthesia rather than exposition. Final image of “bridge built from reluctance and longing” offers resonant CR without moralizing. No thematic echo violations.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person intimate stays locked to Mira’s perceptual filter: star-anise “spirals,” cinnamon “remembers flesh.” Syntax lengthens during spellwork, then fractures at climax—rhythmic mimicry of dissolution. No head-hopping; diction remains within beast-whisperer’s sensory lexicon. Dialogue sparse but voice-distinct: brother’s cinnamon-voice fits incorporeal state.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is lyric yet propulsive; sentences carry double duty (scent + emotion + world rule). No scaffold loops; metaphor chain (spice → memory → substance) stays coherent. Minor density spike mid-ritual but pattern is taught and paid off. Read-aloud rhythm modulates with spell-cadence; no filter-verb stacks.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fusing fortune-cookie wisdom with phoenix-lit necromancy feels fresh; reluctant self-transmutation as toll for post-death conversation is non-obvious. Specificity of spice-vial mechanics prevents generic occultism. Risk in permanent moon orchard pays off by charging final image. Synthesis makes inevitable hindsight sense without echoing famous scenes.</comment>
