<comment>Mira’s interior contradiction—art as joy versus art as work—arrives pre-explained, not dramatized in scene, so the turn feels pre-loaded rather than earned. Once on-site, her micro-choices (tracing the fresco, switching from projection to amplification) are visible, embodied, and costly (battery drain, public exposure), earning the laugh that ends her creative apnea. The “pensive mirth” epiphany is still articulated in abstract labels rather than a final contradictory impulse, keeping her arc just shy of the 8-band where flaw and cost would collide on the page.</comment>

<comment>Single-scene architecture is clean: arrival → discovery → light-painting → dawn exit. Causality holds because the fresco’s painted reach motivates the new projection tactic that closes the gap for both child and artist. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the streamed orchard reweights “joy” from lost nostalgia to present practice, with visible cost—fading batteries and thinning fog—written into the final image. The lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern (light-on-fog) intensifies rather than plots, satisfying the tightening rule.</comment>

<comment>Orchard district is economically anchored—stone-bark trees, spilled-milk fog, silver-gray palette—and every descriptor answers to Mira’s light-painter eye. Micro-setting (her projectors, the cratered wall) literally constrains the climax: beam angle dictates what can and cannot be illuminated, charging the final fade-out. Spatial choreography stays clean; no floating props or impossible footstep echoes. The phrase “photograph developing in reverse” is the only mixed-metaphor wobble, but it is brief and pattern-taught early, so harm is cosmetic.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—“can joy still be made here?”—is signaled by the cryptic coordinates and tightened when the fresco forces Mira to abandon her habitual imposition for amplification. Agency is present: she risks batteries and reputation on a livestream that could fail; the orchard’s fog accepts or erases her light, a natural antagonist that cannot be negotiated with. Cost is visible—battery gauge dimming, thinning fog revealing too much—altering tactics (she quits at dawn instead of pushing gear to death). The tightening is single but sufficient for the word count; no reversal beyond the switch from new mural to old amplification, which still forecloses her prior practice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through the shifting meaning of “light” and “orchard”—first as lost past, finally as renewable present medium—without authorial thesis. The fresco child’s eternal want versus Mira’s projected fruit reframes joy as an act of reaching rather than owning, an answer conveyed imagistically. Subtext resides in the silence of the viewers who weep off-page, letting the network comments stand in for communal absolution. No final-paragraph moralizing; the last line lets fog reclaim the footprints, implying erasure is the price of momentary bloom.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person intimate stays latched to Mira’s perceptual filter—her “painter-of-ephemeral” diction, light-focused synesthesia—without head-hop. Rhythm modulates: longer, breath-held sentences in fog-choked discovery tighten into staccato projector clicks during setup, mirroring breath returning. Filter verbs (“she thought”) are minimal and voice-motivated when used. The lyric phrase “edible stars” risks decorative lift but is earned by her professional habit of inventing impossible color, staying inside lexicon. Closing image carries charged poise under pressure: “the fog swallowed her footsteps” reads as earned release, not sentimental surrender.</comment>

<comment>Prose is densely figurative but patterned: fog as milk, light as fruit, orchard as photo—each metaphor services the central textural argument that permanence is unnecessary. No mixed metaphors collide in the climax; final beam fade is described in concrete verbs (“batteries dimmed”). One paraphrase loop—“light stealing the image rather than revealing it” restates the preceding photograph metaphor—deducts a hair. Scaffolding is otherwise tight; paragraphs advance knowledge or emotional charge. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with the fog’s inhale/exhale without algorithmic repetition.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fresco-guided light amplification reframes the hackneyed “artist rediscovers wonder” arc into a fresher question: what if the past doesn’t need excavation but collaboration? The knowledge-network livestream rescues the piece from solipsistic artist-in-ruins cliché, making joy a distributed act. Specificity of the stone-apple bark and projector battery gauge prevents transplant to any other ghost-town orchard. Risk—trusting viewers to supply emotional payoff without on-page meltdown—is calculated and succeeds; closure still hinges on Mira’s solo stance. Synthesis feels inevitable rather than gimmicked.</comment>
