<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Iris’s interiority is concrete—her noticing of the arch’s “simple curve” refracts her own artistic problem—and her micro-choice to pocket the slide and abandon the GPS crystallizes her arc. The perpetual-learning trait is shown, not labeled, when she re-reads the land by “three currents converged.” Flaws surface in the therapy-adjacent phrase “she felt herself fall into reverie,” but the final renunciation of digital navigation carries visible cost, satisfying the 9+ test. Still, we never see her hands actually carve or place a stick, so the promised bodily collaboration remains off-stage, capping the score just below exceptional.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: the storm, slide, and coordinates layer meaning until a pattern break (ditching GPS) reweights stakes. Closure is a Charged Poise—the sculpture will “stand until the next great storm reimagines it”—with conceptual cost legible in that acceptance. Causality holds: slide → new method → beach found → work begun. The Orientation Test is passed by word 50; no lens ambiguity at end. A 0.3 deduction because the “turbine-hum” metaphor is repeated four times, creating a template cadence that slightly dulls the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Storm-tossed archway as micro-setting constrains her sheltering and later orienteering; driftwood becomes both material and mnemonic device. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: Iris notices structural load before she notices smell. The coastal road “gray smear” is a selective visual fragment that matches her artist’s eye. Spatial choreography is clean—no teleporting between van, arch, beach—earning the 9+ quick test, but the repeated “turbine-hum” costs 0.4 for minor register drift.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake is articulated early: “find the one cut that would let a twisted branch express flight.” One meaningful deepening occurs when she deciphers the slide’s hidden coordinate system, narrowing her options from digital to analogue navigation. The price—abandoning GPS forever—is paid on-page and alters tactics. Escalation is textural, not causal, fitting the inferred lens; no reversals are needed. The score stays below 8.8 because the external storm threat never truly endangers her bodily safety, keeping stakes conceptual rather than visceral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the accruing images of arches, spirals, and shifting slides: complexity scaffolded by simplicity. No character moralizes the thesis; the final sculpture’s inevitable dissolution is the non-literal answer. Thematic echo appears once (“This was what she’d been trying to articulate”) but is anchored to concrete slide-viewing, so penalty waived. Counter-readings are plausible: is the alliance real or projection? Complexity lingers without confusion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Third-person omniscient stays modest, filtering only through Iris’s perceptual signature—stone curves, driftwood grain. Diction is controlled: “scaffold complexity with simplicity” is exact without thesaurus-itis. The turbine-hum metaphor creates purposeful rhythmic return, teaching its pattern early. A 0.3 deduction for fourfold repetition nudging cadence toward template; otherwise voice is distinct and coherent under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>High information density: one sentence delivers GPS loss, coastal road erasure, and motive. Sentence openings vary; no paraphrase loops. Metaphors are consistent (arch as scaffold, storm as collaborator). Minor scaffold: “turbine-hum” repeated four times; not severe enough to touch closure. No mixed metaphors or register drift in peak beat. Clean grammar and pronoun reference; paragraph cuts are purposeful.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: driftwood sculptor meets medieval lantern-slide coordinate system—two tropes rarely paired. The alliance concept is made specific through her obligate shift from satellite to relational navigation. Risk is taken in the quiet, accumulative structure, yet coherence holds. The final image of a sculpture designed to be unmade feels inevitable in hindsight, earning the upper-band bonus.</comment>
