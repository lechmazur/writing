<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Kael’s maintenance-worker lens gives tactile, embodied attention to stone, kit, pin; her micro-choices (climb, lift, press thumb to glass) are concrete, contradictory impulses under pressure. The internal split—obedience to measured sorrow vs hunger for unquantified healing—drives every beat and is paid for by the dawn-long labor that leaves her “carrying moonlight in her bones.” No stock therapeutic self-diagnosis; flaw (compulsive witness/curator) complicates the final act. The renunciation of pure measurement is earned, costly, irreversible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Kael reassembles the sextant into a moon-prism, crystallizing new options—labyrinth will now hold “what trees remember,” not just human sorrow. Causal chain: pin-fall → door opened → sextant touched → wound healed → astronomer’s map decoded → beam re-configured; each because/therefore tightens. Cost is visible in her exhausted dawn descent and the irreversible shift in the labyrinth’s function. Orientation anchored by word 60; lens (Causal) holds without ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Storm-wracked moonlight, growth-ringed stone, and the broken sextant’s mirrored arc function as micro-setting that directly enables the climax: moon-angles must hit the oak keystone. Spatial choreography is immaculate—seventeen corridors, spiral staircase, east turret, central chamber—bodies and objects never float. Sensory hierarchy obeys Kael’s maintenance gaze: sound of pin, weight of kit, silver pooling in glass. Environment constraints choice (only eastern turret angle works) and charges final image. No filler; every detail either limits motion or supplies the healing light.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—will Kael keep the labyrinth’s rating system pure or let in the unmeasured, arboreal grace—tightens once: the moment she chooses to re-tool the sextant against the oak beam, the old metric order is irretrievably breached. Agency drives escalation; no coincidence. The price is on-page: blistered palms, sleepless night, professional covenant broken. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length; the storm’s flicker mirrors the irreversible internal shift.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: quantification is a cage unless broken open by witness that refuses to measure. Subtext lives in gesture—thumb pressed to mirror, silver light sealing cut—showing healing as unaccountable. Final image of “moonlight in her bones” reweights every prior measurement unit. No moralizing; resonance arises from concrete particulars (847 units vs unsung lullaby in firelight). Ambiguity intact: labyrinth now holds both sorrow and grace, no balance sheet offered.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays welded to Kael’s perceptual signature: sound geography, tool weight, moonlit angle calculations. Syntax grows clipped under pressure (“She understood then what needed doing”). No head-hop; lens stable. Diction—“provisional and holy,” “medicine”—is within her taciturn caretaker lexicon, elevated by awe but never academic. Rhythm accelerates with sentence fragments during beam-projection sequence, then exhales into final long sentence. Dialogue absent by design; voice coherence perfect.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Zero loops, scaffold, or filter-verb stacks. High density: “silver light pooled in its curves like water, like medicine” does three jobs (image, simile, foreshadow). Metaphors stay coherent—moonlight as data, beam as reader. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image that recharges pin and labyrinth motifs. Paragraph cut test passes—removing any paragraph breaks causality or atmosphere. Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; no template cadence. Occasional elevated phrase (“provisional and holy”) is ear-justified by epiphany moment.</comment>

<grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: grief-cartography meets dendrochronology of dreams; sextant repurposed to read wooden memory is non-obvious. Risk—using a maintenance worker as cosmologist—pays off through tactile competence and humble lens. No trope recycling without transformation: labyrinth not Minotaur trap but emotional seismograph; trees not wise ancients but encrypted archives. Conceptual integrity absolute—rules of quantified sorrow proposed, tested, breached. Final reconfiguration feels inevitable yet surprising. Specificity of “847 units” vs “song sung in firelight” prevents abstract drift.</comment>
