<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Maya’s interiority is vivid—her trembling hands steady as she accepts terror—showing embodied contradiction. The twin reveal lands cleanly because her muscle-memory cipher reading seeds doubt early. Carson’s stature as “mentor turned predator” is economical yet chilling; his single seashell prop carries the weight of stolen childhood. Only the line “She had outwitted him…” drifts into explanatory summary rather than dramatized choice, keeping the score just under the 9-band.</comment>

<comment>Causal chain holds: envelope → library → cast cipher → UV notes → seashell voice → prosecutors outside. Orientation is nailed inside 120 words: “rusted library beneath the indifferent stars,” name, object, and present danger. Mid-scene memory downloads (“Sophie always said…”) risk a BRR breach yet each is tethered to on-page stimuli (the seashell, Carson’s entrance) and shifts tactics. Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: flashlight beams = decisive arrival, Maya’s starlit stance = cost felt, no mechanical exposition.</comment>

<comment>The corroded library is not backdrop but accomplice—oxidized shelves become “skeletal orange fingers” that mirror Carson’s predatory reach. Starlight pooling through the open roof supplies both religious ambience and literal beacon for incoming officers; environment guides outcome. Micro-setting object—the seashell—literally reweights the final beat when Maya presses it to her ear and hears her pre-conditioning voice. Spatial tracking stays clean; Carson’s stairs, Maya’s backward step toward exit, flashlight beams entry all legible without diagram.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake is identity survival: “entire constructed life had been someone else’s design.” Tightening occurs when Carson appears wearing the missing shell half, upgrading threat from abstract to embodied. Escalation is causal: each decryption act (cast, shell) forecloses ignorance and tightens physical space—officers now surround. Cost is visible: Maya trades the safety of denial for the danger of testimony; vulnerability chosen over faked courage is the price on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without thesis statement: manufactured fear can become authentic power when owned. Final starlit image reweights earlier “indifferent stars” into witnesses that now side with truth. Subtext lives in objects: children’s cast = innocence weaponized, shell = split self rejoined. No moralizing paragraph; resonance is pure image. The idea that “vulnerability is power” is demonstrated, not declared—Maya’s trembling hands steady only after she admits terror aloud.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise: “rust-scented air,” “salt and childhood summers.” Compression is taught early—“whispering seashell half” signals lyric allowance—and holds. Perceptual signature is fear-filtered: open roof = exposure dread, orange rust = decay of identity. No head-hopping; Carson’s interior is kept at gesture level (“face collapsed into something desperate”). Dialogue is sparse but subtextual: Carson’s “You decrypted it faster than I expected” carries pride and threat simultaneously.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Rhythm modulates: longer clauses for dread, staccato for officers’ arrival. Figurative language is selective and paid off: “oxidized shelves = skeletal fingers” returns as Carson’s grasp fails. No scaffold loops; each sentence advances knowledge or pressure. Minor register drift—Maya thinks “conceptual repricing” is unlikely mid-crisis, yet the phrase never appears; prose stays within stunt-performer perceptual range. Only one near-paraphrase: “trembling certainty” is stated twice; the second could be cut for density.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The amnesia-double-stunt-double conceit is familiar, yet grounding it in a child’s plaster cast cipher feels fresh and chillingly plausible. Using manufactured phobias as both weapon and survival tool flips expected “courage” tropes. Risk of sentimentality in twin reunion is avoided—sister remains offstage breadcrumb-inker, keeping focus on Maya’s internal reassembly. Final reconfiguration makes the corruption-scandal backdrop feel personal rather than generic; stars as silent jury is an image unlikely to be replicated verbatim.</comment>
