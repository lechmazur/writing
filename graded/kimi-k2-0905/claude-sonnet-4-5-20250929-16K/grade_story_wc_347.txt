<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Maren’s interiority is textured (gnarled trees/“graceless beauty”) and her reluctant guardianship collides with an earned, self-authored purpose at the end. The hikers exist only as blank victims, so no relationship crucible; status dynamics aren’t on the page. Micro-choices—hover-walk, nut-warm—are concrete, yet the decisive turn (“someone had to stay”) is more thematic assertion than dramatized cost; we’re told she accepts, not shown the exact emotional toll. Still, the voice shows a consistent perceptual signature and the flaws complicate tactics, keeping her above caricature.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Causal logic holds: inheritance → trapped caretaker → discovery of nut/blueprint → new escape path → embrace of role. Orientation in first 120 words plants who/where cleanly; no penalty. Closure is Charged Poise: Maren’s voluntary return crystallizes options with undeniable cost (“prison,” “purpose”) under causal lens. The cost is legible but abstract—no body price or future consequence dramatized on page—so misses 9+ ceiling.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Orchard-as-body dominates via tactile verbs (“clung,” “screamed,” “clicked”), sensory hierarchy follows Maren’s priorities. Micro-setting (nut, hovering footfalls) directly enables escape route, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography remains clean across the walk sequence. Mechanical birds, frost clock, and labyrinth geometry each pressure tactics; cliffside locale could be any high ledge, a minor generic note preventing top band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“save the hikers before night frost feeds them to trees”—is signaled early and tightens through literal countdown. Escalation is linear but sufficient: discovery of nut → patrol adjustment → guided exit → acceptance of eternal duty. Agency sits in Maren’s hovering footfalls and final voluntary return, both with on-page cost (freedom foregone). No second reversal or rising moral trade-off keeps it from higher bands.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of reluctant stewardship crystallizes without moralizing: “curse was also its strange gift” lands as Resonant Reconfiguration. Motifs—screaming fruit, mechanical birds, graceless beauty—return charged in final paragraph, reweighting prior dread into bittersweet duty. Ambiguity survives: prison/gift coexist, no tidy lesson. Details rather than abstractions carry the insight; subtle, not schematic.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person close sustains a lyrical, fevered diction (“graceless beauty,” “desperate memory”) that feels character-true. Syntax lengthens under reflection, shortens during escape, mirroring pulse. No dialogue, so voice contamination avoided. Distinct perceptual signature—architecture in a nut, birds as offhandedly exact—stays consistent; no head-hop or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; paragraph lengths breathe. Occasional stacked modifiers (“graceless beauty as they transformed…”) flirt with overwriting but stay within pattern taught early. No loops, no scaffold, no synonym churn. Line density high: each sentence advances image, stakes, or sensory cue. Metaphors stay coherent; closure beat clear.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Cursed orchard, mechanical birds, blueprint-in-a-nut synthesize into fresh emotional crucible; not a trope checklist. Specificity (brass wings, hover-walk mechanics) makes rules feel discovered, not imposed. Risky inversion—escape path revealed yet keeper chooses return—earns hindsight inevitability. Missing top tier only because cliffside setting remains slightly generic; otherwise transformation is strong.</comment>
