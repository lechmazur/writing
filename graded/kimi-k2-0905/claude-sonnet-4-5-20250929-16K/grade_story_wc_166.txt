<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Kael’s interiority is concrete—her bones “recognize lunar gravity,” her palm tingles as the speck anchors her—but the moment she decides to tattoo her memories the emotional contradiction is asserted rather than dramatized (“she understood then what she must do”). The final endurance carries visible cost: her body becomes “a map of what was,” flesh inscribed under starlight. One more beat of internal resistance or fear would have pushed this to 9+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: each dance phrase thickens starlight and pools time until the moonstone speck condenses; the final image of living tattooed archive reweights the premise with undeniable conceptual cost. Orientation is clean by line 5; causality is lyric but coherent—stillness within motion produces the speck, the speck becomes pigment, pigment becomes archive. Closure lands as Charged Poise: she dances on, future path foreclosed, stakes crystallized.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Garden’s perpetual dusk, silver fruit, and starlit hedges are filtered through Kael’s tide-trained senses; the environment literally supplies the moonstone dust that enables her archive. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from exile entrance to final rooted stance. Micro-setting of her own forearm becomes the contested territory—every letter glows then settles, charging the final image. One more sensory contrast (smell of burnt photograph ash?) would have nudged 9+.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—preserve memory against erasure—is signaled in paragraph 1 and tightens when the speck offers the only means of permanent record. Escalation is textural: each dance gap yields more dust, more skin, more irrevocable ink; options narrow until her body is the last page left. Cost is visible—constellations settling into flesh—but the beat that shows pain or exhaustion is implied rather than felt, keeping this just below 8.8+ threshold.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through concrete recurrence: tide, moon, garden gaps, and finally skin-as-manuscript. The final image reconfigures the premise—archive is no longer parchment but living tissue, a cost the Empress cannot burn. No moral is stated; the resonance is in the after-image of a woman turning her own body into contraband history. Subtext of dance-as-resistance is implicit in every weighted step.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise: “time pooled like quicksilver,” “obsidian grace”—diction stays within a dancer’s sensorium. Rhythm modulates from long liquid sentences to staccato final declarations, mirroring the shift from flow to inscription. No head-hopping; focalization remains tightly bound to Kael’s proprioception. One clause edges toward editorial intrusion (“the universe’s way of preserving”) but is immediately re-grounded in her skin.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but propulsive; each sentence layers image and stakes without scaffold. Metaphors are coherent—tide, ink, starlight—and never clash. No loops or synonym churn; “gaps” recurs with reweighted meaning, taught early. A single filter verb cluster (“she felt… she saw… she understood”) is acceptable under lyric pressure and does not dull the final line.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fusion of tide-dancing, memory-as-ink, and body-as-archive feels inevitable yet fresh; the premise could collapse into gimmick but is earned by sensory specificity and causal lyric pattern. Risk—tattooing cosmic verse on mortal skin—heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. No close echoes of familiar SFF scenes; the image of star-dust letters settling into flesh is singular. Transformation test passes: swap names and the arc collapses.</comment>
