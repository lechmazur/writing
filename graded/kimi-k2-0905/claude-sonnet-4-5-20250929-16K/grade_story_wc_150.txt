<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira’s contradictory tug between exile-honed detachment and bone-anchored belonging is dramatized in every micro-choice—she caresses root-wrapped skulls, postpones the dig, decides to haul the sundial up. Interiority stays concrete (“some internal architecture,” “hollowed something”) and avoids diagnostic labels. The final renunciation—leaving again but now with a return she feels as cost—is legible and earned. Only the priest’s single-scene presence dilutes relationship-as-crucible pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accretive/textural lens holds: each catacomb foray adds sediment of ancestry and self-knowledge until the sundial’s re-emergence crystallizes the inversion theme. Closure is a Charged Poise—Mira watches living-branch shadows slide across dead stone, feeling the price of future absence. Cost is visible in her conscious decision to keep leaving/returning. Orientation anchors within 120 words; no因果 breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The orchard-catacomb hybrid is tactile—roots “like wooden lightning,” soil smelling of “bone-rich earth.” Spatial choreography is clean from surface to tomb and back. The sundial base functions as micro-setting that ultimately bears the final image, satisfying 9+ gate. A fractional lapse: pear vs. apple roots blur without differential sensory cue.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restitch severed continuity—tightens when each skeletal chamber confronts Mira with ancestral time. Agency is present in every descent/ascent and in the choice to rebuild the sundial; the felt price is the certainty of future departure. Escalation is single-curve (density, not reversal) yet sufficient under accretive lens. No swappable loss or tool breakage visible on-page holds it from 8.8+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges inexorably from literal inversion—above goes below, dead feed living—without sermon. The sundial’s shadowless face and Mira’s embrace of cyclical return reweight “interrupted journeys” into continuous re-rooting. Final image offers oblique answer: time marked by living branches acknowledges impermanence yet promises renewal. No thematic echo articulates the thesis; image does the work.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person hovers at mid-distance yet keeps a perceptual signature—“weathered hands,” “snaking between skulls”—filtered through Mira’s exilic eye. Rhythm modulates: longer cadences for catacomb drift, clipped fragments when she lifts stone. No dialogue to test voice distinction; internal diction holds steady. Compression (“roots and bones remembered each other’s names”) is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, imagistic; each sentence layers sensory data or metaphor without scaffold. Only two adjacent near-paraphrases (“time had inverted… life and death one continuous weaving”) create minor loop; otherwise density is high. Figurative vehicles stay physically coherent. Final line cadence lands with punch.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The catacomb-orchard conceit feels freshly literalized rather than symbolic decal. Inverting above/below via tree roots digesting ancestors is specific to this village, not portable. Risk is taken by quiet Charged Poise ending rather than triumphant restoration—coherence intact. Slight genre echo of “bones feeding trees” trope prevents 9+.</comment>
