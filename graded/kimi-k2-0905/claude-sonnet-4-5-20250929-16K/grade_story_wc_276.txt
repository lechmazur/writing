<comment>Mira’s cool-headedness is shown through action—she steers toward cosmic dissonance “the way a shark follows blood”—but her interiority stays general; we’re told she’s “cool-headed even when the universe decided to unravel” rather than shown the specific embodied tension that contradicts that calm. The contradiction between her fisherman’s composure and the parental desperation that drives her is asserted, not dramatized in a single visible micro-choice until the final catch; earlier beats summarize her state. Still, her motive—transmuting grief into a cure for her daughter’s silence—remains legible and consistent, and the final “Mother?” lands as earned cost.</comment>

<comment>Closure is clean: the goddess-laugh is caught, silence becomes speech, and the cost is the three-hour night and the risk of being scattered across the garden. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern break of sleepwalking stars creates density that reweights stakes—and the final image of constellations “stumbling back into their ancient patterns” crystallizes the Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost. Orientation is anchored by word 40 (“Mira watched from her skiff”), well inside the 120-word allowance. One scaffold: “cool-headed didn’t mean fearless; it meant moving forward despite the fear…” is an explanatory aside that could be cut, but it doesn’t touch the closure beat.</comment>

<comment>The sound-wave garden is rendered through selective, urgent sense filters—“crystalline terraces vibrating at frequencies that made sound visible”—and the rail spike functions as micro-setting that constrains the final act. Sensory economy is tight: sound is vision, silence is drowning, iron sings. Spatial choreography holds: the skiff, the pinned frequency, the bottle of light all track cleanly. Only the garden’s deeper “frequency layers” remain a touch abstract, but the spike literalizes them on-page, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—retrieve the goddess-laugh to restore her daughter’s voice—is signaled in paragraph 4 and tightens once: the laugh resists, tries to transliterate Mira herself into scattering. That deepening forces the decisive act of driving the spike, with visible price (risk of self-scattering, three-hour night). Escalation is single but sufficient for 700-word scope; coincidence is absent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: grief as a frequency that can be re-tuned, motherhood as net-making across cosmic disorder. No character states the thesis; the final “Mother?” is the non-literal answer that reweights every prior echo. Subtext in the rail spike—grandmother’s tool re-purposed—quietly links generations of women translating absence into matter. Sentimentality is avoided; the wonder stays feral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Mira’s perceptual signature—“frequencies that made sound visible” is her fisherman’s synesthesia. Rhythm modulates: longer sentences for celestial drift, staccato for the spike strike. No dialogue, so voice contamination is impossible. One minor filter-verb cluster—“she felt it translate…”—could be tighter, but it occurs pre-climax and doesn’t obscure the final image.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “echoes zigzag through impossible angles, fleeing into dimensions where conventional nets cannot follow” does three jobs—world, stakes, and obstacle—in one line. No loops, no mixed metaphors, no scaffold. Register stays inside Mira’s plausible diction; “transliterate” is the lone technical term and is justified by the garden’s acoustic physics. Final line “She was too busy listening to her daughter sing” lands with cadence that resolves the opening silence.</comment>

<grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The fusion of celestial mechanics with acoustic fishing feels inevitable yet fresh; “sleepwalking constellations” is a phrase that re-weights ancient myth through single-mother science-fantasy. Risk in the non-standard physics pays off because the garden’s rules are taught early and hold to closure. The lullaby is literally feral—divine laughter caught with iron—avoiding quaintness. Derivative Premise guardrail does not apply; no template matches this specific synthesis.</comment>
