<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elena’s interiority is vivid and specific—her noticing of grass spirals, her decision to leave the eastern approach open, her equation of maps with faith. The contradiction between scientific method and quasi-mystical listening is dramatized in scene, not summarized. The final micro-choice (recommend the wound stay visible) carries visible cost: she risks professional censure and abandons the fantasy of complete knowledge. Only the absence of a second on-page character prevents the 9-band; no relationship crucible is available to test her stance under live opposition.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout: pattern of silence → image → reweighting. Closure is a Charged Poise: Elena’s report crystallizes the Whispered Chapel as a living lacuna; the cost is the irreversible exposure of the older foundation and her surrender to partial revelation. Orientation is anchored by line 3 (“map framer's workshop… beneath the old cathedral”) and re-anchored after the single time-jump (“Working through the night…”). No causality gaps; every image (1957 vs. 2023 footage, spiral grass, exposed stones) accretes toward the final reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The rain-scoured vault, the spiral grass, the torn map edge, and the exposed prehistoric stones are not backdrop but instruments: they constrain Elena’s interpretation and supply the final recommendation. Sensory triage is POV-filtered—she notices moisture-ghosted saints and axial-shift shadows because they mirror cartographic absence. Micro-setting (the trilithon’s footprint) literally shapes the reopening plan. Final image recharges the vault frescoes: ruined saints now frame the site’s new, deliberate wound.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can the Chapel’s silence still speak?—is signaled in paragraph 3. Escalation is textural: each compared frame thickens the pattern of identical head-tilts and spiral grass until silence becomes interpretable. The decisive tightening is Elena’s decision to expose the older foundation; this forecloses the “perfect documentation” option and risks Trust censure. Cost is legible: she trades certainty for reverence, a conceptual price paid on-page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete returns: maps’ white space, fresco ghosts, spiral grass, the exposed substrata. No abstract sermon—final line reweights “known vs. unknown” as the live border of human longing. Conceptual Repricing closes the loop: silence is not lack but permission. Subtext resides in gesture (the identical head-tilt) and object state (torn map, open trench). Ambiguity is purposeful yet coherent—reader left holding the same lacuna Elena accepts.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tightly glued to Elena’s perceptual syntax: “methodically curious,” “cartography becomes faith.” No head-hop; psychic distance compresses under pressure (“She enhanced the images…”). Diction stays within her lexicon—no academic register inflation. Rhythm mirrors attention: long sentences for archival calm, clipped fragments for discovery beats. No dialogue, so voice distinctness is judged solely through interior texture, which remains character-specific.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive—each sentence layers map, fresco, and geological data without scaffold. Metaphors are coherent: moisture-ghosted saints → cartographic absence → silence as interpretable space. No mixed vehicles or purple overload. Filter verbs are voice-motivated (“she suspected,” “she realized”) and paid off in final epistemic shift. Zero loops, no synonym churn, no template cadence. Final sentence earns its abstract leap because concrete images have been iteratively soldered.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Premise—restoring a monument to silence via film comparison—feels fresh yet inevitable. Spiral grass and axial-shift shadows are particular rather than generic henge tropes. Risk is taken: no antagonist, no dialogue, quiet ending; coherence survives. Transformation test fails if names are swapped, because the map-frame occupation and fresco vault are irreplaceable engines of metaphor. Slight dip because henge-as-mystical-quiet is a known cultural template; the cartographic inversion is the actual novelty.</comment>
