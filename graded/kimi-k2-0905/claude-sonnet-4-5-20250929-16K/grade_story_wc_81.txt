<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Marcus’s quiet, methodical temperament is etched into every micro-choice—cataloguing by head-lamp, slipping stamp into pocket—so the indexer identity feels lived-in. The buried contradiction between grandmother’s defeat and his own need to prove her right drives the single POV cleanly, and the final renunciation (calm return to desk) carries visible social cost: he must keep acting the obedient functionary while now armed with proof. No second character on stage, so relationship bullets are waived; interiority stays concrete, never drifts into label-speak. Only a hairline gap: we glimpse no transient stress-degradation of perception under pressure, keeping embodiment just shy of 9-band immediacy.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the camera and stamp reconfigure the moral equation—stillness is no longer silence but loaded resistance—felt cost is legible in the hush before security closes in. Causal chain from maritime letters → off-index archive → magnetic-lock failure → discovery is tight; blackout functions as motivated coincidence that complicates rather than rescues. Orientation is anchored within first 100 words (who = Marcus, where = sunken-library, when = blackout midnight). Lens is Causal; each beat narrows options until the final crystallised stance. No loops or late rule changes; payoff image re-uses “reclaimed stillness” to re-weight stakes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Reinforced-glass city, circular archive, bronze stamp, and head-lamp beam all constrain tactics and physically charge the ending: the camera and stamp must be smuggled past glass walls. Sensory economy favours sound (creak, pressure-groan) appropriate to outage urgency; visual detail is filtered through Marcus’s indexer habit of labelling. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from stacks → ajar door → cabinet tiers; no impossible prop jumps. Micro-setting (stamp in palm) becomes the emotional nexus, satisfying 9+ quick test. Minor cap: environment does not further evolve after lights return; hence holds just below 9.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prove sabotacy theory—signals early (three-week-old letters) and tightens when blackout defeats the lock, forcing the clandestine shoot. One meaningful deepening: realizing Preservation Society didn’t lose but was erased; this re-weights risk and forecloses open protest, pushing Marcus into secret-archivist stance. Escalation is causal under chosen lens; each photographed page raises on-page exposure cost. No coincidence in resolution; security proximity complicates, does not save. Price is legible: forfeiture of moral transparency—he must keep pretending. Just shy of 8.8 only because antagonistic pressure (security) is generic, not personalised.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: memory-as-resistance versus engineered forgetting; no overt thesis statements. Subtext lives in object-handling: the bronze stamp’s weight silently accuses. Final image reframes “stillness” from apathy to weaponised patience—Conceptual Repricing with undeniable social cost. Grandmother’s erased activism and Marcus’s indexing precision braid into a specific meditation on archival labour as insurgency. No moralising paragraph; wisdom is earned via the portfolio’s dates and stamp, not asserted. Complexity acknowledged—no tidy victory, only clandestine continuance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person close sustains tight psychic distance; diction (“tranquilly perceptive”, “pressure-groan”) is idiosyncratic enough to feel Marcus-specific. No dialogue, so bullets waived. Free-indirect slips are clean (“understanding shifting through him like light…”). Syntax grows clipped during security approach, mirroring pulse without abandoning baseline rhythm. No POV leakage; knowledge stays character-bound (he cannot decode security intent). Voice never editorialises beyond his professional perceptions; perceptual signature consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentences perform double duty: “Water damage darkened the lower drawers, but the upper tiers looked intact” simultaneously paints scene, hints time decay, and cues Marcus’s path. No scaffold loops; openings vary; no filler filters. Opening line hooks voice & stakes, closing line returns to “reclaimed stillness” with re-weighted resonance. One near-mixed metaphor (“light through deep water”) but it is character-appropriate and doesn’t dull closure. Prose stays spare, propulsive, information-dense; high-band clarity maintained.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Submerged-apocalypse archive is fresh venue; indexer-as-insurgent is a novel vocational angle on the conspiracy trope. Specificity of maritime-law compendium as trigger feels bespoke, not template. Transformation test passes: swap indexer skills and the plot collapses. Risk—quiet archive crawl—heightens intimacy without gimmickry. Down from 8.8 only because corporate-flood conspiracy concept itself is familiar; the innovation is execution, not premise core.</comment>
