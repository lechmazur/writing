<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Kira’s solitude-as-expedition turn is credible, but the text summarizes rather than dramatizes the moment she pivots from despair to mapping; the “choice” is asserted (“her motivation had crystallized”) rather than rendered as a micro-beat we can watch. Interiority is evocative yet drifts toward lyrical self-diagnosis (“alone wasn’t empty”). Still, her body-in-deck actions (charcoal warm on fingers, steady hand across page) keep her grounded, and the final Earned Stasis—continue mapping while millennia slide past—carries visible cost in eternal exile.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the compass rose flash on supernova re-weights “true north” as curiosity itself, sealing the arc with conceptual cost. Accumulative lens holds: temporal density (galaxies bloom/die in paragraphs) tightens until the final crystallization. One minor causality soft spot: the shutdown evacuation is off-stage exposition, but it doesn’t bend the final beat. Orientation anchor (who/where) lands by line 4; no penalty.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The glass bubble deck, charcoal-stained sketchbook, and warming compass rose applique are tactile micro-settings that literally constrain motion and supply the only anchor; spatial choreography stays consistent. Sensory economy favors warmth/touch over visual checklist, matching isolation. The supernova glint off the rose in the last paragraph recharges the object and environment simultaneously, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—map or surrender to madness—signals early; pressure escalates via temporal compression: minutes = centuries, so every sketch stroke costs irreversible exile. One meaningful tightening: realizing the compass rose is a time-anchor, she recommits to mapping amid accelerated star-death. Cost is legible: she forfeits reunion with a future that will never arrive. No external reversals, but accumulative deepening suffices under chosen lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: observation as self-creation of direction. Subtext coils around the double edge of “blessed pariah”—exile as freedom—without sermonizing. Final image reframes family tradition into personal cosmos-cartography, reweighting earlier sketches. A hair’s breadth below 8+ only because the insight is voiced once in reflective summary rather than pure image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person intimate sustains consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature skews to thermal/tactile detail fitting a lone watcher. Rhythm modulates: longer cadences for cosmic panorama, shorter bursts for charcoal strokes. Minor register lift into “temporal anomaly” jargon is brief and motivation-consistent; no head-hopping. Filter verbs minimal; internal monologue avoids therapy-speak.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical yet propulsive; sentences pull double duty (e.g., “galaxies aged and died in accelerated ballet” delivers image + stakes). Only micro-loop: “She sketched… She drew…” pair restates without new pressure. Metaphors stay coherent (compass as time-anchor, rose as gilded supernova mirror). No artifacts near closure; final line lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Familiar trope—lonely astronaut in time-dilated station—is refreshed by replacing telemetry logs with inherited charcoal sketching, making tradition the navigation tool. Specificity of family anniversary custom and the compass rose applique as temporal rather than spatial anchor feels non-obvious. Risk is moderate; payoff coherent. Conceptual re-pricing at end lifts it above mid-band.</comment>
