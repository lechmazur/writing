<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Marcus’s guilt and need for repair are palpable; the trembling hands and fifteen-year weight embody the stake. Interior contradiction—self-forgiveness versus duty—drives the present decision. The final micro-choice (committing to Thursday delivery) costs him lingering shame and is credibly earned. Voice remains priest-specific without lapsing into label-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal chain intact: withheld heart → guilt → second opinion → restoration promise → scheduled delivery; each beat narrows options. Closure is a Decisive Change with felt cost: Marcus finally schedules the hand-off, surrendering the refuge of private remorse. Orientation anchored by word 60; no lens ambiguity. One minor scaffold: “He walked… feeling lighter” states what the prior image already shows.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Shop is rendered through oil scent, suspended dust, and micro-tool detail; the lamp’s circle later mirrors the final focused choice. Objects (ballerina fragment, magnifier) double as emotional barometers. Spatial tracking clean; no white-room. Environment does not literally constrain tactics, so capped below 8.8.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will Marcus release the heart?—tightens once: seeing Sarah converts guilt into action, foreclosing the option to keep hiding. Pressure is coherent under causal lens; cost is the exposure of his fifteen-year failure. No escalation curve beyond the single turn, sufficient at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of restoration versus deserved brokenness emerges through the clockwork heart and the rainbow song, never sermonized. Final image reweights “broken things can sing” without moralizing. Subtext in Mrs. Chen’s “thank me when you see her face” implies transferred judgment. Complexity intact: Thomas remains guilty, Marcus remains fallible.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Marcus’s sensory filter; perceptual signature clerical (sacred/breakable diction). Rhythm modulates: longer sentences for rumination, clipped “Thank you”/“Don’t thank me yet” for final exhale. No head-hop; diction remains within priestly lexicon. Dialogue sparse but subtext-loaded.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong information density: “bell whispered rather than chimed” does two jobs. Varied sentence openings; no template cadence. One paraphrase loop: “vibrant hush” repeated near-identically in open and close; minor. Metaphors (light through storm clouds) coherent and singular. Clean copy; no scaffold obscures closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Music-box-restoration premise is familiar; freshness comes from executioner-father’s contrition object and chaplain intermediary. Specificity of the rainbow song and prison context lifts it above trope. No bold structural risk, but synthesis feels particular. Not quite unforgettable, yet above middle-ground safety.</comment>
