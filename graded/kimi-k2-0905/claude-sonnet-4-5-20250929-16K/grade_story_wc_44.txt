<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mira’s quietly deliberate precision is shown, not told, through her finger-tracing and methodical chart-checking; the interior contradiction between scholar and “shadow-being” is dramatized in the final cross-legged vigil. The micro-choice to insert the key and the later decision to “return” both grow from her established trait and carry visible conceptual cost. Sleeping-Mira’s “more solid” face supplies the external mirror that makes the flaw legible. Closure is earned: her stance crystallizes under the noon deadline she herself invokes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lattice is tight: spoon-bending → rune legibility → key vibration → hidden chamber → identity rupture → voluntary loop-closure. Orientation (who/where/when) is anchored by word 40 (“The observatory floated three miles above the cloudline”). The final image—Mira tracing “return” while dawn approaches—is a Charged Poise that reweights every prior shadow image with undeniable conceptual cost: she must choose between incomplete independence or integrated self. No teleporting props; the key’s magnetic resonance is set up before the hole appears.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The floating brass observatory, crystal walls, and Bent Constellation are sketched with economy; micro-setting (the invisible keyhole mapped by magnetic tremble) directly enables the decisive turn. Sensory hierarchy obeys Mira’s scholar priorities: rune sequences, charts, microscopic carving. Weather is absent but irrelevant; spatial choreography is clean—key, floor tile, cases, dawn line. The “more solid” face in glass charges the final image, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“where do shadows go?”—is signaled in paragraph 3 and escalates from metaphysical puzzle to literal existential erasure. The midpoint tightening occurs when she recognizes Kelm and herself in the cases: the option to remain a shadow is foreclosed as ontologically incomplete. Cost is legible: she must surrender either independent existence or wholeness. Agency drives every beat: her key-turn, her vigil, her pending noon decision.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of ontological authenticity versus constructed self emerges from the spoon-bent world rules, never abstractly stated. The shadow motif reconfigures from physical curiosity to metaphysical price. Final image offers no moral, only charged poise: trace “return” and wait. Subtext in “stars that had learned to whisper” and sealed awakenings implies civilizational complicity without sermon.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is scholar-poetic: “quietly deliberate precision,” “tertiary echoes,” “causation caught its own tail.” Perceptual signature filters every detail through rune-aware, magnet-sensitive attention. Syntax tightens under pressure—final paragraph drops to short clauses matching dawn countdown. No head-hopping; psychic distance stays close third. Diction stays within Mira’s plausible lexicon minus one near-miss (“conceptual” feels analytic but is earned by her textual training).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies from long spliced sentences to fragment staccato at closure. Information density high: one sentence can anchor setting, world rule, and character trait. No paraphrase loops; “shadow” recurs with reweighted meaning, not synonym churn. Metaphors are internally consistent (stars whisper, midnight presses like dark water). One minor scaffold: “She sat cross-legged… and began methodically working” could lose “methodically” without loss.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses cosmic-fantasy with identity philosophy; spoon-bending as loop-closure catalyst is non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Shadow-vanishing at noon repurposes a child’s question into existential stakes. Rune scholarship + clockwork automaton + sealed awakenings feels freshly synthesized, not checklist. Risk in second-self reveal is bold and paid off by voluntary merger tension.</comment>
