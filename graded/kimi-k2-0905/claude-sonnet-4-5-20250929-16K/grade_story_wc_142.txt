<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mira’s interior contradiction—selling gentrification while plotting resistance—drives every beat; the stone chip migrates from nostalgia anchor to seed metaphor with visible cost when she over-paints the yellow star. The final cooperative pivot is earned because her nightly graffiti practice has already rehearsed compromise through layered code. Still, Marcus remains a plot conduit rather than a pressure source; his stake in dual loyalty is asserted, not embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: demolition → encoded resistance → Marcus leak → cooperative proposal, each because/therefore link narrowing options. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the raised hands do not guarantee success but crystallize a new social contract with the felt cost of carnival identity diluted. Orientation is clean within 120 words; lens stays causal throughout. One scaffold lapse: “Three months later” is an un-cued time jump that slightly blurs escalation pacing.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The raft city is sketched through motion—ropes fray, booths rot, tourists stumble—so environment actively threatens choices. Graffiti surfaces (Ferris wheel underside, hall of mirrors) function as micro-settings that constrain how messages can be hidden and read. Sensory hierarchy favors sight and touch, appropriate to a painter protagonist. Final image of murals glowing at sunset recharges the setting without overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve carnival agency inside privatization—is signaled early and tightens when water-rights graffiti accelerates the council vote. Mira’s agency is decisive: she pivots from sabotage to cooperative shares, foreclosing pure resistance. Cost is visible: the yellow star slip shows mis-coding can evacuate her own side. Pressure escalates along one clean curve; no false cliffhangers.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—compromise as survival—emerges through graffiti layers: each over-paint literalizes erasure becoming foundation. The cooperative model is not moralized; it is tested by the council vote uncertainty. Stone chip reweights from relic to seed without thematic statement. Final image keeps ambiguity: carnival “evolved but not erased” invites both hope and loss.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Third-limited stays anchored to Mira’s painterly perception: spirals are “read,” colors carry urgency. Prose rhythm modulates—short beats for leaks, longer cadences for mural work—without drumbeat monotony. Filter verbs (“she felt”) are minimal and voice-motivated. Marcus’s dialogue is utilitarian; distinction is sacrificed to plot speed, acceptable at this length.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty: “tourists stumbled past, drunk on sugar and spectacle” advances crowd cover while encoding stakes. No paraphrase loops; each graffiti description adds new mechanical detail. One mixed metaphor streak—“a sprawling maze of platforms tethered together by rope and trust”—is forgiven because trust-as-cable becomes literal in closure vote. Line-level propulsion remains high through final mural glow.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Floating carnival meets encrypted graffiti resistance: synthesis feels inevitable, not gimmicky. Cooperative-share pivot reframes gentrification trope into collective bargaining micro-utopia. Risk taken—code language taught on the fly—pays off because decoding failure (yellow star) is dramatized. Could edge higher if Marcus’s developer lens carried equal embodied contradiction.</comment>
