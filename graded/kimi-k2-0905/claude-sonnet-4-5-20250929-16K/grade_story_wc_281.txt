<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Maya’s skepticism-turned-devotion is credibly embodied (checking fever though it’s useless; static-jump into Iris). Interior contradiction—warning Iris yet risking electrocution to re-open the pathways—drives every beat. The final camera lift is a micro-choice that crystallizes her hierarchy: love + witness > cure. Minor: Iris’s interior is delivered second-hand, softening the crucible effect.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each therefore is a physics or emotional experiment (shock → shared flicker → muscovite trials → diagnostic tool). Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the “lexicon” revalues loss into public good with visible cost—Maya’s last-frame camera admits the pathway will stay closed for Iris. Orientation clean by 60 words. No meaningful reversals, but one deepening suffices; cost is legible in the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Studio is concise micro-setting: LED array, damp palm, paper-thin geode—objects handled, not catalogued. Rainbows scatter once, then return reweighted in the “delicate as willowglass” line, charging closure. Body-as-setting works: fever palm, solar-plexus warmth anchor stakes. Spatial track survives the shock collision. Slight over-reliance on visual; other senses invited only once.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can lost neural intimacy be mapped/shared—tightens via each experiment narrowing to irreversible knowledge: no cure, only witness. Agency sits with Maya: she initiates every shock session and the final photographic act, paying with time, risk, and ultimate acceptance. Fractal “language” discovery reweights options for thousands, satisfying escalation under causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges without slogan: commodified intimacy → artisanal witness; shortcuts fail, laborious maps succeed. Motif of light-shifting (LED, camera, willowglass) quietly reconfigures value from private miracle to public lexicon. No final moral—just the camera’s click as earned answer. Minor abstraction in “willowglass hope” phrase, redeemed by contextual reprise.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Third-person close keeps perceptual signature: tactile skepticism (“skepticism felt hollow”), synesthetic body-map (“pressure behind left eye = curiosity”). Syntax stays calm under voltage: no rhetorical inflation. Dialogue sparse but subtextual—“You felt that.” registers as action, not confirmation. One filter clump: “she felt it—a foreign presence…” could excise “she felt it” without loss.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm clean; sentences vary; no template cadence. High info density: static jolt condenses into 3-second phenomenology plus forward engine (“What if electricity…”). Metaphors (time-lapse flowers, river deltas) are disciplined—one per beat, never stacked. Pronoun rock-solid across two women. Minor scaffolding: “not for the first time” could delete; doesn’t dull closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Takes the over-mined “telepathy pill” trope but flips to post-recall aftermath—a fresh angle. Invents artisanal, piezo-assisted somatic cartography; science feels handmade, not googled. Risky choice to offer no cure yet ends in hope: avoids miracle reset, earns conceptual cost. Transformation test passes—story collapses without light-painting + geode specificity. One echo: “fractally precise” repeated four times; could vary.</comment>
