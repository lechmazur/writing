<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation is clear and links to every move; the arrow-tip-as-key choice dramatizes her value hierarchy. Interiority stays concrete (“arrow tip lay cool in her palm”) rather than diagnostic. Final renunciation—arrow now dull—pays visible cost, satisfying earned stasis. No live contradictory impulses on the page hold it below 8.0.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: broken arrow → follow up-flow → cavern → plunge → planet-wide bloom. Inversion hour acts as tightening clock; failure risk is implied loss of orchards. Closure delivers decisive change plus felt cost (arrow spent, cycle renewed). One micro-turn only; no causal breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Floating-arch orchard is evoked through tactile flight and water reversal, not static postcard. Bioluminescent moss, magnetic boots, and spiralling pool anchor spatial logic. Environment directly enables climax: up-flow water is the conduit she must ride and then charge. Final green shockwave re-uses water network, binding setting to consequence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“find the vitality source or orchards eventually fail”—is signaled early and tested by inversion clock. Tightening occurs when silence forces engine cut and she surrenders to unknown current. Protagonist’s plunge of arrow is the irrevocable act that resolves stakes. Cost is visible: personal tool expended, future cycles still demand her vigil.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Resilience-through-collective-memory emerges from concrete spectacle rather than exposition. Final image of accelerated bloom grown from its own echoed history reweights premise without moralizing. Broken arrow’s spent state implies cyclical responsibility, inviting reflection on renewal versus depletion. Theme stays tacit; slight abstraction in “symphony of growth” keeps it under 8.0.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains steady psychic distance; perceptual signature leans on motion and temperature (“cool in her palm,” “hummed with new life”). Syntax modulates from long gliding sentences to short beats under peak silence. No head-hop or register drift. Strong control, but voice could carry more idiosyncratic diction to reach 8.5+.</comment>

<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, and image-dense; figurative language appears selectively (“silver leaf,” “petrified clouds”). No paraphrase loops or mixed metaphors. Occasional lush passives (“vine unfurled”) are purposeful, showing accelerated time. Closure line lands clean without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Gravity-flipped orchard navigated by reverse rivers gives a fresh eco-fantasy frame; arrow fragment as living seed-conduit feels non-obvious. Concept integrates with character goal and world logic rather than serving as set-dressing. Could edge higher with deeper cultural specifics of the orchards, but risk level and synthesis already outrun genre boilerplate.</comment>
