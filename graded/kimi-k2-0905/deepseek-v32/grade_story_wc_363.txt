<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Althea’s yearning is embodied in every silken motion, her stoic sparkle rendered as tactile refusal to cry; the final divestment of her own life-thread is credibly foreshadowed and motivated. Interior contradiction—love vs. self-erasure—remains active in-scene, not summarized. The only drag is a faint lyrical abstraction that occasionally blurs micro-choice into ornament, but the sacrifice lands with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: each image layer tightens the tapestry until Althea’s self-sacrifice reweights reality. Closure is a clean CR—Carver’s puzzle reassembles, the amber drops, and love is repriced across impossible time with undeniable conceptual cost. Orientation is taught early (“forgotten orchard deep in a bamboo forest”), transitions are legible, no causal snaps. Single non-closure quibble: the jigsaw gateway is introduced late yet still seeds the payoff, so only a whisper off perfect.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The orchard’s perpetual twilight, the amber bead’s fossilized firefly, and the Loom’s shuttle-click all function as micro-settings that constrain action: Althea can weave only what the sap will anchor. Sensory selection skews to touch and hush, mirroring her emotional choke. Spatial choreography is clean; bodies and threads track without drift. Environment directly guides the climax—her final thread is literally drawn from the orchard’s air—so the 9+ gate is met.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—deliver love across unbridgeable ravel—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens through each shard: puzzle pieces → amber bead → personal life-thread, each increment foreclosing retreat. The silence’s hunger supplies coherent external pressure; Althea’s agency escalates via material choices that cost years, memory, then existence. One meaningful deepening—realizing her own essence is the only sufficient thread—lands with legible price. Escalation is steady under Accumulative lens; no reversal required.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of love as an archival act—preserving what time unthreads—emerges through images of weaving, fossilized light, and jigsaw skies rather than assertion. Subtext operates in the bead’s warmth and the orchard’s hush, culminating in a non-literal answer: memory can re-stitch a frayed world if someone pays with their entirety. No moral is stated; the image of Carver’s palm holding a miniature sun reweights all prior abstraction into felt specificity. Minor abstraction keeps it just shy of 9+.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays consistently close to Althea’s wistful loom-perception; diction of “silken threads of moments” and “raveling silence” is patterned early and paid off. Rhythmic control peaks under pressure—“her form grew translucent, her wistful smile etched into the light”—without syntactic monotony. No dialogue to test, but internal voice carries distinct idiom. POV modesty holds: narrator never claims knowledge Althea doesn’t possess, and the brief shift to Carver is cleanly separated as a new shard.</comment>

<comment>Read-aloud rhythm breathes from hushed long sentences to the staccato “It shot away like a comet.” Figurative layering is dense but patterned, taught by the loom motif, so the density cap is waived. Zero paraphrase loops, no filter-verb stacks, pronouns clean. One clause—“stoically sparkling with unshed tears”—edges toward ornament repetition, but it recurs only twice and charges the final image, so artifact is minimal.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The loom-spinner who weaves reality from lost jigsaw time-shards is a fresh synthesis; the jigsaw-as-chronology portal avoids typical fantasy gate tropes. Latent sacrifice is not abstract—the final weave literally consumes the weaver, making the concept irreversible. Risky lyric accumulation could have collapsed into vagueness, yet it coheres under the textile pattern. Transformation is total: swap any element and the emotional math fails, satisfying the originality test.</comment>
