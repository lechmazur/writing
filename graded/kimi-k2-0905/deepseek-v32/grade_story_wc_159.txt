<comment>Arlen’s fixation on “preserving the sound of forgotten names” gives every move a crisp, idiosyncratic motive; the single micro-choice—channeling the score into the core—carries visible cost (the cracked tube glows, the name Elara rings, the library flares). Interiority stays concrete: “measured as a heartbeat,” “foxglove regret—beautiful, towering, quietly poisonous.” No contradiction under pressure; the exhaustion after the miracle is felt, not declared. Flaw: the endurance itself is slightly under-crystallized—no bodily price or irrevocable foreclosing beyond the existential—so the renunciation stops just short of 9-range agony.</comment>

<comment>The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: each relic hall adds density until the bamboo’s crack becomes the decisive pattern-break. Orientation is secured by word 60 (“opal library above clouds”). Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the wave of pearl-light re-illuminating every book is on-page, irreversible, and conceptually costly—the caretaker’s solitude is now eternal because every name is saved. Causality is tight: fossilized pulse → song echo → name blooms → light saved. No teleporting props; the bamboo’s transition from inert to singing is prepared by the resonance-pattern review.</comment>

<comment>The opal library, crystalline tree-index, and glass orchids are never mere postcard scenery; they channel Arlen’s tactics (proximity to index, access to song-gallery) and supply the final illumination. Sensory economy is exact: “liquid pearl,” “velvet shadows of obsolete nostalgia,” “soft inner light” all double as emotional registers. Spatial choreography is clean: the bamboo is carried back, held against the entry, then hums upward through fingers. The cracked tube itself functions as micro-setting that constrains the climax; without its crack-width the resonance cannot bloom.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—“preserve the sound of forgotten names or the last light dies”—is signaled in paragraph 1. Escalation is a single meaningful intensification: the fossilized pulse inside the bamboo proves the song must be used now, or Sonder shatters. The tightening is textural: each extinct-feeling hall adds weight until the song-gallery becomes the only remaining option. Cost is legible on-page: the name Elara is released, irreversible, and the caretaker’s future loneliness is sealed by the very saving.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without sermon: the price of preserving interconnection (Sonder) is the caretaker’s eternal outsider status—he saves the knowledge of “everyone’s vivid life” at the cost of living none. The foxglove-regret motif (beautiful, poisonous) carries the ambivalence. No character articulates the moral; the final image of trembling glass orchids reflecting a light that “knows their names” reweights the premise with quiet toxicity. The insight is earned: centuries of systematic tending culminate in a single poisonous bloom of success.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Arlen’s perceptual filter; no head-hopping. Syntax mirrors his methodical mind: long,冷静 clauses that suddenly fracture in the climax—“a visible resonance.” Diction remains inside his lexicon: “spectral records,” “decay-rhythm,” “foxglove regret.” No filter-verb stacks; metaphor is sparse, precise, and taught early (opal, pearl, foxglove). The final hum of the bamboo is rendered as synesthetic image rather than explanatory tell.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with the quest: languid cadence through the halls, then short, percussive sentences at the release. No paraphrase loops; each sentence adds either atmospheric density or causal detail. Metaphors are coherent (opal → pearl → liquid light) and physically consistent. Opening line anchors stakes immediately; final line (“reflecting a light that knew their names”) resolves by image that recharges the motif. Minor slip: “gently systematic precision” appears twice in distant paragraphs—acceptable echo, not scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The fusion of extinct emotions, auditory nomenclature, and a crystalline cloud-library feels inevitable yet unseen before. The cracked bamboo as deliberate resonator reverses the broken = ruined cliché. The choice to save “Sonder” (a neologism for interconnection) rather than love or rage is non-obvious and conceptually bold. Specificity throughout—foxglove regret, velvet shadows, liquid pearl—prevents abstraction. Risk: lyric accumulation could have collapsed into gimmick, but the closure image justifies the pattern.</comment>
