<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Kael’s numbness is consistently dramatized through his flat reactions; the micro-choice to channel “the void of his ego death” into vivification gives a credible, embodied turn. Yet the interior contradiction—feeling nothing versus the will to protect—stays more asserted than lived in scene; the single word *Brother* is too slight to manifest a full emotional cost on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Causal spine holds: because Kael is declared template, therefore he must face the clone; because he channels emptiness, the brain awakens. The custody ruling lands as an earned Decisive Change with visible cost—the lawyers vanish, the brain pulses, Kael registers “faintest warmth”—and the lens stays causal throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Floating dojo, rewriting sky, and amber-lit brain are sketched with economy; the jar becomes the micro-setting that constrains every beat. Spatial choreography is clean—hand on glass, filaments glowing—but the larger world rules (how history rewrites, why banners appear) remain evocative rather than tested.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—possession of the clone—tightens once the lawyer’s scorn triggers Kael’s protective will, narrowing options to vivify or lose. Escalation is single but sufficient: the custody hearing forces the on-page vivify act that costs Kael his last pretense of total numbness.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of feeling-through-absence emerges from the complementary-opposites method and the final image of warmth born of emptiness; no overt thesis is stated. The clone custody question reframes personhood as emergent rather than owned, landing with conceptual cost when custody is granted to “the whole.”</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Third-person stays tight to Kael’s perceptual filter; diction is controlled, rhythmic, slightly elevated without drifting outside his plausible lexicon. No head-hopping; the corporate lawyers’ voices are distinct through legalistic cadence that contrasts with Liren’s stone-grind idiom.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Sentences vary in length and rhythm; information density is high—each line advances image, stake, or tactic. No loops, scaffold, or register drift; metaphor (“clean blade of clarity”) is sparse, precise, and earned under pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The ego-death survivor vivifying his own dead clone through reverse emotional alchemy feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Conceptual risk—using emptiness as activation—pays off without late rule changes; the rewritten-history sky stays background rather than gimmick.</comment>
