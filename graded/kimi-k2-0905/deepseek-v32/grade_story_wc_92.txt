<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Aris’s calm-inventive trait is shown through tactile beats (flint strike, ink copying) that embody his covert agenda; the quill-holder-as-archive tightens the final image. Interiority stays concrete (“heft a comfort,” “scratch of nib”) and contradiction is implied rather than staged, nudging him just below the 9-band. A sharper micro-choice that visibly costs him—smudged ink, burnt finger—would crystallize the trade-off and push higher.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Causal chain is clean: blackout → spark-key → archive opened → truths copied → holder sealed, each because/therefore link visible. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: “fire that would not show itself with a roar” charges the holder with social cost. Orientation is anchored by word 70; no debt applied. One minor elasticity—sundial code deciphered off-stage—keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Half-painted sundial doubles as micro-setting and lock; its stone grooves and twilight ember constrain the only workable key. Fort is sketched through selective blackout cues (“sterile light” returning) rather than panorama, keeping economy. The quill holder’s weight recurs as bodily anchor. Environment never over-describes; each detail either limits action or reappears in the charged final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—knowledge liberation—tightens once: sparks travel grooves, archive door whispers open, option space shifts from locked-out to copy-or-not. Cost is intellectual exposure rather than bodily risk, made legible in the final flicker of fort light that will soon collide with his pages. Could edge higher if a single beat showed personal jeopardy (sentinel oath violated, identifiable ink trace).</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme of “illumination vs. hoarded light” emerges entirely through action—sparks, lantern, copied pages—never abstract assertion. Final image reweights the premise: two lights now coexist, the institutional and the insurgent, leaving moral balance unstable. No thematic echo line mars the close; meaning is carried by the warm bronze cylinder. Subtext in the abandoned sundial as obsolete truth-keeper is nicely understated.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Third-person POV stays tight to Aris’s perceptual filter: angles of stone noticed, comfort of bronze weight, hush tasted. Syntax lengthens during calm transcription, shortens during spark-strike, mirroring pulse. No head-hop or filter-verb clutter. One lyrical reach—“lightning in miniature”—is earned by immediate tactile cause. Voice feels singular, neither genre-default nor over-cranked.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, high-density: “Each spark…traced the angles like lightning in miniature” does two jobs (visual + causality). No loops, scaffold, or register drift. Opening line anchors stakes; closing line resolves to image. Minor cadence repetition in “he” subject openings mid-text knocks off 0.1, but artifacts never touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Revolution-through-micro-printing in a light-locked fort feels fresh; sundial-as-cipher repurposes “obsolete” tech. Spark-cradle motif grows from literal flint to metaphorical dawn without late rule invention. Could push 8.5+ if blackout cause remained ambiguous yet personally consequential to Aris, deepening risk. Still, synthesis of light-monopoly and scribal resistance is non-obvious and memorable.</comment>
