<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Elara’s warmly observant nature is shown through tactile attention to the cicada and pool, but her interiority stays safely lyrical; no contradictory impulse or micro-choice visibly risks anything. Kael’s shift from anger to soft curiosity is told, not embodied—his silence never scrapes back at her, so the relationship crucible never heats. The final “low tide” insight is gently shared, yet neither character pays a felt cost for holding or releasing the friendship; the closure is cozy, not charged.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: concentric drip-rings and cicada symbolism slowly reweight the parting stake into cyclical acceptance. Anchors (who/where/when) are clear by line 4; no orientation penalty. Closure lands as Charged Poise—the cicada passed, the low-tide metaphor accepted—but the cost is conceptual, not viscerally felt on the page; the friendship’s future remains suspended without a visible price paid now. One meaningful tightening occurs when the cicada is handed over, shifting the conversation’s temperature; pattern holds.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Grotto, pool, stars, and drip-rings are filtered through Elara’s tidal-eye; each detail does double duty as emotional mirror and time metaphor. The jade cicada functions as micro-setting that constrains the final gesture—its warmth and symbolism must be handled to enable the shift. Spatial choreography is clean: rock, pool, reflected stars, hand-to-hand pass. No weather or world-level exposition required; selective sensory economy keeps the cathedral intimate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether they must part—is signaled early but stays abstract; no concrete consequence (distance, job, third party) is risked on the page. Pressure rises only as emotional silence; the single micro-turn is the cicada hand-off, which softens rather than narrows options. Cost is metaphorical (“low tide” acceptance) rather than a forfeiture readers can feel. Sufficient for accumulative arc, but lacks a tangible price that alters next actions.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of transition-as-fertile-pause emerges through cicada lore, drip-rings, and tidal imagery; no explicit thesis statement until the final “low tide” line, which still leans aphoristic. Subtext resides in the unspoken fear of fracture, but the story chooses consolation over complexity. The image reweights prior material gently, inviting reflection without tidy moral. Could ascend higher if the cost of embracing flux were dramatized rather than likened.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays obediently inside Elara’s perceptual bias: tidal diction, patience with silence, synesthetic time-texture. No head-hopping; psychic distance contracts smoothly from cosmic stars to thumb-on-cicada wing. Rhythm modulates—long contemplative sentences under starlight, shorter declarative when she speaks. Dialogue is minimal but carries indirection; Kael’s two spoken lines feel plausibly halting. Voice remains distinctive without mannered overload.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical yet propulsive; most sentences do two jobs (image + emotional tilt). Occasional mild loft—“ cathedral of stone,” “cosmic alignment”—but figurative layering is sparse enough to avoid purple drift. No paraphrase loops or template cadence; drip-ring returns are purposeful. One mixed metaphor: “time felt…monumental and slow” beside “slippery with algae” —minor, does not cloud closure. Clean grammar, strong verbs, vivid nouns.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>Combining tidal-pool science with grotto starlight yields a fresh ecological-spiritual hybrid; cicada as transition totem is familiar but re-angled through chronicler lens. Parting conversation is stock, yet the tangential foresight method gives it uncommon pacing. Risk level is moderate—lyric stillness overplot—but execution stays coherent. Does not break into unforgettable territory because the emotional stakes remain generic friendship drift.</comment>
