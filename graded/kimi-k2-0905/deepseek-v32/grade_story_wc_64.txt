<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Elm’s “blithe” trait is asserted but never contradicted under pressure; his interiority drifts into poetic summation (“focused reverence”) rather than embodied contradiction. No micro-choice shows him sacrificing cheer or paying a palpable cost—he simply learns and keeps gardening. The absence of relational pressure or visible flaw keeps the arc flat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the tapestry reweights Elm’s caretaking with historical purpose. Causal chain is thin—discovery of the black-wool thread converts to “reconciliatory artifact” in one unattended leap—so the lens wobbles between Accumulative and Causal. Orientation is clear by ~100 words; no penalty applied.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Velveteen gloom, cobalt silo starlight, and the tapestry’s “whispers of blue, gold, and crimson” are vivid, selective, and POV-filtered. The cemetery micro-setting constrains Elm’s path: every grave he gardens becomes a node on the decoded map. Environment thus charges the final image—he now gardens “with insight into the echoes”—meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—uncover why the tapestry was hidden—tightens once when the black thread implies a founder-assassination plot, then softens into “protective, not malicious.” Escalation is informational rather than tactical; no option is foreclosed for Elm, no price exacted. Pressure remains atmospheric, not instrumental under a Causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges quietly: caretaking as historical repair. The tapestry converts private grief into communal cartography, reframing gardening as stewardship of buried reconciliations. Final image—“each stone as a note in a silent symphony”—reweights earlier motifs without moralizing. Complexity is modest but coherent.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Elm’s perceptual filter: “dust motes danced in starlight,” “threads were tenderly organized.” Syntax lengthens and softens to match contemplative mood; no head-hopping. Prose texture is consistent, with painterly diction that never drifts outside Elm’s plausible lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Sentences vary in length and rhythm; strong verbs (“wheeled,” “clung,” “traced”) anchor description. Occasional stack of two adjectives (“velveteen gloom,” “cobalt silo”) is patterned and purposeful. No loops or mixed metaphors; one paraphrase loop (“uncharted echoes seemed to whisper…uncharted echoes resonated”) mildly dulls immediacy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fusing cemetery gardening with cartographic tapestry is fresh; the sovereign case-as-time-capsule avoids typical treasure cliché. The reconciliatory reading of an assassination thread is an inventive reversal. Risk is moderate—lyric stillness over thriller beats—but execution feels specific rather than templated.</comment>
