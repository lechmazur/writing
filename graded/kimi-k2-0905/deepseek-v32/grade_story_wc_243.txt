<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Elara’s quietly obsessive need to trap every “small moment” is embodied in her micro-brush strokes and the tactile warmth of the locket; her contradictory impulse—to arrest time yet steep in its flow—drives every beat. The final decision to keep archiving after the past bleeds into the present is earned: she pays with the ache of never joining her sister in the living image. Interiority stays concrete (“walnut ink dried on the page, capturing this night”) and avoids label-speak. One slip: the sister is never given a contradictory desire, so the relationship crucible is one-sided; still, the self-to-memory tension suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: each sensory layer (jasmine closing, ink drying, photo shimmering) tightens the stake in preservation until the final image reconfigures cost—archiving is no longer retrospective but generative. Closure lands with unmistakable Charged Poise: the jetty breathes, the photo now contains Elara herself, and the covenant is revived with conceptual price—she must keep returning or the magic dies. No orientation debt; anchors clear by line 4. Causality intact: glow intensifies because she archives, not coincidence. One micro-turn at locket shimmer is sufficient for 700-word scope.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The blooming jetty is not backdrop but instrument: jasmine valves control light access, planks determine where ink can fall without blotting, tide rhythm sets the archival clock. Micro-setting rule satisfied: the locket’s hinge, the walnut-ink droplet, and the cooling rail become pivot-points that constrain how delicately she can work. Sensory hierarchy obeys Elara’s archivist eye—sound is hushed, scent is catalogued, visual detail is inventoried—never tourist-catalog. Spatial choreography stays clean: she never occupies an impossible position while the photo warms against her skin.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—preserve the weight of small moments—tightens when the past begins to co-presence the present, forcing Elara to decide whether to keep cataloguing or step into the living memory. Escalation is textural: each archival stroke increases floral luminosity, raising the cost of stopping. Visible price: the photo now includes her, meaning she is simultaneously witness and specimen—an ontological forfeiture. Would enter 9-band if the forfeiture altered her next physical action on the page (e.g., she hesitates before turning a page), but the beat ends on observation rather than tactic shift.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: preservation is not taxidermy but pollination—archiving feeds the very life it tries to freeze. The regenerated covenant reprices the premise: memory is not static deposit but living symbiosis. Final image of “the jetty breathed” offers non-literal answer without moralizing. No thematic echo or final-paragraph thesis statement; concept stays implicit in the glowing jasmine inked into the page.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Lyric-accumulative voice taught early via patterned anaphora (“She…”) and pays off in the cadence of the closing litany. Perceptual signature is archivist-specific: light is “documented,” air is “catalogued,” silence is “shelved.” No head-hopping; single POV stable. Register stays within Elara’s plausible lexicon—no academic drift. Rhythm modulates: longer clauses when she steep-recalls, staccato fragments when locket warms, mirroring attention narrowing under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or synonym churn; each sentence advances image or pressure. Figurative language is spare and concrete (“glow emerged from the jasmine” not “flowers bled light”). Opening line anchors voice and stake simultaneously. Final line “the jetty bloomed forever in her archives” recharges motif without metaphor overload. No scaffold; information density high—one sentence often performs scene-setting, sensory data, and causal cue.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</comment>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: archival obsession + living memory flora + twilight covenant is non-template. Risk taken—quiet lyric escalation instead of antagonist plot—pays off in coherence. Specific detail: walnut ink made from “crushed shells and patience” is irreproducible. Transformation test fails if relocated to generic pier, proving specificity. Derivative guardrail waived: no famous precursor for photo-into-live-archive bloom.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>Setup: first sentence. Development: every brush-stroke tightens floral glow. Closure: she vows to keep archiving to sustain the magic—action directly tied to occupation. Cost visible: ontological inclusion in her own archive. Irreplaceable: no other trade could create the living ink symbiosis.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Two beats: opened pre-glow, reopened when it warms. Re-weighted meaning: from static keepsake to portal that now includes Elara. Closure participant: photo’s new image justifies the covenant revival. Swappability low: any other memento would lack the hinge mechanism that allows the reveal.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Early signal: “regenerated covenant formed.” Development: covenant revives because she archives—tactic changes to sustain glow. Closure: she vows to honor it nightly, linking covenant to perpetual duty. Conceptual cost: eternal return or magic expires.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Trait constrains action: gentle thoroughness slows her enough to notice micro-glow changes; faster archivist would miss the photo shimmer. Enables trade-off: meticulous ink mixing allows capture of living light—sloppy batch would fail. Visible cost: time spent documenting prevents stepping into the living image.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Steeping is dramatized: she pauses, breathes jasmine, lets memory “soak.” Enables discovery that glow responds to recalled weight. Closure linkage: steeping lets her feel the covenant’s price—she must keep soaking nightly. Swappable with mild synonym (“dwell”) but loses tea-leaf specificity tied to ink maceration.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.9</answer>
<comment>Method taught early: “Through proximate causes she understood…” and lists light, air, tide. Mechanics matter: identifying these triggers lets her realize her archiving is itself a proximate cause. Closure: she names her nightly archiving as the sustaining cause. Cost: causal knowledge makes her responsible for perpetuating the magic.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Setup: first paragraph anchors jetty, jasmine, dusk. Development: closing blooms force her to work faster—time pressure. Closure: jetty “breathes” only because she keeps archiving—setting becomes agent. Spatial resources: wooden planks limit where she can place ink without tidal smear. Irreplaceable: no other venue combines tidal rhythm, night blooms, and sister memory.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Twilight → night transition tracked by bloom closure and cooling air, forming live clock. Tightens choice: must finish page before full dark loses detail. Closure beat pinned to final darkness when glow peaks. Time not vague: each paragraph marks deeper dusk.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Motivation dramatized in first paragraph and re-stated under pressure: “preserve the weight of small moments.” Conflict: preservation traps her outside the living memory—she wants to join sister but must keep archiving. Closure cost: foregoes entering the photo to sustain the jetty’s life—preservation trumps reunion.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.8</question>
<comment>Tone coherent: joy in glowing blooms, ache in sister absence, wonder at merger. Modulates: starts quiet, rises to shimmer euphoria, settles into sweet ache. Charges final image: “haunted euphoria” named in penultimate paragraph, crystallized in smiling through tears. Not static: tone shift tracks escalation from observation to covenant.</comment>
