<comment>Elara’s face-blind, fractal perception is dramatized through tactile micro-choices (coin-reading, wall-press sequence) that directly enable the plot; the arc is a credible renunciation—she saves pigment, not books—whose cost is legible in the final image. Interiority stays concrete, never drifting into therapeutic self-labeling. The sole absence: no secondary character on-page to test status dynamics, but at this length the solitary crucible suffices.</comment>

<comment>Causal chain is airtight: coin-map → wall-panel → pigment recipe → escape under demolition clock; each link shrinks options until the Earned Stasis of sealing the jar while the tree falls. Closure carries undeniable conceptual cost—“she had not saved the library” reweights the stake from rescue to extraction. No orientation debt; anchors (who/where/when) are fixed by word 60.</comment>

<comment>The hollowed trunk is not backdrop but toolbox: growth-rings become cipher-key, obsidian mortar is handled on-page, and the final pigment literalizes the setting’s interior sky. Spatial choreography is flawless—panel swings inward, jar is cradled, distance to idling machines tracked. Micro-setting (coin, vials, clay jar) constrains every tactical move, charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—extract the zenith-sky pigment before demolition—tightens continuously; the distant growl of machinery is a metronome that accelerates grinding and sealing. One meaningful tightening: the coin-map narrows infinite library walls to one hexagonal panel, foreclosing search. Cost is visible—she forfeits the books themselves, accepting archival loss for chromatic memory.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: the limits of perception become the means of preservation—what can’t be read (guild script) is superseded by what can be felt (coin ridges, raised ink). The final image reframes the premise: art can rescue a fragment of sky, not knowledge. No moralizing; resonance is carried by the clay jar’s cool weight against approaching dust.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person POV remains tight inside Elara’s tactile cognition; diction stays painterly (“fractally precise,” “light raked across”) yet never exceeds her perceptual lexicon. Rhythmic control mirrors pressure—long sentences for ritual grinding, staccato fragments during collapse. No head-hop or filter-verb clutter; every sentence is sensate, never expository.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence advances action or pigment alchemy without scaffold. Metaphors are precise—“blue so profound it seemed to pull the very light from the room”—and never layered to purple. Zero loops or synonym churn; technical guild terms (distilled sky-water, dawn quartz) are accurate and motivated. Opening and closing lines anchor and recharge the sky motif.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The face-blind artist who saves color, not text, is a fresh synthesis of archive-heist and creation myth; the coin-topography map feels inevitable yet unprecedented. Risk—using tactile literacy as plot engine—pays off without obscuring clarity. Specificity of pigment recipe and tree-ring cipher prevents generic swapability; the premise would collapse if Elara could read guild script.</comment>
