<question>1</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Leo’s obsession is palpably embodied—wading chest-deep, diving, cradling the cello—but the interior contradiction between “lately inspired by half-remembered melodies” and “inspired not by sound, but by its absence” is asserted rather than dramatized; we never feel the tug between these impulses in a single, pressured beat. The final renunciation (playing silence) is foreshadowed, yet the cost feels atmospheric rather than personal: no specific memory, identity stake, or concrete loss is surrendered on the page. Still, his micro-choices track cleanly and the embodied emotion is strong enough to earn mid-band credibility.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The causal spine holds: water-stain map → dive → cylinder → silence-score → released chord. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—playing the absences reweights the world for both ghost and living. Cost is legible in the single echoing chord that “costs” the pristine silence forever. One minor wobble: the program’s water-reactive ink is revealed post-plot rather than seeded, a late rule, but it does not break the final moment.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The flooded opera house is not backdrop but instrument: water height impedes every stride, lanterns dictate visibility, floating cello case becomes raft. The “dark volume beneath the balcony overhang” is a spatial threat that funnels Leo toward the pit. Micro-setting (grooved chair leg) literally houses the clue. Final image—the hall itself sounding—recharges every prior sensory detail, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Stake is singular: decode the ghost. Pressure tightens once: map appears → dive risk → silence performance. The tightening is tangible—lung burn underwater, bow hair kissing string without contact—but options do not meaningfully narrow thereafter; once Leo chooses “play the silences,” no live alternative is foreclosed. Cost is atmospheric resonance rather than a visible price (instrument damage, physical exhaustion, social repercussion) so escalation stops just short of high-band punch.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme—music lives in silence—emerges through concrete dramatization: stains bloom into staves, bow hovers above strings, hall answers with unstruck chord. No character moralizes the insight; the final reconfiguration makes the idea undeniable without pronouncement. The concept repurposes flood, program, and architecture as silent notation, achieving specificity over abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person lingers inside Leo’s sensory filter: “pressure of the water and the silence in the in between spaces,” perceptual signature fixed on resonance, gap, hush. Syntax lengthens and contracts with submersion and breath. No head-hop; vocabulary stays within a cellist’s lexicon (“harmonics,” “fingerboard positions”). Distinct rhythmic control at climax—single-sentence chord release—matches the hush it describes.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, high-density; most sentences carry dual duty (action + atmosphere). One scaffold loop: “He…He…He…” triad in paragraph 3 creates template cadence but does not propagate into climax. Mixed metaphor risk—“water itself as a pen”—is forgiven because the governing metaphor is sustained and paid off. No paraphrase loops, no filter-verb stacks; clarity at closure spotless.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Flood-as-manuscript and silence-as-score fuse two fresh angles; neither feels grafted. The ghost’s communication medium (progressive water stains) is non-obvious and inevitable in hindsight. Transformation test fails if Leo were a pianist or the venue a theatre, proving specificity. Risk (+0.3) in choosing sonic negative space as narrative engine pays off without obscuring plot.</comment>
