<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The nameless survivor’s compulsion to “layer” stories into a missing self is concrete, embodied, and consistent; the final moment where he presses the poison label to steel and feels the “terrifying, beautiful softness” shows contradiction held in scene. Interiority stays sensory—rust, spice, echo—never drifting into diagnostic speech. No second character appears, so relationship crucible is N/A; the arc is earned renunciation, not change, and the cost (accepting un-naming) is legible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the label crystallizes that the poison, not the clerical error, scoured identity; the container wall becomes Charged Poise—options narrowed to eternal namelessness with felt cost. Causality under Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each overheard tale adds density until the aconite story pattern-breaks into personal shard. Orientation anchors by line 4 (“greasy water between the colossal steel cliffs”); no teleporting props or retro patches.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The port-container labyrinth is lived-in, tidal, and tactile; steel temperature and rust guide micro-choices like retreating into a chosen cube. The poison label micro-setting recharges the final image—its “rough pulp” against cool steel literalizes the mind-as-container metaphor. Spatial choreography is clean; no white-room syndrome. Tide rhythm tracks causally with low-tide discovery and night-flask confession.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recover the grain of a lived memory—signals early and tightens when the label links to aconite poisoning, foreclosing the option of full restoration. Escalation is textural: story fragments accumulate until the purple-flower shard ruptures the blank slate; cost is the searing gut-heat and the realization that love administered the dose. Agency remains in the layering act; no coincidence resolves the tension.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: erasure as both violence and mercy—bureaucratic paper and maternal tea unmake the self. The poison label’s recurrence reweights from curiosity to origin, offering conceptual repricing without moralizing. Final image of “rough pulp… terrifying, beautiful softness” fuses love and annihilation. Ambiguity lingers: is namelessness freedom or void?</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays tightly bound to the survivor’s sensory filter; diction—“greasy water,” “hollow echo”—is character-specific. Rhythm swells with tidal cadence, then compresses at the gut-flash memory. No dialogue to test voice distinction; internal voice coherent. One clause edges toward editorial—“the perfect metaphor for his mind”—but slips by inside POV reflection.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence or synonym loops. Figurative language is sparse and precise—“metallic symphony marking time”—never clogging high-pressure beats. Information density high: one sentence layers story, scent, and sound. Final line lands clean without scaffolding.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fusing bureaucratic death-error with aconite amnesia feels fresh; the container-port as externalized memory palace is specific and non-obvious. Risk in lyric accumulative structure pays off: closure reconfigures without forced twist. Could not swap setting or object without collapsing metaphoric logic.</comment>
