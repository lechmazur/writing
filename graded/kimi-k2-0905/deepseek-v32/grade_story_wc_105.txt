<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s synesthesia and childhood wound give her a concrete perceptual engine and emotional stakes; the moment she flinches at the chime shows embodied cost. Yet the text keeps her at a mythic distance—no contradictory impulse in scene, no micro-choice that risks failure—so the “designer” expertise never affects tactics. The arc is a smooth quest-to-success without a visible fork where she might refuse or lose something on the page. Closure is resonant but not earned stasis; the device is finished, not tested on another human, so relationship crucible remains off-stage.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each sensory layer (color-hearing, orchard pulse, shipwreck groan) thickens the dominant stake—making betrayal audible—until the final imprint reweights meaning. Orientation is swift: who/where/by-when crystalline inside 50 words. The forge ignition and thermal-shift imprint supply a single meaningful tightening that forecloses the option of “unknowing” the sound; cost is legible in her flinch. No因果 reversal, but pattern break (hope-color bleeding through grim brown) satisfies RR.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Sunken greenhouse, saline-fed branches, kelp-draped wrecks—each detail does double duty, mirroring Elara’s internal fracture/regrowth. The ashen forge breaches the dome ceiling, a micro-setting that literally constrains the final act (thermal shift required). Sensory hierarchy obeys synesthetic bias: colors heard, not seen. Spatial choreography clean; water depth, dome radius, and forge position remain consistent across moves.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—capture the sound of trust breaking—signaled in line 2 and escalates by layering absences into audible crackle. Pressure grows accumulatively: each silence filtered raises the moral cost of weaponizing private pain. The forge beat narrows options to “finish or forget”; she pays with childhood gray-memory resurfacing. Price is visible (flinch) but external; no live relationship is risked, capping the upper band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges from motif chain: absence → fracture → possible regrowth, mirrored by orchard cell division. No moral stated; final silver note of hope is weighted against grim brown pain, leaving ambiguous whether the device warns or wounds. Subtext operates in the unspoken crackle—betrayal made audible yet not shown in human encounter. The reconfiguration lands: knowledge of the sound is now loose in the world, conceptual cost felt.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited clings to Elara’s synesthetic filter: “she heard the colors of the flames” keeps perceptual signature consistent. Rhythm modulates—long saline-fed clauses vs. stark “the forge glowed”—tracking thermal intensification. No dialogue, so voice contamination avoided. Free indirect clean: “This was where memories were imprinted…” stays within her lexicon. Compression taught early (“collecting absences”) and paid off at imprint.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentence openings avoid template cadence. Information density high—single sentences fold world rule, sensory twist, and emotional cue. One mixed metaphor cluster (“impact of memories weighed… echoed in present deafness”) but does not touch closure. No scaffold loops; paragraph cuts tight. Filter verbs minimal and voice-motivated. Line-level artifacts absent in final third, keeping 9+ eligibility intact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Synthesis of synesthetic prosthetics, underwater orchard, and memory-forge feels inevitable yet fresh; no trope checklist aroma. The “sound of trust breaking” reframes relationship trauma as engineerable frequency—a conceptual risk that pays off. Transformation test fails if Elara is renamed mechanic or violinist, confirming specificity. Risk heightens stakes without obscuring clarity; derivative premise guardrail waived.</comment>
