<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elan’s desire to reveal hidden value is embodied in tactile glass-work and the pond-ritual; the etched pane triggers a credible micro-choice to preserve rather than discard, showing a values hierarchy. Interiority stays concrete, filtered through glazier perception. The final stance—light is for reading, not only seeing—carries visible cost as he permanently re-arrays his workspace, renouncing pure utility. Secondary pressure is absent (no on-page relationship crucible), capping full depth.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens: pattern of light-images (mist, prism, etched map) intensifies until the final spectral cast reweights the premise. Causality is associative—rings → clouds → reframed glass—but coherent within lyric design. Closure lands as Charged Poise: spectral map appears, fishermen pause, pattern fades; cost is felt permanence of transient illumination. Orientation is swift; no prop or knowledge teleporting.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sea-mist greenhouse, brackish pond, salt-caked windows rendered through glazier’s selective eye; glass and water recur as tools that refract choice. Spatial choreography is clean; weather affects visibility and timing of spectral reveal. Micro-setting (etched pane) literally charges the final image by casting colored lines. Tool-as-setting satisfies 9+ gate; environment constrains the decision to enshrine rather than discard.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—make townsfolk see worth in ordinary glass—gains pressure via discovery of hidden keeper text; escalation is textural density of light-images culminating in spectral map. One meaningful tightening: keeper’s “noctilucent” warning reframes Elan’s task from replacement to preservation, narrowing options. Cost is permanent display of flawed pane, forfeiting perfect repair. No external antagonist; internal shift suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through refracted light motif: value hides in wavelengths missed by casual glance. Subtext resides in Elan’s silence—he never lectures, merely arranges glass so townsfolk must interpret. Final line offers resonant, non-moralizing takeaway (“some light is meant for reading”). Ambiguity lingers: fishermen see colors but not text—gap between perception and legibility is thematic engine.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person hovers close to glazier perception; diction of “salt-caked,” “lead and fracture,” “spectral colors” mirrors occupational lens. Rhythm modulates—long clauses for misty calm, short pulses for etched discovery. No head-hopping; unreliability absent. Single line of dialogue carries subtext: fisherman’s question met with metaphoric reply that advances Elan’s new stance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Sentences are clean, varied, propel without scaffold; figurative language is sparse and purposeful. No mixed metaphors or loops. Opening anchors tone and stakes; closing image re-casts prior motifs. One minor filter-verb cluster during pond beat (“he focused”) but immediacy recovers. Proofing clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Occupational POV (glazier) + noctilucent code etched in lighthouse glass offers fresh angle on “hidden beauty” trope. Stone-ring divination method is particular, not generic mysticism; links glazier’s precision to ripples. Final spectral map feels inevitable yet surprising. Slight risk in lyric structure rewarded by coherent closure.</comment>
