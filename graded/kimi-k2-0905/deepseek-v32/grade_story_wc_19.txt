<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Leo’s claustrophobia and porcelain-anchor are vivid; the contradictory drive to seek enveloping silence to escape enclosure is dramatized in body and micro-choice. Interiority stays concrete, never diagnostic. Final stance—claustrophobia “manageable” via tasted silence—earns its cost through the tapestry’s creation and panic beat on the trellis.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Clear causal chain: inversion window → ascent → collection → panic → corrective focus → descent with tangible tapestry. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: silence reweighted from threat to portable companion, cost paid by mid-air terror and time squeeze. Orientation anchored by 120 wds; lens held.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Subtle bunker/trellis polarity grounds spatial logic; floating lattice details (glowing vines, air-roots) constrain movement and harvest tactics. Sensory hierarchy obeys Leo’s filtered-mask limitations, sharpening taste/feel over sight. The porcelain doll functions as micro-setting that charges the final image—irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—harvest silence to blunt claustrophobia—faces live test when gilded hush thickens into near-solid panic, tightening options under causal lens. Protagonist agency: Leo limits exposure, refocuses on doll-tool, pays with spike of terror. Cost is felt, visible, and alters final stance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme—silence as both cage and key—emerges through sensory transformation rather than statement. Porcelain doll’s reprise (cool anchor → root-tool → warm keepsake) reweights silence from oppressive void to portable inner space, closing the arc with earned ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-limited voice stays tight to Leo’s perceptual filter; compressed phrasing mirrors mounting pressure (“throat tightening,” “stretching contracted emotions”). No head-hop; diction within plausible lexicon. Rhythm accelerates during inversion, breathes during descent—purposeful modulation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Taut information density: one sentence often serves atmosphere, motive, and motion (“He inhaled slowly, tasting the silence: it was sweet yet metallic…”). Metaphors are precise, never mixed; zero loops or filler. Final image crystallizes without overwritten flourish.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fusion of claustrophobia with aerial silence-garden feels fresh; inversion-hour rule and tasteable quiet create new metaphoric physics. Porcelain doll sprouting air-roots transforms familiar comfort-object into extraction tool—specific, memorable. Concept commits fully; no retreat to safety.</comment>
