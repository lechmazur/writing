<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Aris’s involuntary truthfulness is a vivid, pressure-generating trait that drives every consequential beat; the “preserve wonder” motive is stated early and repeatedly but only dramatized in the final climb/fix, so the interior contradiction feels thin until then. Relationship with stranger stays instrumental—no status friction or mutual risk—so the single-POV crucible holds but doesn’t deepen. Closure choice (expose + fix) is credible and foreshadowed, yet the emotional cost is asserted (“I cannot stay silent”) rather than embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Causal chain is clean: blackout → riddle → box → sabotage proof → manual discharge → partial restoration. Orientation (who/where/when) is anchored within 120 words; one seamless time-lapse transition from plaza to archive to control room. Closure lands as Decisive Change with societal cost legible (“truth remained to be told”), satisfying the lens. Minor slack: the whistleblower’s arrival is pure convenience, not earned by prior pressure, keeping it from the 8.8 tier.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Selective sensory filtering—“nectar-dusk sky,” “twilight that tasted like spoiled nectar”—keeps the cityscape inside Aris’s perceptual bias. Lightning tower and lacquer box both constrain choices (energy source, evidence vault), meeting the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography is tight across stair-climbs and archive reach. Only slip: “drone beehives” shorthand skips tangible mechanic detail that could sharpen stakes further.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore ecosystem while exposing corporate sabotage—is signaled early and tightened by the manual-discharge gamble that could fry the grid. Protagonist agency drives every turn: climb, open box, choose revelation, pull discharge lever. Cost is visible (risk of second blackout, personal vulnerability via truth-telling). Escalation is linear, not deepening, so it stops just short of the 8.5+ band that demands a felt price on the final image.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—truth as the engine of wonder—emerges through Aris’s compulsive candor and the choice to publicize proof rather than bury it. Subtext in the riddle and bee/lightning filigree quietly links natural and artificial systems without sermonizing. Final dissemination scene risks overt thematic echo (“wonder needs truth to thrive”) but stays within tolerable assertion. Complexity is present but not pronounced; counter-readings are thin.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Third-limited stays locked to Aris with consistent perceptual signature (sound of transformers, taste of nectar dusk). Rhythm modulates well: longer reflective sentences on stairs, staccato panel commands in control room. Stranger’s dialogue is utilitarian, but Aris’s compulsive factual replies create natural indirection. No head-hopping or register drift; minor filter-verb clusters (“he understood,” “he realized”) keep it from the 8.5 tier.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Strong read-aloud rhythm, varied sentence shapes, and high information density (“blue energy arced… like liquid light”). Figurative language is selective; no metaphor pile-ups in peak beats. Occasional scaffold (“his routine of…,” “his motivation surfacing”) and one paraphrase loop (“preserve wonder in routine” restated) slightly dull propulsion. Errors in grammar, tense, or clarity are absent; copy is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Synthesis of bee-collapse, energy-grid noir, and compulsive-truth teller feels fresh and specific to this voice. Riddle-to-box payoff is patterned early and lands inevitability. Corporate sabotage motive is familiar but justified by lacquer-box evidence rather than last-minute twist. Risk level is moderate; no structural or perspectival experimentation that would push higher.</comment>
