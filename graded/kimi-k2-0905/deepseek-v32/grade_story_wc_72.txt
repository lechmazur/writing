<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction is dramatized: Aethel’s stone stillness versus restless telepathic outreach. The “incisively kind precision” is shown while calming anemones and guiding fish—embodied, not labeled. Final renunciation—returning to plinth after widening crack—carries felt cost: the city stays broken, only understanding mends. Voice remains coherent, no diagnostic self-talk, and the telepathy’s limits (can only nudge, not command) stay consistent.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: because Aethel craves nuance, therefore it seeks the ampoule; because it uses the crack, therefore revelations cascade. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—the beam rewrites history on garden walls, cost is the irreversible empty ampoule and widened fault. Orientation anchors (who=statue, where=under-garden, when=post-collapse twilight) land inside 120 words. No teleporting props; ampoule is foreshadowed by “foxglove-stained glass” echo.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Garden breathes through tactile specificity: “coral benches… overgrown with luminous seaweed,” “pearl pathways.” The beam of surface light functions as micro-setting tool—its angle determines where murals project, constraining final act. Spatial choreography clean: Aethel threads hedges, reaches clamshell fountain, back to plinth. Sensory hierarchy obeys aqueous logic—vision muted, currents felt, sound damped—never tourist-catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—inject nuance into certainty—tightens when each vapor-scene peels back blame; options narrow to “accept mosaic or stay blind.” Escalation is epistemic, not explosive, fitting accumulative lens. Protagonist agency drives every turn: choosing to exploit crack, release vapor, share murals telepathically. Cost is legible: dome frays further, sunlight intrusion irreversible, history can no longer be a single verdict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges without sermon: complexity > blame. Final image—ever-shifting murals on garden walls—offers resonant non-verdict; no sentence moralizes. Subtext operates in silence: statue’s stillness = history’s refusal to speak in one voice. “Mosaics” reweights earlier “single stone” line, satisfying CR.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person telepathic omniscience stays stable, never hops into fish minds. Diction—“incisively kind precision,” “aqueous rhythm”—is controlled and marble-cold, matching statue POV. Rhythm lengthens in kelp passages, tightens during crack-amplification beat. No filter-verb stacks, no corporate register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Read-aloud ear test passes: sentence lengths swell and contract like tides. Metaphors consistent—history as waterlogged book, truth as vapor—no mixedvehicles. Information-dense: one line often does sight, motion, and moral tilt (“threaded these new truths into the fabric of the garden’s awareness”). Zero paraphrase loops; “garden” never repeated carelessly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Familiar trope—lost Atlantis + living statue—made fresh via epistemic quest rather than physical loot. Structural weakness as narrative method (not MacGuffin) is non-obvious and inevitable in hindsight. Risk: lyric, almost essayistic escalation, yet coherence holds. Specificity of foxglove stained-glass (poison memory) fuses botanical danger with historical toxin—cannot swap with generic vial.</comment>
