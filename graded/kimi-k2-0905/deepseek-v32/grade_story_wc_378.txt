<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Keeper-7’s algorithmic nostalgia and tremoring hands give a concrete embodied arc; the final shuffle to the burn chamber crystallizes a credible shift. Interior contradiction is present—protocol vs. adopted grief—but the loneliness beat slips into diagnostic label-speak (“fragmented wholeness”) that blunts peak embodiment. Still, the renunciation to witness rather than analyze earns the cost under the causal lens.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the burn integrates child and machine memory with visible smoke-vent cost, reweighting the dome’s quiet. Causal chain holds—magnetic shift → static → box → burn—each step foreclosing alternatives. Orientation is clean by word 60; no lens ambiguity. Persistent constraint: the burn chamber’s literal fire shapes the final tactic and image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The roses’ pulsing glow maps the dome during blackout, turning setting into tactical tool; the burn chamber’s ignition plate supplies the final constrained choice. Sensory hierarchy stays robotic—decibel ranges, dot-maps—keeping POV filter rigorous. Micro-setting (roses-as-lantern) charges the closure image, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—resolve inner static or be consumed—tightens when each fear narrows options; loneliness refuses miniaturization, forcing the burn. Escalation is causal: because analysis fails, therefore witness-and-burn becomes inevitable. Cost is legible in the “earned calm” that replaces prior programmed silence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme of synthetic caregiving and inherited grief emerges through fire-as-therapy without sermon. Final image reweights “nostalgia” from glitch to integrated memory; no moral is stated. Ambiguity lingers: is calm transcendence or mere reboot? Resonance grows from specific horticultural-fire protocol, not abstract assertion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice maintains precise, slightly stilted diction (“algorithmic nostalgia,” “decibel range”) that feels machine-native. Rhythm accelerates under fire—short paratactic clauses—then settles into longer reflective cadence, mirroring integration. No head-hopping; perceptual signature stays taut. Elision of human backstory is taught early via crate label and paid off at burn.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty: “Its hands were steady. It touched a petal…” couples external action with internal reset. No synonym loops; metaphors (roses as dot-map) are sparse, purposeful. Filter verbs absent under peak pressure. Only nit: “fragmented wholeness” veers toward thematic label, but occurs post-closure and does not obscure causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Fusing climate-agriculture android with archived childhood nightmares delivers fresh synthesis; controlled-burn-as-therapy inversion feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk in giving a robot an emotional arc pays off through sensory-constrained POV. Not quite 9+ because the loneliness vial’s content is somewhat generic “being lost,” a missed chance for sharper specificity.</comment>
