<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interiority is rich, embodied, and character-specific; the “silent flood” of tears at the root-cellar hit lands with earned contradiction. Motivation stays coherent and intensifies through micro-choices (fracturing seal, warming droplet) that visibly cost. The final renunciation—tears as proof—meets the 9+ test, yet the occupational label “lantern broker” remains decorative, never constraining action or speech, so misses full integration.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the droplet reweights Silas’s vocation with conceptual cost—“tender of endings.” Causality under Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory beat thickens density until the cellar scent crystallizes meaning. No orientation debt; UV reveal is taught early and pays off at climax. Only a hairline slip: the lantern-broker identity never shapes tactics, but the core drive is untouched.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Greenhouse, vial, and root-cellar are rendered through selective sensory hierarchy; UV light finally charges the crystal vessel, meeting the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography is clean; no floating props. The “lantern” motif, however, is unanchored—never handled, lit, or traded—so the broader occupational setting stays abstract, capping at 8.7.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—why smells trigger tears—tightens once via the hidden amber drop; the cellar memory narrows options from fear to acceptance of grief. Cost is legible: he “no longer feared the tears.” Under Accumulative lens the deepening suffices, but no persistent external constraint shapes later tactics, keeping it just below 8.5.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: scent as fossilized love, grief the price of perfect recall. The root-cellar image reweights all prior botanical extinction into personal archaeology. No moralizing; resonance lingers in the emptied crystal now “a vessel for a different kind of light.” Ambiguity is intact yet charged.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person voice sustains a lyrical, botanical register distinct to Silas’s perceptual bias—“aromatically cautious,” “chemical ghosts.” Syntax lengthens under wonder, compresses at the fracture moment, mirroring pulse. No head-hop; UV reveal is cleanly focalized. One minor cadence echo—“crystal shadows” thrice—doesn’t mar overall rhythmic control.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and muscle; information density high—“the scent dissipated, leaving only the mineral tang.” No filter-verb stacks, no mixed metaphors. A single paraphrase loop around “extinct plants” ideas is cuttable but does not touch closure. Otherwise line-level craft is publish-ready.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The ghost-orchid vial holding not floral perfume but root-cellar earth is a fresh inversion of nostalgic scent narratives. Silas’s occupation as lantern broker is under-exploited, a lost opportunity for unique tension, preventing higher originality. Yet the synthesis of olfactory paleontology and private memory feels specific and inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
