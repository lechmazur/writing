<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara’s quiet resolve and empathic listening are embodied through micro-choices (plucking the exact three laughing notes, lifting the tooth). The interior contradiction—pain she carries versus joy she seeds—drives the beat; the final gentle glow is earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single-scene causal spine holds: harp keyhole summons ghost → memory reframe → bright fadeout. Orientation locked by line 3; cost visible in Elara’s retained ache. Closure image reconfigures gorge from sorrow vessel to joy vessel.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Shale underfoot, silver silence, tooth’s dense weight—tactile anchors constrain ritual steps. Gorge shadows guide proximity for confessions; rising sun’s final gold literalizes the released laugh. Setting and micro-tool jointly charge the ending.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake is the ghost’s release; tension tightens when Elara must pivot from guilt to laughter. Her agency shapes the tonal reversal; no outside contrivance intrudes. The laugh costs her nothing external but deepens her internal balance—price legible yet modest.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme—laughter as active healing—emerges through dramatized riff on a crow joke, never stated. The reprise of gorge-as-echo reframed from lament to joy gives clean resonance without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers in her perpetual ache, honoring complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays tight to Elara’s perceptual filter: “silver silence that flowed,” “luminous ache.” Syntax lengthens for calm, shortens under ritual pressure. No head-hop; diction consistent, rhythmic, and voice-driven.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Strong verbs, concrete nouns, minimal modifiers. Figurative layer (“a flame in the gloom”) appears selectively and pays off. Only micro-loop: “luminous ache” echoed twice—minor, does not stall momentum. Final line lands clean with varied cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Soul-collector trope refreshed via musical mis-tuned harp forcing confessions, then laughter as exorcism. Gorge micro-cosm and fossil tooth ground the fantastical in tactile specificity. Synthesis feels inevitable, not gimmicky.</comment>
