<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lyra’s motivation to “articulate unspoken needs” is clear and embodied through the ritual stamping; her interiority is lyric but concrete (“listened… with a heart attuned to tinkersong wonder”). No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene, so the internal conflict is only asserted, not simultaneously enacted; this keeps the score below 8.8.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the ghost integrated, the island purrs, Lyra walks away with a new song—cost is felt in the warm iron plate and the fading glyphs. Causal chain holds under Accumulative/Textural lens; each stamped glyph visibly tightens the pattern. One micro-turn suffices; no orientation debt incurred.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The misty cloud-courtyard is filtered through Lyra’s ritual attention; weather and stone react causally to each stamp, guiding her timing. The flower-press bolt plate functions as micro-setting that constrains every glyph press and is charged in the final image—meeting the 9+ gate requirement for setting-as-constraint.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Single dominant stake—“free the ghost before the storm exhausts the window”—is signaled early and tightens as lightning/thunder intervals shrink. Each glyph stamps a visible price (physical blow of thunder, glowing chain, mist solidifying), foreclosing retreat; escalation is driven by Lyra’s agency under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of listening to silenced voices emerges through image (phantom blooms, chimes) rather than statement. The reweighted final image—quiet sky, sleeping purr—invites reflection on caretaking and integration without moralizing. No thematic echo or final-paragraph thesis stated; ambiguity remains productive.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person lyric voice maintains stable distance; diction (“tinkersong wonder,” “driftingly alert”) is character-specific and rhythmic. No head-hopping; compression in storm beats is taught by the lightning/thunder pattern and pays off in the silence beat. Distinct perceptual signature holds under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense but purposeful; figurative layering is pattern-taught and peaks only after the reader learns the rhythm. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors; sentences vary in length and stress to mimic storm pulse. One filter-verb cluster (“seemed to strike”) is minor and does not blunt closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Fusion of graffiti-code ritual with cloud-island ghost is fresh; flower-press bolt plate as encoding stamp is specific and non-obvious. Risky lyric escalation is coherent under Accumulative lens, though the “ghost in code” trope has prior echoes. Final reconfiguration feels inevitable yet not derivative.</comment>
