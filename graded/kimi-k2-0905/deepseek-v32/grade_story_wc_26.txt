<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation is legible—preserve the “shape of hope”—and the river-stone touchstone gives her body-anchor. Yet her interiority drifts into generic “beauty and sadness” labels; no contradictory impulse is staged while she programs counter-dreams, so the final renunciation feels foregone rather than earned under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: hope is “now more resilient,” stone re-weighted, regret admitted—cost is felt. Causal chain is thin (watch videos → code dream-patch → library blooms), but accumulative pattern holds; orientation clear by word 80, single transition at midpoint taught by reflective cadence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Crystalline library and cloud-sea are sketched with dusk-light economy; river stone functions as micro-setting that constrains her tactile anchor and final placement. Spatial track stays clean; no world-rule drift. However, environment never actively resists or endangers her—description supports mood more than tactical choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—halting color-leech of hope—signaled early. One meaningful tightening: she programs counter-dreams, foreclosing pure observation. Price is conceptual (loss of innocence) rather than visceral; escalation is a single upward step, not a narrowing spiral, keeping pressure moderate.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Theme of necessary corruption of innocence emerges through image-pattern (stone, bloom, shadow) without explicit moral. Final “luminous acceptance” reweights earlier purity ideal. No thematic echo sentences; ambiguity lingers. Could sharpen ironic gap between watcher and changer roles for deeper resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited maintains steady psychic distance; perceptual signature favors light/shift imagery consistent with “dusk noticer.” Rhythm modulates—long reflective sentences versus clipped “softly deliberate” key presses. No dialogue, so voice contamination absent. Occasional elevated diction (“luminous regret”) edges toward authorial varnish but stays within elegiac register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, loop-free, with vivid specificity (“petals opening to the sun”). Figurative language controlled except one mixed cluster—“luminous regret” repeated thrice without fresh inflection. No scaffolds or filter-verb stacks. High information density; paragraphs advance stake or image. Minor cadence repetition in “softly deliberate” tag does not stall momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Shareable-dream archive above clouds feels fresh; integrating shadow as non-malignant color-leech is elegant twist. Risk taken with quiet, internal climax pays off. However, narrative arc still traces standard “observer becomes reluctant intervenor” template—could push further into the metaphysical rules teased.</comment>
