<comment>Elias’s quiet obsession is rendered through embodied micro-choices—wedging notes, sealing stones—so his stoic/sensitive duality stays active in scene. The locket discovery forces a visible crack in his façade, paying off the interior contradiction. Final surrender of both note and locket gives Earned Stasis with cost: he forsakes future excavations. The only bar to 9+ is that the county-employer motive remains briefly asserted rather than pressure-tested on the page.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: “She is remembered here” re-weights every prior absence into testimony, visible cost paid with the inkwell capped and pavilion soon re-submerged. Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout—each inserted note thickens the lattice of loss until the locket breaks pattern. Final image of Elias climbing back to “modern world” crystallizes before/after stance. No causality gaps; orientation anchored within first 120 words; constraint (receding water) shapes all tactics.</comment>

<comment>Submerged pavilion is not backdrop but hydraulic clock—its re-emergence enables every beat; its re-submersion supplies the closing cost. Brass inkwell functions as micro-setting handled in multiple beats, constraining action (scarce ink, antique heft). Sensory selection skewed to Elias’s surveyor eye: stone matrices, mortar freshness, copper-dove light. Spatial choreography flawless as he descends slick embankment, ankle-deep water, kneels to mortar. Setting directly charges final image of water refilling—an environmental Repricing.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—“map abandoned dreams”—is signaled early and tightens when collective absence collapses into one woman’s face. Each note sealed is an irreversible micro-cost, cumulatively raising emotional ante. Locket discovery is pattern-break that forces final testimony, not external coincidence. Visible price: he relinquishes future secrecy to restore her memory—option foreclosed.</comment>

<comment>Theme emerges solely through lattice motif—interlaced absence—culminating in deliberate interment, never sermonized. Testimony note reframes prior catalog of losses as human acts of love, not data. Ambiguity remains: we never learn woman’s name or fate, keeping theme open. Final image reweights concept of archaeology from extraction to burial—Conceptual Repricing with felt cost.</comment>

<comment>Third-person close mimics Elias’s restrained diction—“practical man mapping practical change”—yet allows lyric flare (“hushed blaze”) that betrays sensitivity. Perceptual signature consistent: light is always gauged, stone footings inventoried, mortar freshness read. No head-hop; psychic distance compresses under locket shock, syntax shortens. Rhythm modulates: longer cadence for descriptive grandeur, clipped fragments during extraction of stone.</comment>

<comment>Prose is dense—each sentence layers action, object, and metaphor (“mossy dome emerging like forgotten skull”). No synonym loops or filter-verb stacks; figurative language patterned and paid off. Opening and closing lines bookend with fire imagery, creating circular ear-music. One near-purple line—“void of guests tangled with missing music”—but pattern justifies it as echo of interlaced absence.</comment>

<comment>Fresh synthesis: surveyor as clandestine poet-archaeologist, using infrastructure repairs as secret reliquary. Concept of “interlaced absence” made tangible through mortar gaps and waterproof scrolls. Locket twist converts abstract forgetting into singular heartbreak without conventional back-story dump. Risk of lyric abstraction accepted and paid off by final watery submergence—image recharges all prior motifs.</comment>
