<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s insomnia, shyness, and “photosynthesize pain into beauty” drive every beat: she reads aloud, seeds poems, confronts Corvin, and finally rests. Interiority stays concrete (“reef-shadow joy surge, profound and tearful”) without label-speak. The renunciation of sleepless solitude for communal lullabies carries visible cost—her death and the town’s whispered grief—earning the closure. Minor cap: no contradictory impulses staged in a single micro-beat; the switch from solitary to shared art is smooth, not internally contested under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of nightly lullaby transmissions → echoing return chorus → published volume → spreading gardens. Orientation anchored by word 60 (“gargantuan shell on Aisling’s cliff”). Closure is a Charged Poise: the shell-shrine and off-key wind chorus reconfigure centuries of longing into ongoing healing; the cost is her life and the town’s perpetual vigil. One micro-turn: Corvin’s skepticism dissolves when the postcard reminds him of lost love, tightening the communal stake.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The shell functions as micro-setting: its iridescent chambers, moss-lined niche, and acoustics directly enable the lullaby transmission that drives every beat. The galaxy postcard is handled twice—first as inspirational seed, finally as gift that softens Corvin—charging the closure image. Sensory selection (“nacreous shelf,” “glowing lichen”) filters through Elara’s poet eye, never tourism-catalog. Spatial choreography is clean: cliff, valley, shell interior track without drift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will her pain-into-beauty alchemy reach others—tightens when the wind returns human voices singing her poem; the off-key chorus forecloses permanent anonymity. Cost is legible: she trades lifelong insomnia for death, leaving the shell as communal shrine. Agency is cumulative rather than causal: each nightly broadcast incrementally seeds the valley’s gardens. One deepening: the townspeople adopt “blossom armistice” for real truces, reweighting her private metaphor into civic praxis.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Theme—art’s quiet power to end war—emerges from concrete particulars: poems sung into wind become actual gardens replacing barricades. No final moralizing; the closing image of whispered pains transformed by wind offers resonant non-literal answer. Subtext in gesture: handing Corvin the postcard wordlessly admits vulnerability while claiming art’s battlefield. The postcard’s border text (“Across centuries of longing…”) risks thematic echo but is framed as artifact, not authorial sermon, so only minor −0.2.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyric third-person stays tight to Elara’s perceptual signature: “reef-shadow joy,” “photosynthesize pain,” “shyly unstoppable” are her private metaphors, not narrator intrusion. Rhythm modulates: long breathless cadences for insomnia, shorter lullaby fragments when wind carries songs. No head-hopping; Corvin’s interior accessed only through observable softenings. Experimental compression (“Across centuries of longing…” as section breaks) is taught early and pays off in closure refrain.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High information density: single sentences do triple duty (“Each dusk, she would ensconce herself… lit by glowing lichen, read stanzas, shell wove lullabies”). No paraphrase loops; each repetition (“off-key wind,” “reef-shadow joy”) accrues new semantic weight. Metaphors stay coherent—shell as instrument, wind as postal service. Minor −0.4: occasional stacked adjectives (“nacreous shelf,” “gargantuan shell”) verge on purple but remain POV-true to poet sensibility.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fusion of insomnia, fossil shell, and pacifist horticulture feels non-obvious and specific; removal would collapse the story. The “blossom armistice” coinage transforms familiar peace-garden trope into lyrical praxis. Risky temporal sweep (“centuries of longing”) compressed into postcard-border refrain that reweights closure. No derivative echoes; the off-key wind chorus is fresh transmission device. Conceptual integrity: commits fully to soft-spoken magic realism without explanatory hand-holding.</comment>
