<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Liren’s guilt and methodical atonement are vivid; the embodied ritual of “unwriting” with his own blood makes the interior cost felt. The flaw: his original “mercy” motive is asserted more than dramatized, so the stakes leap in summary. Still, the final exhaustion sells earned stasis.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure is crystal: the blood-in-groove reversal dissolves the forged chain under a Conceptual Repricing—the sanctuary’s record reverts to unfinished, not false. Causal lens holds: every drip and thorn-stroke tightens the circuit. The orientation waiver is earned; the marble-aurora frame is taught by line 3 and pays off in the deepening grey hush.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Pearl twilight, aurora, and dripping stalactites are never backdrop—they meter time and mirror the slow dissolve of ink-blood. The thorn-as-key and marble groove function as micro-setting that literally guides the final gesture. One minus: no sensory shift under stress; the same luminous hush persists even at the climax.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—undo the lie—threads every beat; each droplet escalates patience-cost under Accumulative lens. The single meaningful tightening arrives when blood meets groove, foreclosing the option to leave the lie intact. No external antagonist is needed; the pressure is internal and relentless.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of “forgiving the unfinished” emerges through the concrete act of unwriting, not exposition. The false edict’s slow ruin is left ambiguous, keeping moral complexity alive. Final image of deepening grey reconfigures the sky-memory without moralizing—an earned, quiet resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person intimate carries a hushed, ritual cadence that mirrors calligraphic precision. Syntax is controlled, no head-hopping; diction stays within Liren’s lexicon of ink, thorn, stone. One hairline slip: “calibrated treason” leans toward prompt-echo, but the phrase is immediately grounded in stroke-by-stroke memory.</comment>

<comment>Prose is lean and rhythmic; every sentence either advances drip-time or etches the groove. No loops, no mixed metaphors. Figurative language is sparse, all stone/ink/blood—each image recurs with reweighted meaning, satisfying the read-aloud ear test.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The “unwriting” reversal of a forged imperial edict feels fresh; the rose-thorn-as-eraser-of-fate is a sharp, specific invention. Aurora-lit marble sanctuary could tilt to fantasy cliché, but here it functions as memory-sky, not scenery. Risk is present and coherent, not gimmick.</comment>
