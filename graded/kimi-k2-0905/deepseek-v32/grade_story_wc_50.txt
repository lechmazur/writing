<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Interiority is lyrical and consistent; the “store wonder” motive recurs but never crystallizes into a single high-stakes micro-choice that costs him something tangible on the page. The final beat is wonder secured, not a path foreclosed—more triumph than renunciation. Emotional embodiment is vivid (“hands steady… mind soaring”), but contradiction under pressure is understated rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: light-echo mapping thickens pattern until the timer’s first tick reweights meaning. Closure is a Charged Poise—the living timer now pulses with harvested moments, a conceptual re-pricing with felt cost in the cavern’s hush. Orientation is anchored by 120 words; no因果 breaks, though escalation is gradual density, not sharp reversals.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Marble cavern operates as both cathedral and calibration instrument; reflection angles directly constrain his tinkering and final success. Sensory triage favors light/sound over visual clutter, mirroring his peripheral attention. The timer’s gear states evolve in tandem with the light shifts—object-as-setting that charges the final tick.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“capture echoes before season turns”—is signaled early; pressure mounts via daily light-window narrowing, not interpersonal clash. Agency shows in mirror adjustments and gear recalibration, each iteration risking lost echoes. Cost is conceptual: the timer becomes an externalized memory vault, foreclosing the option to leave empty-handed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges obliquely: time as salvageable memory, not currency. Final image of the ticking timer reframes earlier light studies as acts of resurrection rather than measurement. No moralizing; wonder is stored, not explained. Metaphor of “cellar of reason” recurs but never explained away, preserving ambiguity.</comment>

<comment>Third-person lyric remains tight to Elian’s perceptual filter—light angles, gear ratios, peripheral whispers. Syntax stretches into reflective cadence then contracts for tactile dismantling beats, mirroring task focus. No dialogue, so voice is carried by rhythmic, precise diction (“springs slack,” “prismatic hues”) without purple drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>High information density: each sentence layers light motion, echo behavior, and mechanical detail without scaffold. Metaphor is controlled—marble as cathedral, echoes as fruit—never stacking into mixed vehicles. Occasional anaphora (“Each day…”) is pattern-taught and pays off in the final cadence. Zero paraphrase loops or filter-verb bloat.</comment>

<comment>Premise fuses locksmith craft with acoustic archaeology; reverse-engineering a timer to bottle sonic memory feels non-obvious and specific. Risk lies in the quiet, accumulative structure—no antagonist, no physical peril—yet coherence holds. Could perhaps swap “locksmith” for “clockmaker,” but gear-ratio expertise and “cellar of reason” metaphor root the vocation in theme.</comment>
