<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is concrete—hands “moving by instinct,” “heard its cry”—and her creative paralysis is embodied early. The contradiction between longing and numbness is held in scene, not summary, and the final rest is a credible renunciation that costs her exhaustion. Grandfather memory tilts her present choice without feeling grafted on. Voice slips once into lyrical cliché (“shadowed rapture” repeated) but recovers.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the reversed star-avalanche reweights the premise and the orrery’s warmth signals cost felt on the page. Causal chain holds—dream maps to real arch, each star traced turns a gear, final alignment triggers inversion—no coin-flip resolutions. Orientation anchor is clear by word 40; no test penalty. One micro-turn suffices under Accumulative/Textural lens; pattern taught early, paid off.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Brass orrery functions as micro-setting: its frozen gears constrain her first action and warm ticking signals transformation at close. Aurora arch is rendered through motion—star-cascade, reversal—rather than postcard palette. Sensory hierarchy follows POV: tactile cold, metallic hum, inner-ear star-cry. Spatial choreography clean; no floating props. Environment directly governs the tracing method and final rest.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—freeing frozen creativity—signals in paragraph 1 and tightens when each traced star releases “a tiny, captive spark.” Escalation is textural: density of mapped trajectories increases, cadence slows to exhausted rest. Protagonist agency drives every beat; no outside rescue. Cost is visible exhaustion and the irreversible stilling of the arch, foreclosing return.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of remembered stardust emerges through orrery, grandfather memory, and final bodily rest—never stated as thesis. Subtext operates in tactile inversion: cold metal warms only after she metabolizes the star-paths. Final image of frost-lit steps implies ongoing creation without declaring victory. Avoids moralizing; ambiguity lingers in “universe of murmuring… words.”</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-limited voice stays tight to Elara’s perceptual filter: she hears stars, feels gears “click of understanding.” Syntax lengthens under wonder, shortens under fatigue, mirroring arc. No filter-verb stacks; occasional lyric uplift (“cathedral of fleeting light”) is earned by prior groundedness. Distinct diction avoids stock fantasy cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>High information density: one sentence shifts time (“After weeks of travel”), embeds rumor, and lands her at arch. Metaphors are coherent—stars as “ancient light ending its long journey”—without mixed vehicles. One paraphrase loop detected (“shadowed rapture” twice) but does not obscure closure. Rhythm breathes with action; no template cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Familiar quest-for-inspiration frame is reanimated through astronomical orrery and star-mapping mechanic; inversion climax feels inevitable yet fresh. Specific detail—brass gears aligned to falling light—prevents generic swap-out. Risk taken in quiet, non-violent resolution pays off via bodily cost. Could edge higher with one more startling sensory twist mid-arc.</comment>
