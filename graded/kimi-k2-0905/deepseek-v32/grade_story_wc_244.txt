<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Aris’s jocular desperation is vivid and embodied in the opening beats; the moon-rock hand-off to the woman crystallizes his contradictory need for both control and connection. Interiority stays specific, never drifting into label-speak. Yet the crowd remains a blur—no secondary face exerts reciprocal pressure—so the relational crucible is only half-forged. Still, his micro-choice to surrender the talisman carries a felt cost that earns the closure shift.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the station’s social energy flips from absence to presence, and the warm moon-rock weight on the map is a concrete conceptual cost. Causal chain is intact—rumor → arrivals → reciprocity → city envoy—without off-stage cheats. One soft spot: the mayor’s envoy appears as a late convenience rather than a tightening constraint. Orientation is clean inside 120 words; lens holds as Causal.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Ivy-strangled iron ribs, geodesic stone paperweights, and the ticket-booth alcove give tactile anchors that steer movement. Sensory hierarchy reflects Aris’s logistician eye—maps, tokens, crowd flow—rather than tourist catalog. The moon rock functions as micro-setting that constrains the final choice. Environment never over-described; each detail earns its keep in the reciprocity economy.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“will loneliness calcify?”—is signaled early and tightened when Aris must hand over his talisman to a stranger, foreclosing sole ownership. The envoy’s offer extends rather than resolves the conflict, keeping pressure alive. No coincidence rescues the moment; the turn rides on his prior rumor labor. Cost is visible in the relinquished fragment and the exposed station now answerable to city eyes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges not as slogan but as lived reciprocity: moon rock passed hand-to-hand reweights “contact” from abstract cure to circulating debt. Final image of the fragment pinning a new map reframes loneliness as infrastructure problem rather than private ache. No moralizing paragraph closes the loop; the silence after the envoy’s offer lets ambiguity breathe. Subtext in the jocular mask vs. hollow ache keeps sentimentality at bay.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-limited stays locked to Aris with clean psychic distance; no head-hop. Syntax carries a logistician’s clipped cadence—“maps pinned under geodesic stones”—that loosens into longer breaths as genuine amusement surfaces. Jokes about red-tape ivy and lost luggage carry subtextual self-interrogation. Only nit: crowd dialogue is reported, not direct, so speech distinctness can’t be judged; voice still holds.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, high-density; no filter-verb stacks or scaffold loops. Metaphors stay single-track—“iron ribs strangled by ivy”—without mixed collisions. Paragraph cuts are purposeful; removal of any line would thin causality or atmosphere. One tiny register lift: “conceptual repricing” thoughts nudge academic, but they occur in low-stakes reflection, not peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The “loneliness as disaster logistics” frame is fresh, and the moon-rock-as-currency twist feels inevitable once introduced. Polite anarchy, rumor supply chains, and reciprocity economy synthesize into a singular stance rather than prompt box-checking. Risk is taken—no antagonist, no violence—yet stakes stay legible. Could dock for near-template “revival of dead space” except the reciprocity rule-set reconfigures the trope.</comment>
