<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elara’s interior calculus—using stone-fruit spectra and chipped mosaics to solve grief—remains consistent and embodied; the buried optimism resurfaces through micro-choices (mapping hues, slotting eyes) that visibly cost her detachment. Her contradictory goal—quantify emotion yet remain safe from it—drives every beat; the final image crystallizes a refusal to accept stasis, foreclosing the old hollow variable with earned risk.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: scuffed tile → recognition → decoding → portal; each because/therefore step tightens options toward the charged poise of Aloysius suspended. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the “impossible gap” is accepted as her next equation, cost legible in the shifted light and her relinquishing of detached observation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Phosphorescent fruit, dripping stalactites, and mosaic cavities are filtered through Elara’s taxonomic gaze; each detail constrains method and metaphor, culminating in the twin beams carving a path through solidified feeling. Spatial choreography stays clean across cavern, wall, and portal.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—turn ambiguous loss into navigable problem—tightens once when chipped tiles swap grief for puzzle; the price is trading detached study for potentially infinite responsibility to balance Aloysius’s equation. Agency is intellectual yet visceral: her mapping of emotional spectra literally walks her into another cavern.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: the scientific impulse to quantify emotion collides with the lived obligation to feel it; the crystallized grove literalizes that collision. Final image of hope-as-variable reweights earlier “hollow” language into an active unknown, offering no moral, only a new equation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Tight third keeps perceptual signature—spectral hues, tile numerics, mineral drip cadence—distinctly Elara’s. No head-hop; psychic distance compresses under pressure (“the silence…charged with a problem”). Register stays consistent, elevated but plausible for an obsessive conjurer-mathematician.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet limpid; syntax modulates from languid observation to clipped beats when mosaic code surfaces. Figurative layering (“mathematics of emotion”) recurs with accrued meaning rather than clutter. One minor paraphrase loop—“the ambiguous loss transformed”—doesn’t dull momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: taxidermy optics + geologic orchard + emotional calculus = new metaphor for grief-as-proof. Risk of stasis-portal is taken early and paid off, avoiding gimmick. Without these exact elements the emotional algebra collapses; transformation is irreversible.</comment>
