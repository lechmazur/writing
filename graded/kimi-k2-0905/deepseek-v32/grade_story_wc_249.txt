<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Leo’s quietly stubborn self-preservation via drumming is embodied early and tied to the final resonant weave; the interior contradiction between borrowed sorrow and fragile hope stays active in scene, not summary. Cost is felt when the lagoon’s glow edges sorrow with dawn—his solitude and stolen memories are not erased but repurposed. The beat remains single-POV tight, no head-count clutter. A hairline slip: “auroral sorrow” risks label-speak once, yet is immediately grounded in sensory ripple.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the shared dream manifests as scent and silence, foreclosing Leo’s isolation while leaving the ache visible—cost paid in the same image. Accumulative lens holds: each drumming layer densifies the psychic weave until the final cadence shift brightens starlight. Causality is internal but legible—no off-stage fixes. Orientation anchor (who/where) is clear by line 5; no ambiguity caps triggered.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sound-wave garden, silver reeds, and auric lagoon are not backdrop but instrument: reeds bend, orbs cluster, water ripples in direct response to Leo’s tapping—environment constrains and enables the climactic weave. Sensory hierarchy skews tactile/auditory, matching his grounding ritual. Spatial choreography is clean; no floating rooms. Micro-setting (his own chest as drum) charges the final image, meeting 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will the cacophony yield a livable peace?—is signaled in paragraph 2. Escalation is accretive: each rhythmic layer tightens the psychic braid, narrowing Leo’s options from passive endurance to active sonic tailoring. The reversal is micro but decisive when he shifts from random tapping to purposeful code, visible cost being the surfacing of others’ grief in his body. No coincidence resolves; the garden’s physics merely obeys the pattern he imposes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges obliquely: trauma cannot be deleted, only re-orchestrated into communal beauty. Subtext lives in gesture—palms-up stillness after drumming ceases—rather than statement. Final image of sorrow edged with dawn reweights earlier “auric sorrow” without moralizing. No echo of prompt language in closing paragraph.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Leo’s perceptual filter: antiseptic smell arrives only when a foreign memory intrudes, never as authorial aside. Syntax mirrors his staccato resistance—short percussive clauses that elongate only when the lagoon swells. No head-hop, no filter-verb clutter. Dialogue absent by design; voice remains singular and rhythmic.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is lyric yet propulsive; metaphor vehicles (auroral sorrow, audible light) remain internally consistent. One paraphrase loop—“the garden was alive… the very air thick with audible light”—but it occurs early and teaches the physics, so waived as pattern-setter. No scaffold, no synonym churn in peak beats. Final line lands on image, not explanation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Familiar trope—memory experiment gone awry—is flipped: protagonist weaponizes the garden’sown psycho-acoustic rules to compose communal solace. Specificity of sonic botany and rhythmic code makes the concept feel indigenous to this world. Risk-taking lies in quiet climax—stillness after percussion—rather than explosive release. Could not swap setting or motif without collapsing the weave.</comment>
