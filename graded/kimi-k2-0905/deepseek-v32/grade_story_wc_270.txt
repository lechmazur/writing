<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Marta’s insurgent resolve is embodied in every micro-choice—bare feet in soil, amber lowered into heat—so her final smile feels earned. The telepathy trait is never dry-label; it drives the decoding and is guarded with believable secrecy. Interiority stays concrete: “fire in her veins,” “cold against geothermal heat,” never abstract self-diagnosis. The cost is legible: she forfeits the elders’ certainty and steps into unknown stewardship, a visible renunciation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Closure is a perfect Conceptual Repricing: the embryo dissolves and the question “What will you grow?” re-weights every prior rule. Causal chain holds—moss-whispers → kite-script → sonic key → amber melt—each beat narrows options until tradition is unmade. Orientation is anchored by word 40 (“steamy edge of the volcanic hot springs”). The lens is Causal; every beat is a because/therefore that climaxes in the reframing of destiny itself.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Hot-spring minerals, geothermal algae, and petrified tree create a tactile micro-setting that literally dissolves the amber in the final image. The kite’s silver frame caught high in stone is a spatial anchor revisited at closure. Sensory hierarchy favors heat and mineral taste, never tourist-catalog. Environment is the instrument of change: the pool’s sonic resonance is the key that unlocks the concept.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“evolve tradition or obey”—is signaled in paragraph 1 and tightens when amber enters the pool. One decisive turn: the embryo dissolves and the imposed destiny flips to chosen destiny. Cost is the elders’ prohibition violated and the uncertainty she now carries. Pressure accumulates under Causal lens; each decoded curve of script forecloses retreat until the final sonic hum makes retreat impossible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: tradition is a garden, not a cage. The kite tail’s script starts as lock, ends as memory of the lock—an image that reweights meaning. Subtext lives in gesture: placing bare feet in soil is assent to become earth’s student. Final question “What will you grow?” is earned wisdom, not moral; it invites reflection without declaring a thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is lush yet volcanic—syntax mirrors geothermal pressure: clauses build like heat until the amber melts. Perceptual signature is plant-telepathic: “murmurs of moss,” “whispers of ferns” compress two senses into one idiom. No head-hopping; distance stays tight inside Marta. Register never drifts into academic diction; “fire in her veins” stays within her lexicon of lived heat.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with scene: longer languid sentences at pool’s edge, short pulses at dissolve moment. Information density high—every sentence advances goal or atmosphere; no scaffold. Figurative language is spare and precise: “amber melting like sugar” is single, apt vehicle. Zero loops, zero paraphrase; opening and closing images are cleanly linked without redundant exposition.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: telepathy as non-heroic accident, destiny as dissolving question, reconstruction era as garden-not-cage. Kite-script of organic glyphs that must be sung by a hot spring is a risk that pays off conceptually. Risk heightens coherence: the impossible premise is taught early and justified by the geothermal instrument. Transformation test passed: swap any element and the whole frond-voice logic collapses.</comment>
