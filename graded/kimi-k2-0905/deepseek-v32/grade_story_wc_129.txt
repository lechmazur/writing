<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elara’s longing to belong is palpable and embodied in her reed-sculpting, but the interior contradiction is summarized rather than staged; the final “bold sympathy” is declared, not dramatized under pressure. Kael functions as a gentle conduit, not a crucible, so the relationship alters nothing on-page. The sculpture dedication is a gesture of stasis, not a renunciation with visible cost, so the arc feels complete but emotionally under-charged.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The causal spine—lonely artist → shared hunt → found tag → public dedication—tracks cleanly; the tag’s discovery under the arbor supplies a decisive change that reconfigures Elara’s social position. Orientation is swift; the orchard/crater anchors by line 3. Closure lands as earned stasis: she is now “taught others,” a visible role shift, but the cost is only lightly felt (“luminescent ache never fully faded”) rather than dramatized on the final beat, keeping it shy of 9-band force.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The crystalline orchard and obsidian arbor are more than postcard: the refractive light guides their literal search for a hidden mark, and the arbor’s arch becomes the exact site of discovery and later teaching. Micro-setting works—tag etched into reed-like crystal—tying the marsh craft to the alien place. Spatial choreography stays clean across the orchard sweep and the final placement of the sculpture. The setting constrains the search path and ultimately hosts the closure beat, satisfying the 9+ gate for environment charging the image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—will Elara weave herself into community?—is signaled early and tightens when the tag clue is found, forcing a public dedication that risks rejection. The escalation is gentle but coherent: each day of fruitless search raises the emotional ante until the arbor discovery crystallizes her communal identity. The cost is present but soft: she accepts the “luminescent ache” of impermanence, yet this is asserted, not staged as a painful choice on the page, keeping pressure below 8.8 intensity.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of belonging emerges through the tag’s journey from outsider glyph to shared emblem; no character lectures us on inclusion. The faded dye of the tag quietly reweights the motif: community memory is fragile, and grafting demands embracing loss. The final sculpture beside the arbor offers a resonant, non-literal answer—art as a living bridge—without moralizing. Subtext stays in glimmers: “webs of kinship tighten” is the closest to echo, but it is buffered by image and action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person lyric voice sustains a consistent reed-and-light perceptual signature, filtering every detail through Elara’s synesthetic bias. Syntax breathes with search rhythm, contracts at discovery: “There, beneath the arbor’s arch, they discovered the tag…” No head-hopping; Kael’s interior remains opaque, as required. Diction stays within Elara’s artisan lexicon; no corporate register drift. Dialogue is minimal but natural when Kael offers the tag legend—subtext of invitation, not exposition.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, with high information density: each clause layers setting, emotion, and forward motion. Occasional lyric clustering—“luminescent ache of memory,” “prismatic shadows”—never overwhelms a single beat. No paraphrase loops or template cadence; sentence rhythms vary. Minor scaffold: “the orchard’s trees, like frozen light,” is a touch generic, but it does not obscure causality or dull the closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>The marsh-reed sculptor searching for a graffiti tag in a crystalline crater orchard is a fresh synthesis; the tag-as-key-to-belonging reverses typical outsider arcs. Specificity of craft—woven reeds, luminous dye—grounds the concept in tactile detail rather than abstract metaphor. The final sculpture mirrors the tag, creating an inevitable echo that feels discovered, not imposed. Risk is moderate: quiet lyric closure over explosive twist, but coherence stays high.</comment>
