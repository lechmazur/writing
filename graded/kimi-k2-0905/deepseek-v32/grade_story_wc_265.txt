<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Interiority is evocative—"the subtle hum of insight"—but emotion stays at a single mystical register; no contradictory impulses are dramatized. The gear-warming moment could crystallize a value hierarchy yet Alaric simply "knew" the next step. Translocations are label-only; we never feel vertigo or loss. Closure achieves renunciation with conceptual cost, satisfying the 9+ gate, but the journey feels frictionless.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of listen→translocate→listen again tightens toward Charged Poise. Orientation is clear by word 60; no penalty. Closure lands—“he, too, was part of the forest's design”—with conceptual cost (self as mutable component). Middle sags into iterative summary rather than escalating pressure; one micro-turn too few for 8+.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Selective metallic sensorium (pneumatic leaves, copper branches) filters through Alaric’s ears, constraining navigation. Micro-setting of the gear-in-palm evolves from keepsake to catalytic key, charging the final image. Spatial anchors hold across translocations. Environment actively guides choices; no static postcarding. Meets 9+ gate: tool charges closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“rediscover the wild frontier of his mind”—is signaled early. Pressure deepens via unraveling engine-tree, reweighting the abstract goal with concrete stakes. Escalation is textural (pattern of discordant chords) rather than causal; Alaric’s agency limited to listening and fitting his gear. No felt price is extracted from him personally, capping entry to 7-band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Theme of cognitive integration with the mechanical emerges through recursive listening and translocation, never sermonized. Final smile reconfigures the initial quest: frontier is not found but continuously assembled. Subtext whispers that breakdown is revelatory, not tragic. Minor abstraction in “probable miracles” line almost over-speaks, but phrasing stays imagistic.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited maintains steady psychic distance; perceptual signature tuned to sonic detail and gear-precision. Rhythmic control—long sentence for forest breath, staccato for ticking roots—mirrors Alaric’s attention shifts. No dialogue, so voice purity remains intact. Occasional elevated diction (“epistemology”) fits philosopher POV without register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>High information density: one sentence often layers metaphor, motion, and world rule. No loops or scaffold. Mixed metaphors rare; “waterfall of lubricant oil” is precise rather than purple. Filter verbs minimal, chosen for sonic effect. Clause rhythm modulates with forest cadence, propelling accumulative design. Could trim two adjectives for 9-band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Mechanical rainforest feels inevitable yet fresh, synthesizing clockpunk and introspective picaresque. Translocation-as-pilgrimage repurposes gamer trope into epistemic ritual. Small-gear-as-key reframes abstract thought as tactile interface. Risk in lyric recursion pays off; no gimmickry. Concept stays committed: no retreat to mundane safety.</comment>
