<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Kaito’s grief is rendered through tactile bonsafied metaphor; every micro-choice (spreading lace, speaking to compass) externalizes contradictory impulses—silence vs. need to confess. Interiority stays particular, avoids therapy-speak, and culminates in earned renunciation: he accepts the unclosed severance. Cost is visible in the final folding of cloth and compass, a quiet monument that forecloses easy absolution.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens governs: lace pattern accumulates symbolic weight until brass needle reconfigures, delivering Conceptual Repricing with undeniable cost—compass now points at the lace, not home, mapping irreparable distance. Orientation anchored by word 50; single-scene default held. Closure beat ("He folded the lace...") crystallizes before/after with felt price; no causality breaks, no props teleport.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Sensory economy privileges salt-stone scent and cerulean light; each returns to mirror internal shift. Compass-as-micro-setting constrains final choice, charging image. Islet breathes but never over-described; weather and wet stone keep action tactile. Spatial clarity maintained through low table, cottage interior, single continuous scene.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—finding form for unspoken apology—signaled early and tightens as confessing aloud becomes the only remaining tactic. Lace-reading scene supplies one decisive deepening: articulating regret re-weights compass from static relic to active respondent. Cost legible in exposed failures and the perpetual inland needle that refuses reunion. Could edge higher if a secondary external obstacle complicated the ritual.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through image circuit: severance → lace map → tidal compass → cerulean light = apology without reconciliation. No moralizing; final image reweights prior metaphors (tree-shaping into soul-shaping) with conceptual cost. Subtext of craftsmanship-as-love suffuses every beat. Complexity preserved: forgiveness is hue, not fact.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited adheres to Kaito’s slow-spoken bonsai mind: syntax stretches, clauses pruned, rhythm mirrors patient cuts. Perceptual signature filters world through wires, seasons, branches; no head-hop. Free indirect slips cleanly into near-prayer while addressing compass. No register drift; lyric elevation justified by grief ritual.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose breathes with variable cadence; no paraphrase loops or template runs. Figurative layering high but patterned (tides, pruning, maps) and paid off in closure image. One mixed risk—“cerulean regret” used thrice—skirts purple but saved by chromatic payoff in final light. Information density strong; each sentence advances confession or atmosphere.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: lace circuitry + maritime compass + bonsai discipline converts familial grief into cartography of remorse. Risk of sentimental object magic neutralized by procedural ritual and tactile specificity. Not a trope retread; pattern feels inevitable in hindsight. Specificity of "snowy gardens" childhood memory anchors originality.</comment>
