<question>1</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid—”a sliver of pure, harvested silence” in her palm shows embodied contradiction—but motivation is stated, not pressured; no second character, so crucible & status bullets N/A. Earned change is present via frequency capture, yet cost is conceptual (shard, dull star) rather than viscerally felt on her body. Voice stays consistent, but micro-choices plateau after the shard insertion; struggle flattens, keeping her just below 8-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Causal chain intact: star fragment → shard of hush → receiver retune → tonal capture. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: “space where new assumptions could grow” reweights premise with undeniable cognitive cost. Orientation anchored by ~80 words; no time-line drift. One scaffold loop: “serenely electric” repeated verbatim at open & close; mild, does not dull final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The tower city/gorge and lunar perigee are not backdrop; gravitational tide literally bends waves to enable the tune, satisfying 9+ gate. Micro-setting (obsidian shard, dials frozen mid-rotation) constrains her next move and charges the hush insertion beat. Sensory hierarchy stays filtered through signal-tech priorities—cold steel, practical light—no tourist catalog. Spatial choreography clean: pack → drawer → secondary port → dish tilt all track.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“find the beginning in every ending”—signaled early; tightening occurs when she re-tunes to absence not sound, foreclosing loud-signal option. Cost is conceptual (assumption void) rather than tangible loss, so pressure plateaus below 8-band. Agency is continuous: connect, insert, adjust. No coincidence; escalation coherent under Causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through reversal: noise → hush → creation blueprint; no moral stated. Subtext in shard-as-void and dull star-as-spent ambition subtly reweights glamour’s cost. Final image—tower now “tool, not tomb”—re-configures meaning without abstraction. Ambiguity remains: who else might tune next? Complexity honored, no tidy thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Lyra’s perceptual filter—celestial technician’s diction, not touristy. Rhythm flexes: long clause for cosmic murmur, fragment at “a single, clear tone” to mimic signal lock. No head-hopping; psychic distance stable. Filter verbs rare and voice-driven: “the air felt…” serves tone, not dilution.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>High metaphor density but pattern-taught early (“steel forest,” “lunar drumhead”) and paid off in final tower image. No mixed metaphors; vehicles stay mechanical/astronomical. One paraphrase loop: “serenely electric” ×2—minor. Sentence variety good, propulsion clean; no scaffold. Tense stable, pronouns clean, read-aloud rhythm varies.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: Hollywood glamour as RF filter, silence harvested as tangible tool—trope inversion feels inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric compression sustains clarity. Specificity (fused sand + celebrity ambition) anchors premise. Could swap city name, but shard & star mechanics are irreplaceable. No prior echo of this exact combo.</comment>
