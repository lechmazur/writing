<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara’s cautious stance and isolation are credibly rooted, but her contradictory impulses surface more in summary (“she believed…”) than in split-second embodied beats. The final shift to unity-proposal is clearly motivated by the on-page reflection-echo, so the arc lands, yet interiority sometimes drifts into diagnostic labels (“cosmic tricksters”) rather than visceral contradiction under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: subsonic ping → immediate mirror-echo → recognition that division is self-inflicted → decision to seek unity. Orientation is clean by line 6; the lone transition (dawn exit) is legible. Closure is a Charged Poise: the cost is the ongoing burden of mending a fracturing faculty, felt as she powers down the console.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The console, charts, and vibrating floor function as micro-setting that constrain action; the Cygnus Arm vector is specific enough to steer the beam. “Grinding starlight” adds sonic texture without overwriting. Spatial choreography stays coherent; no white-room syndrome.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prevent community self-destruction via reckless signal—signals early. Tightening occurs when the mirror-echo proves that any transmission weaponizes internal splits, foreclosing both Kline’s glory hunt and Mirren’s total silence; Elara’s only path is social repair. Cost is conceptual but legible: she must now shoulder mediation without guarantee of success.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of self-exploited division emerges through the mirror mechanism rather than lecturing. The reprise of her own prime sequence reweights earlier departmental bickering as cosmic feedback, yielding resonant ambiguity: are the reflectors external or psychic? No moralizing coda; the dawn walk carries understated ethical heft.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Third-person adheres tightly to Elara’s perceptual filter; diction (“celestial whispers,” “grinding starlight”) feels idiosyncratic to her vocation. Rhythm modulates from patient vigil to clipped discovery, mirroring tension. No dialogue to test voice distinction, but interior voice stays consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; few filter verbs. Occasional elevated phrases (“ethereal grit”) flirt with register drift but stay within an astronomer-poet lexicon. No loops or mixed metaphors; information density is high. One paraphrase loop—“power plays erupted daily…power plays within the university”—drops it slightly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The “reflectors” angle flips the standard first-contact anxiety into a self-division allegory without losing SF plausibility. Pulsar-map rhythm as cryptographic key is a fresh, specific method. Risk is moderate but effective; no gimmickry, and the premise could not swap genres unchanged.</comment>
