<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elara’s involuntary truthfulness is dramatized under immediate black-market pressure; her rationalism collides with raw need, producing a credible micro-choice to barter the truffles. The shift from self-protection to communal shelter is tracked through on-page risk (storm rituals, eye’s waning charge), so the arc earns its cost. Interiority stays specific to her perceptual bias—botanical precision against psychic noise—without lapsing into diagnostic labels. Minor slip: the communal extension beat is summarized rather than shown, muting the final hierarchy of values.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal chain is clean: truthfulness → dangerous barter → storm-charging → fragile sanctuary, each because/therefore link tightening options. Closure lands as Earned Stasis—she must endlessly renew the eye’s charge, a felt constraint priced on the page (“each storm-battered ritual reminded her…”). Orientation is anchored by word 90 with place, weather, and POV. single-scene default honored; no lens drift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The hanging orchard is not backdrop but tool: swaying root-nets force her climb, storm-winds dictate ritual timing, glass eye must be sky-exposed. Sensory hierarchy obeys her forager gaze—scent of bruised stone-fruit, tactile weight of truffle vs. eye—anchoring every beat. Weather evolves from ambient to assault to resource, charging the final image. Micro-setting (the warm sphere in her palm) constrains the last stance, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—psychological safety—faces immediate escalation: first the black-market trade where her truthfulness raises price, then the ritual where failure means empathic overload, finally the communal draw that threatens finite storms. Each tightening narrows her tactical option set and exacts an on-page price (season of truffles lost, bodily exposure on cliff, perpetual storm-watch). Resolution keeps the cost alive (“each storm-battered ritual reminded her…”), so pressure persists. One minor loop: “other survivors came seeking” is stated more than dramatized.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of “managed fracture” emerges through recurrent storm/eye imagery rather than statement; the glass eye’s partial, renewable silence argues that cures are maintenance, not healing. Final image reweights the premise: tranquility is rented, not owned, resisting moral neatness. Subtext in the barter scene—her truthfulness functioning as social currency—adds complexity. Avoids final-paragraph sermon, though “that was the most any could hope for” flirts with echo; resonance still derives from concrete particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains steady psychic distance aligned to Elara’s rational, botanical perceptual filter. Syntax is controlled, rhythmic rise during storm ritual—“wind screamed… lightning fractured”—without overwriting. No head-hopping; interiority stays character-bound. Occasional elevated diction (“psychic ailments,” “conceptual repricing”) slightly overleaps her evident education but remains within tolerable range.</comment>

<comment>Prose is lean, high-density: one sentence often performs atmosphere, propulsion, and world rule simultaneously. Figurative language is sparse, taught early (“roots woven into nets”) and paid off at closure. No paraphrase loops, no filter-verb stacks. A single mixed metaphor (“valley like a physical pressure” and “static” in same breath) is minor enough to leave clarity intact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Post-empathy-virus world plus sympathetic-magic botany feels fresh yet internally coherent. Venetian glass eye as occluding “antenna” is specific, non-obvious, and causally integrated. The inversion of truthfulness from liability to trust-building currency under threat transforms a familiar trope. Risky choice to make silence partial and labor-intensive pays off, preventing easy feel-good closure.</comment>
