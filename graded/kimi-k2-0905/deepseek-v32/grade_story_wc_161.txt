<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses—preserving loss vs. re-engaging with life—are dramatized in the attic dust-mapping ritual and the moment she risks asking Henry for help. The embodied tremor in her “voice cracking from disuse” and the tactile meteorite chip make her grief specific. Micro-choice hierarchy is visible: she surrenders isolation to co-compose, paying the cost of reopening herself to further loss. The ending earns her shift without tidy healing.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal lens: pigeon’s return (no message, muddy feathers) → triggers decision to “transcribe” meteorite → forces Elara to leave attic → collaboration births new song. Each because/therefore linkage tightens options; the final played composition is the Decisive Change with felt cost—she exposes her rebuilt heart to fresh possible silence. Closure reweights the meteorite from relic to generative instrument; persistent constraint remains: songs still vanish, but she now chooses to keep making them.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The attic’s paper towers and single skylight act as micro-setting that literally constrains movement and supplies the dust motes she maps; the phonograph pulled from “cluttered depths” enables the climax. Sensory hierarchy obeys Elara’s curator ear: coo > paper scent > meteorite coolness. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from roof-beam perch to desk to shared floor space with Henry. Final image of skylight illuminating dust while new melody plays charges the setting with transformed meaning.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can she bear to let the past change form—tightens when Jasper arrives message-less, forcing the choice to risk collaboration. Escalation is causal: inaction (continued mapping) becomes untenable once the silence itself is questioned. Cost is visible: she forfeits the safety of frozen grief and accepts the possibility of new loss. One meaningful turn suffices; coincidence (muddy feathers) complicates rather than resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: preservation is not stasis but transformation. Subtext lives in the meteorite’s shift from tombstone to tuning fork and in shared silences with Henry. The final played notes answer the thematic question—echoes survive by being re-made, not embalmed. Complexity remains: no guarantee the new song won’t also vanish.</comment>

<comment>Lyric, faintly archaic diction (“aerie,”“brittle pages”) mirrors Elara’s attic solitude; rhythm lengthens during dust-mapping, then contracts when she speaks. Perceptual signature is curator-acoustic: she hears pigeons before seeing, reads smears as text. No head-hopping; Henry’s interiority arrives only through Elara’s noticing his “quiet eyes.” Syntax stays controlled under pressure—no filter-verb stacks.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet breathable: “paper trails, towering piles of ledgers, letters, and sheet music” packs four nouns that sketch the attic’s archaeology in one breath. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or causality. Metaphors are precise—“blooming withering” is oxymoron that encapsulates tonal arc. Read-aloud rhythm accelerates during equipment haul, then settles into long sentence for the haunting playback without drumbeat monotony.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: carrier-pigeon grief + meteorite cosmic score + dust-mote cartography yields a story that could not swap names or props without collapse. Risk resides in quiet stakes—no war scenes, only attic silence—yet emotional cost is sharp. Mars meteorite as recording device is transformed from quirky MacGuffin to necessary instrument of reinvention. Specificity of “water-stained symphony score” prevents generic “old music” placeholder.</comment>
