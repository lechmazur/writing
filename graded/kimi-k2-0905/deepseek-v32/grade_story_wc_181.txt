<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Aris’s “brightened disquiet” is embodied every time light pulses against his skin; the interior contradiction between duty and forbidden curiosity stays active in scene. Micro-choice—pressing the cameo to the bloom—earns the climactic vision and costs him his former stance. Beats could be leaner, but the action-to-interior ratio keeps pressure alive.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: knowledge is not extracted but generated by asking, a reweighting legible in the glowing self-portrait cameo. The single causal spine (question → imprint → vision) holds under the Accumulative/Textural lens; the bathroom shard functions as taught pattern, not break. Spatial/temporal anchors arrive within 120 words; no orientation debt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The synaptic orchard’s light levels, temperature shifts, and hum of recycled air constrain when and how Aris acts; the bathroom’s sterile planes catalyze the epiphany. Sensory triage follows POV bias—he notices bloom pulses over starfields because they answer or refuse him. Micro-setting (the cameo’s carved oval) becomes the final charged image; meets 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“possess forbidden knowledge”—tightens into the realization that possession is impossible; the inversion costs him certainty and rewrites his curatorial task. Single meaningful escalation occurs when the cameo imprints his face, making future inquiries personal; price is visible and felt. Agency resides in the decision to press; coincidence plays no role in resolution.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges as “inheritance is a network of questions, not answers,” demonstrated through the orchard’s synaptic storage of doubt rather than fact. No thematic echo in final paragraph; resonance delivered by the glowing cameo portrait that reframes earlier blankness. Subtext pulses in the orchard’s silent nod, affirming Aris’s renunciation without pronouncement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Perceptual signature filters cosmic imagery through curatorial cataloging—“astral orchard,” “synaptic blooms”—syntax stays precise, slightly academic, never purple. No dialogue; interior diction consistent with a man who keeps logbooks. Compression (“simply complicated”) is taught early and paid off; patterned elision in shard transitions remains legible.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no algorithmic rhythm. High information density—“pistachio shell cameo blank” does noun-and-modifier work in four syllables. One scaffold loop: “the simply complicated nature of his duty” is restated three times; trims would sharpen. No figurative muddle in peak beats; closure image remains clear.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Combines cosmic librarian, neural orchard, and bathroom metaphysics into an inevitable synthesis; risk lies in dignifying the lavatory as portal, fully realized. The pistachio-shell heirloom reframes the trivial as cosmic without feeling twee. Freshness survives the transformation test—plot collapses without these exact elements.</comment>
