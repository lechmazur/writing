<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid (“the clasp was cold…a tangible link”), but Leo’s contradictory impulses are summarized rather than enacted in scene; the shame confession is delivered in a single expository block without micro-choice pressure, so the renunciation feels announced, not earned. The memory surge upon touching clasp-to-photo is the only embodied beat that genuinely reveals character under stress.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the clasp absorbs the luminance, funhouse collapses, fear evicted—legible Decisive Change with conceptual cost (perpetual carriage of fear-core). Causal chain holds: dream note → funhouse entry → clasp key → confession → vacuum-seal luminance. One soft spot: the advisor’s “materialize” beat is unmotivated, a ghost-in-the-machine convenience that slightly dilutes causality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>“Sickly green light that seemed to pulse like a heartbeat” and “photographically cursed” images supply sensory specificity; the funhouse corridor tightens spatial choreography; the central photograph constrains the final action—setting charges closure. Still, broader carnival geography remains sketch; we never feel exits, dimensions, or exterior weather, keeping it from top band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“trick fear into revealing its weakness”—is signaled early; pressure tightens once when Leo voices the staged-death secret and the mirrors weep silver, foreclosing denial. Cost is visible (clasp now permanently hosts luminance), but escalation is single-note; no intermediate tactical loss or reversal between entry and confession prevents higher band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of confession-as-exorcism emerges through image chain: cursed photos → silver tears → evacuated funhouse, avoiding explicit moral. The paradoxical note “Joy is fear unmasked” reweights at closure when Leo pockets the warm clasp—Conceptual Repricing without preach. Complexity acknowledged: advisor is self-subconscious, preserving ambiguity. Final paragraph’s “lessons would linger” drifts toward summary—minor slip.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Third-person keeps tight psychic distance, perceptual signature colored by Leo’s morbid fascination: “repulsive allure,” “photographically cursed.” Rhythm modulates—long sentences for decay, staccato for confession. No head-hop. Occasional template cadence (“He…”) appears but not clustered. Voice distinct enough for high band.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Strong verbs (“unfastened,” “wept silver tears”) and sensory density keep momentum; only minor loop: “repulsive allure” phrase repeated without variation. Mixed metaphor risk—“core concept the advisor warned about”—but clarified by context. No artifact touches the climax; opening and closing lines hit ear-right cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Fusing “staged death at masquerade” with “dream-dictionary-guided funhouse exorcism” produces fresh gothic texture; trope inversion (confession defeats fear) feels inevitable yet non-generic. Some decorative phrasing (“photographically cursed”) borders gimmick but earns keep by motivating photo beat. Risk level moderate; execution coherent.</comment>
