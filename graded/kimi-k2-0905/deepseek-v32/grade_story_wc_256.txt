<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elara’s curiosity is vivid, but interior contradiction is only asserted (“questioning assumptions”) rather than dramatized in a moment of risk; the emotional arc is smooth rather than jagged under pressure. No tangible cost or renunciation is staged on the page, so the change feels observed, not earned. Her “powerfully gentle” touch never collides with a limit that would force a costly micro-choice. Still, the sensory anchoring of motive in the worn lens keeps the portrait above mid-tier.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the broadcast symphony reframes the lab from mausoleum to bridge, with conceptual cost—the past is now irrevocably public, no longer her private archive. Causality holds under an Accumulative lens: each bell-resonance layers density until the final tapestry reweights the stake. The piece teaches its pattern early and stays legible. A firmer felt price (fatigue, privacy surrendered) would push it higher.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The “golden shadows” micro-setting is tactile and recurrent; light through the lens literally guides her choices and reappears in the final broadcast, satisfying the 9+ gate. Selective auditory detail (prism-song spectra) filters every action through Elara’s ear-eye synesthesia. Spatial choreography is clean—lens, bell, plate, archive cache track without drift. Could edge higher if environmental hazard (flickering grid, dust abrasion) had pressed her method further.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“texture of connection”—is signaled early and tightens when the miner-chant resonance fuses with her bells, foreclosing solitary study: she must share or lose the bridge. Agency is present in the overlay choice, but the cost is softly collective (community healing) rather than personally stinging, keeping pressure lyrical not lacerating. One meaningful intensification suffices for Accumulative mode; a second private loss would deepen the turn.</comment>
