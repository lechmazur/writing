<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Eli’s interiority is specific—his “mathematics of a fair trade” obsession governs every micro-choice, culminating in the cosmetic ritual that hides Aris. The note’s renunciation is earned: we watch the ink pot literally rewrite his filial contract. Stefan remains a tantalizing silhouette rather than a full second pressure source, so relationship-as-crucible is only partly activated. Still, the cost is felt when Eli forfeits his father’s world for an axiom of zero profit.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a crisp Conceptual Repricing: Eli’s note redefines “fair trade” as taking nothing, a permanent mark that liquefies Stefan’s cons. Causal chain is clean—ink pot cue → active-wait discipline → breach → cosmetic disguise → call to Aris’s ally—each step because/therefore. Orientation is anchored by 50 words; no lens ambiguity. Visible cost: Eli’s forfeiture of future loot and father-trust, crystallized in the inked farewell.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The prep-room’s mortuary tools—formaldehyde reek, wax jars—constrain Eli’s tactical imagination, supplying the cosmetic disguise that saves Aris. Micro-setting doubles as moral mirror: the table that “embalms” the living becomes the stage for Eli’s ethical rebirth. Spatial choreography is immaculate; no floating bodies. Weather is used once (rain-lashed night) to motivate the breach but doesn’t overstay.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—Eli’s need for a fair-trade axiom—tightens when the breach forces an immediate binary: save Aris or protect father’s scam. The cosmetic disguise is a visible price (Eli abrades his conscience) and forecloses the inherited grifter path. Escalation is causal, single-cycle, sufficient for 700 words. No off-stage rescue; the phone call is seeded in Aris’s memory, so agency stays on-page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from Eli’s equation: value given = value taken → value given = 0. The ink pot’s reappearance as writing tool reweights “permanent marks” into writable revolt. No overt moralizing; the final image (note on empty table) lets silence speak. Subtext in the cosmetic ritual—life painted as death—mirrors the con-life Eli refuses. Complexity lingers: Stefan is wronged yet reader feels filial betrayal’s sting.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person close adheres to Eli’s perceptual filter: numbers, geometry, chemical scents. Sentence rhythm tightens under breach—“blood turned to ice, then… to something else”—mirroring shift from stasis to fluid act. No head-hopping; Stefan’s reaction is外部 legible only through the note he holds. Diction stays within a brainy teen’s lexicon; no register drift. Dialogue is minimal but subtextual when Aris whispers proofs, supplying Eli’s emotional vocabulary.</comment>

<comment>Prose is lean, high-density: “antiseptic thing,” “cosmetic wax,” “ambiguous currency” each carry plot + atmosphere. No loops or near-paraphrase; every sentence advances. Metaphors are spare and consistent—ink as liquidity, death as performance. Opening line anchors voice and stakes simultaneously. Final line lands with imagistic punch that recharges ink-pot motif. Minor filter verbs (“Eli watched”) are purposeful, establishing POV distance before intimacy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Fusing funeral-home mise-en-scène with refugee thriller is fresh; using embalming cosmetics as live camouflage feels inevitable yet unforeseen. The “fair-trade axiom” reframes morality as geometric proof, avoiding sentimental heist beats. Ink pot’s metaphoric flip—from permanence to erasable ethic—gives a charged, non-literal closure. Risk is moderate but coherent; no gimmickry, no trope recycling. Specific detail (Aris traces proofs in air) counters generic “asylum” shorthand.</comment>
