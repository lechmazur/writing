<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Interiority is specific to Lyra—her “quiet revelation,” “heart pounding,” and choice to invite, not command, the glow. The earned shift from underachiever to custodian carries visible cost: she forfeits guild prestige and embraces fragile, non-scalable magic. Contradictory impulses—yearning for simplicity yet fearing obscurity—play out in the kneel-and-invite beat. Closure ties directly to these motives, fulfilling the 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory layer (ice ache, vine glow, phantom garden) deepens the stake without causal reversals. Closure is a Charged Poise—the expanding garden-light reconfigures meaning while Lyra’s custodial vow forecloses return to the guild; cost is legible in “she forfeits dazzle for a single silent glow.” No orientation debt; transitions are smooth within the single-scene window. One hairline slip: “brilliant dimness” is slightly self-contradictory exposition, keeping it under 9.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Keystone-as-micro-setting constrains the final choice—its vine channel determines where the glow spreads, charging closure. Ice-window, cloud-sea, and diffused twilight are filtered through Lyra’s relieved attention, not catalogued. Spatial choreography is clean: palms on stone → glow flows floor → walls → her laugh echoes. Sensory economy favors touch and sight under calm pressure; no static repetition.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“find the sacred in the simple”—tightens when the keystone offers exactly that but at the price of obscurity. One meaningful escalation: mist-walking success turns spire from exile to cradle, narrowing her options to stay. Cost is felt but could be sharper (e.g., concrete guild repercussion); hence stops short of 8.5+. No false intensifiers; coincidence only reveals, not resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: automation versus fragile, useless beauty. Subtext lives in gesture—inviting light, dusting ledges—never sermon. Final image reweights “underachievement” as guardianship without moralizing. One tiny echo of prompt language (“sacred in the simple”) in final paragraph costs −0.2, preventing 9.0.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Lyra’s perceptual filter: “slow ache of the ice,” “ghostly scent of soil.” Syntax lengthens during luminous bloom, then shortens on her laugh—rhythmic control under pressure. No head-hopping; diction remains within her plausible lexicon. Distinctive phrase “brilliant dimness” is reused once too often, a hairline slip.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Strong read-aloud rhythm; sentences vary in length and opening. High density—“cold, moist presence filled the chamber, not a physical fog but a perceptual one” does triple duty. One mixed metaphor (“lighthouse for a different kind of brilliance”) is minor. Zero loops or scaffold; no filter-verb stacks in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Familiar “antique object holds prelapsarian magic” trope is refreshed by tying the glow to joy-without-function, then making that fragility the explicit stakes. Custodial identity swap feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Specific detail—vine-carved keystone, cloud-sea window—anchors the concept. Risk in quiet accumulative structure pays off, meriting +0.3 within band.</comment>
