<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Aris’s obsessive frugality is concrete—reusing parchment, diluting ink—yet the interiority stays generic: “desire to seal a covenant” is told, not embodied. The final self-expenditure is credible because the tile’s drain is foreshadowed, but we never feel bodily fear or cost; the laugh is the only embodied beat. Contradictory impulses (save vs. spend) are asserted rather than enacted in-scene. Still, the arc from hoarded life to total expenditure is coherent and character-bound.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: Aris’s life is the price, the palace becomes astrolabe, tile reverts to clay—before/after is legible. Causal chain: tile discovery → schematic mapping → alignment → drain. No teleporting data; each step grows from prior. Orientation clear by line 4; no lens ambiguity. The cost is felt in the cooling tile and scouts’ indifference—ironic repricing achieved.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Palace-as-instrument is vivid: terraces “hanging between day and night,” chamber open to sky, tile’s internal glow. Micro-setting—the tile underfoot—literally steers the climax. Sensory hierarchy biased to Aris’s astronomer gaze, but touch (warm tile) seals the pact. Spatial choreography clean; no floating anchors.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake: knowledge vs. self-preservation. Escalation is single but meaningful: schematic alignment narrows options to self-sacrifice. Cost is visible—his consciousness “unravels.” No artificial reversals; coincidence complicates nothing. Pressure stays under causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme: frugality as false economy—total expenditure buys cosmic union. Emerges through tile’s ironic demand, not authorial sermon. Final scouts’ shrug reweights prior devotion as invisible, underscoring theme. Resists tidy moral; ambiguity lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person lyric distance remains stable; perceptual signature is star-chart filtered—“dusky harmony,” “numeric cipher.” Syntax modulates: longer cadence for twilight calm, clipped clauses at drain moment. No head-hop or register drift. Dialogue absent; voice sustained by metaphoric control.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Rhythm breathes with twilight pacing; no template cadence or synonym loops. Figurative layer is selective—“terraced gardens hanging” is fresh; no metaphor pile-up in climax. Information density high: one sentence often sets scene and stakes. Copy clean; no scaffold artifacts.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fusion of palace-as-astrolabe and magic-square heart is fresh, yet “cosmic covenant via ancient artifact” leans on familiar numinous-math trope. Frugality-as-cosmic-irony rescues it from generic. Specificity of Babylonian reimagining helps. Not transformative enough for 9-band, but above-template.</comment>
