<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Aris’s envy-of-metamorphosis and mentor-loss guilt are concrete early; the arrowhead warming and her body lightening embody the shift. The cosmic-laugh beat crystallizes her renunciation with visible cost. One hairline slip: “turn bitterness into a cosmic joke” edges toward thesis-statement, not embodied choice, keeping it sub-9.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: fungal glow, gravity wobble, and static co-densify until the single clear tone reweights premise. Closure is Charged Poise—hovering bioluminescent guardian—cost legible in forfeited surface life. No因果 gaps; each image accretes rather than explains. Pattern taught by 25 %; legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Underground garden is not backdrop but causes the gravitational missteps that trigger confession; flint arrowhead final embed recharges space. Sensory triage—glow, scent, directional gravity—filters through Aris’s researcher eye. Micro-setting qualifies and constrains final tactic: she stays because the garden’s field now flows through her.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will she master or merge with the garden’s harmony—tightens when gravity literally levitates her during confession. Cost visible: forfeited human form and surface future. One escalation beat suffices for 750-word span; no reversal required. Could use one earlier tangible loss (tool, time) to push into 8.8+ band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from pattern: sorrow-fed metamorphosis, confession as compost, laughter as acceptance. No moralizing; final image of glowing arrowhead pulse reweights prior grief without statement. Ambiguity lingers—guardian duties undefined yet felt. Resonant reconfiguration meets Q2 ownership; subtext operates in static hiss and wing-reflection.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person hovers at researcher-distance yet slips into Aris’s perceptual signature—“gravitationally playful,” “cosmic joke”—without head-hop. Syntax tightens under levitation: fragments mirror breath-shortening. No dialogue to judge; internal monologue avoids diagnostic speak. One template-ish recurrence of “wild harmony” keeps it sub-9.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Strong noun-verb propulsion; bioluminescent fungi, flint pulse, static tone avoid modifier clutter. No paraphrase loops; “garden’s harmony” thrice is motif, not scaffold. Minor simultaneity slip—“arrowhead grew warm as she spoke”—is forgiven in lyric mode. Closure image clean; no figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Cryptid-botanist confessing into a cordless phone that replays her own static as metamorphic trigger is non-obvious synthesis. Risk: levitation-transformation inside 800 words could read gimmick, but gravitational field is seeded early, paid off in arrowhead embed. Familiar grief-to-awe arc made specific via garden physics. Fresh inflection lands.</comment>
