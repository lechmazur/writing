<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elara’s desire to “translate isolation into independence” is stated early and re-iterated, but the interior contradiction between clinging and release is told rather than embodied; the single micro-choice—pressing the shell to the stone—lacks sensory or bodily specificity that would reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. The earned hollowness at the end is credible, yet the absence of any micro-failure or complicating impulse keeps the arc emotionally flat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Causal chain is clean: shell → resonance → archive → freedom, with the fading star as a hard external clock. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—the garden permanently holds the echo, Elara’s stance is reweighted, cost is felt in the “hollow space.” Orientation is swift; no teleporting information. A single beat of micro-obstacle or failed attempt would have tightened escalation further.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Garden, monolith, and shell function as micro-setting that literally constrain method; velvet petals tremble in response, integrating sensory detail with action. Twilight-to-dawn progression is tracked without cliché and mirrors internal fade/illumination. Spatial choreography remains stable; no white-room syndrome. The garden’s rules are learned through use, not exposition, and the final image is charged by the setting’s permanence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—safe archiving without possession—is signaled early and tightened once: the pull to cling versus the resolve to release. The star’s disappearance supplies external pressure that narrows options. Cost is conceptual (permanent echo lodged in stone, personal hollowness) but lacks a visible, stakes-raising misstep or irreversible forfeiture mid-process. Sufficient for this length, yet borderline for 8.8+.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme of memory-as-burden emerges through the archive act and the garden’s permanent absorption; no explicit thesis is stated. The tragic radiance motif shifts from pain to usable permanence without moralizing. Subtext operates in the shell’s crescendo and the garden’s tremor. Final image reweights the premise: memory preserved ≠ memory possessed. A sharper ironic gap—e.g., a residual physical mark on Elara—would deepen resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric voice sustains a consistent ghostly cadence; diction stays within Elara’s perceptual range (“quarantined memory,” “tragically radiant”). Repetition of “ghostly resolve” is purposeful pattern, taught early. No POV leakage or filter-verb clutter. Syntax modulates with the shell’s rising whisper. Near 9-band but one or two adjectival stacks (“tragically radiant glow”) flirt with overwriting under peak pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with the shell’s escalation; sentence lengths vary, no template cadence. Figurative language is selective and coherent—resonance structures, singing stones—without purple drift. One paraphrase loop: “archive meant to preserve without possession” restates prior beat. No mixed metaphors or simultaneity errors. Line-level artifacts never touch closure. Clean copy; opening and closing lines anchor and resolve effectively.</comment>
<question>8</question>
<grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>The memory-archive-through-resonance concept freshens the familiar “let go of the past” arc, grounding it in a tactile garden lattice. Specificity of the half-shell and singing stones prevents generic allegory. Risk is moderate: lyric causal design rather than twist. Could edge higher with a sharper irreversible side-effect that only this method could produce.</comment>
