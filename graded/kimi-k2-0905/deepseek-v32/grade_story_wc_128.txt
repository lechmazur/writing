<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elias’s shift from “sharp deals” to gratitude letters is legible and rooted in the symphony trigger; the interior contradiction is stated rather than dramatized in scene, so the cost feels announced, not embodied. Clara stays appealing but functions more as catalyst than crucible; her one on-page beat is accepting the locket, a micro-choice that doesn’t test or change her stance. The final “greatest deal” line shows earned perspective, satisfying the arc, yet the absence of a true two-character pressure scene keeps the relational change summary-level.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: symphony → letters → misdelivery → friendship → public award; each because/therefore link is on-page. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: Elias re-values “deal” from cargo to human connection, with the locket’s circulation as visible social cost. The Orientation Test is passed by word 75; no anchor confusion. One minor elasticity: the award’s funding mechanics are asserted, not shown, but do not break causality at the ending image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Setting details are selective and POV-filtered (calloused hands, sea breeze through arches); the library under stars is returned to twice, evolving from incidental to ceremonial, recharging the ending. Objects—locket, envelopes—are handled tactilely and track cleanly. Environment does not physically constrain choices, so the 9+ gate fails, but atmosphere supports theme without clutter. Spatial choreography remains coherent across the two venues.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—turn private gratitude into public culture—is signaled early and tightened once when Elias decides to scale up via Clara’s network. The meaningful turn is his proposal of the award; it forecloses his prior anonymity and risks commercial reputation, a cost stated but not dramatized in conflict with an antagonist. Pressure is steady but singular; no second reversal. Sufficient for 600-word scope, yet the lack of an on-page obstacle or felt price caps the band below 8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges inductively from the chain of quiet contributions rather than explicit declaration; the locket’s migration enacts “cycles” without sermon. Final image of applause carried to sea reweights earlier motifs with understated resonance. Subtext in letters and shared locket avoids sentimentality. One soft echo of thesis language—“cycles of compassion”—appears mid-story, not in final paragraph, so penalty waived.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Third-person voice maintains consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature is Elias’s broker diction (“shrewd,” “deal,” “cargo”) modulating into gentler cadence as stakes shift. No dialogue on page, so voice tests default to narrative texture. Syntax is controlled, with purposeful repetition of “breezy library under stars” creating accumulative lyricism. No head-hopping or register drift; elision is minimal and taught early.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; sentences advance premise or image. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Occasional elevated phrasing (“constellations wheeled overhead”) stays within POV’s lifted post-symphony mood. One paraphrase loop—“cycles of compassion” named three times—slightly dulls edge but never muddies closure, keeping the band solid.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Premise of misdelivered gratitude letter turning broker into community builder is fresh without gimmickry; transformation feels inevitable in hindsight. Specific coastal details (stevedores, night watchman, fishermen’s reading program) personalize the template. Risk is moderate: sentimental uplift is a crowded lane, but the locket’s circulation and award’s sustainable funding give it particular spin. Not boundary-pushing yet memorable within its lane.</comment>
