<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara’s pensive-mirth contradiction is stated repeatedly but never embodied in a reversible micro-choice; the fresco fragment is handled lovingly yet never complicates her tactics. Interiority relies on lyrical labels (“thin but real” joy) rather than specific bodily tension or risk. The ending’s “renewed spirit” is declared, not dramatized—no cost visible on the page—so the arc feels observed rather than earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the final “tree of light” image crystallizes her stance and reconfigures fog from erasure to canvas. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—repetitive light-painting beats accrue density until the sunray pattern-break. Causality is loose (no external obstacle) yet coherent under lyric accumulation. Cost is conceptual (fog remains, joy reframed) but not viscerally felt—cap stays below 8.8.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fog as mutable micro-setting constrains every move: it swallows geography, dictates the light-painting method, and becomes the literal projection screen at closure. Sensory hierarchy is painterly—visual spectra dominate, justified by POV. Arch, mossy stone, and orchard ghosts are selectively re-illuminated rather than catalogued, keeping economy tight.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Stake—recover lost joy—stays abstract; no live option is ever foreclosed (she could simply leave). Escalation is textural: each light-murual overlays the ruins with denser memory, but pressure plateaus rather than tightens. Visible price (fresco almost drops? lantern battery fades?) is absent, so 8.8+ is unreachable.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: memory as palimpsest—each projection layers new art over decay without erasing it. Final image of the glowing fragment reframes loss as renewable medium, avoiding moralism. Ambiguity is fruitful: is she consoling ghosts or herself? Subtext stays in glimmers rather than stated thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person lyric achieves painterly distance consistent with protagonist’s medium. Lexicon stays within artist register (prism, spectrum, exposure) without jargon drift. Rhythm modulates between long breathy sentences and clipped light verbs (“cast, pulse, swirl”) that mimic beam movement. No dialogue, so voice convergence risk is avoided.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Loop check: six iterations of “painted with light” and four of “knowledge network” create template cadence that dulls final third. Mixed metaphors—“exposed film of her mind”—blur physical/analogue logic. Otherwise vivid specificity (“spectrum danced in the mist”) and strong verb choices keep momentum alive.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade>
<comment>Light-painting in fog-ruins is fresh; “exposed film” metaphor feels grafted from a different tech era and never integrated optically. Core move—projecting memory onto weather—derives from familiar “screensaver of ghosts” trope. Salvaged by tactile painter idiom and orchard-specific folklore retrieved via network.</comment>
