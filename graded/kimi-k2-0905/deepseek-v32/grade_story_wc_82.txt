<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elian’s grief and lantern-making obsession read vividly; the folding of cranes and polishing of gems are embodied micro-choices under pressure. Interior contradiction is present—he courts pain to court peace—yet the arc is largely summarized, not dramatized in scene, so the final “weight lifting” feels coaxed rather than earned. No second character on page, so relationship crucible and status dynamics N/A.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Mira’s raw dream is re-folded into luminous birds that cast no shadow, a clear before/after with conceptual cost. Causal chain (grief → polishing → folding → release) is legible under Accumulative/Textural lens; pattern taught early via cranes. Orientation anchored within 120 words; no teleporting props. One minor causality wobble: the basilica’s paradoxical descent/ascent is asserted but never constrains action, so the metaphor remains decorative rather than tactical.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Floating island, glass basilica, and emerald moss are rendered through selective sensory strokes that reflect Elian’s artisan eye. The tea garden re-appears at end lighter, mirroring internal shift—object charged by closure. Spatial choreography clean; no floating rooms. World rule (shadow = soul) learned through action, not lecture. Meets 9+ gate: the lantern-tool constrains the final transformation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—transmute ruinous memory into bearable light—is signaled in paragraph two. Escalation is textural: each gem-polish stroke intensifies emotional density until the dream folds into birds, foreclosing raw grief. No external antagonist; pressure is interior and coherent. Cost is felt (labor, exposure to pain), but not persistent—no concrete constraint carries past the final image, capping high-band entry.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of alchemy-through-art emerges via cranes, lanterns, gems—no explicit thesis. Final image of birds that cast no shadow reweights the shadow-loss rule with elegiac acceptance. Subtext in “perpetual twilight,” “trapped starlight” sustains luminous torment without label-speak. Avoids tidy moral; ambiguity lingers whether light truly heals or merely gilds pain.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited adheres to Elian’s artisan perception; diction of folding, polishing, rivulets feels particular. Rhythm swells and contracts with gem-work, then lifts in bird-flight. No dialogue, so dialogue bullets N/A. Free-indirect texture clean; no filter-verb stacks. Voice remains stable under stress; no head-hop. Meets 9+ quick test for perceptual signature and rhythmic control.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence. Figurative language dense but patterned (origami, light, descent/ascent) and paid off. Zero paraphrase loops; information density high. One mixed metaphor—“torrents of luminous torment”—slips into purple but occurs mid-story, not at closure, so high-band intact. Mechanics clean; no typos.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Shadow-as-soul and dream-polishing feel fresh, synthesized through lantern-maker vocation rather than trope checklist. Conceptual risk in “descends while ascending” architecture mostly decorative, not tactical, slightly dulling ingenuity. Emotional specificity of folding grief into cranes avoids generic loss narrative. Transformation test passes: removing lantern-craft collapses plot. No close echoes of famous scenes.</comment>
