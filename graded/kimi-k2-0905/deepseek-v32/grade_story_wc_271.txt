<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Aria’s embodied micro-choices (steady hands while planting, chest-tight check) show believable progression from freeze to cultivated stillness. Diagnostic phrase “somatic markers” intrudes mid-crisis without dramatized cost, blunting peak interiority. Final renunciation—photo set beside her, tree chosen—earns its quiet via prior beats; cost is the creases she refuses to smooth.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: cultivating stillness inside loss re-weights earlier photo/arboretum motifs with visible cost (solitude, soil under nails). Accumulative lens holds; each freeze → notice → plant beat tightens the cadence. One shard only, orientation anchored at word 12; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Sea-cliff arboretum constrains choices—salt-wind rules species, bench placement steers panic work—charging final salt-tolerant sapling image. Photograph functions as micro-setting, its creases mirrored in cliff crevices. Sensory triage (cold fingers, damp earth) filters through gardener priorities; no white-room lapse.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will she act while frozen by trauma—tightens once: storm triggers freeze, somatic check enables planting. Cost (fatigue, visible solitude) appears on page; persistent wind-salt constraint shapes final tactic choice. No false coincidence; escalation is textural density, adequate for 600-word frame.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stillness-as-cultivation emerges through action, not thesis; photo creases + salt-pruned bonsai reconfigure “optimism” as scar-acceptance. Final image answers the thematic question without moralizing. Therapy term “somatic markers” is the lone didactic leak.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Third-person hovers at Aria’s perceptual pitch—gardener’s tool-eye, wind map, muscle census—maintaining stable psychic distance. Rhythm modulates: clipped clauses during freeze, longer horticultural sentences during re-rooting. No dialogue to test, yet interior diction stays within her lived lexicon except one therapist phrase.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High-density sentences carry double duty (action + metaphor) without purple overload. No loops, clean tense track. Figurative work (“pearl of stillness”) recurs too often mid-text, but stops before closure, sparing final beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Drone-strike widow trope is refreshed via bonsai grafting as trauma grafting; lighthouse-automation ghost quietly mirrors survivor automation. Specific horticultural choices resist trope wallpaper. Could swap coastal location, but internal gardening logic is inseparable from arc.</comment>
