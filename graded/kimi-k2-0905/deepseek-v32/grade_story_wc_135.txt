<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s solitary drive is vivid: every micro-choice—uncorking a vial, kneeling in shale—radiates from her reactive gift and compulsion to mend silence. The valve’s warming in her palm externalizes internal stakes, letting embodied emotion stand in for exposition. No contradictory impulse is dramatized in-scene, so the conflict edges toward emblematic rather than wrenching, keeping this just outside 9.0 terrain.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a textbook Conceptual Repricing: the phantom lattice makes “navigated absences” a live diagram the crowd can re-inhabit, reweighting exile from loss to score. Causality is immaculate—every spray release stems from the valve’s pull, calibrated across staggered intervals—so lens (Causal) holds. The final sentence crystallizes cost: the valve “warm and still” signals spent agency; exiles now carry the burden of performance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The ivory harbor micro-manages every beat: wet shale grip, tide-marker numerals, crushed bell as mold. Each sensory shard is filtered through Elara’s archival priorities, guiding her next placement of vials. Environment directly enables the conceptual closure; without the rain-slicked quays as projection screen, the lattice could not be shown. This satisfies the 9+ gate of setting constraining the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recovering the harbor’s temporal frame—tightens when the bell proves irreparable, forcing Elara to invent a communal spectacle instead of a sound. Pressure escalates through because/therefore links: valve warms → next vial chosen → ghost scene activated → crowd sees pattern. Cost is visible: her archive is emptied, valve silenced, future song irrevocably altered. One further visceral loss (a vial she hesitates to spend) would have pushed this into 9+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as the inverse of nostalgia: memory is not retrieved but spatialized into a blueprint for new living. The ivory harbor’s “navigated absences” become a lattice the exiles can choose to re-occupy, avoiding moralizing. Subtext lingers in the valve’s muteness—some instruments can’t be repaired, only translated. Resonance is earned, though a touch more ambiguity about who will conduct the “different song” could deepen the after-image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person hovers at mid-distance, retaining Elara’s perceptual filter: “salt-corroded case,” “reactive gift,” “phantom echo bloomed.” Syntax flexes with tension—short clauses during valve pulses, longer cadences for crowd reaction—showing rhythmic control. No head-hopping; lexicon stays within her archival idiom. A faint editorial tinge in “sonic lattice that structured daily life” nicks the 9-band edge.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet breathable; figurative language is rationed to one crystalline image per beat. No paraphrase loops or mixed metaphors. Pronoun and spatial tracking is flawless across the staggered route. Rhythm modulates naturally—no template cadence—and the final line lands with echoic snap. A single overripe adjective (“gleamed”) in paragraph one keeps this from a hairline 9+.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>“Memory-impregnated sea spray” as archive is a fresh, risk-laden conceit that fuses occupation with worldbuilding. The trumpet valve transformed into cartographic key re-infuses a tired symbol with civic stakes. Specificity of the celestial-tidal schedule prevents generic harbor nostalgia. A lesser story would restore the trumpet; this one smelts memory into a new social contract—conceptual risk that pays off.</comment>
