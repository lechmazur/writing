<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Kael’s solitude is vivid and embodied—his finger on the glass, the warm shard at his chest—but interior contradiction stays static; the same “yearn→empath→stillness” loop repeats without new micro-cost. The final smile is earned by pattern, not by a fresh choice that forecloses anything; vulnerability is declared, not tested under sharper pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each traced meteor adds density until the stillness crystallizes, delivering a Charged Poise with felt hollowness. Orientation is swift, the single shard–to–screen transition is legible, and cost (the hollow after every burn) is reiterated; yet no late constraint retroactively shapes tactics, so closure is resonant but not irrevocably priced.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Station’s hush is rendered through tactile lenses, dust motes in shafts, cool console glass—detail selective and POV-filtered. The yellow glass functions as micro-setting, softening tech edges and guiding the final amber vision; however, the larger facility geography (where panels, corridors, or exits sit) stays vague, capping specificity just below elite tier.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—lonely caretaker seeks connection via stellar empathy—is signaled early. Pressure tightens once when real meteors arrive, forcing him from observer to participant, but options never narrow past “keep tracing”; escalation is poetic accumulation rather than a trade-off that risks loss or reconfigures possibility space.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges quietly: strength discovered in surrender, cosmos alive in stillness. Recurrent amber/yellow imagery reweights from nostalgic keepsake to perceptual lens, letting closure feel like revelation rather than moral. The insight avoids thesis statement, though the wording “core truth he had been groping toward” nudges abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Voice is hushed, stately, with controlled long sentences that mirror orbital drift; diction stays within a meditative custodial lexicon. Occasional elevated phrases—“primal elegance,” “luminous sigh”—risk self-conscious poetics, but rhythmic consistency and perceptual signature remain intact, no head-hop or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is fluid, read-aloud rhythmic, mostly free of scaffold; clauses layer without paraphrase loops. A few stacked epithets—“silent, simulated flash,” “profound flourishing stillness”—thicken density in high-pressure beats, slightly dulling immediacy. Otherwise precise verbs, clean grammar, strong paragraph cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>“Lonely janitor communes with dying meteors” is fresh emotional territory, not derivative trope. Conceptual twist—finding vitality in cosmic quiet rather than awe in explosion—adds non-obvious reweighting. Some phasings (“cosmic janitor,” “primal elegance”) flirt with stylized shorthand but overall synthesis feels particular and inevitable.</comment>
