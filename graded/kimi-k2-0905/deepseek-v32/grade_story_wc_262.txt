<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid—her spatial mind mapping the booth as a “clockwork city” shows embodied contradiction. The final “witness” moment is a credible renunciation: she pays with the permanent lodging of these sorrows inside her. Yet her flaw (obsessive cartography of grief) never complicates the quest; once she touches the film, progress is frictionless. Still, the cost is legible and character-particular, satisfying the 9− quick test.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each frame thickens the archive of un-mailed love until the silence itself becomes the repository. Closure is a Charged Poise—Elara’s internal archive is now an open resonance chamber, cost paid by her bodily “steady rhythm” of hushed thunder. No Orientation debt; anchoring complete by line 4. A hairline slip: the lyrics’ final “bittersweet aria” is declared rather than dramatized, keeping it under 9.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Booth, film strip, and paper tombs function as micro-setting: the strip warms under touch, constraining her to keep witnessing; the letters’ physical weight anchors the conceptual archive she projects onto the walls. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven—gears taste of rust, dust-motes carry tunes. The “hushed thunder” tone is evoked through acoustic detail (quiet that vibrates) rather than label. One tiny gap: no olfactory or temperature shift at the climax to mark the surge of acceptance.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—locate the storage of unused love—is signaled in line 3. Escalation is accretive: each new letter-frame densifies the cost of bearing witness. The decisive tightening occurs when she realizes the repository is the silence itself, foreclosing further search. Price is felt (pulse of warmth in film, thunder in chest), but external stakes remain internal; no lived consequence beyond her new “steady rhythm.”</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: unused love is not lost but resident in the interstice between memory and oblivion—an idea reweighted by the final image of the palace bricks “storied in every brick.” Subtext operates in gesture (winding the film back is a quiet act of re-interment). No moralizing; the “home” she gives the letters is a resonance, not a solution. Bittersweet aria risks echoing stock sentiment, yet the specificity of “spatially imaginative archive” keeps it fresh.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person omniscient is stabilized through Elara’s perceptual signature—every noun is filtered via her spatial imagination (“gears like a clockwork city,” “paper tombs”). Rhythm modulates with pressure: long clauses for incubation, staccato repetitions of “hushed thunder” for heartbeat. No dialogue, so no register clash. One micro-drift: “conceptual archive” edges toward academic diction, but the phrase is earned by prior spatial metaphors.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is taut; most sentences carry double duty—description + metaphysical tilt. Figurative density is high but patterned (clockwork, archive, thunder) and paid off at closure. No synonym loops; scaffolding excised. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with the mournful waltz cadence. A single mixed metaphor—“silence charged with echoes”—is permissible under accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses psychometry with cinematic archaeology to ask a fresh question: where does affection go when it is not delivered? The spatial archive is a memorable conceit that could not be transplanted to another character. Risky lyric repetition of “hushed thunder” succeeds because it accumulates from whisper to heartbeat. Near-echo of “bittersweet aria” is the only familiar chord, preventing 9.5.</comment>
