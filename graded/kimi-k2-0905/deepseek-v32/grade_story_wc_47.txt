<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Interiority is lyrical but leans therapeutic (“preserved hope”) rather than embodied contradiction; the pendant hand-off is a visible micro-choice yet feels symbolically preordained, muting cost. No secondary character pressure on-page until journalist arrives late; status shift is gentle, not crucible-level. Meets baseline for quiet endurance, but lacks a moment where flaws actively complicate the outcome.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: thaw-pattern imagery layers meaning until pendant transfer crystallizes the reweighting. Closure is Earned Stasis—she relinquishes the relic yet keeps the garden—cost is felt in the empty chain link. One scaffold loop: “graft new meaning onto old wounds” is slogan-repeated. Otherwise causality intact; orientation anchored by line 4.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Data-moss fusion is vivid, selective, lived-in; cables-as-aqueducts constrains her watering ritual. Micro-setting (pendant) charges final image. Sensory economy strong except for one overripe cluster “honeyed hush…sweetness trapped in time” mid-climax. Environment shapes pace and healing tactics; spatial choreography clean.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—transform viral shame into living memorial—signals early. Escalation is accretive: icicle sigil reappears, deepening rather than narrowing options. No tangible resource lost or foreclosed path; journalist visit softens rather than tests resolve. Cost is tonal, not tactical; pressure plateaus instead of tightening.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of transmuting grief via patina and pattern emerges organically; final image reframes amber from coffin to seed. Avoids overt thesis until near-final “every wound could be grafted…”—a mild echo penalty. Subtext of shared silence between women lands through gesture, not exposition. Complexity acknowledged yet closure drifts toward consolation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Elara’s perceptual filter; synesthetic attention to drip, light, resin feels character-specific. Rhythm modulates—long sentence for garden hush, clipped clauses at pendant release. No dialogue until tea scene; journalist diction slightly flatter but brief. No head-hop or register drift; compression taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Strong read-aloud cadence; sentences vary in length and launch vector. Two paraphrase loops (“graft new meaning…”) and one “honeyed hush” over-recurrence slightly dull momentum. Metaphors mostly coherent; “fossilized bee” strand stays consistent. Info-dense with sensory layering; no scaffolding obscures causal drip.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Viral confession→moss sanctuary premise is fresh; eco-repurposing of data center offers visual hook. Spiral symbol resurrection risks familiar trope but is grounded in sister memory. Risk lies in quiet resolution; still, rewilding grief through icicle calligraphy feels specific to this narrator. Could swap pendant for any keepsake, blunting irreplaceability.</comment>
