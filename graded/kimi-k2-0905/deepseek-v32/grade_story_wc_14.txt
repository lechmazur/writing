<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara’s “earnestly studious” trait is repeatedly shown through tactile ritual (fresh page, worn cover, pen strokes). Interiority is concrete but stays single-frequency; the only micro-choice is to switch on the lamp and later close the book—no visible trade-off or cost under pressure. The ending’s Charged Poise is earned by cumulative pattern, not by a new, costly decision on this night, so the arc trends toward steady-state rather than turning-state.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure is a textbook Accumulative CR: dawn’s hum fades, refraction ceases, and “town began to stir” reweights invented histories from private dream to fragile public memory. Causality is pattern-based, not beat-by-beat; every paragraph deepens density until the cadence shift at “lamp’s hum faded” crystallizes cost. One transition (descent) is legible; orientation is clean by word 50. No meaningful tightening inside the single ritual, yet the lens holds and the final image levies conceptual cost: she can harvest but never fully possess time.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Micro-setting rules: the fluorescent lamp’s humming filament and the bonsai’s “gnarled trunks” are tactile tools that gate entry to temporal refraction. Sensory choice is POV-filtered (silent town, spice scent) and mirrors internal compression. Spatial choreography is stable; no distance shifts between Elara, lamp, and single bench. The lamp’s final dimming directly charges the resonant image, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—capture another layer of temporal texture—is signaled early. Escalation is textural: each sketched sensation layers density until the dawn break severs access, tightening stakes without a second reversal. Cost is conceptual (another dawn lost, histories remain partial), visible in the fading hum. Agency is limited to disciplined attention; a higher score awaits a mid-ritual complication that actively thwarts or endangers her harvest.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges as the impossibility of complete historical possession; invented histories are empathetic reconstructions, not archives. Subtext lives in the lamp’s mechanical drone replacing human voices from the silent town. Final image of Elara descending while “town below began to stir” reweights prior layers from private salvation to communal forgetting—no moral spelled. The single frequency of metaphor (light/time) coheres without drift.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays tight to Elara’s perceptual filter: “she believed,” “she listened,” “she smiled.” Syntax lengthens under calm, shortens at hum-peak, mirroring breath. No dialogue, so no voice clash. Diction favors precise verbs—“charting,” “refract,” “yielded”—without thesaurus drift. Incantatory repetition (“refract,” “textures,” “hum”) is pattern-taught early and paid off in the final hush, earning the high band.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sentences carry double duty (action + texture) with near-zero scaffolding. Metaphors are spare and consistent (light = time). One paraphrase loop—“silence of centuries” / “silence of the town”—is adjacent but serves as intentional mirror, not artifact. Figurative language halts at peak beat (hum fades), letting concrete image land. No grammar slips; pronoun/tense clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Combines stationer craft with speculative dendrochronurgy—fresh synthesis. The fluorescent lamp as time-prism converts mundane hardware into occult instrument: high risk, clear payoff. Concept commits fully; no late retreat to metaphor. Invented histories sidesteps clichéd “memory tree” trope by emphasizing empathic fabrication rather than retrieval, making the angle non-obvious and thematically charged.</comment>
