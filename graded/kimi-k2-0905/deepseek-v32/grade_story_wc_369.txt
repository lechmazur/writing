<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Silas’s quiet obsession is concrete—moonlight soothes his scar, the broken sextant is handled with practiced ritual—so motive stays embodied. The final “simply stood, sharing the witness” is a credibly passive but earned renunciation for this length, and the fading dial shows cost. Interior contradiction is thin: we’re told he seeks “what trees witness” but never feel him wrestle with doubt or competing desire, so the arc is gentle, not crucible-tight.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the dial drops to zero, sorrow re-weighted into shared witness, cost legible in the hush. Causal linkage is loose—why a dropped pin triggers alignment is more poetic than motivated—but the lyric lens is taught early and held. Orientation is immaculate within 50 words; transitions are single-scene. One causal gap prevents a 9: the sextant’s numerical sorrow never logically foreshadows that sound is the missing key, so the turn feels conjured rather than fore-planted.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Tower, storm-moon, yew, and broken brass saturate every beat; the sextant functions as micro-setting that constrains action (pointing down, clicking gears). Selective sensory hierarchy—cool tingle of moonlight on scar, metallic ping carving silence—keeps atmosphere tense and immersive. Space is coherent; no drifting rooms. The yew root-zone becomes the final charged image, meeting the 9+ gate, but the labyrinth’s physical layout stays slightly schematic, capping at 8.5.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—release quantified sorrow—is signaled in first third and tightened once when the pin’s ping spikes the dial, foreclosing the “map-only” path. Escalation is lyric-accumulative rather than causal-combative; pressure grows through image density, not reversals. Cost is present (his earlier mapping efforts rendered insufficient) yet mild—no tangible loss beyond the abstract zeroing of sorrow—so the beat falls short of the sharper price required for 8.8+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: bearing witness is the only absolution for historic pain. Subtext lives in gesture—hand on bark, dial fading—never sermon. Trees as neutral archivists reweights the labyrinth from trap to memory-chamber, a resonant conceptual re-pricing. Final image avoids tidy moral; ambiguity lingers in the hush after zero, inviting reflection without statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person lens stays tight to Silas’s perceptual filter—moonlight as salve, brass weight familiar, sorrow as mist with numbers. Syntax is calm, slightly archaic, matching the hush of nocturnal maintenance. No dialogue, so no contamination. One lyrical elision—“vision unfolded, not in images, but in knowing”—is taught by the prior sextant反常 usage and paid off in closure, keeping distance controlled. Voice is distinct, internally coherent, and rhythmically steady under pressure.</comment>

<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, high-density: “trimming wayward branches and clearing the moss-clogged drains” packs vocation, texture, stakes in one stroke. No loops, no filler filters, no mixed metaphors. Figurative language is spare—silver flash, pearlescent light—each image advances mood or stakes. Opening and closing lines book-end with mirrored hush, earning resonance.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Sextant repurposed to measure sorrow down-angle is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis; tool logic stays internally consistent. Mundane miracle tone rescues the premise from preciousness by grounding every enchantment in tactile labor—scar healing, gear clicks, pin drop. Concept of quantified grief is philosophical yet dramatized through physical process. Risk is moderate but successful; without this exact frame the piece collapses, so originality feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
