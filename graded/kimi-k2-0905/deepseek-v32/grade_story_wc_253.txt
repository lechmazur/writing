<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete—narrating mundane acts to sculpt meaning from numbness—and the micro-choice to set bird among dried flowers crystallizes a private morality. No contradictory impulse is dramatized in-scene, so the “ambiguous kindness” never risks real transgression; cost is atmospheric, not viscerally paid. Still, the embodied ritual of whittling and tight first-person filter keep Leo singular and grounded. Meets 9- gate on voice specificity but lacks the final knife-edge of irreversible self-cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: wooden bird nested in dead bouquet re-weights the premise—grief archived, happiness refused—under Accumulative lens. Cause/effect runs on ritual accretion; the turbine shadows ticking across the room tighten cadence without forced reversals. Orientation locked by word 50; no prop drift. Felt cost is the ongoing theft of grid-energy for private stasis, legible in final “theft of energy” line. Tiny slip: blade never risks skin, so physical price stays off-stage.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Farmhouse, turbine penumbra, and whittling shavings form a micro-setting that physically constrains action—every sweep of shadow marks time and enforces silence. Sensory hierarchy favors touch and hearing ( suppressed whoosh, pine curl ) over visual clutter, filtering through Leo’s tactile grief. Dried bouquet is handled repeatedly, its crumble anchoring memory. Environment never over-described; each detail either paces ritual or recharges final image. Meets 9- gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—permission to feel non-joy—tightens via accumulating ritual beats; no external antagonist needed. Turbine shadows provide cadenced pressure equivalent to ticking clock; each pass narrows temporal space for mandated brightness. Whittling produces tangible cost in shavings, but societal penalty stays abstract (no knock on door). Escalation is incremental, not a sharp reversal; sufficient for 600-word Accumulative arc yet just shy of visceral option-foreclosure required for 8.8+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of illegitimate grief emerges through image pattern—preserved flowers, carved bird, narrated water—never named as thesis. Final tableau reframes silence not as lack but as resistance, re-pricing mandated happiness without moralizing. Ambiguity survives: reader cannot tell if Leo’s practice is futile or sacred. Resonance lingers in “breath held,” a conceptual after-image that outlives plot.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited clings to Leo’s perceptual grid: syntax is calm, slightly elevated mimicry of his theatrical narration, breaking into imagistic shards under turbine shadow. No head-hop; psychic distance fixed. Register stays within plausible self-talk of a retired performance artist. Rhythm modulates—long sentences for washing, clipped fragments for blade-work—mirroring attention. Distinctive, controlled, and paid off in final cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, lyrical, artifact-free; no synonym loops or scaffold. Metaphors (“liquid diamonds,” “porcelain altar”) risk purple but are justified as Leo’s conscious performance idiom. Information density high—each sentence layers gesture, object, emotional null. One mixed image: “suppressed thoughts” for turbine hush is vague amid otherwise precise audioscape. Closure line is clean, resonant.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>“Happiness mandate” dystopia is familiar terrain, yet focus on acoustic suppression and private liturgical whittling feels fresh. Ritual narration of dish-washing elevates mundane into resistance art, a specific twist not templated. Core emotional driver—illegal grief curated in miniature—is non-obvious and sustained. Could edge higher with one unpredictable material risk (e.g., blade slip) to prove rule-breaking beyond mood.</comment>
