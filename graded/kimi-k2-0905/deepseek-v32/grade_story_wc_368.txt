<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Juro’s interiority is rich, embodied, and idiosyncratic—dye-master attention, transplant heartbeat, quiet explosive thump—each micro-choice (tilting the wing, pocketing it) grows from contradictory impulses of scientific detachment and indebted wonder. The arc’s renunciation—accepting responsibility for another’s story—pays visible cost as he commits to the dawn descent. Only the donor-heart “memory” edges convenient; still, the beat lands as earned stasis. Voice stays singular, never drifts into label-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the wing-sun-map fusion crystallizes Charged Poise (he must now act) with felt cost—lifetime guardianship of a stranger’s tale. Causal linkage holds: wing → reflection → revealed stones → decision. Accumulative lens taught by sun-drops and light trails tightens stakes without coincidence. One scaffold—“He did not know what fragment…”—is trimmable but does not blunt the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The floating tea-house is sketched via tactile micro-details—lacquered table, lattice light, mist below—each filtering through Juro’s color-obsessed eye and constraining his tracking method. Spatial choreography is clean: table → floor → window → valley rock. The morpho wing functions as micro-setting that literally re-projects the environment. Weather and altitude affect visibility, guiding the final reveal.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Central stake: will he answer the wing’s命令 to “Look” and shoulder another soul’s story? Pressure escalates through each light-tracking beat; options narrow when reflection brands the wall-map, foreclosing passive curiosity. Cost is legible—lifelong obligation accepted at dawn. No coincidence resolves; sun angle is environmental constant, not rabbit-from-hat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: attention itself is ethical dye-work—catching transitory light/truth at the necessary angle. Iridescent caution reweights from mere beauty to covenant. Final image of glowing mist reframes earlier sun-drops as communal sacrament. No moralizing; resonance lingers in pocketed wing and steadying heart.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice stays precise, lyrical yet restrained—syntax mirrors dye-master patience (“read time not by the clock but by the light’s path”). Perceptual signature is consistent: color, scale, micro-refraction. No dialogue to corrupt register. Psychic distance tightens under the wing’s flare without uncontrolled fragments.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet breathable; sentences vary in length and opening. Mixed metaphors avoided—vehicles of dye, light, and heartbeat stay coherent. Only minor scaffold: “quiet hours tracking sun trails” could compress. Otherwise zero loops, no filter-verb stacks, strong verbs anchor every beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Premise—transplanted heart guiding recipient to complete stranger’s story via butterfly-wing heliograph—is non-obvious and fully committed. Sun-trail cartography feels fresh, specific to Juro’s profession. Risk of sentimental “organ memory” is acknowledged and grounded in optical physics. Could not swap wing for feather or rock without breaking the light-map closure.</comment>
