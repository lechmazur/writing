<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—clinging to memory while destroying its image—plays out in embodied, tactile beats (porcelain edges, aching fingers). The renunciation of the finished portrait is earned by the prior ritual buildup, and the cost is felt as “bittersweet.” No secondary character means relationship/status bullets are NA; all pressure is internal and coherent. Micro-choices (lifting, dusting, scattering) reveal a clear value hierarchy: ephemeral truth over permanence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the ash remains only “for a while,” foreclosing permanence with visible cost. Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout—each stroke adds density until the powdering reverses it. Orientation is immediate (gallery, night, rocking chair by line 2). No causality breaks; the ritual logic is internally consistent and pays off in the final image of “gray snow” around the chair.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The vanishing-point gallery is more than postcard: its converging lines literally reshape when the mask is worn, constraining Elara’s perception and guiding the ritual. Micro-setting (porcelain shards, ceramic bowl, ash grains) is handled repeatedly and charges the final scatter. Spatial choreography is clean—every object’s position is tracked across beats. Environment mirrors internal state without overt symbolism: the “distant nothingness” externalizes her memory gaps.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—crystallize loss before it evaporates—is signaled in paragraph 4. One meaningful tightening: the moment charcoal loosens into ash, permanence is irrevocably traded for fleeting presence; options narrow to “temporary crystallization.” Cost is legible: the portrait she aches to keep becomes dust she must sweep away. Escalation is textural rather than causal, fitting the lens; intensity rises via sensory density, not external opposition.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme—art’s beautiful futility against forgetting—emerges through the ash scatter, never stated. The mirage of safety reweights at closure: the gallery’s illusion of order is exposed yet still craved. Subtext in the fractured mask: reassembled fragments can’t restore the whole. Final image of “gray snow” offers non-literal resonance without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays glued to Elara; no head-hop. Perceptual signature is painterly—lines converge, charcoal “weaves,” ash “carries.” Rhythm swells and thins with ritual pace; longer sentences during drawing compress to fragments at powdering. No dialogue, so dialogue bullets NA. Phrase choice (“somber marvel,” “gray snow”) remains within Elara’s artistic lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or ritual step. Figurative language is sparse and pattern-taught (“mirage of safety,” “gray snow”), paid off at closure. Strong verbs—presses, loosens, scatters—replace modifiers. No mixed metaphors or register drift; prose breathes with ritual tempo without monotony.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Ritual ash-scattering of a self-drawn portrait is a fresh angle on grief; shattered-porcelain mask adds haptic risk. None of the core elements could swap out without breaking the mechanism. Conceptual commitment is total—no retreat into safer metaphor. Risk heightens meaning: destruction is the only preservation.</comment>
