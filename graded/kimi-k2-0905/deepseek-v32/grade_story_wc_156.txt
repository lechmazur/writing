<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—expert technique vs. willing surrender of certainty—is shown through micro-choices (angling the coin, slotting it into the “flaw”). The final renunciation costs her professional identity and is earned by the sonic trials; no diagnostic label-speak. The “methodically playful” trait is more stated than embodied in gesture, keeping her just shy of 9.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: inserting the coin rewrites the mural’s motion and her vocation, cost paid in the surrender of expertise. Causal chain (coin reflection → pigment resonance → myth recovery → slot) holds without teleport. Orientation is anchored by word 50; no penalty. One minor scaffold: “nested awakenings” is named twice, not shown as pattern first, but this is routed to Q5, not a causality break.</comment>

<comment>Sound Wave Garden is not backdrop; its copper lily and wind-chimes supply the exact harmonics that decode pigment, constraining her tactical angle choices. The mural’s azure shard and moon indentation are micro-settings that charge the final image. Sensory hierarchy favors auditory over visual, matching restorer’s shifted attention. Spatial track stays clean as she moves from table to wall to slot.</comment>

<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—curiosity vs. certainty—tightens when each reflected chord forces her to abandon a restoration rule; final slotting forecloses expert detachment. Escalation is Accumulative: each new harmonic layer increases density and reweights the personal cost. No external antagonist needed; pressure is epistemic. Price is visible: she permanently trades technical mastery for Listening, shown on page.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the concrete arc: the pause between sounds births meaning. The moon-face coin shifts from quaint artifact to sonic lens, recharging the mural’s central moon as symbol of productive silence. No overt thesis statement; final image of evolving constellations offers non-literal answer. Minor echo of “nested awakenings” as label keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays close to Elara’s perceptual filter—she hears through bones, sees ripples in air. Syntax mirrors her methodical-playful rhythm: long sensory sentences interrupted by clipped discoveries (“It was a hobo nickel.”). No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens under sonic pressure. Distinct diction avoids generic restoration jargon.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentences open with motion, sound, or object to propel. High density: one sentence often paints, motivates, and signals acoustic effect. No loops or mixed metaphors; “shimmering pattern” and “cascading tone” stay consistent with light-sound motif. One filter-verb cluster (“she realized, she understood”) in climax deducts 0.3, preventing 9+.</comment>

<grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fusion of acoustic garden, sonic-coin decryption, and pigment-encoded myth feels specific and non-obvious. The hobo nickel—folk-altered currency—becomes a sonic lens: fresh functional twist. Risk in letting climax hinge on “quiet between sounds” pays off via charged poise. Could not swap coin or garden without collapsing plot logic.</comment>
