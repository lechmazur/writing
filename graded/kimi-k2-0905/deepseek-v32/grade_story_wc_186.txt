<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elias’s motivation—proving coincidences hold meaning—drives every micro-choice; the prism-touch vision and grandfather’s constellation command tighten his goal under pressure. His interiority is embodied (“thistle-blown hope,” fingers on cold glass) without therapy-speak, and the final alignment is an earned renunciation of the old beacon’s purpose, costing him the familiar silence. No contradictory impulses are shown in-scene; adding one would push to 9+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens: grandfather’s dying pointer → years of star charts → tonight’s perfect alignment → fracture-as-lock → new, quieter beam. Closure is a decisive conceptual re-pricing: the beacon no longer summons ships but asserts meaning from fragments; cost is the surrender of nostalgic rescue fantasy, visible in the shift from “guide-light” to “steady, quiet pulse.” One continuous scene, orientation locked by word 50; no ambiguity or teleporting props.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The glass humming pavilion, overgrown metal ruins, and cold prism are filtered through Elias’s custodian eye; sensory hierarchy privileges touch and sound (hum in bones) over visual catalog. The prism’s fracture evolves from “useless beauty” to active lock, constraining the final alignment that redefines the beacon’s function—qualifying for 9+ gate. Spatial choreography holds as Elias realigns the apparatus atop the pavilion; no floating rooms.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prove meaning in coincidences—tightens when the star path literally materializes through the fracture, forcing a final realignment that forecloses the old beacon’s purpose. Escalation is causal under the lens: each charting session narrows tonight as the last viable alignment; pressure peaks when silence-shard converts to navigable star-path. Cost is legible: the beam’s new quiet purpose abandons rescue, accepting post-world solitude.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from action: fragments (prism, memory, constellation) assembled into deliberate pattern reframes cosmic noise as intent. Subtext lives in the prism’s fracture—physical proof that breaks can conduct new light. Final image reweights “thistle-blown hope” into solid beam without moralizing. No thematic echo; meaning stays non-literal and charged with cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Elias’s perceptual signature—star diagrams feel like “searching for a single thread,” silence reads “solid.” Syntax lengthens under wonder, shortens under tactile precision, supporting emotional contour. No dialogue present; narrative voice sustains lyrical compression without purple drift. Psychic distance stable; register never exceeds custodian lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening structure; high information density (“broken crystal prism, fractured along a hairline seam that glimmered faintly”) advances scene and atmosphere simultaneously. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors; figurative language is sparse, purposeful. Final paragraph cadence slows to match the “steady, quiet pulse,” mirroring thematic acceptance. Copy-clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Post-collapse star-custodian trope is refreshed through retrocognition redefined as frozen-time instruction, turning silence into a key. The prism-fracture-as-lock and star-path-as-code feel inevitable yet non-obvious. Risk in quiet, non-rescue beam pays off by reconfiguring hope itself. Specificity of “glass humming pavilion” anchors the concept, preventing generic ruins.</comment>
