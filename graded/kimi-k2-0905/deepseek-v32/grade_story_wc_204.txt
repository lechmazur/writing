<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Aeliana’s obsessive drive to bottle eternity is cleanly dramatized through tactile micro-choices—frost-tracing, gear-tuning, vial-opening—yet her interior contradictions (precision vs. surrender to chaos) stay stated rather than embodied in simultaneous tension. The final smile feels lightly earned because the cost (ruptured library, spent whisper) is external; we don’t sense an internal ridge she will now walk differently.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: frost vortex → uncork whisper → press misalignment → rupture → compression → shelf glow. Closure is a crisp Charged Poise: eternity sits gleaming, the library resettles, Aeliana’s next dawn pattern now foreclosed by her own artifact. Persistent constraint—the spent vial and the new glass sheet—are on-page, satisfying cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Glass orchard/cloud-sea is immediate, selective, and filters through Aeliana’s curator gaze; shelves shudder, pages rustle, frost patterns guide hands. The micro-setting (letterpress plate, bottled mist) literally constrains the decisive rupture, meeting the 9+ gate. Only the cloud-sea itself stays scenic postcard, not threading into tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Single stake—compress eternity—tightens once: perfect system must be broken, then rebuilt. Destabilizing the press is the visible price that forecloses flawless repetition; the rupture’s risk is felt in shuddering shelves and shimmering books. No false escalation; coincidence is absent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges as “perfection must fracture to hold the infinite.” Frost, whisper, and rupture keep reweighting that idea without moralizing. Final image of the glowing sheet on the shelf reconfigures the library’s former sterility into fragile, living archive—resonant, non-didactic.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person hover stays tight to Aeliana’s sensorium: cold glass, silver mist drawn into gears, heart racing. Syntax lengthens during contemplation, then clips—“She uncorked”—under stress. No head-hop; perceptual signature (frost as text, machinery as organ) remains distinctive.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is lyric yet propulsive; figurative layering (“sound like cracking ice,” “swirling sea of clouds”) is sparse enough to avoid density penalty. One scaffold loop: “whisper destabilized the system… the necessary rupture, the break from precision” restates the same idea in adjacent clauses. Otherwise clean rhythm, varied sentence openings, zero filter-verb stacks.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Conceptual fusion—library as glass orchard, letterpress as cosmic engine—feels fresh yet inevitable. Frost-as-code and bottled sigh invert standard “magic book” tropes into materialized ephemera. Risk in letting the rupture resolve to quiet shelf glow pays off; no derivative aftertaste.</comment>
