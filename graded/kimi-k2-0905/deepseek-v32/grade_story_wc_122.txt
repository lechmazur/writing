<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—grief-stricken yet seeking silence—surfaces in the first beat and is embodied through tactile contact with the phonograph horn; the thaw is credibly traced to that filament of hush she literally feels. Cost is visible in the tears that arrive only after vibration has loosened the knots, but the prose sometimes drifts into lyrical paraphrase (“falling upward into peace”) that blurs the exact micro-choice being made. Still, the renunciation of noise is earned and irreversible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The piece teaches its accumulative/textural lens early—vibration as topography—and lands a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the internal silence is now “a silent song that would never break,” reweighting the premise with felt cost (tears). Orientation is anchored by ~120 words; no causality breaks. One minor slack: the cavern’s “mirrored hush” is stated more than demonstrated, but this does not touch the closure image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The cavern’s damp stone and skittering leaves function as micro-setting that doubles the hush; the modified phonograph acts as tool-as-setting that literally constrains the final choice. Sensory selection favors touch over sound, consistent with POV. A hairline slip: “season’s rustle” is repeated almost verbatim in opening and closing, reducing freshness, but the object-states (needle, horn) track cleanly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—defeat emotional numbness—is signaled inside 50 words. The backward song provides one meaningful tightening: the filament of hush she detects narrows her options to “keep feeling or retreat,” and she pays with the first tears in years. Pressure is textural rather than causal, fitting the inferred lens; cost is legible on the page. No reversals needed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through tactile inversion: silence becomes the audible event. Subtext resides in the silver-repaired needle—grief fused into instrument. Final image of leaves as “vivid texture on her skin” reweights the opening premise without moralizing. No thematic echo or pat summary; ambiguity lingers about what future feeling will cost her.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person POV stays tight to Elara’s tactile perception; no head-hopping. Diction favors haptic verbs—“threading,” “winding,” “tracing”—that mirror her deaf sensorium. Rhythm swells intentionally during the phonograph spin, then thins at the tear release. One tiny filter-verb cluster (“she realized,” “she felt”) could be trimmed, but voice remains distinctive under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is lyrical yet propulsive; only two adjacent paraphrase loops (“mirrored hush…doubling back”) and one mixed metaphor (“topography of tremors”) slightly dull the peak beat. Otherwise sentences vary in length, openers differ, and information density stays high. No scaffold sentences or overwritten figurative strings obstruct the closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Core premise—deaf musician seeking silence through reversed sound—feels inevitable yet non-obvious. The broken phonograph needle repurposed as emotional suture is fresh and specific. Risk in the lyric accumulative structure pays off: the filament of hush functions as both concept and tangible sensation. Could not swap deafness or reversed playback without collapsing the arc.</comment>
