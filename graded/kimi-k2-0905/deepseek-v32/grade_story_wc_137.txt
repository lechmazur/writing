<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Elara’s skeptical intellect and latent yearning are concrete from the first sentence; her shift from detached observer to vulnerable listener is embodied in the micro-choice to press the warm tile to her heart at the end, a gesture that costs her the safety of distance. The double-exposed memory is credibly framed as blood-deep rather than convenient revelation, so the interior contradiction feels earned. No secondary character shares the stage, so relationship/status bullets are N/A; headcount stays within default. The only minor friction is a trace of diagnostic self-awareness—“the skeptic’s mind fractured”—but it is immediately grounded in physical collapse and the warming tile, so the slip stays beneath the −0.4 penalty line.</comment>

<comment>The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: each transcription session thickens the pattern until the lattice reweights reality. Orientation is clean—who/where/when fixed by line 3; no penalty. The closure is a Charged Poise: the silent thread cast from the parapet crystallizes a new stance with undeniable cost—she must now live inside the symphony she once dismissed. The persistent constraint is legible in the final image: the tower remains, but its stone is now porous to whale song, so her reflection space is permanently charged with listening duty.</comment>

<comment>The tower functions as micro-setting: its open parapet enables the physical act of casting the silent thread into the sea wind, and the dissolving walls literalize the boundary loss at climax. Lavender jade tile constrains every beat—cool at start, warm at payoff—its temperature shift charging the final image. Whale migration timeline is tracked nightly, giving a live clock that tightens the final pause. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: astronomer’s daughter notices starfield first, salt second, whale-song last, mirroring her shifting attention. No environmental detail exceeds the scene’s need; every noun is tactile and lived-in.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—proving the patterns mundane—flips to proving they are alive; the single meaningful tightening occurs when the first transcription dissolves the tower walls, foreclosing detached analysis. Cost is visible: she forfeits cognitive safety, ending on her knees gasping, then standing in permanent exposure to an auditory world she cannot mute. Agency is accumulative rather than causal: each nightly dive deepens the pattern until renunciation of skepticism is the only remaining stance. The whale’s reply is not rescue but recognition, so coincidence complicates rather than resolves, satisfying the lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the tile’s temperature shift and the whales’ returning call: kindness is not heroic anomaly but circulatory memory. Subtext lives in gesture—pressing the tile to the heart replaces articulate confession. The final image reweights the premise without moralizing: the unheard symphony is now a lived obligation, not a metaphor. Complexity is preserved—human blindness is apologized for yet remains part of the pattern, refusing tidy redemption.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is stargazer-precise: “starfield,” “salt wind,” “dark shapes like continents adrift” reflect Elara’s inherited sky-vocabulary. Compression is taught early—“the world softened; the tower walls seemed to dissolve”—and paid off in the final porous parapet. No head-hopping; perceptual signature stays strictly bounded to Elara’s body and blood-memory. Rhythm modulates: longer cadence for whale-time, clipped fragments for collapse, steadying to declarative for the final thread-cast.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence advances pattern, stakes, or atmosphere. Figurative language is sparse and physics-true—“dark shapes passing like continents adrift”—no mixed metaphors. Information density is high: one sentence slips grandmother, tower, whale, net, song into a single breath. The warming tile is a textural refrain that avoids repetition fatigue by shifting sensory modality each beat. No line-level artifact touches the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The whale-migration / memory-lattice synthesis feels inevitable yet non-obvious; removal of any particular collapses the concept. Risk is taken in the double-exposure vision, but grounding in bodily temperature and salt wind keeps it from abstraction. The “unheard symphony” frame could have slid into eco-sentimentality; instead it is earned through reciprocal memory with visible cost. Fresh inflection: kindness as circulatory data, not charity, reframes altruism as interspecies circuitry.</comment>
