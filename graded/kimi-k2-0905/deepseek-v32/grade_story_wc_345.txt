<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The collective “we” flattens individuated interiority; only Mara’s single touch of the bell breaks the surface. The ghost’s altruism is asserted, never tested or contradicted, so motivation stays external. The arc from dependency to self-trust is declared, not dramatized through micro-choices that cost anything on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the ghost’s final message reframes the entire dependency pattern into self-governance with conceptual cost—“You are the gardeners now.” Causality under the Accumulative lens holds: each chalk instruction accretes until the community’s collective labor reconfigures meaning. The shift from external to internal guidance is legible, but the absence of a visible price paid by any individual keeps the beat short of 9-band punch.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The floating rock arches move from picturesque backdrop to gateway constraint once the nebula alignment is discovered; environment actively reweights stakes. The watering bell’s bronze wings and soil-conducted tone provide tactile micro-setting that charges the culminating ring. Selective sensory hierarchy—color of butterflies, rust on bell—filters through communal attention rather than tourist catalog.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—earn respite by healing the land—is signaled early and tightens when the bell’s tone is revealed as the arches’ sustaining force. Escalation is accumulative: each dusk ringing deepens communal investment; the fading messages sharpen the final choice to keep gardening without external prompts. Cost is collective, not individuated, so pressure feels diffuse yet coherent under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the shift from ghost-written instructions to self-authored sidewalk messages: stewardship must internalize altruism. The nebula’s promise stays ambiguous—haven or hologram—letting resonance outrun literal moral. Final image of new strangers reading human chalk reconfigures earlier ghostly guidance into generational cycle without sermon.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>First-person plural voice sustains coherent collective interiority without head-hop leakage. Syntax tilts toward liturgical cadence—“we obeyed,” “we worked”—that suits communal hymn. Occasional elevated phrasing (“tapestry of gnarled fruit trees”) drifts from pragmatic farmer lexicon but remains within mythic register the piece teaches early.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is clean, varied, and propulsive; no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is selective—“butterflies…like living threads”—and avoids density clutter. One mixed metaphor (“hope here was brambled, tangled with thorns”) momentarily overlays botanical and textile domains, but clarity recovers before closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The ghost-as-training-wheels premise freshens standard “mysterious helper” trope by making disappearance the pedagogical point. Floating orchard planet combines familiar agrarian and alien imagery into memorable bioluminescent gateway. Risk is moderate—quiet lyric communal voice over singular heroics—but execution feels inevitable rather than gimmicky.</comment>
