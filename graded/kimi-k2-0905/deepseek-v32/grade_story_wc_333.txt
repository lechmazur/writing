<comment>The locksmith’s contradictory impulses—yearning for the impossible while maintaining plain composure—are dramatized in the micro-choice to release the ribbon; the ache of fulfillment in the final line makes the cost legible. Interiority stays concrete (“improbable longing ached in his chest”) and avoids label-speak. The only bar to 9+ is that the philosopher remains off-stage, so the relationship crucible bullet is moot and the interior conflict is solo; still, the earned renunciation qualifies for the quick test.</comment>

<comment>Causal lens: Vega’s hint → untie ribbon → fear fragments → release ribbon → silence/idea freed; each because/therefore link tightens options until the final surrender. Closure is a Decisive Change with felt cost: the ribbon’s flight visibly forecloses the locksmith’s tether to the past. Orientation is clear by line 5; no teleporting props. Persistent constraint—the absence of the ribbon—shapes the final image and qualifies for 9+.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The shadowed nexus, flat stone, and starlight constrain choreography: the stone anchors the ritual, the dark provides cover, the widening sky times the hint. Sensory selection skews visual, but the humming pulse and cool air embody the fear-presence. The lock of hair functions as micro-setting that charges the final image when it glows then is relinquished. Slight over-reliance on sky imagery keeps it from 8.8.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—liberate the unity-idea—is signaled in paragraph 2 and escalates when fear manifests as screaming wind. The micro-turn: instead of tightening grip, the locksmith lets go, narrowing his option set to zero physical tether. Cost is the surrendered ribbon and the “ache” of fulfillment. One meaningful tightening suffices; no reversal is required under causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of unity emerges through action: spoken secrets (“We are all echoes of the same sound”) dismantle fear. The final image—idea merging with starlight—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext resides in the ribbon’s release as acceptance of impermanence. No late thematic echo or platitude intrudes.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person omniscient remains stable, focalized through the locksmith; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is cosmic-philosophic (“universe holding its breath”) yet calibrated to a plain man who notices starlight and worn clothes. Rhythm modulates: longer incantatory sentences build ritual intensity, then short clauses at release. Distinct texture qualifies for 9- gate; minor over-repetition of “shadow” and “starlight” nudges down.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty (action + atmosphere), vary in length, and read aloud cleanly. No filter-verb clusters or mixed metaphors. One paraphrase loop—“shadowed nexus was just a place again, paths under stars, quiet and empty”—is purposeful cadence echo and waived. Artifacts do not touch closure; density remains high.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The cosmic-locksmith conceit is familiar, yet the specifics—Vega’s cryptic hint, ribbon as memory-key, fear as wind—synthesize into an inevitable logic. Risky surrender of the talisman rather than wielding it feels fresh and grows from established pattern. Transformation test fails if names change, confirming specificity. Bold letting-go move earns the +0.2 risk bonus.</comment>
