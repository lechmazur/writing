<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied (“she brushed away leaf litter to find not soil, but a porous crust of ancient bone”). Contradictory impulses—repulsion vs. reverence—coexist in scene, powering the micro-choice to clear channels rather than re-bury. The final renunciation (leaving, lighter) carries visible cost: she forfeits permanent rootedness, earning stasis. Missing the 9-band only because the elder’s single line of dialogue is too thin to test voice distinction or status shift.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: “Her return was complete not because she stayed, but because she saw the connection.” The image reweights diaspora flight from betrayal to intentional seeding with undeniable conceptual cost. Accumulative lens holds: pattern of bone→root→fruit tightens stakes through density, not causality. Orientation anchors by line 4; no teleporting props; one legible time-lapse transition across days of excavation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Catacomb orchard is irreplacable micro-setting: rib-cage-cradled sapling literally constrains her rebuild tactics—she must work around roots, not bones. Sensory hierarchy obeys POV urgency, narrowing from dappled light to tactile finger-bone beads. The rebuilt sundial’s noon shadow pointing “to the valley below” charges the final image, fusing environment, tool, and body. No spatial drift; weather and scale track across the single contiguous scene.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore lost faith—tightens when excavation reveals the orchard as intentional seeding, foreclosing nostalgia and forcing active rebuild. One meaningful deepening suffices: clearing root-channels instead of reassembling bones narrows options and manifests cost (days of kneeling, forfeited ease). Accumulative lens: density of bone-fruit imagery escalates stakes without causal reversals. Price is visible in bodily fatigue and the relinquishment of permanent return.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulates: diaspora as cyclical seeding, not exile. Final image of “returned seed, momentarily resting” reweights ancestral flight without moralizing. Interrupted journeys motif accumulates through bone, family, and her own departure, crystallizing in the charged poise of leaving again. No thesis statements; resonance is non-literal and durable.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited sustains a perceptual signature attuned to geological and vegetal timescales—“time measured…by the slow embrace of roots.” Syntax lengthens and breathes under calm pressure, then compresses at the zenith moment. No head-hopping; diction stays within POV’s plausible lexicon. Minor rhythmic repetition (“journey” iterations) keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry triple duty—image, metaphor, and causation—without scaffold. “A ribcage cradled a thriving sapling” fuses death and life in one clean stroke. No filter-verb stacks or paraphrase loops; clause variety supports the accumulative cadence. One mixed metaphor (“faith quiet and durable as stone, warm and curious as the living wood”) slightly blurs tactile logic, preventing 9.0.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Catacomb orchard as living calendar is a fresh synthesis of burial and growth tropes; diaspora narrative is inverted from loss to deliberate dispersal. Risk is taken in quiet, accumulative structure rather than twist, and pays off in the final reconfiguration. Specificity of bone-threaded roots feels inevitable, not ornamental. Could not swap setting or object without collapsing meaning.</comment>
