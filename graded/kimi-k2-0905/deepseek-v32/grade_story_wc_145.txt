<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Motivation is lucid and consistent, but interiority skews abstract (“subtle confidence,” “worrying tranquility”) rather than embodied. The single on-page choice—trekking to the ridge—lacks a felt trade-off; no opportunity, stamina, or relational cost is dramatized. Dry wit surfaces only once (“unedited”), leaving the advertised persona under-used. The arc lands as observation, not pressured decision.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The condensation map supplies a tidy causal trigger, but tension plateaus: data confirmed by falcon → memorized pattern → walk → discovery. No narrowing of options or new obstacle escalates risk; the final beat is verification, not irreversible change. Closure qualifies as Charged Poise—the vista “reweights” his quest—yet the cost is conceptual, not lived on the page. Orientation holds; lens is straight Causal.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Arctic outpost, frozen lake, and ephemeral glass map are tactile and POV-filtered; cold contracts breath, wood floor crunches under boots. The glass condensation literally steers navigation, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography stays clean across the hike; glacier birthplace is rendered through glint and trickle, not exposition. Selective sensory economy keeps momentum; no world-rule lapses.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Stakes are declared (career-defining quest) but static: confirmation arrives, he walks, he finds—no fresh opposition, resource drain, or emotional friction. The singular convergence concept tightens thematic focus yet functions as revelation, not escalating pressure. A single micro-turn (condensation map) suffices structurally, but the absence of consequential choice keeps the beat flat. No visible price alters later tactics.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Theme—raw origin versus curated knowledge—emerges through the irony of “unedited” rivers. The polyglot’s relic and native hydrology terms layer cultural convergence cleanly. Yet theme stays cerebral; the ending reprises tranquility without emotional after-shock. Resonance is present but muted by the lack of personal cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays anchored to Aris with consistent perceptual skew (maps, glossaries, glass veins). Diction is spare, slightly sardonic, fitting the “dry-witted” brief; no POV leakage. Rhythm modulates: short declaratives under chill, longer cadences for reflection. No dialogue to test, so voice stands on narrative texture; it holds.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Sentences stay lean, propulsive; no filter stacks or synonym loops. Figurative language is restrained—“veins,” “web”—and coherent. One scaffold tic: “worrying tranquility” is repeated thrice without escalation, dulling its edge. Otherwise clean mechanics; glass map image crystallizes effectively.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Quest-for-source is familiar, but reading ephemeral condensation as living cartography offers a fresh sensory twist. The polyglot relic links vanished explorer to present discovery, adding historical layer. Risk level is moderate; no formal experiment. Specificity of atlas editing versus unedited meltwater gives the concept a memorable inflection.</comment>
