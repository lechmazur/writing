<comment>Interiority is concrete—oxygen gauge, vial cold against palm—and the override of panic is shown through micro-choices (deliberate grace, recalling exact glyph pressure). The final silence-as-cost is earned. Minor slip: “trapped by a collapsed entrance” is told, not embodied; we never feel the rock pinning her.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Causal lens holds: every beat flows from oxygen-drop → hush-release → memory-reading → glyph sequence → exit. Closure is a clean Decisive Change with conceptual cost—she carries the temple’s silence home. One micro-gap: the transmitter “might now carry a signal” is an un-earned conditional that slightly softens the final causal bite.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Temple architecture is filtered through求生 priorities—glyphs under light, dais wear-marks—so detail never stalls. The vial and empty passage function as micro-setting that charges the final image. Oxygen gauge and rising water provide live environmental pressure. One nit: cliffside crevice geometry is sketched only at emergence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—air running out—tightens every beat; hush-use trades remaining time for knowledge, visible on the gauge blink. Escalation is linear but effective: each glyph touch burns seconds, final twist buys egress. Cost is legible: empty vial, lungs burning, permanent soul-silence. No secondary stake complicates, but single stake is sufficient at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from action: silence as survival tool, not symbol. Final surface image re-weights earlier “lonesome splendor” into earned solitude rather than loneliness. No moralizing; the empty vial as relic lets resonance echo. Avoids cliché binaries of panic vs calm—instinct is overridden, not erased.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Aris’s perceptual filter—“crushing depth,” “velvet quiet”—without head-hop. Syntax lengthens underwater, shortens at surfacing, mirroring breath. One filter-verb cluster (“seemed to watch”) is minor. Voice is consistent, marine-archaeologist diction plausible, no corporate register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with scene: long clauses underwater, punchy fragments at surfacing. Figurative language is spare—only two metaphors, both clean. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances oxygen, memory, or glyph. “Blink” used twice for gauge and stars is intentional echo, not repetition flaw.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>“Distilled silence as memory key” is fresh synthesis of familiar tropes. Risk—quiet surreal memory-touch—pays off causally, not as gimmick. Temple-as-memory-bank feels inevitable in hindsight. Only soft spot: transmitter signal re-entry is less transformed, a near-generic rescue cue.</comment>
