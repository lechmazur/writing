<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Aris’s “purposefully curious” trait is repeatedly named but never put in direct tension with an opposite impulse; the grain-of-sand totem is handled but never alters a decision on the page. Interiority is vivid (“grain… seemed to pulse”) yet stays safely aligned with her single goal, so no contradictory impulse compounds pressure. The beat-level cost is atmospheric (melancholy acknowledged) rather than behavioral, so the closure feels admired, not earned. Still, the embodied solitude and camera micro-choices keep her above the mid-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the chemical flare marks the site, re-weighting her vigilance into legacy; cost is the flower’s extinction, felt in the final “pang.” Causality is light but coherent under Accumulative lens—each paragraph layers texture until the sunrise pattern breaks. Orientation is secure by paragraph 2; no teleportation of props. The lens holds, yet one meaningful tightening is all we get; no second option is foreclosed, capping it below 8.8.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The summit’s shifting light is filtered through Aris’s camera priorities; crater shadows and UV chemistry constrain both timing and method. The grain of sand functions as micro-setting, warmed by palm and memory, charging the final souvenir image. Selective sensory hierarchy (visual > thermal > hush) supports the photographic stakes without tourist catalog. Environment materially shapes tactics—photochemical vial placement depends on exact sunrise angle—meeting the 9- gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“photograph the last bloom”—is signaled early and tightens only once when the first ray triggers both camera and vial. No second reversal or resource loss complicates her path; oxygen check is mentioned but never limits action. Pressure is situational and coherent yet static; she waits, succeeds, mourns. Cost is existential (species loss) rather than personal trade-off, keeping escalation in the competent mid-band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Theme of preservation-against-entropy emerges through the photochemical beacon and last-bloom image, never sermonized. Subtext resides in the grain-of-sand inheritance—time’s passage versus human witness—re-weighted when she keeps it after the flower vanishes. Melancholy tone is sustained but modulates into bittersweet trophy, offering plausible counter-readings (curiosity as vanity). No thematic echo punts it below 8.8.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Aris; perceptual signature is visual-photographic (“visor reflecting,” “lens focused”). Syntax lengthens under dawn glow, then clips at closure (“She packed her gear”), mirroring emotional cadence. No dialogue to test voice distinction, but interior diction stays within a crater-inspector lexicon. Occasional soft filters (“seemed to pulse”) slightly dilute immediacy, keeping it south of 9.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm is varied; paragraph lengths swell and contract with light. Information density is high—chemical vial, hourglass relic, UV trigger woven in two sentences. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; metaphors stay coherent (“craters like ancient memories”). One mixed image—“dawnlit melancholy” as noun phrase—slight strain, but it recurs purposefully, not enough to dull closure.</comment>

<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Lunar sunrise flower is fresh; pairing it with 19th-century hourglass sand creates temporal friction that feels specific to this voice. Chemical time-capsule method is grounded in prior geo-tradition, not gadgetry. Risk is moderate—quiet stake, no antagonist—but the synthesis of extinction photography and beacon graffiti keeps it from template territory. Could swap inspector for botanist with minor edits, so not quite indispensable.</comment>
