<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete (“whispers travel farther than shouts” as credo) and embodied emotion surfaces during stealth beats; the petition reveal provides external validation of her credo with felt social cost, satisfying closure. The rival functions only as thematic foil—no status shift staged—so relationship crucible is absent; micro-choices are present but not sharply contradictory under peak pressure. Overall a strong single-POV arc, yet the rival’s cardboard menace keeps the relational pressure thin.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: anonymous note → map memory → coin slot → key seam → petition expose, each step because/therefore linked. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the petition’s appearance re-weights authority, foreclosing the rival’s path with visible social cost while confirming Elara’s method. Orientation clean by 80 words; no prop or knowledge teleportation. One minor slack: key mechanics are hidden from reader until final use, but the motif is seeded early enough to qualify as purposeful elision rather than cheat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Container maze rendered through motion—echoing steps, junction choices, slot discovered in “certain light”—so setting actively guides stealth tactics. Geomagnetic storm supplies flickering stakes and radio static but never forces a recalculated move; storm stays background rather than constraint. Micro-setting (zodiac slot, key seam) directly enables climax, meeting 9+ gate. Sensory hierarchy favors hearing and touch, matching maintenance worker POV.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“lose your place forever”—is personal livelihood and belief validation; escalation proceeds from threat → infiltration → discovery of petition, each step narrowing options. Tightening beat occurs when she turns the key in the wall seam, exposing worker solidarity that flips power balance; cost is rival’s humiliation and her own exposure as insurgent organizer. Pressure coherent under causal lens; no coincidence resolves conflict.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: subtle knowledge work versus blunt authority. Subtext lives in staging—Elara’s whispered disappearance vs rival’s echoing shout—without thematic lecture. Final image of folded map and coin tucks theme into gesture; resonance lingers. Docked slightly because rival’s line “But why? To save your job?” nudges toward echoing the thesis aloud.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-limited stays tightly lashed to Elara’s perceptions; syntax is lean, tactile, rhythmic. Filter verbs minimal; perceptual signature selective (“identify any intruder by their walk”). No dialogue until the underground confrontation; lines serve power shift, though rival’s speech leans expositional. Voice remains consistent under auroral static pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, high-density; varied sentence openings, no loops or synonym churn. Metaphors sparse and functional (“steel canyons”). Occasional elevated phrasing (“calculated spontaneity”) is justified as thematic label. No artifact touches closure beat; momentum carries to final image without scaffolding.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Combines industrial-port noir with zodiac-tinged mysticism; result feels fresh rather than checklist. Hidden petition as “whisper-made-roar” twist is foreshadowed yet satisfying. Rival archetype is familiar, but Elara’s cartographic kinesthetic intelligence particularizes her. Risk taken in merging geomagnetic sci-fi with underdog labor plot pays off without gimmickry.</comment>
