<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Leo’s reticence and “warmly observant” trait stay embodied: he traces the rail, stacks stones, bottles radiance through silent attention. Internal contradiction is thin—no moment where observation collides with an impulse to speak—so the arc is more still-life than crucible. The final renunciation (carrying the bottled safety away) is credible but cost is diffuse; we feel quietude more than loss. Within word-limit, characterization is sustained and specific enough for high-band, yet stops just short of 9 because pressure never forces a visible flaw or trade-off.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the tower’s new inner light reconfigures meaning and the bottle in Leo’s pocket carries undeniable conceptual cost (“a quiet promise for the next lonely keeper”). Causality is lyrical-accumulative: each beat—letter read, cairn built, glow bottled—adds density until the final image reweights the premise. The lens is coherent from first sentence to last; no orientation debt; one clean transition (descent & return) stays within two-shard allowance. All set-ups (sea-glass, stone-code, flicker timeframe) pay off in the final beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Salt wind, iron rail, crevice stones are filtered through Leo’s tactile priorities; the lantern room’s glass crown and the “luminescent ache” sky are visually precise without tourist clutter. Environment constrains the pivotal choice: the narrow gallery forces the stone-stack method and the extinguished lamp necessitates the bottling act. Spatial choreography is immaculate—every climb, crouch, and sail away is trackable. Micro-setting (pocket, desk, crevice) doubles as crucible, earning the 9+ gate; only the faintest excess adjective (“hollow groan of the wind”) keeps it sub-9.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserve the unseen keeper’s sanity and the ghost’s vigil—tightens once: when Leo realizes the flicker signals spectral fatigue, his stacking shifts from routine to life-line. A single, visible price is paid: he captures the tower’s accumulated safety, surrendering his own detachment (the bottle now weighs in his coat). No second reversal is needed at this length; the deepening of knowledge suffices under accumulative lens. Cost is legible but not viscerally felt, capping entry below 8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of custodial continuity emerges wordlessly: anonymous letters, stone syntax, and bottled radiance all argue that vigilance must outlive the individual. No character moralizes; the final gleam on sea glass re-prices the premise that safety can be stored and passed on. Ambiguity persists—ghost may still linger, Leo may never speak—giving the reader after-image to interrogate. One faint echo of prompt language (“bottle the feeling of safety”) is subsumed in action, so no deduction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited clings to Leo’s sensory rail: “his thick fingers careful,” “salt wind,” no knowledge beyond his gaze. Syntax is maritime spare, rhythmic rise and fall mimicking swell. No dialogue, so voice carries entirely through weighted verbs (“traced,” “gathered,” “poured”) and selective maritime lexicon. One clause (“luminescent ache”) risks authorial flourish but is taught early and reprised at dawn, just inside patterned license.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Sentences vary from short pulse (“He climbed”) to elongated clause chains that mimic spiral ascent; no template cadence detected. Figurative load is disciplined—three metaphors across 700+ words, each anchored to maritime physics. No paraphrase loops, no filter-verb stacks; information density is high (“bottle it” compresses an entire metaphysical act into two words). A single adjectival pair (“beautiful and sorrowful”) at closure is earned by prior accumulation; prose remains propulsive and transparent.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Supply-skipper tending a ghost via stone-code cairns and captured luminescence feels fresh, yet inherits recognizable lighthouse lore without mere inversion. The anonymous letter-chain and stone-stack syntax are specific inventions that could not swap into another maritime tale unchanged. Risk is quiet—lyric stillness instead of twist—but coherent. No familiar scene or line is echoed without transformation; originality resides in the logistical tenderness of bottling safety itself.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Reticence is signaled early, shapes the silent courier role, and enables the final act of non-verbal preservation; without it the stone-code and bottling feel unmotivated.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Sea glass appears in pocket, crowns the cairn, then catches dawn’s first gleam—each return reweights meaning from talisman to shared beacon; removal would gut the closure image.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Letter chain justifies Leo’s presence, triggers the confessional text, and cues the ghost’s back-story; it drives two beats but could be replaced by logbook with only moderate revision.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Warm observation enables the stone-stack cipher and the bottling act; the trait is active in multiple beats but never collides with a conflicting impulse, keeping it below 8.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Protect is the through-line: every action—climbing, stacking, bottling—serves to shield unseen keepers and ghost; removal collapses the entire causal chain.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stone-stacking method is taught early, executed mid-scene to convey solidarity, and completed in final beat; mechanics are specific and irreplaceable to the story’s silent logic.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Haunted lantern room supplies the ghostly pressure that redefines Leo’s task; its glass-paned architecture forces the stacking gallery and the bottling ritual.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lamp-flicker sets the clock and tightens the need for alternate light; timeframe is tracked via dusk-to-dawn but does not actively constrain mid-scene tactics, capping impact.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Bottling safety is stated motive, enacted in the luminous capture, and carried off-page as cost; the desire directly shapes the climax and could not be deleted without breaking closure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>“Luminescent ache” infuses sky, glass, and final dawn, modulating from mournful to consolatory; tone is coherent across every beat and charges the resonant ending.</comment>
