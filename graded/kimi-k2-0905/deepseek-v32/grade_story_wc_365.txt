<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elara's sensory-mapper vocation is vividly interiorized, but motivation is stated rather than dramatized; the withheld-truth drive never collides with an immediate opposing want, so her final choice feels pre-ordained. Cyclic power is label-repeated ("cyclically spontaneous") without visible cost or contradiction inside beats. Mentor reveal supplies back-story catharsis, yet Elara’s live emotional contradiction stays off-stage; the only micro-choice is grabbing the shard, which is reflexive, not value-revealing.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: she accepts the weight and resolves to complete Alistair’s work. Causal chain, however, is thin; the shard’s sudden memory-projection solves the core mystery without prior set-up or price, and the Orientation Test triggers: location, time, and even her body placement remain vague past 120 words (“abandoned spaceport repair bay” is repeated but not anchored). Lens = Hybrid leaning Accumulative; pattern holds but escalation is one-step, not tightening.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>“Derelict hall,” “rust-fretted console,” and “cool green shard” give tactile micro-setting; the bay functions as thin-place object rather than postcard backdrop. Spatial choreography is loose—no sense of exits, scale, or Elara’s bodily relation to walls/ship husks—so environment never constrains movement. Atmosphere is strong but static; details echo mood rather than shape tactics. No world-logic inconsistency; ozone/engine hums are well-filtered through synesthetic POV.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is the withheld truth; pressure spikes once with the psychic surge, then resolves via shard-ex-machina. No meaningful narrowing of options or trade-off; she simply learns and decides to “complete Alistair’s work” without visible obstacle or cost on-page. Agency is observational—mapping, witnessing—until the final declarative stance. Escalation is informational, not tactical; coincidence (shard happens to be the key) substitutes for reversal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme of inherited responsibility and the gravity of knowledge emerges through the iterative mentor visions; epiphany is earned by stacked parallels rather than authorial statement. Green shard reweights from curiosity to legacy, supplying resonant closure without moralizing. Ambiguity remains: she shoulders an endless task, implying cost beyond the page. Final phrase “density of love, and the gravity of continuity” skirts thematic echo but feels grounded in prior particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Lush, lyric third-person adheres tightly to Elara’s synesthetic register; perceptual signature is consistent (“scent of ozone,” “echo-locations of emotions”). Syntax modulates with surge-and-calm rhythm; no head-hopping. Diction stays within poetic speculative idiom; occasional elevated phrasing (“delicate mental embroidery”) is motivated by voice. Dialogue absent, so no register clash; shard-images act as subtext.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose is sonorous but loops: “cyclically spontaneous” appears three times without new information; “withheld truth” / “weight of truth” paraphrase chain; “murmur of half-remembered dreams” bookends with no cadence shift. Metaphors coherent but dense in climactic beat (“woven between worlds,” “threading consciousness,” “cosmic energies”)—slight purple tint. No grammar faults; pronoun/tense clean. Paragraph variation supports breath. Information density high; still, trimming 5–7 adjectives would sharpen propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Synesthetic cartographer navigating grief across multiversal rift is fresh synthesis; mentor-memory crystal shard is elegant physicalization of legacy burden. Iterative mentor vignettes avoid single-twist dependency. Risk taken with lyric, accumulative structure pays off in resonant final image. Premise not radically novel, but execution is personalized and avoids stock “chosen one” beats.</comment>
