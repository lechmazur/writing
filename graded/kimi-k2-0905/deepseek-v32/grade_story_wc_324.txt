<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is lyrically voiced but stays observational; she listens and assures but never faces a contradiction that costs her anything. The “contact tracer for hearts” premise is evocative yet never tested by an on-page dilemma, so her curiosity and protective drive remain static traits rather than engines of choice. The embodied emotion is atmospheric, not kinesthetic, keeping her just below the 8-band where micro-choice under pressure is required.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly as Resonant Reconfiguration: the voice is “whole,” the locket reunited with the photograph, and Elara’s listening has reweighted the relic into testimony. Causality is lyrical-accumulative rather than strict because/therefore, but the pattern is taught early and held to the final image, satisfying the lens. Cost is felt conceptually—the dead now “echo” in living hearts—meeting the 9- gate even without a physical price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The atrium’s mist, marble, and skeletal tree are selectively filtered through Elara’s tracer perceptions, creating a micro-setting that guides her steps and cloisters sound. The hearing aid and photograph function as portable setting-extensions that constrain how she can act; without them the pulses vanish. While the wider world is absent, the tight sensory frame successfully charges the final locket discovery.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Stakes center on whether one silenced woman will remain so; pressure tightens once as the pulses quicken and the locket is found, but no live option is foreclosed for Elara—she risks nothing, loses nothing. Escalation is textural (mist thickens, pulses clarify) rather than causal, sufficient for the accumulative lens but short of the visible price that would push the score past 8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: witness as quiet heroism, memory as resistance to erasure. The refrain “incidental heroism” risks minor echo-statement, yet it is anchored to the concrete act of listening that reweights the photograph from relic to testimony. Ambiguity remains—no moral is declared—allowing the reader to feel the conceptual cost rather than be told it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person lyrical voice stays consistently close to Elara’s perceptions; syntax breathes with the misty cadence and never breaks register. Perceptual signature is strong—sound is “reeling hush,” pulses “erratic like a heartbeat on the verge of stillness”—creating a distinct texture that peaks in the final clarified “I was silenced” without head-hopping or filter-verb clutter.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Prose is lush but disciplined; metaphor clusters serve the atmospheric lens without overwriting until the final third, where “reeling hush” and “hymn” verge on excess. No loops or scaffold sentences; rhythm modulates from long mist-wrapped clauses to the stark coda “You are heard.” A 0.3 debit for purple tint in closure keeps it below 8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The “contact tracer for hearts” conceit freshens the familiar ghost-medium trope by weaponizing an obsolete hearing aid as spiritual Geiger counter. Specificity of the yellowed device and last photograph grounds the concept so the story could not swap props without collapse. A modest risk bonus (+0.3) rewards turning tech intended for the hard-of-hearing into an instrument for the long-dead.</comment>
