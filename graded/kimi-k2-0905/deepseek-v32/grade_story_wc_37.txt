<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Elara’s longing to “rekindle a dying realm” is lyrically reiterated but never sharpened into a tangible, high-stakes want; her interiority is lush yet abstract (“she moved as a whisper”) and the only embodied choice—placing “translucent hands upon the mica”—is reported, not dramatized. Scattering her consciousness is an evocative premise, yet the re-assembly feels automatic once the chorus swells, so the cost of reintegration is asserted rather than felt. No micro-choice visibly forecloses an alternate path; the ending’s “bound release” is thematic shorthand, not an earned renunciation or fresh risk.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the “cascade of soft, dawn-like light” swaddles the greenhouse, halting decay with visible environmental change and communal cost—the echoes must keep singing. Causality is lyric rather than strict: humming → mica response → chorus → mending tapestry, each step contiguous but not rigorously pressured; still, the lens (Accumulative/Textural) is taught early and held. Two reflective blocks exceed 20 % yet tilt the present stance each time, so BRR exception is met. Orientation is clear within 120 words; no teleporting props or retroactive patches.</comment>

<comment>The greenhouse’s “glass panes holding back an endless night” and memory-fruit rows are economically re-used: setting constrains choice by supplying both the failed resource (fruits) and the tool (mica window). Sensory triangulation is strong—luminescent flora, cool mica under palms, hesitant lullaby—each filtered through Elara’s urgent selective attention. Spatial choreography is clean as she “turned from the window and moved deeper,” tracking body-to-object distances. The mirror-world tag is atmospherically evoked but never explicated; since no choice depends on alternate physics, the vagueness is tolerable.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—restore the realm before “its light faded completely”—is declared early; pressure deepens as Elara realizes she needs “the chorus of the community that was no more,” narrowing her options from solo act to summoner. Escalation is textural: each joined voice brightens the mica, reweighting the stake’s cost (perpetual vigilance). The final swaddling is an accumulative payoff, not a reversal, sufficiently legible under the lyric lens but lacking a sharp, irrecoverable price shown on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without sermon: communal memory sung into light reframes “unity” from abstract virtue to renewable resource. The woven-dawn tapestry visually reconfigures in the mica, paying off the core concept without overt thesis. Final image—“the endless night was no longer a shroud, but a canvas”—reweights premise via Conceptual Repricing, implying perpetual creative labor rather than victory. Subtext in gesture (touching fruit but releasing only glow) quietly asserts restraint over consumption.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric maintains consistent psychic distance; diction (“silvered leaves,” “rosy filaments”) is elevated yet anchored in Elara’s perceptual bias toward refracted light. Rhythm modulates: long, breathy sentences for twilight stillness, shorter fragments (“She sang again, clearer now”) to mark beat shifts. No dialogue to test, yet prose itself carries musical indirection. Patterned repetition (“woven dawns,” “swaddle”) is purposeful, taught early, and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm is fluid; sentence openings vary, no template cadence. Occasional modifier stacks (“luminescent flora grew in silent rows”) flirt with density but stay legible and thematically apt. One paraphrase loop (“the greenhouse, once a vibrant heart, now felt like a solemn tomb”) is forgivable at ~3 %. No filter-verb clusters; verbs are strong (“channelled,” “swelled,” “straightened”). Copy is clean; pronouns track.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The memory-orchard germinates fresh mythopoeia: fruit bearing memories, song as loom for dawns—specific synthesis, not checklist. Premise risks sentiment yet grounds itself in tactile acts (hum, touch, swaddle). Transformation test fails if names change because the mirror-world mica-window mechanics are irreducibly particular. Risk-taking (scattered POV, accumulative chorus) heightens meaning without obscuring closure.</comment>
