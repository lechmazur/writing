<comment>Elara’s allegiance-to-static, not-to-Kael, is embodied in every dial-turn; her final micro-choice to transmit the lullaby costs her last stamina and isolates her further, earning the renunciation. Interiority stays concrete—“her hands steady despite the tower's shudder” shows contradiction in motion. No second character on page, so relationship bullet skipped; loneliness sharpened into perceptual bias is sufficient for single-POV scope. Motivation scales to visible fatigue and the smile that admits perpetual solitude—clear cost.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the packet is sent, Kael’s spectrum bent toward mercy, her solitude crystallized—cost is the ebbing storm and her physical exhaustion. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each radio fragment layers urgency until the cadence shift of “strange silence” reweights stakes. Orientation anchored by word 52 (“stormlit observatory above the clouds”). No causal break; ancient-data payoff set up early. Persistent constraint—she is still alone, airwaves forever altered—visible in final image.</comment>

<comment>Cobalt portico acts as micro-setting: it focuses signals, hums under lightning, and refracts dawn into the final charged image—environment constrains both reception and transmission. Storm governs beat rhythm, narrowing perception to crackle and light. Selective sensory hierarchy—sound before sight—mirrors her profession. Spatial choreography clean; tower’s groan tracked throughout. World rules consistent: dead satellite data is plausible McGuffin within near-future noir tech.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—will she bend the prophet’s rise or remain passive—signaled in paragraph 1. Mid-story tightening: Kael’s priority demand forces her to choose transmit or obey; option foreclosed when she keys the lullaby. Cost legible in bodily fatigue and the forever-changed spectrum. Accumulative lens: pressure intensifies via sharper signals and storm peak; no coincidence resolves. One meaningful deepening sufficient for length; meets 8+ gate with visible price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme—truth resides in static, not leaders—emerges through action: she seeds doubt into every radio. Subtext encoded in the lullaby of equations; no moral declared. Recurrent cobalt / storm imagery reweights from menace to beacon by dawn, charging closure. Ambiguity survives: mercy may or may not flower, but narrative refuses to settle. No final-paragraph thesis; resonance carried by image of portico “ablaze.” Complexity honored.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice distinct: lyrical compression, tech diction (“packet,” “data stream”) fused with nursery-rhyme noir. Rhythm accelerates during keying sequence then exhales into dawn silence—tight control. No dialogue, so dialogue bullets skipped. Perceptual signature concrete—she hears before she sees, notices frequency over flesh. Free indirect clean, no head-hopping. Experimental elision (“a solid block of storm”) taught early and paid off. Registers stay within her lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence runs. High density: “lullaby of equations, a prophetic map hidden in a cradle song” does double metaphoric and plot work. No mixed metaphors; storm/tech vehicles stay coherent. Loops absent. Minor filter verb at “she felt” but immediacy restored in same clause. Final third clean—no artifact touches closure. Read-aloud rhythm peaks on cadence shift to post-storm hush.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Premise—lone tuner hijacks messianic bandwidth via dead-satellite lullaby—feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Tropes (storm-observatory, prophet, ancient data) transformed through radio-poetic specificity. Risk of lyric tech-noir pays off: static as scripture. Could not swap portico or lullaby without breaking logic. Synthesis of science and nursery rhyme creates memorable angle. Emotional truth—solitude sharpened into agency—grounds novelty.</comment>
