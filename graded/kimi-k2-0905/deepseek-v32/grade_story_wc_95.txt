<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Alistair’s “turn questions into destinations” creed is dramatized through the sundial decoding and the pivot from duel to joint quest; the tin card functions as a credible, cost-laden micro-choice. Interiority is concrete (“restless thoughts,” thumb on cold tin) and the final lowering of the blade shows a hierarchy of values (archive over victory) with visible relational cost. Flaws are present—perfect recall of cipher mechanics under duel stress—but they don’t derail the earned renunciation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: because he decodes the sundial, therefore he can offer the destination; because the card falls, therefore the truce crystallizes. The 120-word anchor is met (glass atrium, brook, mechanical arm all within first 90 words). Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—shared purpose replaces combat—with felt cost: the duel abandoned, the archive’s uncertainty accepted. No teleporting props or outline sequencing; every beat advances either knowledge or relational stance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Glass walls fragment movement, brook murmur counters duel chime, half-painted sundial literally steers plot; environment constrains footwork and supplies the cipher. Micro-setting succeeds: the tin card’s sun-warmed metal becomes the final handshake. Selective sensory economy—sound of water, gleam of steel—keeps momentum. Spatial choreography is clean; no floating bodies or impossible angles.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“right to map the question onto the world”—is signaled early and narrowed by the sundial revelation. One meaningful tightening: duel suspends, archive journey begins, foreclosing victory-as-resolution. Cost is legible: relinquished triumph, deferred answers, shared risk. Pressure grows under causal lens; no coincidence rescues them.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the inversion of combat into collaboration; the sundial’s incomplete face mirrors their unfinished philosophy. Subtext lives in gesture—lowering blades, returning card—rather than exposition. Final image reweights prior duel as overture to joint inquiry, avoiding moralizing. Slight abstraction in “map the question” keeps it from 8+ band, but ambiguity is purposeful and tied to concrete stakes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Third-person POV stays tightly anchored to Alistair’s perceptual filter: hydraulic arm, angle calculations, diplomatically fierce modulation. Rhythm shifts from reflective long sentences to staccato blade-work without register drift. Dialogue is sparse, elliptical, goal-driven—“We fence for the right to map the question”—carrying subtext of old affection. No head-hopping or filter-verb clutter; mechanical limb narration remains embodied rather than explanatory.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening structure; no template cadence or synonym loops detected. Figurative language is spare and accurate—“glass walls reflecting their movement like a fragmented tableau”—and never intrudes during high-tempo exchanges. Information density is high: sundial cipher, foil stance, emotional history delivered without scaffolding. Final line cadence echoes opening brook murmur, creating purposeful circularity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Fusing philosophy, clock-puzzle, and rapier duel into a collaborative quest feels fresh; the sundial cipher as plot engine rather than set dressing transforms familiar tropes. Specificity—danish tin card, hydraulic riposte—prevents generic “fate-of-ideas” abstraction. Risk is taken by aborting the duel mid-peak, yet causality holds. Could edge higher if archive stakes were less abstract, but synthesis is already non-obvious.</comment>
