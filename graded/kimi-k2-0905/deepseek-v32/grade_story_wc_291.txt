<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s methodical, face-blind painter is sharply particularized through sensory micro-choices (“frayed edge…with a methodical precision born of necessity”). Her flaw (face blindness) actively complicates the quarry search and forces creative compensation, giving the empathy awakening a visible cost. The only drag is a late, slightly abstract declaration of motive (“she understood the perpetrator's motive”) rather than an embodied deduction; still, the interior contradiction and earned shift land cleanly.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Causal linkage holds throughout: ribbon fragment → quarry logic → box discovery → empathy turn. Orientation is instantaneous (who/where/when by line 3); the single shard stays coherent. Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the locket portrait reweights Elara’s rule-set, empathy now irrevocable (“she had finally learned to see with the heart”). Persistent constraint—her permanent face blindness—shapes the final image and keeps the cost legible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Quarry is rendered through tactile, POV-filtered detail (“bowl of silence…damp smell, crunch of gravel”) that constrains movement and pacing. The ribbon fragment and rotted box serve as micro-setting objects whose evolving states steer discovery. Mist and limestone shadows act as active impediments, not backdrop. One minor slip: “time-rotted box” is the only visual that drifts toward convenient adjective stacking, but it does not dull the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—solve the cold case before the last evidence rots—tightens once: the ribbon’s logic forces the quarry climb, narrowing options to “misplaced in plain sight.” Protagonist agency drives every beat; coincidence is absent. Cost is visible: Elara’s empathy awakening is paired with the irreversible recognition that she will never see the victim’s actual face. The tightening is single but meaningful; no secondary reversal is needed at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of “vision beyond sight” emerges organically from Elara’s compensatory method and the masquerade motif; no explicit sermonizing. The ribbon’s shift from elegant silk to violence carrier quietly reweights “mask” as both concealment and revelation. Final image—portrait she cannot visually resolve yet now emotionally inhabits—offers a resonant, non-literal answer. Only a half-sentence of thematic echo (“truth often hides behind masks”) nicks the score, but it is brief and not closure-straddling.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elara’s synesthetic, detail-obsessed perceptual signature (“shifting mosaics of features”). Diction remains within her artistic lexicon; no filter-verb clusters. Rhythm accelerates up the quarry path, then breathes at the crevice moment, mirroring tension. No dialogue appears, so voice evaluation rests on interior texture, which is consistent and pressure-responsive.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is lean, high-density: single sentences perform setting, characterization, and causality (“From the fragment, she deduced the mask's size, the tie method, even the wearer's probable height”). Metaphors are spare and coherent (“bowl of silence”). One scaffold loop—“methodical” appears three times in 30 lines—creates mild cadence echo; it stops short of the closure beat, so the 9+ gate is not broken but keeps the score sub-8.5.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The face-blind portrait artist + cold-case ribbon + quarry search is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis; removing any leg collapses the plot. The “unifying opposites” method is literalized in both geology (quarry) and psychology (empathy through blindness). Risk—making the protagonist unable to visually recognize her own solution—heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The concept feels inevitable in hindsight yet was not predictable at entry.</comment>
