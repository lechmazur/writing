<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Interiority stays lyric and consistent; “lucid unrest” gives a usable contradicted pulse. Yet every micro-choice is the same—insert needle, pull thread, whisper—and no interior hierarchy shifts; the final calm is declared, not dramatized through a cost she visibly pays. Motivation is declared (“to ground restless spirits”) but never tested by a competing want or fear, so the arc is flat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the captain’s emergence reframes the accumulated silence into a sanctuary guardian, cost felt in the expelled light. Causality under Accumulative/Textural lens is coherent—each knot loosened thickens the hush—yet the story repeats the same beat with only scalar escalation; a single mid-course pattern break or failed knot could have tightened options. Orientation is clear by line 4; no debt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prism sanctuary refracts starlight into color that literally guides her needle—setting as tool, satisfying the 9+ gate. Micro-settings (net, needle, glow) are tactile and tracked; spatial ground holds. Repetition of “interlaced hush” edges toward static catalogue, but the final image re-uses the colored light to mark closure, earning its keep.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—free the captain—emerges only at the final knot; prior spirits are anonymous, so pressure is uniform rather than escalating. Because each success brightens the sanctuary instead of narrowing her options or raising personal cost, the middle sags; no reversal or trade-off tests her resolve. Agency is present but undifferentiated across beats.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of “unraveling binds” emerges organically through the net image and the grandmother secret; no moral is stated. Final image of merged starlight re-weights earlier color refractions, achieving quiet resonance. Would climb higher if a personal stake (e.g., her own mask still broken) had been knotted into the captain’s fate.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Elara’s perceptual filter; diction (“accumulated silence pressed softly against her skin”) is sensuous and consistent. Rhythm modulates—long breaths for description, clipped sentences for knot work—without losing control. No dialogue to test voice distinction, but narrative voice carries sufficient idiosyncrasy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and mostly free of scaffold; a few “interlaced hush / accumulated silence” near-repeats create minor loop drag. Metaphors hold physical logic; no mixed vehicles. High information density—each paragraph advances task or atmosphere. Final eruption of light lands without figurative muddle.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>“Ghost net restorer” is fresh, and the prism sanctuary literalizing starlight as tool offers a vivid speculative slant. Yet the plot skeleton—patiently untangle knots to free souls—maps directly onto familiar “releasing trapped spirits” templates without subverting the pattern. Specific grandmother secret and color-guided needle provide enough inflection to feel memorable rather than derivative.</comment>
