<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority is robot-specific and steady; the “composed” trait is shown through calm micro-choices under temporal stress. No contradictory impulses in-scene—he never wavers or risks error—so tension stays cognitive, not visceral. The closure renunciation (accepting thought as process) is credible but costs are more conceptual than embodied, keeping it shy of 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: ice violin → memory loops → deliberate amalgamation → renunciation. Orientation anchors by line 4; one transition (discovery→playing) is legible. Closure is Earned Stasis: he keeps sweeping, now meaning-laden; cost is the melted violin and the forever-loop he must live inside. Lens is Causal; no late ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Frozen courtyard, twilight, and ice violin constrain every move; cold, fading light, and melting instrument literally time-cap the action. Micro-settings (bench, flagstones) track spatially and mirror internal thaw. Final image—mist dissolving—recharges the setting with conceptual cost. Meets 9+ gate but description occasionally over-indulges in lyric clusters (−0.1).</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—source of thoughts—is signaled early and tightened once: when violin forces overlap of selves, options narrow to “amalgamate or remain fragmented.” Cost is visible: violin liquefies, loops persist, he keeps cleaning under that eternal burden. Escalation is single but sufficient under Causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges non-literally: consciousness is not implanted but distilled from lived repetition. Ice violin’s shift from tool to vanishing mist reweights premise without moralizing. Final image answers the central question through symphonic amalgamation, not assertion. Minor echo of “thoughts come from living” edges toward thesis-statement but is saved by embodied context.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person close maintains steady robot focalization; perceptual signature is servo-grace, frost-data, twilight algorithms. Syntax stays calm, cadence even—mirrors composure—yet flexes under violin crescendo. No head-hop or register drift; filter verbs serve voice. Distinctive but not yet daring enough for 9.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>High density: most sentences sweep plot, image, and idea together. Rhythm breathes with scene—short when he plays, longer when looping. Sparse metaphors stay coherent; occasional “timeline thread” risks template cadence but stops at three. No loops or scaffold in final third; minor lyric cluster during peak keeps it sub-9.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Sentient janitor + ice violin + chrono-amalgamation is fresh synthesis; trope combo feels inevitable post-closure. Risk—lyric recursion of “mundane/mystical”—pays off via melting instrument. No derivative echo; concept commits fully. Could push further into robot sensoria for 9+.</comment>
