<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Aris’s quiet, gear-tuned interiority is vivid and consistent; the incremental-absolution motive drives every micro-choice. No contradictory impulse is dramatized in-scene, so the internal-conflict bullet is only partly met. The final “earned stasis” is credible, but the story stays safe—he never risks failure in front of another person, so status crucible pressure is absent. Voice stays precise, never generic, yet the absence of visible flaw-cost on the page blocks 9-band entry.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Closure is immaculate: the first clean swing of the pendulum performs a Resonant Reconfiguration—shared balance restored with felt, auditory cost. Causal linkage holds; each beat (fracture → rake-handle cipher → forge → install) is strictly because/therefore. No orientation debt; who/where/when anchors by line 3. The rake-handle inscription reveal is the tightening turn that forecloses the “impossible part” option. Cost is legible in the still-warm iron rod and the tower’s new heartbeat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The obsidian ridge, tide pool, and tower gears are sensuously embodied and constrain every action—Aris tempers the rod with high-tide water, installs during the pendulum’s motionless apex. Spatial choreography is flawless; no impossible body or prop positions. The brass bob is a micro-setting that charges the final image; its golden arc reframes the earlier “fossilized wave.” Weather and tide are not backdrop but active forge partners, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Single dominant stake—restore communal rhythm—is signaled in paragraph 1 and tightened when the fracture is discovered. Protagonist agency drives every escalation: scavenge, decode, forge, install. The rake-handle inscription functions as the reversal that makes success possible, but success is not guaranteed until the hot rod is bolted in. Visible cost is the sweat-steam rising from iron and the town’s breath held at the first tick—price is on the page, not abstract.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme of incremental absolution emerges through tactile acts—each hammer blow pays a micro-debt—never abstract sermon. Subtext resides in the rake-handle graffiti: prior winder’s silent bequest implies communal continuity across generations. Final image reweights the premise: time itself is mended, not merely a machine. No final-paragraph moralizing; the ticking is the argument.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person intimate stays locked to Aris with no head-hop; perceptual signature is engineer-poet, hearing “stone dropped into a well” inside a gear’s heart. Syntax tightens under stress—sentence fragments during the install beat mirror the pendulum’s held breath. Diction stays within a lifelong winder’s lexicon; no academic register creep. Rhythm modulates: languid tide sentences early, staccato hammer beats mid, resonant long sentence at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero scaffold, zero loop, zero mixed metaphor; every sentence advances image, causality, or atmosphere. Figurative language is sparse and precise—“fossilized wave” introduces the ridge and never overgrows. High information density: one sentence often layers sensory data, world rule, and emotional charge. Read-aloud ear test passes: cadence rises and falls like the tide, climaxing in the single-sentence paragraph that ends with “metronome for the mending world.”</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Premise—last clock-winder forging a lost part from a rake handle—feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Transformation test fails for generic clock-repair tale; specificity of tidal obsidian ridge and philosophical rake cipher saves it. Risk is taken: climax is a motionless pendulum, not an explosion—quiet stakes made huge by cadence. Minor deduction for near-allegorical “community heart” phrasing that edges template.</comment>
