<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elara’s luminous-skeptic tension is asserted rather than dramatized; the only embodied contradiction is the internal “warred with her hope,” never shown through micro-choice under pressure. The liberation motive stays abstract—no moment where a specific memory’s loss costs her personally—so the final fade-out feels predetermined, not paid for.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the box unstuck, water restored, city re-membered—visible Decisive Change with conceptual cost (her own fading). Causal chain is thin—star-alignment coincidence does the heavy lifting—but the lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds: pattern of dew-breadcrumbs → density of starlight → cadence shift to flowing water reweights the stake. Orientation anchor beats the 120-word clock; geography stays coherent.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Fountain-ring choreography is tracked without drift; dew-in-basin micro-setting becomes the pivot that lets starlight reflect, so environment directly enables the final tactic. Sensory range is narrow (mostly visual starlight) but selective to POV priority. The “city of forgotten fountains” never acquires social texture beyond postcard label, keeping it functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—liberate memories—remains conceptual; no single trapped memory is dramatized to hurt if lost, so pressure stays ambient. Escalation is accretive: each breadcrumb repeats the same dew-pour mechanic without tightening trade-offs. The Chalice-zenith moment is external timing, not an earned narrowing of options; cost is deferred to Elara’s off-page dimming, legible but not viscerally felt.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme of collective amnesia vs. individual belief emerges through the water-return image rather than statement. Subtext stays modest: no ironic gap between Elara and reader, no charged silence. Final image of empty glowing box reconfigures meaning, but because no specific memory is individuated, the resonance is general rather than piercing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Third-person lyric voice sustains a hushed, starlit register without register drift. Syntax repeats purposive anaphora (“At each fountain…”) that mirrors ritual patience; no filter-verb clutter. Perceptual signature is limited—Elara’s skepticism never colors metaphors or diction in a way that would individuate her from any other patient seeker.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Prose is clean, no mixed metaphors or scaffold loops; however, noun-verb economy sometimes defaults to elevated generics (“luminous nature pushed her forward”) that could compress further. Rhythm breathes with scene cadence—long sentence for stellar wait, short crack for “unstuck.” No artifacts touch closure, but density never reaches high-band compression.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Star-map breadcrumb trail is a fresh interactive puzzle; stained-glass memory-box feels familiar but is saved by the astronomical key mechanic. Risk is moderate—quiet lyric quest without antagonist—but specificity of dew-on-dry-stone reflection keeps it from template fantasy. Transformation is present: skeptic performs ritual, accepts fade-out cost, yet city remains backdrop rather than transformed society.</comment>
