<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s guilt-driven urgency and “carefully reckless” diction give her a sharp internal edge; the embodied quill/ink micro-choices visibly track rising risk. Kael remains more thematic mirror than distinct voice, softening relationship-as-crucible pressure. The final shared transcription registers credible renunciation cost, but prior silence is asserted rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Causal spine holds: withheld translation → dawn deadline → ink-test → three promises → harmonic revelation. Orientation lands by ~90 words; single-scene arc meets closure with Earned Stasis (empty well, shared vellum). One minor elasticity: prophecy stakes shift from “weapon” to “warning” without on-page foreshadowing, slightly loosening tightness.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Archive breathes through acoustic, tactile, and light detail; shelves creak in sync with harmonic tension, turning setting into metronome. Glass ink well micro-setting constrains every beat—glow, pulse, overflow—charging the final empty-well image. Spatial choreography remains clean under single POV.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restore trust by dawn) is explicit and time-boxed. Escalation tightens once: promises chain her to irreversible exposure; harmonic misstep risk is felt but abstract. Cost turns concrete only at ink-well exhaustion, slightly late for maximum pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of knowledge-as-hoarded-weapon dissolves into knowledge-as-shared-music through the harmonic lattice image—an earned reconfiguration. No moralizing sentence mars the close; resonance emerges from the emptied well and fresh vellum. Could sharpen subtext in Kael’s forgiveness counter-melody.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Lyric-academic register stays anchored to Elara’s arcane lens; perceptual signature favors sonic metaphors that mesh with concept. Rhythm modulates with ink pulse and musical cadence, no head-hopping. One filter-verb cluster (“seemed to breathe”) slightly dulls peak beat.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Strong sentence variety, high information density; most lines double-duty (action + sonics). No loops or scaffold. One mixed metaphor (“cascading scales of sound”) and a single paraphrase echo (“symphonies of truth” over-invoked) keep it from perfect polish.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Acoustic linguistics + living archive + harmonic truth is a fresh synthesis; turns the trope of “lost prophecy” into “prophecy against hoarding.” Risky ink-well flourish pays off by emptying itself. Not quite revolutionary, but specificity makes the concept feel inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
