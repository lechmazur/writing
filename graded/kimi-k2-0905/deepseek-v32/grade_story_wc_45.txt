<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elara’s “forgiving skeptic” tension stays visible in gesture (cradling the tooth while doubting) and in the final quiet smile, but her interior contradiction is more asserted than dramatized under pressure; no scene beats force her to act against her doubt, so the change reads as gentle acceptance rather than costly renunciation. The old parents’ grief is sketched with economical specificity, yet their one beat—speaking “as if weaving starlight”—is too abstract to test Elara’s stance. Still, the micro-choice to use the tooth as lens, not key, tracks motive cleanly.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the dissolving tooth charges the night sky, reweighting grief into constellation-memory with felt release. Causal chain is spare but coherent—find body → extract tooth → ritual → sky-light—each step narrowing options toward memorial rather than revenge. The single transition (garden → village → garden) is legible and the accumulative lens holds; cost is the irretrievable loss of the magical object itself, visibly paid.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Garden, willow, moss-bed, and hedge maze are filtered through Elara’s bone-setter eye—every detail either supports tactile handling (roots as cradle, moss as altar) or mirrors the theme of hidden growth. Spatial anchors arrive early and hold; the tooth functions as micro-setting that constrains the final ritual. No object or terrain shifts implausibly; weather is muted but consistent. Selective sensory economy keeps the lyric pulse without overcrowding the short frame.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake is articulated early: can doubt be transmuted into healing? Pressure escalates once—discovery of the glowing tooth—then deepens through the ritual rather than complicating via external opposition. The tightening is conceptual (skepticism vs. faith) rather than tactical; no live option is foreclosed on-page, so cost feels contemplative, not visceral. Sufficient for this length and lyric mode, but not piercing.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the recurring bone-setting metaphor applied first to limbs, then to sky: “turning mistakes into constellations” is never sermonized; it crystallizes when the tooth becomes star-map. Ambiguity survives—fey motives stay mysterious—yet the family’s release is concrete. Final image reweights all prior grief without moral tag.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Elara’s perceptual filter—bones, moss, starlight—without head-hop. Syntax tilts toward compound mystery (“shrewdly innocent air,” “nostalgic innovation”) that feels intentional, not template. No dialogue appears, so voice coherence rests on narrative rhythm, which modulates cleanly from hush to uplift. Diction remains within plausible village healer lexicon while allowing slight elevation for mythic lift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is fluid and largely loop-free; occasional soft stacks (“quiet determination,” “gentle space where doubt and belief could coexist”) dilute immediacy but do not stall closure. Metaphors stay consistent—constellation, cradle, bridge—and avoid mixed vehicles. Strong paragraph variety and auditory rhythm support the ceremonial cadence. One paraphrase loop inside “nostalgic innovation” refrain costs a sliver.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Changeling lore is refreshed by routing it through adult aftermath and astronomical memorial rather than rescue or revenge; bone-setting-as-constellation feels idiosyncratic to Elara’s vocation. Risk is quiet—lyric reflection over plot twist—yet specificity of tooth, garden, and ritual keeps the concept from feeling generic. The synthesis arrives inevitable in hindsight, satisfying the transformation test.</comment>
