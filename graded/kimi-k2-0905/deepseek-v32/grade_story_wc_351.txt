<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid—"chaotically precise tremor" embodies the trait while her fingers move. The abandoned-artist/backstory beat is cleanly anchored to the father-napkin memory and motivates the synaptic dig. Micro-choice to re-angle the cracked mirror under heart-tightening loneliness shows contradictory impulses live in scene. Final conservation pivot carries felt cost: she leaves with "soul-stuff" instead of scrap, foreclosing the old scavenger identity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: "curated collection of soul-stuff" crystallizes the new conservator stance with conceptual cost. Causal chain holds—mirror crack diffracts → entangled memories surface → synaptic rewiring occurs → purpose shifts. Orientation anchored by 70 words (who/when/where). No lens drift; accumulative/textural pattern taught early ("moonlit canyon was a scar") and paid off at dawn.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Moonlit canyon color-shift anchors every beat; the cracked mirror itself becomes micro-setting that constrains angle adjustments and reweights at closure. Sensory triage—oil dust on fingers, ozone taste of ambition—narrows to POV priorities. "Ghostly schematic" overlay keeps spatial choreography legible. Environment supplies the literal debris she re-uses, tying setting to tactic change.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—unearth vs conserve abandoned dreams—signaled in first paragraph. One decisive tightening: she shifts from digger to conservator when mirror-multiplied heartache peaks; option to keep harvesting is foreclosed. Cost is felt viscerally ("weight was... clarifying") and conceptually (she now carries irretrievable soul-stuff). Pressure escalates via accumulating sensory fragments, not external antagonist—fitting accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of honoring failure emerges through mirrored refraction—literal cracked glass → metaphoric acceptance of flawed ambitions. No overt thesis; final image of leaving "with soul-stuff" reweights earlier scavenging. Subtext in father-napkin memory quietly equates her art/engineering split with the outpost’s dead city. Ambiguity remains: conservation may itself fail, inviting reflection without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tightly glued to Elara’s helix perceptions ("thoughts perpetually spiraling"). Syntax mirrors mood—long, winding sentences during diffuse memories, abrupt fragments at activation. No head-hop; inference remains character-bound ("she believed"). Distinct perceptual signature: smell of cold plasteel, taste of ozone ambition. Register consistent—technical diction ("synaptic plasticity") filtered through poetic sensibility.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Strong density: "moon climbed, bleaching the canyon bones white" performs atmosphere + time-passage simultaneously. Varied sentence cadence supports reverie without monotony. Minor mixed metaphor risk—"spider's web" plus "archaeologist" plus "museum"—but the through-line of excavation/conservation holds. No filter-verb clusters; props tracked cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: cracked periscope as neural diffraction grating turns salvage into memory archaeology. The entangled-memory premise could have felt generic, but grounding in funding-dead outpost and father-napkin sketch particularizes it. Reconfiguration from builder to conservator offers non-obvious payoff. Some phrasings skirt familiar poetic tropes ("moonlit canyon was a scar") yet accumulate new weight by closure.</comment>
