<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Interiority is lyrical and specific—her “calm defiance” is embodied in micro-choices (rolling dice, swaying into decryption). The mirrored arc with Thorne is felt, not told. Yet the emotional cost is slightly abstract; we see her resolve crystallize but the price (loss? exposure?) is implied rather than visceral.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each decryption step is a because/therefore advance culminating in the transfer that “lifts the burden.” Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the drive glowing warm in her pouch re-weights “encryption” from armor to language. The oceanic ascent image pays off the sunken anchoring without soft-reset.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Body-as-setting (the dice in palm, silt-covered desk) constrains action and charges the final image. Deep-sea twilight is filtered through her coder’s gaze—blue gloom is data, not décor. Spatial choreography stays clean in the single-location scene; only light omnipresent water threat, never generic.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—liberate the program—tightens via each cipher solved; the dice roll literally narrows possible seed phrases. Cost is conceptual: she absorbs Thorne’s fear architecture into herself. A sharper tangible loss (oxygen alarm? data corruption flicker?) would push higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: “strength is language, not fortress.” The dice and dance keep the concept embodied; no final-paragraph thesis states it. Ambiguity lingers—will the world misuse the tool?—inviting reflection without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Lyric third-person remains tight to Elara’s perceptual filters; syntax mirrors recursive code loops (“as a spider spins its web” twice = pattern taught). No head-hop; diction stays within her poetic-tech lexicon. Compression in peak beats (“her fingers flying… silken thread of light”) heightens tempo without clarity loss.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies: long sentences for sinking calm, fragment bursts for server boot-up. No loops or synonym churn; metaphor disciplined (“shattered mirror of sunlight” lands once). Information-dense: one sentence often does scene + atmosphere + tech detail. Only micro-slip: “perpetual twilight of the deep” is familiar phrasing.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Fusion of hacker thriller with aquatic gothic feels fresh; hangman’s dice as poetic cipher is a specific invention. Risk-taking in the “decryption via dance” could have collapsed into whimsy but stays grounded by因果 linkage to seed-phrase generation. Not quite a 9 only because the Thorne-mind-map premise faintly echoes familiar “uploaded psyche” tropes.</comment>
