<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elian’s guilt over the failed gambit is stated, not dramatized; the “single flawed gambit” never appears as a lived moment, so the forgiveness feels unearned. Interiority drifts into self-diagnosis (“he understood that the village was…his memory”) without embodied contradiction. Micro-choices (thread-pulling, labyrinth walk) track cleanly, but they register as symbolic busywork because the underlying mistake remains abstract.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the hush dissolves once he whispers self-forgiveness, a legible before/after. Yet the causal chain is thin—decoding tapestry threads never materially changes labyrinth options; insight alone restarts time. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern holds, but the lack of a concrete cost on the page keeps the reweighting cerebral rather than felt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The frozen village is rendered through selective, sense-filtered detail—dust motes locked mid-air, oaks welded in silence—creating an immediate micro-setting. Platinum labyrinth and tapestry function as extensions of Elian’s mind, constraining his tactile exploration. Spatial choreography stays coherent across cottage-to-square movement; weather cue (distant thunder) usefully tracks the accrual of pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—self-forgiveness—is signaled early, but pressure plateaus; each new beat (tapestry, labyrinth) merely reiterates the same interior task without narrowing options or raising price. No meaningful tightening: the labyrinth can be attempted whenever he chooses, and nothing is risked or forfeited in the attempt. Escalation is decorative rather than causal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Threads, labyrinth, and hush cohere around the idea that memory must be actively rewoven; theme emerges through image, not assertion. Final whisper supplies quiet resonance, though it leans therapeutic. Subtext stays implicit, but the lack of dramatized guilt limits complexity—there’s no counter-argument to forgive.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Third-limited voice maintains steady psychic distance; perceptual signature favors chess-derived metaphors that feel character-specific. Rhythm modulates with sentence length, supporting the hush-to-motion arc. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk is nil; prose stays consistent without register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Lines are clean, varied, and propel; only minor scaffold (“the woven hush was the sound…”) restates prior image. Figurative language is restrained, avoiding mixed metaphors. One paraphrase loop adjacent to labyrinth re-description deducts slightly; otherwise high density without clutter.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Frozen-memory village plus thread-decoding mechanic gives a fresh slant on the Guilt-Redemption arc. Premise is familiar, but specificity of chess-tutor perception and tactile tapestry work lifts it above template. Risk is moderate; no radical formal twist, yet integration feels organic.</comment>
