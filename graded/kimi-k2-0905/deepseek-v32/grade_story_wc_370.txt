<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Aris’s regret over the misfiling and his gentle re-shelving gesture embody contradictory impulses (guilt vs. hope) and yield a credible renunciation—leaving safety to speak of errors. Interiority stays concrete (“gentle apology” touch). Cost is visible: he forfeits lifelong anonymity. Yet empathy remains an asserted label more than a tested flaw; no moment shows him mis-reading someone under pressure, so the trait feels static rather than crucible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Causal chain is clean: past refusal → present concealment → hiding the index inside the very error → departure to confess. Closure is Earned Stasis: he forecloses the safety of the library with felt cost (“the library…held its breath”). Anchors (who/where/when) land by word 60; no orientation debt. One tightening beat suffices; lens holds.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Vaulted, shadow-draped reading room, pocket-softened edges of the invitation, and the vellum index between root-network pages give tactile, POV-filtered specificity. The library-as-archive-of-errors is learned through goal-directed action, not exposition. Environment does not physically constrain the final choice, so the 9+ gate fails, but atmosphere mirrors interior expansion effectively.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—rectify his catastrophic misfiling by protecting the library yet exposing its heart—tightens once when he slips the index into the treatise, narrowing options: he can no longer shield the archive personally. Cost is legible; escalation is micro but sufficient for 700 words. Coincidence absent; tension holds.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: errors as fertile seedbed for wisdom. The re-shelved treatise reweights “mistake” from shame to gift without moralizing. Final image of the tolling bell as “turning page” offers quiet conceptual repricing. No thematic echo or platitude intrudes; ambiguity remains rich.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person lingers in Aris’s hush—measured syntax, hushed diction, faint Latinate cadence suit librarian recluse. Perceptual signature sharp: he senses “loneliness in old texts.” No dialogue to test voice split; interior texture consistent. Rhythm modulates: longer sentences swell during tranquillity, contract at “gentle apology” beat. No head-hop or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm varies naturally; no template cadence or synonym loops. Figurative language sparse and coherent (“placid lake reflecting a sky full of stars”). High information density—each sentence advances motive, image, or causality. Passive voice rare and purposeful. Zero scaffolding; closing line earns sonic echo without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Library-of-mistakes is fresh; hiding the key inside the original error flips the “secret vault” trope. Empathetic recluse risking exposure offers nuanced inversion of introvert redemption arcs. Yet conceptual frame overshadows character surprise; risk is intellectual more than visceral. Particulars feel idiosyncratic enough to evade template charge.</comment>
