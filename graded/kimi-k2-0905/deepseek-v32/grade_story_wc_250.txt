<comment>Kael’s “silent empathy” remains abstract; no interior contradiction or embodied cost is shown while he teaches darkness. Micro-choices (tilting shutter, flicking mirror) are present but read as serene choreography rather than stakes-forcing decisions. The final “earned stasis” is tender yet unmotivated by any prior flaw or risk; the absence of personal price keeps motivation in the functional band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each adjusted shutter and mirrored star adds density until the darkness reciprocates, creating a Resonant Reconfiguration—darkness as collaborative canvas. Orientation is swift; causality is metaphoric but coherent. Closure lands with conceptual cost: guardian renounces further action, having ceded luminous control to the dark. The persistent constraint (darkness now holding stars) is legible in the final image.</comment>

<comment>Cobalt dock, wet planks, and dental mirror are tactile, selective, and filter through Kael’s quiet attention. Micro-setting works: the mirror’s angle and shutter slots physically constrain how light can be thrown, directly shaping the lesson. Weathered wood and saffron glow carry emotional tone without cataloguing. Spatial choreography is clean; no anchor drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—will the darkness accept the lesson?—is signaled early. Pressure deepens through each light-pattern added; the dark’s tendril contact is the single meaningful tightening that forecloses failure. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral: darkness gains purpose, guardian cements his passive role. Sufficient escalation for lyrical mode, but no tangible price weakens upper-band entry.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: value of light inheres in the dark that frames it. Final image of dark “resting, full and quiet” reweights prior imagery without moralizing. Subtext in cradled reflection and cooperative star-holding invites lingering ambiguity. No thematic echo or tidy maxim—resonance is earned through concrete particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited holds tight to Kael’s silent perception; diction stays within his calm lexicon. Prose rhythm is controlled, slightly breathless elongation matching spiraling focus. No head-hopping; perceptual signature evident in “spiralingly calm” and light-angles noticed. Filter verbs are minimal and justified.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm modulates naturally; high-density lines combine action, sensorium, and metaphor. Only minor scaffold: repeated “he” opener in two adjacent sentences. One mixed image—“a form of condensed gloom stirred”—is fleetingly abstract. Closure beat is clean, uncluttered, and propulsive.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Fantastical empathy lesson feels fresh because mechanism is mundane (shutters + dentist mirror) and Darkness is treated as melancholic student rather than foe. Conceptual risk—teaching an elemental force through star-patterns—pays off in cooperative closure. Could edge higher with a sharper personal cost.</comment>
