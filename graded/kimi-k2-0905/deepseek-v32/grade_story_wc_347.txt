<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Elara’s reluctant-caretaker premise is embodied in the opening sigh and the grim routine, but her “stubborn ember” motive is stated rather than dramatized until the very end; no contradictory impulse is shown under pressure, so the turn feels foregone rather than earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the nut’s shadow-arrow and quartz-flash assembly reweight her inheritance from burden to quiet purpose. Causal chain is thin—travelers escape because birds already obey lost code—but the lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds: each “impression” accrues until stance crystallizes with felt cost (she remains exiled in frost). Orientation is clear by word 80; no penalty.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Selective sensory filtering—“bitter fruit that whispered,” “brass wings caught the fading light”—roots us in Elara’s fatigued attention; the nut-quartz-bird triad functions as micro-setting that literally steers the final shortcut, meeting the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography stays clean across labyrinth moves.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—get strangers out before frost—tightens once via the night-clock. Agency is present (she places nut, hums slate, flashes quartz), but the travelers’ peril is off-stage; the cost paid is prospective loneliness, not an irreversible loss on the page, so escalation feels moderate rather than acute.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme of inherited duty versus quiet service emerges through the nut-shadow image; “graceless beauty” reprises at end to reconfigure ugliness into stewardship. No moral is stated; the whispering orchard and clicking birds accumulate a spare, chilly resonance that lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited clings to Elara’s perceptual bias—she reads grooves by feel, hears bird clicks as leys. Syntax is exact yet tired, mirroring her offhand precision; no register drift. One line of dialogue is utilitarian but voice-true.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>High information density: “offhandedly exact gesture,” “graceless beauty” repurposed, each sentence layers task + atmosphere. No loops, no mixed metaphor; the single optional intensifier “profoundly right” is earned by prior ugliness.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Fuses orchard-curse, clockwork birds, and non-contact guidance into a fresh mythic miniature; the blueprint-in-nut device feels novel yet inevitable. Risk is moderate—quiet lyric rather than bold formal experiment—but specificity keeps it from template territory.</comment>
