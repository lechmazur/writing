<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elara’s “listen don’t alarm” ethic is legible and consistent; the memory of city false-alarms roots it. Yet we never feel contradictory impulse—no flicker of doubt that might prickle skin or shorten breath—so the final act feels pre-decided. Interiority stays atmospheric (“the solstice hush followed like a cloak”) rather than embodied under pressure. She earns a quiet renunciation, but the cost is stated, not dramatized in body or relation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure is an Earned Stasis: she foregoes the siren and pays with solitary responsibility, signaled by the single bell toll that reconfigures valley expectations. Causal chain (micro-data → contradicts authority → chooses bell) holds; however, the bell rope is introduced late as symbolic exit rather than planted constraint, so the pivot feels convenient. Orientation is swift and coherent under Accumulative/Textural lens; hush and altitude taught early. Cost is conceptually visible but not felt in sensor or body, capping high-band entry.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The windblown sanctuary is economically anchored through barometer glue, narrow tower stairs, and bell-rope fibers that track wear. Micro-setting (rope texture, pressure gauge ink) constrains her final choice between lever and bell. Weather detail (“storm would likely fracture”) is filtered through tester priorities, not tourist catalog. Environment is more backdrop than active obstacle; storm split happens off-stage, limiting top band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve peace by calibrating warning—surfaces early and tightens when data contradicts zero-hour order. One meaningful deepening: regional authority demand vs personal instrumentation forces choice. Escalation is intellectual, not visceral; no tool failure, social backlash, or bodily risk raises cost. Bell toll narrows option space but consequence is reported (“people understood”), not dramatized, keeping pressure moderate.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—listening over noise—emerges through bell vs siren juxtaposition and microclimate accuracy, never sermonised. Final image reweights earlier “alarms cried wolf” memory with earned trust. Ambiguity lingers: she assumes risk alone, peace preserved but authority unchallenged. Resonance is quiet and particular; no pseudo-profundity, though symbolism of bell feels self-consciously placed.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Elara’s perceptual filter—pressure numbers, rope fiber, cathedral hush—without head-hop. Syntax is controlled, rhythm modulates between long hush-sentences and short tester notes. No dialogue, so voice is carried by texture; occasional poetic lift (“ballet of air”) edges toward writerly display but stays rare. Consistent modest diction fits humble technician stance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose is clean, loop-free, with purposeful repetition (“after the glue dried”) that threads time and resolve. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with escalating hush. No mixed metaphors; barometer, rope, bell handled tactilely. Occasional elevated phrase (“solstice hush”) risks ornament but remains legible; no artifacts obscure causality or closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Storm-siren tester is fresh vocational lens; bell-rope refusal flips customary disaster tropes. Micro-climate science versus institutional protocol supplies non-obvious tension. However, core beats—lonely watcher contradicts bureaucracy, chooses gentle warning—echo standard “individual vs system” arc without further twist. Specificity of altitude sanctuary and glue-dry timing adds local color but not transformative insight.</comment>
