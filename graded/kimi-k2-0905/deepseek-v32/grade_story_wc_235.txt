<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid—her jealousy of past selves is embodied in “a bitter pill” that “gnawed.” The causal arc from envy → empathy → integration is legible, but the final beat of “profound peace” is declared rather than dramatized with a micro-choice, softening cost. Meeting the 9+ quick test requires one visible forfeiture; instead she gains perspective without losing anything on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the grave shifts from terror to “marker in a story still being written,” reweighting time. Causal lens holds—because she writes the scroll, therefore she re-sequences selfhood. One minor scaffold: “She no longer felt chronologically confused” tells the change already shown. Cost is conceptual (mortality accepted) but not felt as concrete loss, keeping it below 9.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Cabin and valley are sketched with sensory economy—“logs weathered to silver,” “sharp and clean” air. Birch scroll functions as micro-setting that constrains the final act of writing. Spatial tracking is clean; no object teleporting. Environment does not force a tactical sacrifice, so capped below 8.8 for 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“distill chaos into narrative”—is signaled early. Escalation is textural: density of temporal images increases until the scroll absorbs them. Tightening occurs when jealousy melts into empathy, narrowing her stance. No visible price (lost option, forfeited object) is dramatized on the page, blocking 8.8+ entry.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of nonlinear selfhood emerges through image pattern (soaring, grave, scroll) rather than statement. Final reweighting—grave as story punctuation—offers resonant ambiguity. One soft echo: “jaded wonder” is named in closing line, slightly prising theme open. Overall, complexity is honored without tidy moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Voice is consistent lyric–reflective, with controlled rhythm (“feral nostalgia gripped her, a savage longing…”). Perceptual signature is character-specific: she notices organic textures, avoids digital. One filter-stack cluster (“she remembered dreams… memories now tasted of ash”) dulls immediacy. No head-hopping; POV stable.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence runs. Mixed metaphor check clean. One paraphrase loop: “She envied the Elara who… She envied even the future self…” restates within three lines. Figurative language is sparse under peak pressure, avoiding overwriting. Minor scaffold keeps it sub-8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Familiar trope—seeing one’s own grave—is freshened by lucid-dream chronicler using birch scroll to re-order time. Integration of “feral nostalgia” as visceral hunger rather than wistfulness adds bite. Risk is moderate; nonlinear self-envy structure is coherent but not boundary-pushing. Specific detail (birch scroll, aspens) grounds the concept.</comment>
