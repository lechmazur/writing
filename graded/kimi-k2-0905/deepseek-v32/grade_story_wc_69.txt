<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Alistair’s “expectantly resigned” posture is stated often but only once—presenting the rosette—does it surface as an embodied micro-choice. The choral members remain nameless, reducing relationship pressure; only the tenor–alto moment hints at crucible-level stakes. Interiority leans on abstract labels (“hopeful and weary”) instead of contradictory impulses shown in scene. No visible cost attaches to Alistair’s final smile, so the arc stays pleasant rather than urgent.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens is clear: subtracting noise → entwining voices → public concert. Orientation is swift; the velvet library and autumn timestamp anchor by line 3. Closure lands as Charged Poise: handing over the rosette crystallizes commitment with conceptual cost—harmony is fragile. However, no persistent constraint or price shadows Alistair after the concert; the ending feels resolved rather than foreclosed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Selective sensory detail—“amber light,” “old books and polished wood,” “bare branches”—filters through Alistair’s elegiac ear. The rosette functions as micro-setting, charging the finale when it is literally passed forward. Autumn’s encroaching cold and fading daylight subtly mirror communal song’s dwindling future, guiding stakes without overt symbolism. Spatial choreography stays loose because singers are never individuated on the page, preventing 9-band entry.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The dominant stake—can fragmented singers become one voice?—is signaled in paragraph one. Escalation is textural: each rehearsal thickens trust (hill soprano / city bass share smiles) until the public concert tests the braid. The tightening beat is the folk-tune entry exercise where tenor adjusts to alto—an on-page trade-off that dissolves prior scorn. Cost is communal, not personal; no single character forfeits a concrete want, keeping pressure under the 8-band ceiling.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the rosette’s evolving meaning: from lost craft → shared silence → communal pledge. Subtext resides in gesture—the tenor’s micro-pitch shift speaks louder than any apology. Final image (empty library echoing promise) offers resonant non-literal answer without moralizing. A slight echo of the prompt’s “unlearning hatred” phrase near the end keeps it from full 9+ integration.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited clings to Alistair’s musical ear; perceptual signature is auditory (“traveled stillness,” “noise stripped away”). Diction stays within a choir-master’s lexicon—no sudden academic drift. Rhythm modulates: long cadences for reflection, clipped fragments during rehearsal (“sing single notes, then chords”). No dialogue appears, so voice coherence rests on narrative texture alone, and it holds.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence detected. Figurative language is restrained—one amber / velvet layer per paragraph—so density never stalls momentum. Occasional elevated abstractions (“vanishing arts of communal song”) could be traded for tactile specifics, but they do not clog causality. A lone paraphrase loop—“across the weeks… across unlearning hatred”—drops the score a notch.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The “subtracting noise” rehearsal ethic reframes standard reconciliation tropes through musical negative space. The zither rosette—an obsolete ornamental fragment—becomes a fresh emblem of preservation versus progress. Ensemble harmony as antidote to sectarian grudges is familiar, yet the quiet public-library incubator and autumn’s dying light give it a distinct husk. Risk is moderate; fresher dialect or regional song detail could push originality higher.</comment>
