<question>1</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete—Jonas’s synesthetic longing for “the color of sound” sets a distinct POV filter—but the contradiction never complicates a live choice; the emergence of the library answers the longing without testing it, so the final stance arrives as gift, not earned cost. No micro-choice visibly forfeits an option; the key turns itself.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Causal line holds: lantern hush → compulsion → wreck-door → library → synesthetic payoff. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration: the gaslights now “sing” color, a perceptual irretrievably altered; the cost is felt as irrevocable solitude. No orientation drift; lens is Accumulative/Textural, pattern taught by repeating “hush” and gold. The −0.6 non-closure cap reflects the absence of a constraint or price that shapes tactics—luck, not agency, unlocks every turn.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Selective, salt-and-vellum detail is filtered through Jonas’s lamp-tuned eye; the library’s warped timber and glowing moss constrain movement and supply the perceptual payoff. Pier, tide, hull, and lectern track spatially; no white-room drift. Micro-setting (key tag) charges the final image by bridging hotel transience to eternal knowledge—meets 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—private longing to hear color—tightens once when the folio’s gold ribbon answers it, but escalation is passive: the door, key, and diagram appear without Jonas forcing or forfeiting anything. Cost is aesthetic, not tactical; pressure accumulates texturally rather than through narrowed options. Meets single meaningful deepening but lacks visible price that alters later moves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme of layered perception emerges organically from Jonas’s occupational synesthesia and the library’s light-sound vows; no moralizing. Final image reweights gaslight into silent music—conceptual repricing with felt loneliness. Subtext resides in the hotel tag’s transit echo versus the library’s permanence, but the Insight is slightly tidier than complex.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Voice is lamplighter-precise: “vault of stars,” “meteor hush,” rhythmic clause control mirrors lone nocturnal rhythm. Perceptual signature consistent—Jonas notices flame, glass, tide-lines, never tourist catalog. No dialogue, so no drift; free-indirect stays clean. Prose modulation breathes with the hush, then tightens at key turn—meets 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Ear-test passes: sentence rhythm varies, no template cadence, high info density—“gaslights seemed different” carries before/after weight in four words. One paraphrase loop: “solitary dance of flame and glass” / “quiet beauty” overlap conceptually, −0.2. No mixed metaphors, no scaffold. Closure line is crystalline, artifact-free, propels outward.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Synesthesia-as-mystic-key is familiar, but grounding it in a lamplighter’s work-night and a shipwreck library freshens the trope. Hotel key tag as mnemonic bridge between transit and eternity is specific; lanterns’ gold mapped to collective hope is non-obvious synthesis. Risk is moderate; reward coherent. Avoids pseudo-profundity by staying in concrete images.</comment>
