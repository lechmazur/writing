<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The mathematician’s interior contradiction—grim optimism, risk-averse daring—remains concrete in every beat: his hand never leaves the column while he destabilizes the world. Embodied memory (“the slick cold of the railing”) anchors motive; the dice micro-choice sequence shows hierarchy of values with visible cost. Final smile is earned because hesitation is literally re-staged and survived. Only the rival remains off-page, so status crucible is N/A—no deduction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the staircase’s hum changes character, proving his flaw is now internalized structure. Causal lens holds throughout—each proof alters the staircase’s pitch; the paradox roll is the irreversible trigger. Cost is legible in the three-heartbeat silence that returns the “crushing weight” as lived present. Orientation, transitions, and stakes are crystal; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The staircase is not backdrop but instrument: its railing measures frequency, its hum answers calculations, its central column anchors the dare. Micro-setting (ivory dice, chipped face) constrains the final probability experiment. Spatial choreography is flawless—hand on column, dice on step, abyss below. Environment literally re-tunes after the proof, charging the exit image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—capture the texture of missed opportunity—is signaled in paragraph one and tightened when he risks collapse to reproduce the hesitation. Paradox roll is the decisive escalation that forecloses safety; silence delivers the visceral cost. No coincidence; rupture is authored. Persistent constraint: the staircase now carries his flaw forever.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from iterative structure: infinity + flaw = lived regret. No abstract statement—meaning accrues through tactile returns (cold rail, upright die). Final re-tuned hum is the non-literal answer: understanding does not liberate, it re-weights the cage. Ambiguity lingers—was the rupture worth it?—without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is mathematically precise yet haunted: “a machine that fed on its own descent.” Perceptual signature selects harmonics, lemmas, stress points—never generic gothic cadence. Compression is taught early (“grim optimist”) and paid off in the final thin crack of a smile. No head-hop, no register drift; even the dice roll is narrated as equation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances either equation or sensation. Rhythm accelerates into the stutter, then decelerates for the three heartbeats—syntax mirrors machine hesitation. Metaphors are spare and consistent (staircase as engine, dice as variables). No scaffold, no filter stacks; high information density without purple strain.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Infinite-regret staircase as physics lab is fresh; the dice-scar variable turning topology into autobiography is non-obvious synthesis. Risk—rupturing one’s universe for a memory texture—heightens stakes without gimmick. Every element is irreplaceable: only the chipped die can breach probability. Feels inevitable in hindsight, yet unforeseeable on first line.</comment>
