<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Ero’s calm, centuries-worn resolve is rendered through embodied micro-choices—cradling the arrowhead, syncing finger-skims to bone—so the final stillness feels earned. Interiority stays concrete (“shiver of historical reverence,” “weathered resolve solidified”) without label-speak. The only restraint: we never glimpse contradictory impulse; his serenity is monolithic, so the arc is less a change than a confirmation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: the arrowhead’s discordant hum → flock-pattern reading → harmonic convergence delivers a single tightening that reweights meaning. Closure is a Charged Poise: the canyon’s voice absorbs the pulse, Ero’s own pulse now tuned, cost legible in “part of the canyon’s permanent voice.” Orientation and causality hold; no loops or amnesia.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Canyon of petrified leviathan ribs is sketched with ruthless economy: “soft, grey blanket,” “slit of sky,” “living inkblot” swifts—each detail either guides Ero’s attention or becomes a resonator. The bone tower literally acts as the sounding board that completes the arrowhead’s chord, so environment constrains the final tactic. Spatial choreography is immaculate across one seated scene.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“learn to navigate without moving”—tightens when the wandering pulse threatens the canyon’s harmonic order. One deepening: realizing the pulse seeks harmony, not a target, reframes appraisal into co-creation. Cost is the irreversible absorption of the pulse into the canyon’s voice, foreclosing Ero’s private ownership of the answer. Agency全程在場，因果鏈無斷裂。</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as the paradox that homecoming is possible only when one surrenders motion and lets the world complete the song. Subtext dwells in the arrowhead’s shift from weapon to tuning fork—violence re-cast as connection. Final chord image reweights every prior echo without moralizing. No platitudes; the idea stays rooted in bone, dust, and flock geometry.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited maintains steady psychic distance; diction (“harmonic stone skimmer,” “petrified forest”) is precise yet archaic, mirroring Ero’s vocation. Rhythm modulates: long sentences for canyon breath, staccato fragments at harmonic convergence. No head-hop, no filter-verb clutter; perceptual signature is consistently his—listening skin, not seeing eyes.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, lyrical, loop-free; figuratives are sparse and purposeful (“living inkblot,” “slice time”). Information density high—each sentence advances resonance or stakes. One hairline slip: “centuries of layered dust had settled here” is repeated almost verbatim; minus 0.1. Closure beat remains crystalline.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Transforms familiar “lonely artifact” trope into a tonal-mythic key where navigation equals sonic completion. Leviathan-bone canyon + harmonic skimming feels singular, not checklist quirky. Risky stillness-as-climax commits fully and lands. The synthesis of flock pattern-reading and stone resonance yields a fresh spiritual physics.</comment>
