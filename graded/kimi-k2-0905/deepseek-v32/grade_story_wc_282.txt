<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Arin’s role as “sensory map maker” supplies a concrete lens, but interiority stays flat: “motivation solidified” is summary, not embodied contradiction. No micro-choice under pressure—Arin floats, the fossil glows, the map completes without a visible cost paid or path foreclosed. The final stance repeats the opening goal; no new hierarchy of values is tested.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Closure is a quiet Conceptual Repricing: the finished map reweights the world for post-hibernation humans. Causality, however, is loose—“the fossil began to glow” triggers floating and visions without prior rules taught. Orientation is clear early, but escalation is accumulative/textural only; no tightening beat narrows options or raises cost, so the lens holds but feels thin.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Salt-cool air, dripping silence, and stone altar are selectively vivid; the cave behaves like a body whose pulse Arin reads. The elm fossil and floating spring function as micro-setting objects that constrain perception and finally charge the map-image. Spatial choreography stays clean; no geography drifts. Meets the 9+ gate: the fossil’s glow and spring’s anti-gravity directly shape the closing image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade>
<comment>A single dominant stake—giving voice to forgotten emotions—is signaled early, yet pressure stays flat. Each new chamber adds wonder but no trade-off; the fossil’s activation is gift, not test. No visible price is exacted; tactics never alter. Escalation is purely additive display rather than narrowing of options or rising cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Theme—memory as communal anchor—emerges through the fossil’s conduction of joy and the final map as survival guide. Subtext is modest: cave silence vs. stored emotion creates useful tension. No moral is stated; the ending image invites reflection. Yet the insight feels gently asserted rather than wrested through costly choice.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays consistent, with calm affect matching the hush of the caves. Syntax repeats “Arin verb-ed” openings, producing a lull cadence that suits float but flattens urgency. Perceptual signature is present—heat-map palette guides what is noticed. No dialogue to test voice distinction; interior diction remains uniform.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, free of loops or scaffold; sentences breathe and advance. Occasional stacked modifiers (“factually mystical artifact”) edge toward abstract velvet without muddling. Rhythm is steady; more variance could heighten the float climax. No artifact touches closure; clarity stays intact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Emotional cartography after species-wide hibernation feels fresh; the fossil-as-conduit and anti-gravity spring literalize memory in ways not seen elsewhere. Tropes of post-apocalyptic rediscovery are tilted toward felt geography rather than survivalist grit. The concept commits fully; risk lies in gentleness rather than bold structural gamble.</comment>
