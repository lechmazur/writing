<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Aris’s claustrophobia and prudent-adventurous contradiction are shown through micro-choices (steady breath, calculated step) and embodied dread; the final “memory, not a master” moment is earned by the organ ordeal. Interiority stays concrete, avoiding label-speak until one soft “his claustrophobia spiked”—a forgivable slip. No second character on page, so status tests are waived. Meets 9- gate for earned change with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the “key” reweights from physical artifact to perceptual rebellion, cost legible in the laugh that dissolves fear. Causal chain (compass → organ note → spatial mutiny → doorway) holds; no teleporting props. Orientation anchored by word 80. One minor loop: “wistful rebellion” is named thrice; doesn’t touch climax. Lens (Hybrid→Accumulative at end) stays coherent.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Starlit nexus, derelict chapel, organ pipes as “jagged teeth” are selective, sensory, and filter through Aris’s explorer gaze. The compass-as-micro-setting constrains his final step; environment breathes with the mutiny, charging the closure image. Spatial choreography clean: floor tilts, walls pulse, distances track. Meets 9- gate by tying setting to final tactic.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—find the lost key—faces one tightening: the key is immaterial, forcing a perceptual surrender under crushing walls. Escalation rides the organ chord; each wave raises spatial cost, foreclosing retreat. Protagonist agency is attention, not escape; price is visceral dread transmuted into awe. Sufficient for length; cost legible on page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme—discovery through perceptual rebellion—emerges from the organ-driven spatial mutiny rather than assertion. The returning “wistful rebellion” reweights at closure, linking personal fear to cosmic shift. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in the hanging note. Minor drift: phrase is named more than shown late, keeping it under 9.0.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Aris’s perceptual filter: syntax lengthens under awe, shortens under dread. Diction (“pewter sky,” “spatial mutiny”) is controlled, never purple. No dialogue, so voice contamination absent. Patterned repetition of “wistful rebellion” is intentional but slightly overripe; still coherent at close.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Rhythmic variety, strong verbs, no scaffold loops; metaphors stay physical and consistent. One mixed image: “void felt solid” is momentarily abstract yet paid off by pulsing walls. Information density high; each sentence layers setting, sensation, and concept. No artifacts touch the final beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>“Spatial mutiny” via church-organ reverberation is a fresh speculative hinge; the compass-as-attention device repurposes a classic explorer prop. Claustrophobia-transcendence arc is familiar but made specific through sonic architecture. Risk in lyric abstraction pays off without clarity loss. Slight echo of House of Leaves conceit, but transformed by compressed scale and earned closure.</comment>
