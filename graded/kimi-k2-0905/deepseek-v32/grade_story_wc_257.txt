<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Silas’s grief is palpably embodied; the locked locket of ash condenses his motive. The origami trail forces a credible micro-choice chain—each coordinate accepted is a self-willed step toward re-engagement. The final act of giving the ring shows earned endurance: he does not relinquish sorrow but weaponizes it as craft, paying the cost of exposure. Interior contradiction—yearning for endings yet fearing their finality—remains active in-scene, satisfying the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the dawn projection on the client’s wrist reconfigures both their stances without curing grief. Causality holds—each origami set-up pays off in the observatory vision that directly seeds the palladium ring design. The lens is Causal: “because” he learns decay is generative, “therefore” he forges and delivers the ring, foreclosing his anonymity. Cost is legible in that very surrender of invisibility under the inferred lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Key objects—the bench, vellum stencil, botanical-garden shimmer—double as micro-settings that constrain movement and focal length. Sensory triage favors touch and reflected light, matching a jeweler’s eye. The “dust-choked rooms” anchor time elapsed since last commission, integrating atmosphere with stake. Palladium ring acting as portable observatory charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ constraint test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can Silas convert private grief into shared solvency—emerges by paragraph two and tightens when he decides to step through the “curtain.” Escalation is one-directional but sufficient: refusal of orders → origami lure → observatory revelation → ring fabrication → dawn delivery, each stage foreclosing retreat. Visible price: surrender of anonymity and exposure of his craft to daylight. Under Causal lens, the tightening is clean and protagonist-driven.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme—decay as generative craft—emerges through the living/ skeletal vine and is never sermonized. Subtextual coup: the woman’s wrist becomes temporary skin, echoing tattoo without ink, showing grief can mark yet not scar permanently. The owl coordinates reframes “Illuminate” from command to communal projection, reweighting prior beats. Final image avoids moral, offering resonant ambiguity about whether light heals or merely reveals.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person intimate maintains jeweler’s perceptual signature: light is grain, texture is moral. Rhythm modulates—long sentences for meditative beats, staccato when parcels appear. Figurative control: “genuinely artificial solemnity” is self-aware without slipping into diagnostic jargon. No head-hop; compression in observatory passage is taught by earlier celestial coordinates, keeping elision legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; dual-purpose lines (“coaxed light from onyx and fire from rubies”) weld craft lore to metaphor. No synonym loops or template cadence; varied sentence openings sustain ear. One mixed image—“veins of starlight”—but occurs in low-pressure beat. Closure image remains clear, unmuddied by ornament, staying within 9-range.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Mourning-jewelry maker undergoing reverse apprenticeship to grief is fresh; origami star-chart messages innovate the mysterious mentor trope. Conceptual risk—observatory as perceptual nexus—pays off by reframing craft as cosmic cartography. Specific detail (palladium vs. platinum reflectivity) prevents abstraction. While “learning to bloom again” arcs toward familiar redemption, the execution via projected skin-template avoids stock imagery.</comment>
