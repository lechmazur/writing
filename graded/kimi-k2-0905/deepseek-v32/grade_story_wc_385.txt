<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation is lucid and thematically braided to every beat; her micro-choice to release Kael’s echo is embodied (“heart full of reed-blown melancholy”) and costs her the comforting illusion that every story can be saved. Interiority stays concrete—sound on stone, warmth in shell—without therapy-speak. The flaw driving error is missing: she succeeds too cleanly, so the renunciation feels pre-ordained rather than wrested from contradictory impulses. Still, the arc lands as credible Earned Stasis because the text lets the silence after Kael’s fade ache on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the nexus remains “a bridge, not a prison” and Elara’s new song reweights her prior obsessive collection of echoes. Causal chain holds—shell clues → progressive disclosure → conscious release—though escalation is gentle accretion rather than sharp reversals. Orientation is anchored by line 3 and stays coherent through one continuous scene. The cost is felt (“she sang a new song…of release”) but could be sharper if a concrete external consequence (lost tool, exhausted voice) had been grafted on.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Canyon walls, starlight angles, and shell texture filter through Elara’s sound-oriented perception, giving micro-setting muscle. Weather is absent, but chill stone and “reed-blown” wind suffice for atmospheric shorthand. Spatial choreography is simple—hand on wall, shell to ear—yet tracks cleanly. Setting enforces the climax: the labyrinth must accept her song or keep Kael tangled, so environment does tactical work.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—free Kael without chaining future echoes—emerges mid-scene and sharpens into one irrevocable choice. Pressure escalates by accretion: each shell-whispered fragment tightens moral cost of possession vs. release. No external antagonist appears; tension is situationally internal, fitting lyric design. Final renunciation forecloses the option to “preserve every echo,” satisfying the tightening test.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Theme—stories must be heard, then let go—surfaces through action, never lecture. Motifs (echo, web, shell) recur only when they gate choice, culminating in the charged image of “echo that returned…of peace.” Ambiguity lingers: will Elara’s own voice echo someday? The refusal to answer reweights prior material without moralizing. A hairline slip: “unfinished emotions” edges toward thesis-statement, but is saved by its placement before the final cadence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays locked to Elara’s sensorium; diction is acoustically tuned (“serpentine nexus,” “needle starlight”). Syntax lengthens and shortens with breathing cadence of song. No dialogue to fracture voice. Reed-blown melancholy saturates every clause, yet modulates—wonder, urgency, solemn release—without register drift. Near-9 control, just shy because one clause (“webs were not of silk but of sound”) over-explains an image already shown.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is rhythmically alive, sentences do double duty (image + pressure), and no filler verbs clog forward motion. Mixed metaphors are avoided; vehicles stay sonic. Minor scaffold: repeated “echo” as noun and verb in adjacent lines dulls edge once. No artifact touches the final release, so momentum stays intact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>The acoustic after-life premise feels fresh, avoiding stock ghost tropes by tying haunting to listener consent. Specificity—canyon slots, shell half, reed timbre—grounds the concept so it couldn’t transplant unchanged. Risk is moderate: quiet lyric arc instead of thriller beats, but coherence justifies the choice. Missing a bolder speculative twist or unforeseen rule-reveal that would push it into 9 territory.</comment>
