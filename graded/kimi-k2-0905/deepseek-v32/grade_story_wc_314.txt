<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Anya’s interior contradiction—formal alchemist vs. secret petal-keeper—remains embodied in every beat; the micro-choice to “pour that feeling, raw and uncalculated, into the flame” visibly fuses her poles and costs her the crystal. Sentiment is never label-speak; it’s pressed into action. The arc lands in earned stasis: she keeps the harmonized world inside her, not as trophy but as charge. Could push higher if secondary pressure (mentor memory) had on-page teeth beyond one quoted line.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the pearl-bloom rewrites the tree’s possible states and makes the fusion irreversible. Causal chain (crystal → starling pattern → white flame → blossom) holds without teleported props; each link is cued and paid. Orientation locked by line 5; no lens drift. Persistent constraint: the crystal’s gone—no rewind possible—so cost stays legible at final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The kaleidoscopic waterfall is not backdrop; it supplies the prismatic light that focuses through the crystal and ignites the tree. Micro-setting (barefoot on moss, damp bark) channels heat transfer and anchors flame distance. Spatial choreography remains coherent across the single continuous scene. Environment directly shapes the final transformation—meets 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—harmonize logic/intuition—tightens once: the crystal must be sacrificed to achieve fusion, foreclosing safe retention. Pressure is accumulative/textural: density of light, flock, and memory layers until the white-flame beat crystallizes the trade-off. No external antagonist needed; the internal contradiction supplies sufficient friction. Cost is visible (loss of crystal, irreversible bloom) but could feel sharper if a concrete external risk (orchard vulnerability) had been seeded.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through image pattern—lattice vs. murmuration—never named as thesis. Final pearl-blossom reweights both crystal geometry and flock unity into a new organic form, leaving ambiguity: is fusion stability or mutation? Subtext in the mentor’s “ignition point” line carries latent warning that lingers after bloom. No moralizing, clean lyric resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person perceptual signature is tight, alchemical: “a captured breath of the world, a perfect lattice of water and cold.” Diction stays within Anya’s lexicon; no filter-verb clusters. Rhythm accelerates into short clauses at white-flame contact, then relaxes into blossom release—effective psychic distance shift. No dialogue to test, yet voice remains distinctive under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty: “The crystal in her hand was the logical component, a structured gem of pure process” seeds both theme and prop state. No paraphrase loops; metaphors stay coherent (lattice, flock, ignition). Strong verbs (“swept upward,” “unfurled”) replace modifiers. Zero artifacts in final third—clears 9+ bar.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Fusion of algorithmic starling swarm with alchemical dew-crystal feels non-obvious and inevitable in hindsight. Risk taken: quiet lyric climax over explosive spectacle, but blossom reconfiguration pays off. Orchard-behind-waterfall frame is fresh yet not gimmicky; specificity (“silver-barked apple tree”) prevents generic fantasy slide. Transformation test passes—story collapses without exact elements.</comment>
