<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elm’s interiority is concrete—still hands, cracked stone, charcoal sketching the ribbon-map—yet the decisive shift from “isolate sorrow” to “weave love” is stated more than dramatized; the moment he lifts the mallet feels earned but the emotional cost is soft, keeping him shy of the 9-band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the charcoal drawing of the woven poems visibly forecloses the single-stone option and re-tools his vocation; the Accumulative/Textural lens holds from first chisel-echo to last butterfly whisper, with the ribbon roll pattern taught early and repriced at the end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Greenhouse glass, dusk color, and butterfly river are selective and mirrored in Elm’s narrowed attention; the cracked panes and spectral light literally guide his decision to draw rather than carve, satisfying the 9-band test of setting constraining choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—find the living form of grief—tightens when the ribbon map reweights the task; pressure escalates via Accumulative density (each poem adds strand-tension) rather than causal reversals, but the felt price is legible in the cracked child-stone he must now abandon.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges without motto: grief is a living weave, not a block. The butterfly migration and poem-threads accumulate into a Conceptual Repricing that redefines memorial art; no moralizing line mars the final image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person POV stays tight to Elm’s perceptual filter—chisel as thunder, ribbon colors as “dusty sunset”—with lyrical compression taught by the opening sentence and held to the last butterfly-wing wind; no head-hop or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet breatheable—“a river of orange and black flowing ceaselessly past the glass” does triple sensory work; one mixed metaphor (“worked stone in a thundering calm”) is forgiven because it inaugurates the tonal pattern that pays off.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The ribbon-roll-as-grief-map feels fresh, and pairing it with butterfly migration avoids familiar memorial tropes; risk is moderate—lyric ghost mentor而非plot twist—but specificity of family poems keeps it from feeling recycled.</comment>
