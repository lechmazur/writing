<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s burnished sorrow and poetic lens are consistently embodied—her micro-choice to veil the mirror during the storm crystallizes her contradictory impulses. The interior contradiction between scholarly rigor and aesthetic mysticism is dramatized, not declared. The final renunciation (publishing the elegiac treatise) is earned by the prior ritual beat and carries visible cost in her aged reflection. Competence is balanced with genuine epistemic risk; no safety-hedging.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the shard reframed as “map of a world that had loved deeply” reweights the entire premise under Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality is lyric rather than plot-centric—each descriptive layer thickens the stake until the mirror-veil act tightens meaning. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are taught by word 60; no debt incurred. Cost is unmistakable: “her eyes held a new clarity” after the storm’s temporal erosion.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The baroque asteroid is not backdrop but instrument: the visible-time storms and silver-vine mirror frame directly shape the ritual that produces the new reading of the shard. Micro-setting—the shard’s fracture lines glowing “like veins of gold”—charges the final image and constrains her interpretive choice. Spatial choreography is clean; storm-light and mirror cloth track believably. Sensory hierarchy honors POV: Elara notices filigree, script, velvet texture, never tourist-catalog excess.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—redeeming a civilization’s beauty—signals early and tightens through the mirror-ritual discovery. Escalation is accretive: each descriptive pass reweights the same shard until the final reimagining forecloses Dr. Kellor’s utilitarian reading. No coincidence; pressure is purely epistemic and aesthetic. Price is legible: her own face aged by the storm she invited in exchange for insight.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulate imagery—dust, fracture-lines, velvet, storm-light—never abstract assertion. The final image answers the thematic question (how to live with visible decay) by reframing breakage as cartography of love. Subtext operates in gesture: covering the mirror = refusal to let temporal decay dominate aesthetic memory. No moralizing; the elegiac tone is earned, not declared.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person POV remains tightly anchored to Elara’s perceptual signature—filigree, script, temporal haze—without head-hopping. Psychic distance contracts under storm pressure: clauses shorten, images stack like strata. Diction stays within her poetic lexicon; no corporate register drift. Rhythm modulates: languid cadence in study, staccato beats during temporal gusts.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is high-density lyric without purple overload: each sentence advances image or stakes. No paraphrase loops; “burnished sorrow” recurs twice but reweights meaning at closure. Metaphors are coherent—time as amber waves, shard as map—never mixed. Filter verbs minimal; strong verbs (“cradled,” “lashed,” “glowed”) propel. Opening and closing lines are image-anchors, not scaffolding.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: baroque asteroid + visible time + mirror ritual to reframe archaeology via aesthetic mysticism. The shard-as-map reconfiguration feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Risk—lyric escalation rather than plot reversals—heightens coherence without obscuring closure. No trope recycling; the theocracy-versus-beauty dispute is inverted through poetic material culture.</comment>
