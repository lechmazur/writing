<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Kael’s mythic solitude and century-scarred laughter are vivid, but his interiority never cracks under the single on-stage pressure beat; the “shadowed elation” is declared, not embodied in micro-choice. The moment he might have faltered—seeing the reef surface—passes in summary, so the cost feels managed rather than paid in muscle or breath.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The accumulative/textural lens is declared early (“otherworldly routine”) and holds: each ritual micro-movement layers density until the beam’s final re-pricing of the seascape. Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the softened beam and cooling wick make the dawn’s altered geography undeniable, with the conceptual cost of ancient shadows now surfacing to future sailors.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The emerald stone’s inner pulse, the silica wick’s cool perfection, and the star-washed tower are selective, POV-filtered details that constrain every tactical micro-tilt of the lens. The lighthouse itself functions as micro-setting: its mineral glow and stair vibration physically steer Kael’s hand motions and decide the storm’s final geometry.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>One dominant stake—reshape the sea with ancestral storm-force—tightens through sensory cadence shifts rather than causal reversals. The beam’s incremental re-angling is the visible price that forecloses the option to simply warn ships, turning the reef’s exposure into the irreversible trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Renewal-through-ancient-danger emerges organically from the image-chain of surfacing stone and scrubbed air, never sermonized. The final soft gleam reweights the earlier “ancient shadows” from menace to fertilizer, achieving Conceptual Repricing without moral abstract.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The prose’s tidal syntax—long rolling clauses that break into staccato lens-clicks—mirrors Kael’s storm-breath cadence. “Laughing storm herald” becomes a percussive motif whose rhythm modulates from gale-peal to quiet satisfaction, keeping perceptual signature intact under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Almost no scaffold; every sentence either advances the ritual or re-specifies the glass-light physics. The single micro-loop—“total internal reflection” repeated twice—earns its echo because the second instance is embedded in the closing image, crystallizing the mechanic as the new seascape’s law.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The fusion of meteorological physics with mythic storm-herding feels inevitable yet fresh; the lighthouse is reborn as an optical plough, not mere warning device. Risk lies in the lyric repetition of “ancient shadows,” but the payoff—the reef’s surfacing—justifies the gamble and anchors the concept.</comment>
