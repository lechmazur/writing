<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Leo’s “quietly analytic” nature is consistently embodied in micro-choices—how he lifts the snow globe, deciphers the captain’s equation, and decides to surface the globe—so interiority is concrete. The contradiction between scientific detachment and emotional surrender is dramatized, not stated, culminating in the earned renunciation of “stop solving for holding on.” No therapy-speak; flaws (intellectualized avoidance) complicate the final act. Missing a second on-page character, so relationship crucible and status dynamics are N/A; single-POV depth is sufficient for 600-word scope.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the crystalline image of Leo ascending with the snow globe reconfigures meaning—letting go becomes a buoyant transmission, not surrender. Causal chain holds: discovery of equation → recognition of parallel to Earhart → decision to surface globe → final journal line. Orientation is anchored by word 80 (“His submersible glided…”). The lens is Accumulative/Textural: density of mirrored “last transmissions” and watery imagery tightens until the cadence lifts. Cost is felt: he relinquishes the need to solve grief, embodied in the globe’s promised return.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The snow globe functions as micro-setting that constrains the final choice—its fragility dictates protective casing and the promise to return it, charging the ascent image. Sensory selection is POV-filtered: “leather-bound volumes drifted like sleepy fish” reflects the explorer’s analytic, oceanic gaze. Spatial choreography is flawless—submersible, desk, globe, log tracked without drift. Paris-in-miniature inside the globe mirrors Leo’s internal “physics of letting go,” re-weighted at closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—understand letting go—is signaled in para 1 and tightens when the captain’s equation reframes release as calculated ascent. One meaningful deepening: the globe shifts from artifact to daughter’s unpaid promise, forcing Leo’s decision to surface it. Agency is intellectual (documentation, decision to return globe) yet forecloses the path of perpetual analysis. Cost is conceptual but legible: he gives up the safety of unsolved loss.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from concrete parallels: Earhart’s fuel exhaustion ↔ captain’s buoyancy sketch ↔ Leo’s analytic surrender. No explicit moral; final line “stop solving for holding on” reprices the premise. Sophisticated melancholy is sustained yet modulates—pressure of depth lifts into buoyant ascent image. Ambiguity lingers: is release calculable or incalculable? Answer held in charged poise.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is distinct—compressed, maritime-philosophic diction (“first-name basis with death,” “library of let goings”). Rhythm accelerates under pressure then relaxes into final cadence. No dialogue, so dialogue bullets N/A. Free indirect style clean; no filter-verb clutter. Perceptual signature consistent: Leo notices angles, equations, flotation, not touristic detail.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>High information density: single sentences advance atmosphere, character, theme (“To let go is to calculate the angle of ascent”). Figurative language is patterned, not crowded—extended metaphor of transmission/buoyancy holds. No loops or scaffold; paragraph cuts are purposeful. Opening and final lines serve as anchor and resonant send-off.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Fusion of deep-sea exploration with metaphysics of grief feels fresh; “sunken ship library” and globe-as-daughter’s-promise are specific, irreplicable images. Risk in lyric accumulation pays off—repetition of “last transmission” becomes inevitable refrain. Not derivative; avoids familiar “missing plane” tropes by focusing on after-echo rather than mystery.</comment>
