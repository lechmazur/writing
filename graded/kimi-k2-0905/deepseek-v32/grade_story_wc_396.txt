<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is consistently shadow-tinted and calm; the crystal fragment’s warming mirrors her shift from burden to wisdom. No contradictory impulses play out in scene—she absorbs, then acts—so the “earned cost” bar wobbles. Still, her micro-choice to project shared visions instead of repairing the shard crystallizes her values and visibly costs her the anonymity she kept among the factions.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Causal through-line holds: grinding ice → mirror quest → vision → joint rescue; each beat narrows options. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—the shard stays broken but its projected empathy reweights the conflict rule-set with undeniable social cost. The 120-word anchor is met; orientation never wobbles. One scaffold loop (“the fragment warm in her palm” echoed twice) slightly dulls the final beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Orchard, cliff, ice, and mirrors are filtered through Elara’s twilight-biased attention; every detail either guides her path or mirrors internal state. The tarnished cheval glass physically constrains her stance and focal length in the pivotal vision, nudging the climax. Sensory hierarchy favors silver/white tones and hushed sounds, compressing under crisis. Enough environmental pressure to merit high-band, but not quite charging the final image beyond 8.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Single dominant stake—prevent orchard–ice violence—signaled early and tightened when the floes grind. Middle beat (final mirror) forces a trade-off: absorb collective pain or perpetuate silence. Protagonist agency drives every escalation; luck merely complicates. Cost is visible: she relinquishes secrecy and shoulders communal grief in front of both sides.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme—“peace requires shared fear, not silence”—emerges through mirrored childhood loneliness rather than assertion. Subtext resides in the shard’s refusal to reseal: healing is relational, not mechanical. Final projection offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. One soft “thematic echo” line (“true reconstitution is always of the heart”) nearly slips into preach but is salvaged by its placement after the decisive action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Third-limited clings tightly to Elara’s calm, shadow-laced perceptual filter; diction stays muted and twilit. No dialogue appears, so voice rests on syntax: restrained clauses, tactile verbs (“walked,” “traced,” “raised”). One filter-verb cluster (“she understood now,” “she felt”) slightly thins immediacy. Rhythm breathes with scene tempo—longer sentences for orchard mists, clipped fragments as shard ignites.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong read-aloud rhythm; sentence openings vary, paragraphs trim. Occasional scaffolding (“These glimpses were pieces of a puzzle…” restates prior sentence) and a mixed metaphor (“woven with strands of darkness…like a second skin” beside “shadow-laced”) slightly blur texture. No loops touch the closure beat. Information density is high; every sentence advances stakes or atmosphere.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Familiar peacekeeper trope is re-angled through “vintage mirrors as empathy engine” and the refusal to physically restore the MacGuffin. Specificity of orchard–ice sociology and the inversion of reconstitution give the piece its own fingerprint. Risk in choosing reflective, low-dialogue lyric mode pays off under accumulative lens. Transformation test passes: swap shard for generic amulet and the emotional reweighting collapses.</comment>
