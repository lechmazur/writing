<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The prophet’s compulsion-to-instrument conversion is viscerally embodied in every strike of the mallet; her interiority (“salt and wind,” “charcoal ghost”) is concrete, character-specific, and internally contradictory. No secondary character appears, so relationship/status bullets are waived; the single POV sustains pressure via micro-choices (tap, trace, listen) that escalate cost. The final renunciation—placing the mallet to her ribs—earns Earned Stasis with visible cost: the orchard now plays without her, foreclosing her further control. Flaw: the motive never complicates or meets a genuine counter-impulse; the drive is monolithic, slightly flattening the arc.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a crystalline Charged Poise: the struck white log reconfigures all prior harmonics into a coherent chord, felt in the glowing air and the prophet’s rib-echo—cost is unmistakable. Causal linkage holds: because she maps each tree’s resonance, therefore the final master tone can unify them. Orientation is taught early (“blue hour,” “driftwood circle”) and pays off in the glowing final image. No teleporting props or causal amnesia; the mallet’s worn felt, the visible sketched resonance, and the orchard’s hum all track cleanly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The floating orchard is not backdrop but instrument: every creak, root, and overtone constrains and enables the prophet’s tactics. The white driftwood log’s bleached grain becomes the sounding board that enforces the final chord; its physical state (sun-cracked, salt-etched) directly charges the closure image. Micro-setting rule satisfied: the orchard’s wooden circle functions as tool and environment, dictating where she can stand and strike. Sensory hierarchy is biased to her craft—sound and touch dominate over visual cataloguing—keeping detail purposeful and urgent.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—turn the obstacle-island into an instrument—is signaled in paragraph 2 and tightened when the “restless euphony” demands resolution. One meaningful escalation: the shift from scattered resonances to the “Root Chorus” that yearns for a conductor, forcing her final master stroke. Cost is visible: the orchard’s song now exceeds her control, leaving her in attentive stasis. Under accumulative/textural lens, the density of harmonic patterns reweights the stake; no coincidence resolves the pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges obliquely: creation as surrender—once the grove sings itself, the maker must fall silent. The returning image of the mallet against ribs reweights the earlier “activator” idea into a metronome of her own obsolescence. No explicit thesis; the final star-pinprick of frequency offers conceptual repricing without moralizing. The notion that art outlives artist is felt, not stated, satisfying the non-literal answer requirement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is lyric, compressed, and pattern-taught: the fractal syntax of “tap–listen–sketched resonance” repeats like a musical phrase, legible by midpoint. Perceptual signature is cult-specific—clouds as notation, salt-bleached tunic, charcoal ghost—never drifting into generic mysticism. Psychic distance tightens under pressure: clauses shorten as the final strike approaches, mirroring the narrowing harmonic focus. No head-hopping or register drift; the elevated diction (“euphony,” “fractal generating”) is earned by the prophet’s cosmological vocation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances mapping, sound, or atmosphere. Metaphors are internally coherent—cloud notation, charcoal ghost, root chorus—never mixed or contradictory. High information density: one sentence can deliver time-of-day, tactile strike, and visible after-ring. Rhythm modulates from languid indigo cadence to the single decisive blow, propelling closure without overwrought stacking.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The concept of orchestrating a drifting orchard via visible sound-ghosts is non-obvious and fully committed; no familiar template matches this synthesis. Risk—the lyric accumulative structure—heightens stakes by making the island itself the antagonist that must be tuned. Specificity of “sketched resonance” and “fractal generating” transforms abstract ideas into tactile procedure. The final image of artist listening to her own creation reconfigures the premise irreversibly.</comment>
