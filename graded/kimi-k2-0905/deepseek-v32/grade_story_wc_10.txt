<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara’s survivor guilt and her need to “translate silence into music” give every beat a single, legible obsession; her trembling fingers, silent breath, and micro-choice to shift the device from self to conservatory show embodied contradiction. The final renunciation—closing the case after the visual symphony—earns its poignancy because the text has tied the fork’s vibration to her interior silence throughout. No secondary character appears, so relationship crucible is N/A; headcount stays within default. Minor flattening: “roaring void” skirts label-speak, but immediate tactile context rescues it.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the silence itself becomes “music” as frost and light perform the unheard chord, leaving Elara in Charged Poise with the case snapped shut—cost is the irreversibility of her new, non-aural hearing. Causal linkage holds: because she maps the conservatory’s own thermal song, therefore the gold heat fuses human and plant emotion, vibrating the fork and unleashing the visual symphony. No orientation debt; anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 3. One lens—Causal—drives every beat; no ambiguity at closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The winterglass panes, perpetual rime, and crystalline spire are not backdrop but instrumental: the Unshaken Marvel literally resonates, making setting a co-protagonist. Selective sensory economy—visual chill and tactile silence—mirrors Elara’s narrowed post-Capsize perception without tourist clutter. Spatial choreography is immaculate: we track her wrist device, pocketed case, and the fork’s distance to the spire across every beat. Micro-setting (the tuning fork itself) constrains the climax, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Single dominant stake—“will silence yield music?”—tightens once: from self-only emotion to ecosystem emotion, foreclosing solitary catharsis. The reversal is protagonist-driven and visible: her adjustment of sensors to “read the thermal whispers of the conservatory” is the beat that pays the price of shared vulnerability. Cost is legible: she forfeits exclusive ownership of grief, accepting a communal, wordless composition. No coincidence; pressure stays causal under inferred lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges without dictation: silence as collaborative art, not private cure. The refracted “prismatic tears” reweight the opening image of “perpetual rime” into a transient, living score. No final-paragraph sermon; the last line’s “silent wonder” is an image, not a moral. Ambiguity lingers: the music remains unheard, forcing reader into same heart-ear translation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited holds tight psychic distance; perceptual signature is music-centric—everything “sings,” “resonates,” or “modulates,” giving silence a textured lexicon. Rhythm mimics breathless focus: long sentences swell, then fracture at climax (“At first, nothing. Then…”). No dialogue, so voice contamination risk is zero. Minor lyric repetition (“silent music”) is pattern-taught early and pays off, not artifact.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet lyrical: “frost-fall,” “glittering dissolution” compress motion and sound into single nouns. No filter-verb stacks; action verbs drive lines. One mixed metaphor risk—“roaring void”—but physical logic survives because “roaring” is memory, not literal. Sentence variety and paragraph cut test pass; removing any paragraph would delete causal heat data.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Premise flips apocalypse trope: instead of fighting silence, protagonist aestheticizes it via botanic-tech synesthesia. Heat-map emotion reader is fresh tech with credible DIY mechanics. “Visual symphony” risks preciousness, but earns its lift through prior pattern of prismic light. Transforms familiar survivor trauma into non-aural artistry, making silence a collaborative instrument rather than absence.</comment>
