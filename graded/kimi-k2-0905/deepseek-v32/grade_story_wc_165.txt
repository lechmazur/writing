<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Leo’s “analytical” tag is declared repeatedly yet never shown through concrete calculations or risk-taking micro-choices; the bishop hand-off is sweet but costs him nothing and alters no future tactic. Interiority circles the same abstract desire (“serenade monotony”) without contradictory impulse or visible flaw. Relationship beat is thin—woman remains a passive mirror—so the crucible test fails. Earned stasis is attempted but feels inexpensive because the prior beats carry no tangible forfeiture.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the gifted bishop crystallizes the game-to-music rule-set and reweights Leo’s future performances with undeniable social cost. Causal chain is light but intact—chess logic → melody → woman’s recognition → token exchange—holding an Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is clear by word 60; no penalty. One meaningful tightening occurs when he decides to give the piece away, narrowing his “randomness” toolkit. Cost is more conceptual than felt, keeping the score below 8.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>“Tidal arcade under stars” is sensually alive—salt scent, echoing stone, breeze-borne notes—and the chessboard micro-setting physically constraints every musical choice. Spatial tracking is clean; the bishop’s position is repeatedly re-established. Environment never forces a hard tactical trade-off, so it supports rather than charges the final image. Strong specificity, but not indispensable to the climax.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will the woman receive the pattern and validate Leo’s art?—is signaled early and tightens once when he decides to give the bishop away, foreclosing future reuse of that piece. Pressure is gentle; stakes are emotional validation, not survival. No visible price (money, injury, social risk) alters his later tactics. Sufficient micro-turn for 600-word scope, yet escalation stays modest.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of “ordering randomness into meaning” emerges through recurrence of chess-music link and final gift; no moral is stated. Subtext resides in the unspoken mutual recognition between performer and passer-by. The woman’s pocketing the bishop reweights earlier abstractions into personal covenant. Complexity is present but not profound—no counter-readings that destabilize the premise.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Leo with consistent perceptual filter—“lightly attentive,” sound-oriented, pattern-seeking. Syntax mimics analytical rhythm: short declaratives, iterative “he noted / he believed.” No head-hopping; psychic distance stable. Distinctiveness is moderate—voice never cracks under pressure to reveal new cadence. Clean, professional, but not yet unforgettable.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, and mostly loop-free; occasional echo phrases (“between acts,” “ordering randomness”) repeat without fresh inflection but do not stall momentum. Metaphors stay coherent—the bishop’s diagonal as musical interval. No scaffolding or synonym churn. Final paragraph shows artifact-free clarity. High-band control, one notch below exemplary due to mild cadence duplication.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Concept of algorithmic street music governed by chess moves is fresh and specific; not a trope rehash. Execution keeps the spectacle small-scale and credible. Risk level is moderate—no structural high-wire act. The synthesis feels inevitable yet not breathtakingly original; memorable angle but not a paradigm shift.</comment>
