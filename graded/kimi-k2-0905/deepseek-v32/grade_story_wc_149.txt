<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Interiority is lush and specific—“lovingly venomous nostalgia” bodying both tenderness and sting—but Elara’s contradictory impulses are stated rather than dramatized in scene; the final renunciation is credible because the bead vision has already shown the debt, yet the beat itself is one beat of summary, not split choice under live pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: bead → memory → recognition → orchard ritual → release; the Orientation Test is met by line 4; closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Lyra’s fade and dawn’s first light re-weight all prior night imagery with felt cost—Elara’s solitude is legible and irreversible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Glass, ash-veil, winter-cracked earth, and the bead itself are tactile and selective; the greenhouse’s rules are learned through action (chanting runes, root-search) and the final sunrise is earned; micro-setting (bead in palm) literally steers the climax, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—cancel the elixir curse or stay haunted—tightens once when Elara learns the price (loss of Lyra’s anchor); escalation is linear but protagonist-driven; cost is visible (ghost’s vanishing) though externalized; one meaningful turn suffices for length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of debt vs. release emerges through repetition of “repay,” “anchor,” and the dawn image; no moralizing sentence tells the lesson; final sunlight re-prices all prior night, yielding mournful elation without platitude; ambiguity lingers—was forgetting kinder?</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-limited keeps to Elara’s sensuous bias—“breath fogging,” “stone cool to touch”—with controlled lyric elevation; no head-hop; patterned diction (“ghosted closer,” “resonant awakenings”) is taught early and pays off; rhythm swells then stills with the light burst, mirroring grief release.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is textured yet propulsive; occasional adjective pairing (“mournful elation,” “sorrowful joy”) skirts tautology but reads as thematic refrain rather than clutter; no loop or mixed metaphor; opening and closing lines anchor and echo cleanly; high density without purple stall.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Gothic-lovers-undo-poison is familiar, yet the alchemical orchard that weaves literal time via plant-light feels fresh; specificity of ash-veil tactile ghost and bead-runes transforms trope; final sunrise after centuries-long night lands as earned inversion of ghost-story convention.</comment>
