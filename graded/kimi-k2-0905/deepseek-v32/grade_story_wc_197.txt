<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Leo’s motives stay clean: secrecy, desperation, memory of grandfather. Micro-choices—memorizing the puddle-map, slotting the key, pressing the button—show resourcefulness under pressure. Interiority is sparse but specific (“key clutched…like a promise”). No real flaw or contradiction complicates him, so the arc is linear rather than torn; still, the endurance cost is felt in the final dawn walk.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: key → puddle-map → lagoon → booth → data. Each step follows the last with no teleporting props. Closure is Conceptual Repricing: the city’s past is literally re-weighted when Leo downloads uncensored history; cost is the risk he now carries at dawn. Orientation is anchored within first 120 words (plaza, dusk, rain), so no penalty.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Rain-slick plaza, neon puddles, drainage tunnels, auric lagoon—each locale is filtered through Leo’s goal-directed eye. The puddle-map is environment-as-tool: only that angle reveals the path. Starlit stalactites and golden water charge the final image of hidden truth. No exposition dumps; place names are minimal yet specific (“defunct phone company”).</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—expose censored past—signalled early. Escalation is steady: plans unravel → map discovered → booth rises → data secured. One clear tightening: the lagoon mechanism demands the exact key he carries. Cost is visceral: soaked, exhausted, now marked for Council retaliation. Under causal lens, each beat narrows his options toward the single broadcast future.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—memory vs. erasure—emerges through images (puddle-map, golden archive) rather than statement. No explicit moral; final line is action: “ready to speak.” Ambiguity remains: will citizens awaken? The brass key reappears as both literal tool and symbol of buried voices, re-weighted at closure when it sinks with the reclaimed booth.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Tight third-person limited stays inside Leo’s perception; no head-hop. Diction—“luminous guide,” “auric lagoon”—is slightly elevated yet consistent with his reverence. Rhythm accelerates during tunnel crawl, then slows for lagoon awe. No dialogue, so voice carries through sensory filter and micro-action. Patterned repetition (“key…promise”) is brief, taught early, paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Sinewy sentences propel: “He navigated the drainage tunnels, the key clutched…”—information triple-loads (action, prop, emotion). No filler loops; metaphors stay coherent (“waters…holding metallic golden sheen”). Paragraph cuts are deliberate, each advancing goal or image. Opening and closing lines frame stakes and new dawn cleanly. Minor elevation “tyranny of indifference” is earned by prior specifics.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Familiar dystopia + hidden archive is refreshed by puddle-map mechanics and the literal phone-booth server. Key object evolves from junk to skeleton key to historical switch—transformative rather than token. Risk: lagoon rise could read whimsical, but grounded sensory detail sells it. Specificity of “defunct company frequencies” for broadcast keeps tech logic fresh.</comment>
