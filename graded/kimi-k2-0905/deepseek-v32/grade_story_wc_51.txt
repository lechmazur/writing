<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Motivation (mapping burden-weights) stays consistent, but interiority drifts into abstract lyric loops (“boundary-lessly trapped” repeated) that feel performed rather than embodied. Micro-choices (turning wick, aligning flame) are present, yet the emotional cost of calcifying vs. staying fluid is declared more than dramatized. The ending renunciation lands only after the conceptual freight is restated, so the felt price is inferred, not visceral.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: pattern of burden-knotting thickens until alignment re-weights meaning. Closure is a Charged Poise—circle of release—but the cost is conceptual (“knowledge of shapes”) not visceral, so resonance feels airy. Orientation is clear by word 60; no teleporting props, yet the recursive fractal rhetoric loops risk a stasis that almost stalls escalation.</question>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Bronze grotto, lamp, and starlight pool work as micro-setting: lamp-flame alignment literally enables the perceptual pivot that re-weights burdens. Metallic hush and shingled quiet function as tactile pressure, constraining breath and sound. Spatial choreography is clean; no visual dominance overload; environment mirrors internal recursion without overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—escape endless recursion without calcifying—is signaled early. Escalation is textural: each burden lattice densifies the pattern until alignment shift re-weights options. Agency is present (turning wick, weaving release circle), but the tangible price (fatigue, time, risk of rigidity) is implied rather than dramatized, keeping cost legibility soft.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges from recursive pattern vs. fluid orientation; no final moral stated. “Calcify” and “orienting properly” return with shifted weight, achieving conceptual repricing. Ambiguity between surrender and mastery lingers, inviting reread. Slight abstraction keeps it from deeper emotional aftertaste.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Lyric third-person sustains starlit, metallic texture; diction stays within weaver’s contemplative register. No head-hopping; perceptual signature—“shingled hush,” “whalebone reverie”—remains distinct. Rhythm swells and contracts with fractal repetitions, taught early and paid off in final circle. Filter verbs minimal; free indirect clean.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm modulates with white space and repetition; metaphor strings (“scales/overlapping leaves”) risk overwriting but stay coherent. One paraphrase loop (“boundary-lessly trapped” twice inside 60 words) nicks propulsion. No scaffold sentences; opening and closing lines are sharp. Punctuation clean; no mixed metaphors in peak beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Fractal grief-cartography as plot engine feels fresh; synthesis of starlight, bronze, and recursive weaving is specific, not quirky. Risk-taking in lyric repetition heightens texture without gimmickry. Transformation test: rename elements and the emotional arc collapses—proof of particularity. Minor deduction for near-echo of “silent precision” cliché.</comment>
