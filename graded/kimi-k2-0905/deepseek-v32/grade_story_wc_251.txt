<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Leo’s trait of “hearing unspoken words” is stated repeatedly but never dramatized as a concrete choice that costs him; it functions as atmospheric narration rather than a crucible that forces a visible trade-off. The “cradling” motif supplies tactile tenderness yet remains symbolic; because the candle plan is executed off-stage, we never see him risk anything personally. Interiority drifts toward lyrical summary (“forests of second thoughts”) instead of moment-to-moment contradiction under threat. The closure beat—watching candles appear—attributes civic change to him, but the causal bridge from soft coach to mayor’s reversal is asserted, not embodied on page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure is present: a quiet, Conceptual Repricing image—town windows blooming into a constellation—makes the social cost of dissent legible. Causality, however, is elliptical; the synchronized window plan is seeded in chess diagrams yet the leap from silent lesson to city-wide compliance is summarized, not shown, blunting the because/therefore chain. The lens is Accumulative/Textural; the final cadence shift lands, but the tightening midpoint that forecloses risk (arrest, betrayal, exposure) is skipped, so the price feels communal rather than personal to Leo. Orientation is clean; time/place anchors arrive early and never drift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>“Cobalt library in mist,” “magnetic grotto under starlight,” and “synchronized candles” create a concise triad of visual emblems; each is filtered through Leo’s hushed perception, keeping detail selective. Sensory economy favors sight and tactile coolness (chess-piece weight, damp stones), mirroring the quiet tone. The grotto’s magnetism teases a constraint that never materializes—iron objects don’t complicate the plan—so the setting charges atmosphere more than choice. Still, spatial beats track cleanly from library to cave to window vantage, giving the piece a legible micro-map.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—citizen visibility versus mayor’s decree—is signaled early and escalates through the number of lit windows, a soft but legible quantitative rise. Leo’s agency is indirect (teaching without speech); because the risk transfers to townspeople, personal cost is displaced, muting pressure. No credible loss (arrest, job, public shame) is dramatized for him; the tightening is collective, not protagonist-bound. Closure reweights civic possibility, yet the absence of a live reversal or forfeiture keeps escalation in the mild register.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: quiet solidarity can dismantle overreach without shouting. The candle constellation reprises the grotto’s “whispers,” letting light literalize the unspoken, an image that lingers without sermon. Subtext stays in gesture—chess pieces passed silently, a child cradling a bird—allowing readers to connect nurturing moves across scales. The final line’s “enduring peace” edges toward moral caption, but the prior field-of-fireflies visual does enough lifting to preserve nuance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Leo’s filtered attention; diction (“cobalt,” “cradle,” “hush where past meets prophecy”) maintains hushed consonance. Rhythm modulates with longer cadences for reflection, shorter beats for candle emergence, supporting the “amplified quiet” brief. No dialogue appears, averting register risk. Occasional loftiness (“forests of second thoughts”) is pattern-consistent rather than intrusive, and perceptual signature remains steady throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose is smooth, with high compression: backstory, plan, and aftermath occupy single sentences without scaffold. Metaphors are few but coherent; no mixed vehicles or synonym loops detected. A few template stems (“Leo…,” “The…”) recur, but cadence variation keeps momentum. The final sentence’s “enduring peace” is slightly abstract; otherwise the last line recharges the firefly image cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The synchronized-candle revolt offers a fresh twist on quiet resistance; chess-as-cipher and magnetic grotto add texture, though magnetism stays under-used. Familiar “repressive small-town mayor” frame is not subverted, yet the non-verbal strategy feels specific to Leo’s occupation. Emotional specificity resides more in communal mood than in individual stakes. Overall, a gentle recombination rather than a bold risk, but the particulars keep it from cliché.</comment>
