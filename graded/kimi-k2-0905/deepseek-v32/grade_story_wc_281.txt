<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Leo’s quiet, embodied skepticism and its slow melt into credulity feel lived-in; the contradiction between rational dismissal and bodily surrender to the pill drives every beat. Static-shock memory as the first somatic anchor is specific and irreversible, forcing later light-tracings to carry real cost. The micro-choice to swallow the pill in the dark studio crystallises stakes better than any interior monologue. Interiority never strays into therapy-speak; instead, pulse, tremor, and breath carry the emotional arc.</comment>

<comment>Causal chain is immaculate: shock → pill → somatic recall → camera trace → neural arbor image → submission. Each beat narrows possibility and raises visible cost (grant deadline, bodily risk, aesthetic wager). Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: “illumination does not banish darkness but traces what darkness reveals” reweights the whole premise with undeniable social/epistemic cost. No teleporting props or convenient amnesia; the muscovite and camera remain tactically tracked throughout.</comment>

<comment>Light-painting studio functions as micro-setting: every cable, filter, and monitor constrains gesture and camera placement. The geode sliver’s layered planes become a tactile proxy for neural depth, charging the final image. Darkness is not backdrop but active force—“absolute and accusing”—that guides Leo’s decision to swallow the pill. Spatial choreography survives multiple hand-offs (wand → camera → monitor → geode) without drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—save the grant by producing a breakthrough—threads every beat; the 24-hour deadline is implied but legible. Escalation is driven by Leo’s agency: each recalled somatic state unlocks a new light pattern, foreclosing the previous “pretty streak” option. Visible cost accumulates: bodily attunement becomes almost unbearably acute, and the final composite risks his last dignity. No coincidence; the shock is random but functions as catalyst, not resolver.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges via recurrence of “fractally precise” structures—geode, neural arbor, memory itself—never lectured. The closing image reframes darkness from enemy to collaborator, a resonant non-literal answer to “how do we illuminate thought?” Subtext lives in gesture: the moment Leo sets the geode beside the monitor is wordless acceptance of embodied knowledge. No final-paragraph sermon; the image alone carries the reweighting.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person intimate stays tightly glued to Leo’s perceptual threshold—synaesthetic slide from metallic taste of doubt to cobalt after-image. Diction (“willowglass hope,” “guttering candle”) belongs to an artist who thinks in textures, not diagnoses. Rhythm mirrors pulse: long sentences for exposure drift, staccato for shock. No head-hop; Mara appears only as off-stage voice and gift-giver, keeping focalization pure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is near-loop-free; only one adjacent paraphrase (“once pure drive… now guttering candle”) but it serves cadence, not padding. Metaphors stay internally coherent—electric arbor, layered rock, glassy hope—no mixed vehicles. Sentence variety is purposeful: participle opener used once to mimic camera sweep, then abandoned. Final line earns its metaphoric leap because “willowglass” was earlier tied to fragility under pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Somatic-marker recall as artistic method is fresh; coupling it to a telepathy-recall pill flips typical sci-fi usage into interior cartography. Neural-arbor light-painting is a genuine synthesis, not a gimmick, because the geode prefigures it. Risk—swallowing an unapproved drug alone in the dark—heightens stakes without external villainy. Specificity of execution makes the concept inevitable in hindsight: only this body, this studio, this shock could produce this image.</comment>
