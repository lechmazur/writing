<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elara’s “emotional rationality” is declared more than dramatized; the letter-reading beats show stoic observation but no visible interior contradiction or embodied cost. Her only micro-choice—closing the case—repeats the opening beat without new risk or renunciation, so the arc feels static rather than earned. The trait never complicates her tactics; it merely filters description.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the ivy/lie analogy reweights the national myth with undeniable social cost. Causality is accumulative; each parallel tightens the metaphorical net until the final image crystallizes. The Orientation Test is waived—deliberate slow reveal of place serves the lyric pattern. No meaningful constraint or new price shapes the exit beat, preventing 9+ entry.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The station’s ivy, rust, and rose anchor every beat; the illuminated capital ‘H’ functions as micro-setting that constrains interpretation. Spatial choreography is clean—petal drop → platform walk → carriage spot. Environment mirrors thesis without overt symbolism. The village-that-never-existed charges the final reweighting, meeting the 9+ gate for object-as-setting.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—rescue truth—stays abstract; no live obstacle or ticking clock raises cost. Escalation is textural: each parallel thickens metaphorical density but never narrows Elara’s options or risks failure. The “noble lie” concept deepens but does not test her resolve on the page. Closure reweights meaning rather than foreclosing a path, keeping pressure intellectual, not visceral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the ivy/lie parallel; no moralizing line appears. The personal-vs-public chancellor contrast invites complex irony without false equivalence. Final image of the bare rosebush reconfigures the founding myth with quiet resonance. Slight abstraction caps the score below 8.5.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Free-indirect style stays stable within Elara’s historian lexicon; perceptual signature favors archival metaphors (“rusted iron ribs,” “gold leaf gleaming dully”). Syntax lengthens under reflection, contracts during motion, supporting cadence. No filter-verb clusters or voice drift. Distinct enough for 8+ but lacks rhythmic risk that would push higher.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, vivid, and loop-free; figurative language is selective (“ivy smothering the tracks”). One paraphrase loop—“noble lies…blueprints repeated”—drops the score a hair. No mixed metaphors or register drift. High density without purple overload; final paragraph avoids scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>The ivy-as-propaganda parallel feels inevitable yet not overtly derivative. Combining illuminated manuscript studies with post-war historiography offers fresh angle. Risk is moderate—lyric accumulative structure rather than plot twist—but coherence stays high. Could push further if the historian’s personal stake carried unique professional jeopardy.</comment>
