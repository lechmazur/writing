<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The narrator’s “sensitively perceptive” trait is repeatedly asserted but never embodied in contradictory or bodily ways; interiority stays safely diagnostic (“I felt the weight of their guilt”). The micro-choice to process the negative is present, yet the emotional cost is summarized rather than shown through altered perception or physiology. A credible renunciation is reached—carrying the story away—but it is declared, not dramatized with visible toll.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the diaries + negative together reweight the narrator’s mission from pure observation to testimony, with felt ethical burden. Causality under Accumulative lens holds: each artifact (diaries→negative→blueprint) densifies the moral stake. The Orientation Test is waived—early disorientation (“I became…”) is taught and pays off in the final image. Cost is legible in the final paragraph (“legacy’s burden remained in my heart”), but the beat is still narrated summary, not embodied moment.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Ivy-veiled passage functions as micro-setting: the overgrown panel conceals the device, directly enabling the final deactivation beat and the “lighter” atmosphere shift. Sensory detail is selective—damp stone, metallic glint, ashes—filtered through the auditory cartographer POV. Spatial choreography stays clean across the slow crawl, negative retrieval, and panel pry. Environment thus constrains choice and charges the final image, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—whether the narrator will shoulder the burden of the house’s secret—emerges late but cleanly. Escalation is textural: each artifact layers ethical weight rather than narrows external options. The decisive intensification is the blueprint reveal that forces the deactivation choice; cost is confirmed in the “trembling hands” image. Agency is present but internal; the physical risk is off-page, keeping the score just inside the strong band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically from the chain of objects: walls dream of both joy and complicity, reframing climate grief as inherited ethical debt. No explicit moral is stated; the final image of the cartographer walking away with the evidence invites the reader to carry the burden too. Subtext is carried in the silence of the dormant device and the sigh of the walls—gesture, not assertion. The half-burned pages and spared negative function as concrete particulars that resist tidy takeaway, sustaining ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>First-person POV remains stable with a consistent auditory perceptual signature—everything is heard or muffled first, seen second. Rhythm modulates: longer sentences forechoic listening, clipped fragments (“It was a fireplace, long cold…”) for discoveries. Filter verbs are minimal; diction stays within the loner-cartographer lexicon. No dialogue means no convergence risk; the voice sustains distinct texture under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, with high information density—each sentence advances discovery or atmosphere. No paraphrase loops or template cadence; metaphor is sparse and grounded (“a scar on the world”). Occasional elevated phrasing (“sonic memories trapped in their walls”) is earned by the speculative premise and keeps within narrator idiom. Tiny proofing slip—“the” repeated in “the the ivy-veiled passage”—but clarity and momentum never falter.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The corridor-echo-cartographer frame is fresh, giving climate fiction an acoustic archeology twist. Tropes of found-diaries and hidden device are transformed through the sound-mapper’s lens and the spared negative strip, making the reveal feel inevitable. Specificity of the ivy-choked panel and the sighing walls anchors the concept in lived detail. Risk is modest but coherent—no late rule tricks, just a quiet shift from observation to testimony.</comment>
