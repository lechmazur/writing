<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Aris’s interiority is concrete—parachute buckle as tactile anchor, muscle-memory keystrokes—and his contradictory impulse (duty vs. memory of failure) is on-page. Yet the emotional curve plateaus: no new internal rupture or micro-choice escalates after the data-corruption beat; vigilance simply hardens into resolve without fresh cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: static → debris threat → protocol rewrite → alert sent; orientation (who/where/when) is anchored by word 100. Closure is Earned Stasis—he stands watch with hope reweighted—yet the cost (lost sleep, future risk) is asserted rather than dramatized, keeping it shy of 9-band.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Glass-domed arbor, star-flecked void, and the buckle as micro-setting are filtered through Aris’s professional gaze; sensory hierarchy (cold metal, whisper of breath) tightens with crisis. The environment never physically impedes or enables beyond atmosphere—no zero-g hatch, no glare on screens—so it constrains mood, not tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—evacuation before debris hit—is signaled early and tightens once when corrupted data forces manual rewrite. Agency is steady, not escalatory: each bypassed circuit succeeds without new obstacle or forfeiture; the “single pulse of light” signals completion, not extra cost. Meets short-form threshold but lacks a visible price that forecloses a live option.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Theme of watchful responsibility emerges via buckle, muscle memory, and the final hopeful vigil without sermonizing. Recurrent “soundless echo” reweights from dread to resolve, giving resonant reconfiguration. Complexity is present but narrow—no counter-reading that vigilance might itself imperil—keeping it solid, not exceptional.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited maintains tight psychic distance; syntax contracts under pressure (“whisper of his breath and the click of keys”). No head-hop, no filter-verb clutter; perceptual signature is star-fixed and tactile. Voice plateau prevents 9+: metaphor pool is small, and cadence repeats “after the radio static cleared” without fresh inflection.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and propel; information density high—“fingers danced over control panels without thought” does double duty. Occasional scaffold: “pressure immense and unyielding” is abstract paraphrase of already-shown stakes. No mixed metaphor or loop in closure beat; minor artifact keeps sub-9.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Orbital arbor + pattern-seeker + parachute talisman remix familiar near-future evacuation tropes into a compressed lyric emergency. The synthesis is specific—muscle-memory console ballet, buckle-as-second-chance—but the threat (random debris) remains generic space peril without fresh rule or irony. Enough transformation to feel particular, not groundbreaking.</comment>
