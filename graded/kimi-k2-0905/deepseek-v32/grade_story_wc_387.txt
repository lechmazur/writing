<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Motivation clear and constant (“to appreciate hidden effort”), internal contradiction absent; he watches more than acts until the whistle. Embodied emotion is present (salt-scented hands, sigh) but never in crisis, so no test of degradation. No second character, so relationship/status crucible inert. Endurance itself is the change—fine for 750 words—but cost is only conceptual (quiet witness), not visceral; this caps the arc below the 8-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens signaled early (“scintillatingly somber” repetition, firefly layering) and held; closure is Charged Poise—luminous net-map reweights earlier mending. Orientation anchored within 120 words; single scene, single POV, one transition (tea → net) is clean. No causal reversal, but deepening suffices for this mode. Cost is legible in final image (“fading echoes of light”), yet remains oblique; this keeps it below 9.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Sensory triangulation (salt, damp stone, whistle echo) is selective and POV-filtered. Micro-setting—bamboo whisk and net in lap—constrains the quiet ritual beats and recurs at closure. Spatial choreography simple but coherent: parapet → marsh air → folded net. Weather (post-rain, moonlight) affects visibility and enables “moon paths” method; firefly season supplies living metaphor. Tool/body/environment triad charges the final image; meets 9-band gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake is attention itself—seeing hidden labor. Pressure accumulates through denser firefly patterns until the net-of-light epiphany; no external antagonist or reversal. Agency is renunciation of further mending in favor of witness; cost is opportunity (time, unfinished net?) but only hinted. Sufficient tightening for 750-word lyric mode; lacks visceral price to pierce 8+ ceiling.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through accruing images—knots, firefly traces, tea leaves settling—never named outright. Final image reconfigures premise: hidden labor is its own luminous map. Avoids moralizing; “demure audacity” stays embodied in humble ritual. Ambiguity lingers—whether witness changes anything—creating honest resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person lyric hovers close to corporeal senses; perceptual signature fixed on minute craft and glints of light. Diction stays within philosopher-net-mender idiom (“channels of faint illumination”). Rhythm modulates: long evocative clauses calm, then shorter strokes for knot-work. No dialogue, so no voice collision. Compression taught early (“whispering parapet”) and paid off; zero head-hop. Clean 9-band.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence runs. Figurative layering dense but patterned (light/knot/weave) and justified by closure. One paraphrase loop mid-piece (“hidden effort was everywhere…”) −0.2. No mixed metaphors or register drift. High information density: steam thread, firefly grammar, moon paths all multitask. One minor scaffold keeps it shy of 9.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fusing net-mending with firefly semaphore feels fresh; philosophical stance grows from concrete craft. “Moon paths” as airborne lanes rather than earth trails offers subtle inflection. Risk is quiet—accumulative image rather than twist—coherence high, gimmick zero. Could edge 8+ with sharper cost or irreplaceable detail.</comment>
