<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and character-particular (“the coin on its red thread felt warm…a heartbeat of resilience”). Contradictory impulses—honoring the survivor while ritualizing her own scar—are dramatized in the sand-graft moment. The final renunciation of the arsonist-daughter identity is earned by the因果 chain of ritual + coin + memory. Micro-choices (sprinkling sand, whispering to scar) reveal value hierarchy with felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: “she saw not the arsonist's daughter, but a woman who carried water into heat.” Cost is legible—she forecloses the inherited identity on-page. Drive lens = Accumulative/Textural; pattern of cloud migration → black sand → coin reweights meaning in final image. Orientation anchored by word 80; no因果 breaks; single transition-free scene.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Obsidian lagoon and dunes constrain solitude needed for ritual; volcanic sand’s elemental origin charges the graft metaphor. Micro-setting (scarred forearm) functions as literal canvas. Sensory hierarchy favors touch and sight, filtered through firefighter POV. Environment mirrors internal shift without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prove scars can sing—tightens when paste is applied to her own burn; option to keep scar “silent” is foreclosed. Agency is renunciatory rather than combative, fitting Accumulative lens. Cost is legible: she exposes old wound to public gaze (later wash-away implies vulnerability). One meaningful deepening suffices at this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete ritual: melody from ruin. Final image reweights coin from gift to tuning fork of identity—no moralizing. Subtext in “foreign script” suggests unmapped futures. Scars-as-music resists tidy equivalence; complexity lingers.</comment>

<comment>Third-person lyric voice maintains stable distance. Rhythmic control in “migration of clouds…kelp-drift peace” mirrors emotional cadence. Perceptual signature—firefighter noticing accelerant smell, ash texture—stays character-bound. No head-hopping; elision of father’s arrest is purposeful compression.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>High information density: single sentences fuse action + metaphor (“sand…like powdered night”). No loops or scaffold. Occasional elevated diction (“conceptual ash”) stays within lyrical register taught early. Metaphors remain coherent; closure image unblurred.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Premise—arsonist’s daughter becomes firefighter who ritually grafts volcanic sand onto her own scar—feels inevitable yet fresh. Synthesis of fire/water, destruction/healing is non-obvious. Risk in quiet ritual ending pays off via Charged Poise. Transformation test fails if names swapped, confirming specificity.</comment>
