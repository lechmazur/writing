<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Arvid’s isolated compulsion is anchored in sensory micro-choices (touching the flower, re-pinning it) that visibly cost him comfort; the borrowed-memory gift gives him a unique perceptual signature and contradictory impulse—he both clings to solitude and reaches across death. Final “serene certainty” is earned by the earlier visceral shock that foreclosed disbelief. Interiority stays concrete and alpine frost taste embodies emotion without label-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Arvid’s witnessed isolation becomes active witness of Emil’s story, cost paid in the moment he unpins the flower and speaks the name without external proof. Accumulative/textural lens holds: each lap of water and tactile revisit of the Edelweiss tightens the stake until knowledge reweights Arvid’s identity. No teleporting props; flower state tracks cleanly from soggy → brittle → repinned. Orientation anchored by line 4; mist and dock persist as coherent constraints.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Opal planks that glow and mist that muffles sound are filtered through Arvid’s mariner biases; the dock’s “barnacled legs” physically trap the body and later compel his kneeling touch. Alpine memory is supplied sparingly via sensory inversion (taste of frost). Micro-setting—the flower itself—finally charges the image when repinned at dawn, constraining Arvid to speak. Spatial clarity maintained across two dock visits and the storeroom.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake: decode the stranger or remain sealed in sterile isolation. Pressure escalates through textured memory intrusions that sharpen emotional cost; each handling of the flower deepens the “wrench of departure” he must finally voice. One meaningful tightening: the second dock immersion forces public disclosure, foreclosing the option of silence. Agency remains Arvid’s throughout; no coincidence resolves the gap.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of bridged isolation emerges implicitly via the Edelweiss’s journey from alpine vow to maritime grave; no character moralizes. Final image of burning mist reconfigures Arvid’s role from distant watcher to story-bearer, a conceptual repricing paid by his unexplained certainty. Subtext resides in gestures—re-pinning the flower acts as unspoken pact. Ambiguity endures: the village will never verify the vision, yet cost is felt.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited clings to Arvid’s synesthetic perceptions (“taste of alpine frost”) without head-hopping. Rhythm compresses under stress—single-sentence paragraph “He snatched his hand away”—then widens for dawn reveal, mirroring emotional cadence. Diction stays within a keeper’s lens: nautical, tactile, no academic drift. Distinct perceptual signature sustained; no filter-verb stacks dull immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty—description advances stakes (“green water loomed” both paints and raises peril). Mixed metaphors absent; figurative language sparing and accurate (“muffled the world” fits fog’s acoustic effect). No synonym loops or scaffold; each lap of water revisits with added memory weight. Final line lands with crisp, rhythmic closure: “keeper of a story” re-coins his title.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Familiar trope—lonely lighthouse keeper—reinvented via psychometry triggered by alpine flower, a non-obvious synthesis. Specificity of woodcarver-alpine vow vs. maritime death feels inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric compression taught early and paid off; no safe middle. No close echoes of canonical scenes; final image is fresh.</comment>
