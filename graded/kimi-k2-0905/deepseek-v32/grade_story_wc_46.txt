<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is tender and consistent; the sea-glass tactile beats show embodied emotion. Yet her “decision” to leave is announced only in summary, not dramatized, so the cost feels lightweight. The final hand-off to the girl reprises her motive but still registers more symbol than lived stakes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds: each shard adds density to the starlight/fire contrast, and the closure image (sea-glass passed on) lands as Charged Poise with conceptual cost—she relinquishes her talisman. Orientation is quick, but the middle compresses two decades into a paragraph, blurring causal linkage; the tightening beat is the storm-night demonstration, which is vivid but brief.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Grotto, mist, and sea-glass micro-setting are filtered through Elara’s perceptual bias; the “zephyr bloom tone” is taught early and recurs as olfactory anchor. Spatial choreography stays clean across the single location. The sea-glass object directly constrains her final choice, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“share light without fire”—is signaled early; the storm-night scene provides the single meaningful tightening as villagers see moonlit glass. Pressure stays coherent but plateau-like; no secondary reversal raises the cost beyond her eventual surrender of the shard. The escalation is lyrical accumulation rather than rising risk, adequate for this length under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through iterated images of reflected versus created light; the final transfer reframes “stillness” as communal inheritance. Subtext avoids moralizing, letting the glass’s passage speak. The refrain “memories resurfaced” edges toward Echo, but spaced repetition supports the accumulative design without late-explicit thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Elara’s synesthetic attention: “zephyr bloom tone,” “pearl of stillness.” Rhythm modulates—long breaths for nostalgia, clipped fragments during storm scene. No dialogue to test, yet interior diction remains star-watcher specific. Slight risk of melodic sameness, but cadence serves the accumulative swell.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is clean, high-density; metaphors are consistent (glass/pearl/light) and paid off. One paraphrase loop (“memories resurfaced”) repeated four times; each reprise re-weights meaning, so pattern is taught, not artifact. No mixed vehicles or scaffolding; strong read-aloud rhythm.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Star-watcher teaching “no-fire illumination” via sea-glass is fresh; mentor lineage and communal night-walk feel specific rather than generic Joseph-Campbell template. The ending’s child-recursion is familiar but earned by the grotto’s accrual of quiet acts. Risk is moderate; originality lies in tactile optics, not plot shock.</comment>
