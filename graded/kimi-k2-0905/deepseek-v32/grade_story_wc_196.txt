<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s ache is vivid—“her own heart…felt at home among forgotten records”—and her micro-choices (studying dust, pocketing the button) tether motivation to action. The interior contradiction between imposed order and secret kindness is present yet stays a touch abstract; we see her believing, not wrestling. Because no second character shares the scene, relationship crucible and status pressure remain off-stage, limiting depth. Still, the earned linkage between her private grief and the button’s rescue supplies a credible, visible renunciation at the close, satisfying the 9- quick test for this length.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The causal chain is clean: button fall → dust-study → donor log → Aris ID → new note. One minor ellipsis (how she reaches the city directories) is plausibly motivated by archival obsessiveness and does not derail. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—Elara re-weights Samuel’s life and her own pain via the sleeved button—delivering felt cost in the final image. Orientation is anchored by 120 words; lens stays causal; the non-closure accumulation (single coincidental button drop) holds within −0.4, keeping the category above 8.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Foster-care file room functions as micro-setting: “air thick with old paper and despair” filters through Elara’s professional eye; the swollen folder, sealed page, and dust patterns act as tools that constrain her method and enable discovery. Spatial choreography is clean—button falls, page resists then yields, sleeve encases—tracking body-to-object distances crisply. The room’s sensory signature returns in the finale, re-charged by the returned relic, satisfying the 9+ gate. Era-appropriate diction (“indenture,” “mustered out”) stays accurate without showiness.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recovering obliterated kindness—tightens when the button’s donor identity risks remaining lost; the apprenticeship note worn thin shows tangible payoff, so escalation carries visible price. Agency sits in Elara’s decision to cross-reference nights; this narrows her options (sleep versus search) and alters knowledge. Cost is legible: “late into the night,” “her own heartache softened,” implying stamina spent and grief repurposed. The single meaningful tightening meets lens requirements, though pressure plateaus after Aris is found; still, the beat suffices for 600-800 words.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges without sermon: bureaucratic ledgers vs. human residue; the infantryman’s button re-prices emancipation’s unkept promises. Subtext resides in the tiny notation “For pride” and the later sleeve-silence—gestures, not lectures. Ambiguity is preserved: we cannot know how much the button truly swayed Samuel, yet Elara’s choice to believe gives the idea its charge. No final-paragraph thesis statement appears; resonance is carried by the returned relic, satisfying the 9- quick test.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited clings tightly to Elara’s perceptual filter: “smell of old paper and despair,” “brittle page…yielded with a soft sigh.” Syntax lengthens in reflection, shortens during discovery beat, mirroring pulse. No dialogue appears; therefore dialogue bullets are waived. Filter verbs appear (“she felt”) yet are justified by her archivist self-awareness; diction stays within her plausible lexicon. Voice texture differentiates her quiet yearning from the building’s bureaucratic chill, remaining consistent under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Readable aloud with varied sentence openings; high density—“dust patterns,” “paper resisted, then yielded,” each line doing double duty. One scaffold paraphrase loop appears: “her own heart, fractured…felt at home among these forgotten records” could compress, but it occupies low-pressure turf. Mixed metaphor “fallen star” beside tactile button is brief and doesn’t recur. No loops intrude the closure beat; visibility remains clear, keeping the score sub-8 but respectable.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Fuse of post-emancipation bureaucracy + archival dust forensics feels fresh; the button-as-proxy for Black Civil War valor reframed through a white female archivist offers non-obvious moral geometry. Specific detail—“wool coat, two shirts, a pair of boots”—grounds novelty in lived particulars. The premise could swap era with edits, but the dust-pattern method and donor-log marginalia are idiosyncratic enough to resist full interchangeability. Risk is moderate; coherence high.</comment>
