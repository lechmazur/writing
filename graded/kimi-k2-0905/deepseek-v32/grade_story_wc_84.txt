<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kiran’s contradictory impulses—professional retrieval instinct vs. the ache of rootlessness—are embodied in micro-choices (syncing drone, gripping lever, final refusal) that cost him his commission and future safety. The “perpetually surprised” trait is more label than lived physiology, flattening interiority at peak beats. Closure renunciation is fully earned by prior causal chain, not epiphany.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Earned Stasis: he leaves the chip pulsing, forfeiting employer payout and risk-free life; cost is explicit on the page. Causal lens holds throughout—each glyph trail leads to the physical lever, the lever to the pedestal, the pedestal to the irreversible refusal. No orientation debt; dome, dusk, plinth anchors arrive by word 80.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The observatory’s stone rings, oxidized lever, and engraved floor-light constellations constrain every tactical move and charge the final image. Heat-residual drone overlay gives micro-setting specificity; selective copper/indigo palette mirrors Kiran’s shifting interior without overt symbolism. Environment is indispensable to the climax—no relocation possible.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“deliver the chip” vs. “keep the frequency free”—tightens once, when the pedestal reveal forces an either/or. Escalation is causal under lens: glyph trail → lever → slot → final refusal, each step raising cost. Price is legible on-page (“he would not pull the chip to take it”), but only one tightening beat; second reversal absent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of belonging-as-frequency emerges through recovered wind-chant-hall harmonics, never abstract assertion. Final image reweights the missing-pieces motif: omissions were the lock, belonging the ritual, not data. Avoids thematic echo; no character sermonizes “home is inside you.”</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Kiran’s perceptual bias—mechanical drone overlay, copper light fighting indigo. Syntax leans concrete, verbs strong; occasional elevated diction (“forensic poetry”) momentarily slips register but fits technician awe. No head-hop; psychic distance stable.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varied; sentences avoid template cadence. High information density—one line often does description, interior, and motion. Minor filter-verb cluster around “he felt” during resonance beat keeps it from 9.0. Zero loops or mixed metaphors.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Transforms standard cyber-macguffin fetch into analog-typefounder star-trail forensic poetry; the chip-as-constellation-lock is fresh. Synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight yet non-obvious at setup. Risk—renouncing payoff for intangible song—heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
