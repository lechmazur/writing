<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The narrator’s contradictory impulses—methodical mapping versus the need to absolve frozen panic—are dramatized through the micro-choice to leave the maps behind. Embodied cost is legible: the accordion’s taped bellows, the act of playing while abandoning the chronicle. Interiority stays concrete, avoids therapy-speak. One decimal off 9+ only because the sister’s death is named but not given a single sensory shard to make the guilt individual rather than archetypal.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: “The Lyne endures… in the memory of its song” reweights the entire premise from loss to persistence. Causal lens holds: graffiti triggers because/therefore chain that converts mapping into relinquishment. Cost is visible—maps abandoned, story left unfinished. Orientation clean by 120 words; no lens ambiguity at end.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Station’s rust-ivy cathedral and the accordion as micro-setting constrain the final choice to abandon maps. Sensory hierarchy mirrors POV decay-to-clarity arc after medication stop. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from ticket counter to bathroom mirror to exit. One notch below 9 because weather is invoked only as “cool night air” without feeding tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—self-forgiveness—tightens when graffiti reframes river’s fate, forcing narrator to trade mapping for letting-go. Single meaningful escalation suffices: decision to leave maps constitutes visible forfeiture. No coincidence; resolution arises from narrator’s altered stance. Keeps inside 8.8 because price is more conceptual than viscerally felt on the body.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete particular: a river diverted = a life frozen; final line fuses love, chronicling, forgiveness without moralizing. No thematic echo in final paragraph; image of “memory of its song” supplies resonant non-literal answer. Ambiguity tolerable—reader need not know sister’s death details to feel reweighting. Earned, not asserted.</question>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>First-person voice carries distinct perceptual signature: cartographic metaphors, chemical-fog lexicon, accordion sound as “water finding cracks.” Rhythm compresses under pressure—“I stood frozen”—then lengthens with melody. No head-hopping; psychic distance stable. Register stays within plausible lexicon of a field chronicler.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; sentences multi-task (“raw, unforgiving clarity” layers internal state and atmosphere). Metaphors consistent—river/flow/music—no mixed vehicles. Strong verbs dominate, minimal adverbs. Clean grammar, pronouns unambiguous. One hairline slip: “dusk draped the ivy” edges toward poetic register but fits heightened closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</question>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: abandoned railway + lost river + taped accordion create non-obvious triangulation of grief. Graffiti-as-oracle subverts expected rebellion trope. Risk in leaving maps behind is narratively costly yet coherent. Slight proximity to “bathroom wisdom” trope prevents 9+, but transformed through geography lens.</comment>
