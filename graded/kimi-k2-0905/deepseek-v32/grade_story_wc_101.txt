<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Kael’s interiority is spare but specific—his “calm counterpoint” to rising panic shows embodied control. His micro-choice to reveal the bell, not ring it, crystallizes the shift from suspicion to reciprocity. The cost is clear: anonymity forfeited, risk embraced. Only the line “community is a choice” nudges toward label-speak, blunting full contradiction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the bell’s soft peal reweights the entire ridge-city relationship under an economy of care. Causal chain holds—anonymous gifts → decoded origin → reciprocal network—each because/therefore tightening options until the final irrevocable “declare.” Cost is audible: the bell’s note travels, exposing them. No因果 breaks; lens pure causal.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Terra-cotta arbor functions as micro-setting: its curved amphitheater shapes the council’s acoustics and the bell’s projection downslope. Selective sensory hits—“baked clay columns,” “weak moonlight on silver”—root without catalog. The ridge’s quiet is made tactile, a pressure vessel that finally carries the bell sound. City below remains silhouette, but that abstraction serves theme of unseen reciprocity.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—survival vs. trust—tightens once: suspicion of ghost gifts → choice to answer with their own exposure. The single deepening is decisive: reciprocity forecloses isolation. Price is legible—the bell’s audible reveal—yet feels slightly abstract compared to bodily risk. Still, agency drives every turn; no coincidence resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of mutual aid emerges from event, not slogan: gifts decoded, reciprocated, converted into silent dialogue. The bell’s “pure and clear” note becomes non-literal answer to sanctions’ silence. Final image of “hidden, resilient web” reweights earlier exile frame without moralizing. Only the phrase “economy of care” flirts with thesis-statement; otherwise subtext stays implicit.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited clings to Kael’s perceptual filter: dock-knot detail, honey trace, bell weight. Syntax stays controlled, slightly elevated, matching his tempered leadership. No head-hop; elder and youth voices surface only in quoted goal-driven lines. Rhythm modulates—short declaratives at peak, longer reflective cadences at arbor—without drumbeat monotony.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty: “amplified quiet… pressed upon the gathering” layers atmosphere and stakes. No scaffold loops; each paragraph advances choice or image. Metaphors stay coherent—“map of shadows,” “node in a hidden web”—and pay off. Occasional Latinate uplift (“irrevocable,” “profound”) is justified by Kael’s measured outlook; no mixed vehicles clutter closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Post-sanctions mutual-aid reciprocity feels fresh against default dystopia tropes. The silence-as-currency, bell-as-declaration inversion is specific to this piece. Transformation test fails: swap names and the arc still works, but the dock-knot, honey, herb specifics root it here. Risk is present but modest; no structural daring beyond tight causality.</comment>
