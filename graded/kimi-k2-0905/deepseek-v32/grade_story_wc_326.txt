<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Leo’s solitude-sharpened drive to “fetch wisdom from failure” is vivid and embodied through the painstaking ink ritual; the heartbeat implant keeps stakes visceral. Internal contradiction—yearning for connection while embracing exile—surfaces only briefly, limiting depth. The final renunciation (placing the shard on the dried map) carries quiet cost, earning a credible stasis. Still, micro-choices under pressure are more observed than agonized, capping emotional amplitude.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the dried ink map and steady heartbeat counter reweight Leo’s existence, making continued life conceptually costly. Causal chain (blood-ink-projector convergence) is lucid; orientation anchors by word 60. One meaningful tightening—recognition that Thorne misread cascade vs. singular failure—suffices for this length. No loops or late rule patches; cost is legible in the final image alone.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The observatory’s snow-muffled dome, creaking timbers, and milky projector light filter every action; the porcelain shard doubles as micro-setting that constrains the ritual. Sensory hierarchy narrows to touch (cool shard, pricked thumb) and sight (fractal ink) under crisis, mirroring Leo’s attenuated world. Weather outside deepens while pattern stabilizes inside, creating causal counter-rhythm. Environment never over-described; each detail either enables or limits the next move.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—extract the fatal error before his own heart stops—is signaled early and tightens as the ink patterns accelerate. One decisive trade-off: continued attention to fractal chaos risks cardiac strain, a price legible in flickering heartbeat numbers. No false reversals; the ghost’s stabilization directly forecloses further inquiry, crystallizing Leo’s exile into earned stasis. Cost is felt, though escalation is more intellectual than visceral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges obliquely: the value of persisting cognition even after social death, and the humility of scientific error. Subtext resides in the heartbeat’s indifferent persistence against Thorne’s admission of misreading collapse. No moralizing; the dried ink map becomes a mute testament to fallibility. Final image reweights prior solitude from despair to purposeful witness.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Leo’s perceptual lane: synesthetic attention to ink, blood, and fractal math, with vocabulary scaled to a tech-savvy exile. Rhythm lengthens during ritual tracing, then shortens at recognition, mirroring cardiac flicker. Filter verbs (“felt,” “saw”) are minimal and motivated by observatory isolation. No head-hop or register drift; voice remains particularized and consistent under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet lyrical, with sentence variety supporting the hush of high-altitude night. Figurative language is spare and purposeful (“metronome ticking off borrowed time”) without cluttering causality. No synonym loops or scaffold; each paragraph advances image, choice, or atmosphere. One mixed metaphor (“symphony of broken data”) is forgiven for evoking corrupted upload.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Consciousness-upload ghost fragmented by ink-blood fractals is a fresh synthesis; porcelain shard as stylus carries personal archaeology. Premise risks abstraction but grounds in tactile ritual and cardiac countdown. Risk-taking (bureaucratic death as freedom) sharpens stakes without obscuring clarity. Could edge higher with stronger idiosyncratic detail in Thorne’s past, yet remains memorably specific.</comment>
