<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara’s “noticing” is concretely staged—she clears leaves, plants mint, tastes impossible bread—so motive becomes action. Interiority stays tactile (“the smell faintly of caraway and lost mornings”) rather than abstract. The apprenticeship beat gives her a visible renunciation: she accepts secrecy and shared guardianship, a cost scaled to length. Only minor slip: the final line softens the emotional invoice into collective uplift rather than personal scar.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the official leaves without filing, absolution crystallized in the second roll he pockets—felt social cost on the page. Causal chain holds: seedlings spared → bread offered → trust earned → bureaucratic threat neutralized. Orientation anchored by word 60; no teleporting props. One tightening only, but it reweights stakes under the Situational lens perfectly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The tea-house micro-setting constrains every choice: oven vent shapes rosemary placement, ivy limits sightlines, bench supplies the bread altar. Sensory hierarchy obeys Elara’s gardener eye—texture of frost on snowdrop spear, scent of caraway carrying memory. Weather (autumn chill against oven heat) externalizes the fragile truce. Spatial choreography never slips; bodies track around the clay oven and sagging tapestry.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“will the garden (and memory) survive erasure”—is signaled in paragraph 1 and sharpened when the clipboard appears. One meaningful tightening: official at gate forces public stance, no reversals needed. Agency resides in Elara’s decision to step forward with bread, not argue law. Cost is legible: lifelong secrecy now contingent on one civil servant’s silence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of “tenuous absolution” emerges through gesture, not thesis: bread shared, seedling spared, report left unfiled. Final image of second roll in wax paper reweights all prior loaves as quiet bribes for communal grace. Subtext operates in silence—no one articulates forgiveness, yet it is tasted. avoids moralizing; ambiguity lingers in the official’s unwritten decision.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays welded to Elara’s perceptual filter—“skeletal wisteria,” “glossed with egg wash” read gardener-precise. Rhythm modulates: long cadence for drifting city silence, clipped fragments when clipboard threatens. Aris’s dialogue carries flour-dust diction (“You didn’t trample my seedlings”) distinct from Elara’s horticultural lexis. No head-hop; psychic distance compresses under threat without breaking voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty—description seeds future utility (“ivy she had trained to frame, not strangle”) so no line idles. Zero paraphrase loops; each noun is specific (wrought-iron, clay oven, wax paper). Metaphor is sparse and accurate: “voice like dry leaves” fits autumnal decay. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with scene temperature; no scaffolding detected in closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Familiar “hidden garden” trope is retooled through synesthetic bread-time-travel and bureaucratic soft-defeat, making nostalgia edible. Specificity of caraway-scented roll from a vanished bakery feels idiosyncratic, not borrowed. Risk taken: quiet victory via pastry instead of confrontation; coherence maintained. Could edge higher if the city’s graying had one irreplaceable detail unique to this world.</comment>
