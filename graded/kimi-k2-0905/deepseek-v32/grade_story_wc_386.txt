<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara’s quiet, listening gift and sorrow-rooted motive are coherently embodied; the renunciation at the end (she keeps none of the salvaged truth for herself) costs her solitude and lands as earned. Interiority stays concrete—“the crush of the storm…luminous, blue silence”—avoiding diagnostic labels. One micro-flaw: the single sentence of self-articulated motive (“to salvage something pure…”) is slightly expositional, but it is immediately grounded by ritual action. Character logic holds; competence is balanced by the fragility of the spirit-thread she pulls.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a pristine Resonant Reconfiguration: the truth-beam erupts through the ice-lens, reweighting the captain’s memory forever; the cost is Elara’s renewed solitude and the spirit’s disappearance. Causal chain is tight—globe → shrine → dream-projection—each beat a “therefore” linkage. Orientation is secured by line 5; no lens ambiguity. One hairline slip: “windows of connection” is named before its rule is taught, but the next beat dramatizes it, so the micro-delay actually pays off.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Glacier shrine functions as micro-setting that actively refracts choice: the ice walls are the projector she weaponizes for truth. Candle-starlight, ceramic lump, crevasse-voice—all tactile, never tourist. Spatial choreography is clean: altar → globe → ice-face → beam. Final image of “untroubled blue” compresses both setting and emotional after-image, charging closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—clearing the captain’s name—arrives late (mid-story) yet immediately reframes all prior dream-clues, so the tightening still feels decisive. One meaningful escalation: Elara pivots from passive receiver to active broadcaster, price being the spirit’s exit. Cost is legible on-page: “she stood alone in the quiet glow.” Could edge 9+ if an earlier, smaller forfeiture foreshadowed, but pressure stays coherent under causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of salvaging purity from wreckage emerges through image-pattern—globe, ice, truth-beam—never sermon. Subtext whispers in silence after the spirit smiles: heroism may live only as rumor, retold by strangers’ dreams. Moral ambiguity lingers: the captain’s act is pure, yet the wreck still drowns. Final reconfiguration reweights “wreck” from tragedy to testament without moral tagline.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person lyric distance remains stable; syntax lengthens during calm, fragments under spectral contact, mirroring Elara’s pulse. Diction stays within her salvage-poet lexicon—“borrowed starlight,” “threads their confessions”—no register drift. Dialogue is sparse, indirect, goal-driven: “You have my memory” both offers tool and signals farewell. One hairline echo: “quiet” appears three times in final paragraph; the repetition is near-motif but not yet taught as pattern, so it reads as slight monotony rather than culmination.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Zero loops, no scaffold; every sentence advances knowledge or image. Figurative vehicles are coherent—ice as lens, globe as garden—and culminate in the projection-beat without metaphor pile-up. Opening line anchors tone and mystery; final line releases in single frost-image. Clause variety and rhythmic taper in last paragraph earn the breath-held hush.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Synthesis of wreck-diver, dream-cameo triangulation, and glacial projectors feels inevitable yet fresh, not modular. Spirit-whisperer trope is inverted: she broadcasts, not banishes, turning the dead into living testimony. Risk in high-concept compression pays off: the entire world’s dream-stream shifts in one ice-flash without violating plausibility. Specificity of the melted ceramic village prevents generic “snow-globe” symbolism.</comment>
