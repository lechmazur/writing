<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied in early beats; contradictory impulses appear. Yet the decisive change—abandoning the compass—rests on a declared epiphany rather than a dramatized micro-choice under fresh pressure, so the cost reads asserted, not earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly as Decisive Change with visible cost: the compass sinks, foreclosing celestial navigation forever. Causal lens holds: each paddle stroke and pole sighting tightens options until the final jettison re-aligns life. Utility-pole method is seeded early and paid off, satisfying the taught-pattern test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Coastal fog, cold water, and tilting channel marker are filtered through navigator’s trained eye, constraining the only viable tactic—pole-sighting. Brass compass re-appears as micro-setting that charges the ending when discarded. Spatial choreography remains coherent across paddle and drift beats.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</comment>
<comment>Dominant stake—“align heart and action”—is signaled early and tightens when compass is jettisoned, trading false symbol for humble utility poles. One meaningful escalation: poles thin to zero, forcing abandonment of old identity. Cost is visible (loss of compass + public scream), though external pressure stays largely internalized.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Theme of re-navigation after failure emerges through concrete images—poles, fog, sinking brass—without sermon. Final image of walking pole-ward re-weights earlier shame into quiet acceptance. Avoids tidy moral; ambiguity remains in whether alignment will last.差点落入“merrily melancholic”的标签自证，但被叙事动作及时稀释。</comment>

<question>6</question><<grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited maintains consistent distance; perceptual signature salted with nautical diction (“cockpit,” “fix his position”). Rhythm modulates—long sentences for drift, short bursts for scream—mirroring psychic tide. No head-hopping; free-indirect compression is clean and purposeful.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>High information density: one sentence often conveys motion, setting, and emotion. Figurative language sparing and apt (“compass…a dead star”). Minor scaffold: four instances of “backlash of regrets” phrasing; not quite loop but cadence repetition slightly dulls final third. Otherwise clean, vivid, propulsive.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Navigation-by-utility-poles offers fresh twist on castaway trope; transformation of mundane infrastructure into lifeline feels inevitable. Emotional arc is familiar (grief to acceptance) but salvaged by specific nautical detail and compass jettison. Risk is moderate; could push further into sensory or structural experimentation.</comment>
