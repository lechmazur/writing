<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Elias’s interior contradiction—elegant craftsman vs. exposed manipulator—drives every beat; the tremoring hand, the stick’s weight, and the final renunciation of puppets all embody cost. Serenity cracks on-page, not in abstract confession. Yet the “uncommonly serene” tag is stated more than dramatized; one micro-choice under that trait would have pushed higher.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: failed puppet fable → Aiden’s accusation → Elias’s lone practice → public confession → stick passed to stranger. Closure is Earned Stasis: he abandons the art that once defined him, cost visible in the quiet surrender of the puppets. The radar dome setting and stick are returned to in the final paragraph, reweighting their first appearance; no orientation drift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The dome’s parabolic walls and meteor hush are not backdrop but acoustic mirrors that amplify Elias’s whispered fable and later his confession; the stick’s “worn smooth” texture becomes a tactile conscience. Spatial choreography stays clean across the two-shard move from dome to bar. The dome constrains the final image: a listening silence that replaces echoes with human rawness.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Primary stake—whether Elias can trade performance for truth—tightens once: he abandons the safety of crafted marionettes and invites unscripted pain. The on-stage reversal (confession instead of show) narrows his options to naked exposure; the woman’s raw story is the visible price he now has to host. Cost is legible, but the escalation is a single beat; no second tightening.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme—ethical storytelling cannot be pre-packaged—emerges through the stick’s journey from prop to burden to invitation. Subtext resides in silence: the dome’s echo-free hush mirrors Elias’s refusal to keep authoring other voices. The final image (tired woman holding the stick) reweights every prior polished fable without moralizing. No tidy thesis is stated; ambiguity is charged, not confusing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person lens stays close to Elias’s perceptual filter: calligrapher’s eye for “beautiful lies,” radar-tech metaphors (“node where machinery once listened”). Syntax tightens under stress—fragmented self-commands during the confession. No dialogue until the closing line, so voice distinction bullet is waived. The lyric compression (“meteor hush”) is pattern-taught early and repaid at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is taut, rhythm varied; no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is selective—“meteor hush,” “eye of a storm”—and never clusters to blur sense. Information density high: one sentence can carry setting, motion, and moral tremor. A single register drift—“conceptual repricing” in Q5 comment—is evaluator paraphrase, not text artifact, so no deduction.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The campfire stick as moral lie-detector is fresh; the decommissioned radar dome repurposed into echo-free confession booth is specific and memorable. Reversal is not a twist but a method dismantled—puppet theatre replaced by vulnerable orality. Risk is taken: climax is surrender of art, not spectacle. The synthesis feels inevitable yet non-obvious; no derivative template match.</comment>
