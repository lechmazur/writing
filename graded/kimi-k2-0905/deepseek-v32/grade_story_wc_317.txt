<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Interiority is evocative—“orthogonal approaches” doubles as signature trait and plot engine—but micro-choices stay cerebral; no embodied contradiction under pressure keeps her just below top band. Motivation is steady; the conservation pivot feels incremental rather than costly. Closure lands as crystallized resolve, not renunciation, so the 9+ quick test isn’t met.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure cleanly reweights the premise: seed = fragile ideas, escape room = activist platform; the Conceptual Repricing carries social cost under Accumulative lens. Orientation anchors by line 5; single transition to grove is legible. One tightening beat—map arrives—suffices. No因果 rupture; only minus is that corporate threat is off-stage, muting felt price on-page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>“Quiet brook” and “storm-born silence” return as charged mirror; micro-setting (seed on desk) re-enters closure image. Sensory selection stays auditory and tactile, filtered through puzzle-designer bias. Spatial choreography across brook split is coherent. Environment does not literally constrain tactics, so capped at 8.0 per 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“safeguard sanctuary”—is signaled early; map arrival forces upstream choice, narrowing options under Accumulative lens. Cost is thematic (business takeover) more than visceral; on-page price limited to a plaque inscription, keeping it shy of 8.5. No coincidence; escalation coherent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme—“innovation needs protected darkness”—emerges through seed-to-puzzle transformation; no explicit thesis. Final image of seed on desk reweights prior beats with conservation charge. Subtext in botanist’s silent plea adds depth. Avoids moralizing; ambiguity remains (will players act?).</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person hovers close to Elara’s puzzle-solver perception; diction (“orthogonal channels,” “cryptic bloom”) stays within botanist-lean lexicon. Rhythm modulates: longer sentences for brook flow, clipped fragments during revelation. No dialogue, so voice distinction N/A. Lyric repetitions (“across the hush…”) are patterned, paid off in last line.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>High information density: each sentence layers clue, metaphor, and emotional tilt. Varied sentence openings; no scaffold loops. Occasional elevated phrase (“charged with a storm-born silence”) risks purple but fits POV. One mixed metaphor—“flow from curiosity to determination”—minor turbulence, not near closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Fusing escape-room logic with eco-activism via corpse-flower metaphor is fresh; not a template echo. Could swap seed for another rare bloom without breaking armature, capping ascent to 8.0. Orthogonal framing and puzzle-map pay-off supply distinctive tilt. Risk is present but gentle.</comment>
