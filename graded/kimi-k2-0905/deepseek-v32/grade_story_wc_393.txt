<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Anselm’s interior contradiction—“hollow answers” vs. deliberate quest—grounds him; the embodied wince when the lullaby rings shows earned change. Micro-choice (carrying the felt-wrapped heart through rain) crystallizes his hierarchy of values. Missing: visible cost paid by Anselm himself; Eli remains off-stage so relational crucible is absent. Still, the renunciation of empty consolation is credible under causal lens.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Causal chain intact: snapped spring → chaplain’s promise → Alma’s diagnosis → repair → song → new stance. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: “apology was in the action of mending” reweights the premise with undeniable social cost (a convict’s hope validated by outsider labor). Light-beam beat is coincidence but complicates rather than resolves. Orientation anchored by 120 words; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Micro-setting rules: gear-filled shop constrains movement and attention; oil-and-rain scent anchors POV bias. The storm-break beam is a charged environmental actor that ignites the brass and triggers the thematic pivot. Spatial choreography clean; bodies and tools track. Details selective, never touristic; environment mirrors internal weather without overt symbol.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can broken worth be restored?—tightens when Alma prices the repair beyond a simple spring, forcing Anselm to wager his own credibility. One meaningful deepening: “deserve” conceptually reframed, foreclosing Eli’s self-condemnation. Cost is conceptual but legible (chaplain’s identity shift). Agency is present yet subtle; a sharper material forfeiture would push higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme—mending as moral act, not reward—emerges through gear imagery and the lullaby return, never stated. Subtext in Alma’s silence and Anselm’s thick-throated thanks carries the weight. Final image reconfigures prior material without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers: Eli may still die in prison, but the heart beats—earned complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Anselm’s perceptual filter: rain on cobblestones, *tick-tock-tinkle*, sudden gold blaze. Syntax lengthens under reflection, compresses during the release of song—rhythmic control serves pressure. No head-hopping; Alma’s interior withheld intentionally. Diction remains within clerical lexicon; no register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentence openings diversify. Information density high—“vibrant hush” packs oxymoron and stakes in two words. Zero loops or scaffold; no mixed metaphors. Occasional elevated phrase (“realm of tangible repair”) is motivated by Anselm’s vocation and does not obscure causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Clockwork heart as moral engine feels fresh; prison-confession-to-repair-shop trajectory is non-obvious. Transformation test fails if swapped to generic keepsake, so specificity earns keep. Risk is moderate—quiet lyric rather than bold formal experiment. Could push higher with sharper material stake or stranger angle.</comment>
