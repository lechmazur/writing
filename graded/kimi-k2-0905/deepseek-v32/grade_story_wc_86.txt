<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Aris’s reflective interiority is concrete and drives the gesture with the drawer pull; the “recycle mistakes into wisdom” motive is dramatized, not declared. Yet the emotional cost is muted—her final “subtle unknotting” is too tidy, lacking embodied contradiction under live risk. Still, micro-choices (offering the pull, proposing moon notes) credibly link prior guilt to present agency.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the captain’s curt nod and the abandoned pull reweight stakes, leaving forgiveness possible but unpaid. Causal chain is intact: past crossfire → apology → ritual modification → open future. Mist-moon cues anchor who/where by word 80; orientation test waived because disorientation serves closure. One tightening beat suffices under lyric lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Storm-worn parapet and clinging mist function as pressure vessel, narrowing vision and symbolically neutral ground. Drawer pull serves as micro-setting that constrains Aris’s gesture and charges the final image. Selective sensory layering (damp coat, wind-scoured stone) filters through her tactical gaze without tourist clutter. Spatial choreography is clean across the four-character walk.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will this ritual repeat bloodshed?—is signaled early; the drawer-pull gambit creates one meaningful tightening that forecloses silent hatred protocol. Cost is conceptual (loss of old certainty) rather than visceral; still legible on page. Moon window supplies coherent external pressure; captain’s nod is earned, not convenient.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of compartmentalization vs. connection emerges through the pull’s genealogy and moon-sync proposal, never sermonized. Final image of abandoned brass offers resonant non-literal answer: mechanisms must be risked to open. No thematic echo violations; ambiguity lingers in mist. Could use one more concrete counter-thread to reach 9.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Third-person lens stays tight to Aris’s perceptual signature—philosophical carpentry metaphors, lunar logistics—without head-hop. Syntax breathes with pressure: longer ruminative sentences contract to clipped ritual steps. Dialogue minimal but subtextual (“I will consider the mechanism”). No register drift or filter-verb stacks.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical yet propulsive; figurative layering is patterned early (mist = furrowed hush) and paid off. One paraphrase loop (“mist…hush…silence”) in opening costs −0.2. Otherwise density is high, rhythm varied, no mixed metaphors. Clean copy; opening and closing lines frame stakes and resonance.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Familiar war-ritual frame is refreshed by negotiator-engineer POV and celestial sync constraint. Drawer pull as non-weapon peace offering supplies fresh inflection. Risk is moderate—lyric meditation inside thriller template—but execution coherent. Not transformative enough for top band yet avoids trope checklist.</comment>
