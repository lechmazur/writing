<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation is legible and consistent; the interiority is lyrical but still specific to her perceptual filter. No contradictory impulse is staged in-scene—she succeeds without micro-choice that costs her—so the final “forever translating” feels gifted, not earned. Still, her bodily attention to the lens and the grotto details keep the character alive under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the threshold opens, she steps through, and the cost is the lifelong burden of translation—visible in the “forever” tag. Causal chain is thin (painting map → lens → ritual succeeds) but causality is not the primary lens; the piece reads Accumulative/Textural, and the final cadence shift reweights the stake cleanly. Orientation is achieved by ~100 words; no teleporting props.</comment>

<comment>The rooftop market and grotto are filtered through Elara’s translator-senses; every described object (bottled starlight, ochre-stained fingers, wet wall) nudges her toward choice. The lens itself functions as micro-setting that literally refracts the final threshold—meets the 9+ gate. Selective, urgent detail keeps description woven into action; no white-room lapses.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—retrieve lens to honor forgotten histories—is signaled early and deepened when the painting’s secret is “the forgotten paths of the lightkeepers.” One meaningful tightening: the perceptual price of becoming the bridge herself. Cost is conceptual (lifelong service) rather than viscerally felt on the page, keeping it from 8.5+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges inductively: remembrance as active, translational labor. Subtext lives in Silas’s pigment-stained hands and the silent lightkeeper-figures—no moralizing sentence spells it out. Final image of “sustained, luminous chord” reweights prior material without stating a thesis. One abstract noun too many (“conceptual cost”) slightly blurs the chord’s emotional charge.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric remains close to Elara’s perceptual bias: “scent like ozone and old roses,” “sea of echoes.” Syntax lengthens under wonder, shortens under task; no register drift. Dialogue is minimal but idiom-clean. No head-hop; psychic distance stable. Distinctive rhythm in “between childhood and now” refrain teaches pattern early and pays off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet breathable; varied sentence openings avoid drumbeat. Two adjacent phrases (“elusively tangible promise,” “elusively tangible yet utterly reliable”) recycle the required descriptor—minor loop, not at closure. Metaphors stay coherent (lens = key, bridge = self). No filter-verb stacks. High information ratio; every paragraph advances stake, image, or action.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>The “translator of overlooked histories” trope is refreshed by the painter who accepts cartographies of souls as payment and the lens that refracts thresholds rather than light. Accumulated specifics (knot from ghost ship, vial of quiet fog) make the magic feel proprietary. Risky aerial market and eternal-instant tone cohere without gimmickry. Not quite a 9 because the core plot arc remains standard fetch-and-ritual.</comment>
