<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara’s trait of “wilting near dishonesty” is shown rather than told—her hands shake when pigments crack under rationing, she avoids the market, truth-telling gains her passage—so contradiction and embodied cost register. The final shift from passive quester to active truth-etcher is legible, but because the council’s villainy is revealed by a map fragment rather than by her forced choice under live pressure, the interior cost feels managed rather than wrenching.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: shredded plate → reassembled map → undelivered-letter chamber → core plate exposing council theft → Elara’s decision to etch truth. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive within 120 words. Closure is a Decisive Change with conceptual cost: she forsakes quiet artistry for public accusation, carrying the zinc fragment as perpetual evidence—cost is legible in the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Greenhouse dome under toxic sky, cracked glass, rust-sealed door, and zinc plates glinting like fossils compress world-rules into tactile objects. Sensory selection stays tight to Elara’s body and tools; the postal network and hidden pipes guide her literal path. Setting constrains choice—avoiding the dishonest market, discovering the chamber—so micro-setting fulfills the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—truth versus survival under water lies—tightens once the map reveals council theft; options narrow to silent complicity or public accusation. Escalation is causal: each fragment click advances knowledge toward the irrevocable discovery. Cost is visible: she risks reprisal by disseminating proof. One meaningful turn suffices; no reliance on coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the postal fossil-image: conversations buried in metal outlast the liars who tried to erase them. Subtext resides in silence—the guard’s honesty momentarily revives her, the child’s dream sustains her—rather than exposition. Final image of gilded leaves reframes her art as living archive, a non-literal answer to “where lost conversations go.” No moralizing paragraph.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Third-person close tracks Elara’s selective attention—gold leaf, cracked pigment, zinc gleam—without filter-verb clutter. Rhythm mirrors her faltering stamina: shorter clauses under physical strain, longer when map pieces click. Compression (“She reread the assembled map”) efficiently telescopes time. Voice stays within her artisan lexicon; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Strong information density: one sentence often delivers setting, tool, and emotional cue (“Inside, stacks of zinc plates gleamed, each etched with decades of conversations”). Varied sentence openings avoid template cadence. Occasional elevated diction (“repository of lost words”) nudges register drift but remains consistent with archival motif; does not obscure causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Fusing calligraphy with fossilised postal plates gives a fresh inflection to the “recover lost truth” trope. The greenhouse city, toxic sky, and gilded leaves synthesize eco-dystopia with craft-based wonder without checklist feel. Transformation test passes: the emotional arc depends on her specific artisan tools and the zinc’s metallurgical permanence. Risk is moderate but coherent.</comment>
