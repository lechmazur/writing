<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s “listening” motive is stated early and re-asserted at the end, but interior contradiction is only asserted, not dramatized; she never faces a moment where listening costs her anything or collides with an opposite urge. Micro-choices (sitting silently, scanning the oak) are present yet register as low-stakes; the one visible cost is collective, not personal. The arc lands in an earned communal voice, but the protagonist’s own emotional price stays off-page, capping depth.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Causal chain is clear: locket → address → locked box → key in tree → letters → neighborhood speaks. Escalation arrives through shared threat (developer letter) that tightens time, but the actual unlocking beat is luck-guided (educated guess proves correct) rather than forcing a hard protagonist decision. Closure lands as Charged Poise: silence broken, future action implied, communal cost felt. The lens holds, yet the final causal turn hinges on convenient placement of the key.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Courtyard, fountain, oak, and mailbox row are economically re-used; the oak finally constrains the choice of where to search and then frames the reveal. Light and weather track emotional cadence without overt symbol overload. Spatial choreography stays clean across the crowd scene. While the world feels lived-in, no environmental detail actually endangers or limits Elara’s tactics; it decorates more than it pressures.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Primary stake—can Elara coax the neighborhood into speech before the developer divide-and-conquers?—is signaled once the corporate letter arrives and tightens when she stakes her method on silent presence. The tightening is single, not progressive, and the developer threat stays off-page after its intro, so pressure plateaus rather than intensifies. Cost is off-loaded onto the collective; Elara risks no personal loss, muting bite. Still, the communal voice-finding turns the story’s hinge and is causally linked to her tactic.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of “listening heals” emerges through dramatic structure rather than lecture: withheld speech (locked letters) literalizes emotional lock-down, and the unlocking precipitates collective articulacy. Final letter reweights earlier images (silence, locked box) without moralizing. Ambiguity remains—developer still looms, healing is nascent—yielding resonant after-image. One soft spot: Elara’s personal stake in the theme is asserted more than tested.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited keeps tight focalization on Elara; perceptual signature is consistent—her “discerning” eye filters light, cobbles, mailbox brass. Syntax stays controlled, with rhythmic lift at reveal (“the key turned with a gritty sigh”). No dialogue, so voice shows through free-indirect precision. A faint editorial sheen intrudes in elevated diction (“sandstorm calm,” “conceptual repricing”), but it feels intentional, mirroring her curatorial distance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is lean, vivid, and largely loop-free; sentences advance at least two jobs (image + interior or motion). One scaffold hiccup: “shared anxiety… shared threat” in adjacent clauses. Metaphors (sandstorm, locked heart) recur but stay coherent. Final paragraph drifts toward abstract uplift (“ready for new tracks”), slightly diluting the concrete after-image; still, clarity and momentum hold through closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Combines thrift-store curator, unopenable locket, locked mailbox, and activist listening into a fresh configuration; the道具 literalize emotional muteness in a way that feels inevitable once revealed. Developer-intrusion catalyst is familiar, but its off-stage menace keeps focus on communal process rather than polemic. Risk is moderate—quiet crowd scene over showdown—yet specificity of pianist backstory and ribboned letters lifts it above allegory. Not radically new, but the synthesis is memorable.</comment>
