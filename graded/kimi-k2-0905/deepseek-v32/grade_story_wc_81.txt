<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elara’s calm cataloguer persona is consistent and embodied through tactile stamp-handling, but her interiority edges into textbook self-diagnosis (“her mind operated like a catalog”). The final micro-choice—adding her own stamp—pays off earlier setup, yet the cost feels intellectual rather than visceral; no contradictory impulse or visible price lingers after the blackout.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: blackout ➔ digital index dies ➔ candlelit stamp comparison ➔ multi-indexer discovery ➔ Elara extends chain. Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the manuscript’s origin shifts from point to process, stamped with undeniable conceptual cost. One non-closure hiccup: “reclaimed stillness” is declared repeatedly before the reader feels it.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The vaulted, water-damaged library is sketched through touch and smell, and the antique stamp serves as micro-setting that constrains every move. Spatial choreography stays stable in the single beam of candlelight. The final image—the fresh stamp beside ancient ones—recharges the setting without overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—prove or reframe the Annals’ origin—lands early and tightens when the blackout removes digital crutches. The mid-story micro-turn (multiple stamp variants) narrows options and raises the cost of error. No visible price is extracted from Elara herself; the cost is purely epistemic, keeping the score below the 8.8 gate.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges inductively: authorship as communal accretion rather than solitary genius. The closing image of layered stamps reweights all prior cataloguing without moralizing. One echo of prompt-language (“trace honest origins”) is thinly dramatized; a sharper subtextual beat could have pushed higher.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elara; perceptual signature is precise, stamp-centric, and rhythmically controlled. Occasional elevated diction (“tranquilly perceptive,” “conceptual repricing”) feels authored rather than lived, but the cadence supports the librarian persona. No head-hopping or filter-verb clusters.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; information density is high without purple overload. One scaffold loop: “reclaimed stillness” recurs four times with near-paraphrase. Metaphors (dappled shadows/mirrored resolve) stay coherent and tied to candlelight; no mixed vehicles intrude on the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Sunken-library + stamp-provenance is a fresh synthesis; the communal-indexer angle reframes the lone-scholar trope. Risk is moderate—quiet epistemic victory rather than spectacle—but the piece commits fully. A tighter external stake (career, oxygen, rival scholar) could have elevated the ingenuity further.</comment>
