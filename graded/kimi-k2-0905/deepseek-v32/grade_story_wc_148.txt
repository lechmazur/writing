<question>1</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The son’s guilt-shame nexus is present but abstract; “chasing hush” functions more as refrain than embodied want. No contradictory impulse is dramatized in-scene; acceptance feels pre-ordained rather than hard-won. Micro-choices are limited to upward climbing and lattice-placement—gestural, not value-revealing. Cost is asserted (“curse of disbelief”) rather than felt on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Closure earns a quiet CR: the lattice’s glow reweights the father’s lies into a sustainable myth, silence now a conceptual price. Causality is lyric-associative rather than tight because/therefore; “hovering between truth and myth” stands in for physical stakes. Orientation is lyrically delayed but ultimately functional under Accumulative/Textural lens. The single tightening—the lattice’s activation—legible but low-heat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stone spiral, copperlight, salt-whispered walls: sensory triangulation is economical and biased to POV mood. Lighthouse beam as geometry-bending device teaches the impossibility rule early and charges the final glow. Spatial choreography stays minimalist yet coherent; no impossible positions. Micro-setting (lattice) doubles as talisman, constraining the final gesture.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—convert inherited lies into livable truth—remains abstract; on-page pressure is atmospheric, not tactical. Escalation is textural accretion of salt, rust, echo; no narrowing of external options. Cost is conceptual (myth-ownership) rather than visceral; price is acknowledged but not dramatized as forfeiture. Single meaningful turn: lattice glow maps labyrinth meaning, qualifies as CR under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of intergenerational credibility emerges through mirrored lighthouse & lattice images rather than explicit thesis. Subtext resides in silence vs. alarm, passive hovering vs. active confession—an elegant inversion of the fable. Final silence reweights prior noise without moralizing; ambiguity between myth-creation and self-trap lingers. Minor deduction for refrain “before they find the bodies” never materializing as corporeal stakes.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lyric-compressed diction sustains hypnotic cadence; patterned elision (“thread the labyrinth,” “copperlight repose”) taught early and paid off in final image. Perceptual signature is consistent—meditative, salt-stung, attentive to refracted light. No dialogue, so voice coherence rides on internal rhythm, which modulates from hesitation to resolved hush. Filter-verb use minimal and motivated; metaphors stay within nautical-familial register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Sentences breathe with variable rhythm; no template cadence detected. Occasional stacked epithet (“copperlight repose,” “salt of years”) flirts with density but supports tone. No synonym loops or paraphrase clutter; scaffolding mostly trimmed. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and image cleanly; minor dock for abstract noun “impossibilities” repeated without concrete re-anchoring.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Inherits fable yet flips moral: son weaponizes silence instead of warning, an inventive reversal. Lighthouse-as-prison that sustains myth rather than prevents wreck is fresh conceptual twist. Risk taken with lyric stasis over dramatic action; coherence holds. Could swap coastal setting with minor loss, keeping transmutation of lie-into-myth core—slight ceiling on irreplaceability.</comment>
