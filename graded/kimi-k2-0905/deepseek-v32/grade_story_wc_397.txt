<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses—death-wish vs. listening-urge—are dramatized in concrete beats (volunteer chores, cradling the parasol tip). Interiority is textured and body-anchored (“gripped reality loosely” as tactile stance). The final renunciation of suicide is earned through prior causal listening; cost is legible. Some moments flirt with therapy-speak (“learning to hear the moments before silence”) but are grounded by sensory action.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: she shelves suicide and pockets the parasol tip, a charged refusal with felt cost. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern of listening beats tightens to the fisherman’s sigh that reweights her stake. Orientation clear by 120 words; no teleporting props. The single tightening is sufficient; however, the causal hook between “waking changed” and first volunteer shift is slightly under-dramatized, keeping it just below 9.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Drift-ice marina is filtered through perceptual bias—ice creaks, pine-rot wind—guiding her patience practice. The parasol tip operates as micro-setting/object, constraining her attention and returning in the final image. Selective sensory hierarchy mirrors inner thaw; no white-room syndrome. Environment never over-described; each detail performs pressure or solace.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—learn sound of endings vs. claim her own ending—signaled early. One meaningful deepening: fisherman’s sigh crystallizes the sound, foreclosing suicide option with audible cost. Pressure accrues through accumulative listening beats rather than causal reversals, coherent under chosen lens. No coincidence; option is narrowed by her own attention.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly: patience as active vigil, endings as soft release not crash. Final image of pocketing the parasol tip reprices suicide from solution to postponed eavesdropping. No moralizing; resonance carried by wind-breath and lace snap. Ambiguity survives—she may still die later, but now as listener—yielding lasting after-effect.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains steady psychic distance, perceptual signature of loosened grip rendered through watercolor-smeared syntax. No head-hopping; diction stays within her lexicon. Rhythm modulates: longer clauses for drift, fragmentary bursts for lace snap. Dialogue sparse and subtextual (manager exchange).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong read-aloud rhythm, varied sentence openings, high density—lines carry image + motion + interiority simultaneously. Metaphors consistent (watercolor, lace, wind) without mixed vehicles. One paraphrase loop detected (“windborne solace” echoed twice in close proximity) but does not stall momentum. Zero filter-verb clusters; verbs are muscular, nouns specific.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Euthanasia-tourist turned disaster-listener is fresh angle; “fold in patience” concept intellectual but embodied through lace and ice. Familiar flood-volunteer frame redeemed by sonic stakes. Risk taken in quiet, accumulative structure pays off. Could edge higher if sonic motif carried more idiosyncratic detail unique to this coastline.</comment>
