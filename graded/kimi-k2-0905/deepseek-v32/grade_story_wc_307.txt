<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Anya’s reverse-aging biology is never allowed to texture her perceptions; it functions as a label. The withheld-teach motive is clear, but Leo’s frustration reads as a single register (“frustration marring his brow”) rather than embodied contradiction. The climactic diffusion is shown through pond reflection—an elegant external trace of internal shift—yet the cost to Anya of accelerating his vanish is only asserted, not felt.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: Leo’s vanishing reweights the rule-set—he is present to reality by refusing surface perception. The “wavelength it has forgotten how to sense” line makes the new rule undeniable. Causal linkage holds: each stone drop is a because/therefore tutor that silently deletes Leo’s resistance. Cost is visible in the final image—his body gone from the water—so the 9+ gate is met.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The magnetic grotto is not backdrop; its crystalline hum is the active teacher, literally pulling Leo out of phase. Micro-setting—pond surface as mirror/tuner—constrains every beat. Spatial choreography is immaculate: platform above / cavern below / starlight fissures thread the vertical axis without drift. Final image recharges the grotto’s silence as home, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“can Leo disappear”—is signaled in paragraph one. Escalation is Accumulative/Textural: each ripple pattern deepens the same lesson, tightening until Leo surrenders effort. Visible price: his reflection literally erased from the pond. One meaningful intensification suffices; no reversal needed under this lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges without thesis: visibility = interference; invisibility = harmonic alignment. The postponed verbal payoff mirrors the delayed revelation device, so form enacts meaning. Final reconfiguration invites counter-reading—vanishing is not escape but deeper appearance—yet ambiguity remains legible. No sermonizing; the pond’s last ring does the talking.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person omniscient stays distant but consistent, matching parable tone. Perceptual signature is light, yet “sycamore hush” and “magnetic grotto” carry lyric compression without purple drift. Dialogue is minimal and indirection-heavy—“It aligns them to a different frequency”—fitting withheld-teach method. No head-hop; voice remains steady.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm breathes with trance dilation: long sentences for stillness, fragments for ripple beats. No scaffold loops; each sentence advances image or pressure. Metaphors (pond as tuner, rock as lesson) stay coherent and mutually reinforcing. Closing line “welcomed him home” risks softness but is earned by prior acoustic hush.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Reverse-aging tutor + vanish-by-alignment is a fresh synthesis of familiar mystic tropes. Risky second-person instruction style (“you do not shout”) is held at parable distance, avoiding self-help taint. The pond-stone pattern as sole teaching technology is elegant and non-obvious. Transformation test: swap names and the concept collapses—proof of specificity.</comment>
