<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid, tactile, and lore-specific; her archivist instincts surface in how she handles memory-glass and crystal pages. The looping purgatory gives her flaw-driven blindness (she can question debris but not speak to the past), and the final endurance—rising from catatonia to walk toward a rebuilt library—carries visible cost. Yet the diary’s truth arrives more as oracle than as consequence of her micro-choices; the decisive change feels slightly external, capping the “earned” criterion at 8.0 threshold.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the loop shatters because Elara physically retrieves and reads the encrypted diary; the cost is the searing vision she must now carry and broadcast. Causal chain holds—debris question → wind cue → lagoon → crystal lock → truth vision; each step tightens options under the Situational lens. One minor wobble: the wind’s “answer” is more oracle than mechanical payoff of her debris question, so lens purity dips by a hair.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Zeppelin, obsidian lagoon, and crystal pages are sharply sensed and POV-filtered; the lagoon’s light-swallowing property literally swallows the fire-light of her memory, charging the final image. Spatial choreography is flawless across shards. The lagoon and crystal diary both constrain choice (she must wade, must risk burning the lock), satisfying the 9+ gate for object-as-setting; environment actively shapes tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—break the memory loop by uncovering the real archive—signals early and tightens through each shard. The diary discovery represents a genuine deepening that reweights the “hopeful letters” as decoy; visible price is the irreversible vision of state atrocities she must now carry. Agency is present but once again the wind-cue is half-coincidence; not quite the persistent constraint needed for 8.8+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges as the cost of unredacted truth: sanitized hope versus unspeakable record. The crystal diary’s literal translucence mirrors the opacity of official archives; the searing vision re-prices her life’s work without sermonizing. Final image—walking to rebuild—offers Charged Poise rather than a moral, letting ambiguity linger.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise; syntax compresses under loop-pressure (“retrocognitively trapped,” “phantom wind”) and widens during lagoon calm. No head-hopping; POV distance stable. Occasional elevated diction (“seared into this looping reverie”) risks register drift but stays anchored to Elara’s scholarly lexicon; rhythm modulates with pressure effectively.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and image-rich yet propulsive; no scaffold loops or mixed metaphors. Sensory verbs avoid filter-trap (“the scent of burning parchment acrid and eternal”). One tiny over-cluster of figuratives in the fire-to-aftermath sentence, but clarity remains intact. Closure line “walked toward the library to rebuild” lands clean and rhythmic.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Retrocognitive-purgatory inside a burning zeppelin-library is fresh synthesis; using beach-debris typography to parley with memory is non-obvious and specific. The hopeful-letters-as-decoy twist reweights familiar civil-rights tropes. Risky structure—mosaic shards inside a loop—pays off with legible closure. Conceptual integrity holds; no retreat into safer realism.</comment>
