<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elara’s solitude, temporal stretch, and inherited vocation are sharply embodied; her contradictory impulses—to map a dead sky yet still hope—co-exist in the same beats. The compass-touching micro-choice recurs with rising cost, culminating in the engine-fire that spends the station’s last power. One minor slip: the millennia-old light is called “an artifact” twice in adjacent sentences, a tiny paraphrase loop that momentarily flattens interiority. Still, her final smile carries visible cost: she trades eternity for uncertain motion.</comment>

<comment>Causal lens holds throughout: because the dilation field isolates her, therefore she maps; because the surge reveals a fresh coordinate, therefore she re-orients and burns the last power. Closure is a Decisive Change—time-knot unwinds, real-time re-asserts—paid for by the station’s permanent exhaustion. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are taught by word 50 and never drift. The final image reconfigures the premise: “true north” is no longer a fixed star but a live signal, a conceptual re-pricing with undeniable cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The dome of transparent alloy, the dark navigation panel, and the gilded compass form a micro-setting triad that literally constrains every choice; engines can fire only once, compass rose must be touched to plot. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: echoed silence > starfield stasis > metallic groan. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly as Elara crosses the deck, settles at the console, and feeds power. The station’s final shudder externalizes internal shift—environment and body merge in the closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—escape the dilation pocket or remain fossilized—is signaled in line 3 and tightened when the new coordinate appears. Escalation is causal: each system she awakens reduces future options; the last surge spends irrecoverable power. Cost is legible in the station’s groan and the final hum replacing silence. No coincidence; the fresh star is either external beacon or self-generated map-key, either way paid for by her irrevocable engine burn.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the reversal of “true north” from static heritage to live vector, a conceptual re-pricing earned by her family ritual. The sketch custom is not motif garnish; it is the epistemic tool that lets her parse the impossible coordinate. Subtext operates in silence and starlight rather than declaration. Final smile reframes isolation as autonomy—quiet, unsentimental resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight inside Elara’s perceptual filter: “echoed silence,” “sluggish drum,” “cold geometry.” Syntax lengthens and compresses with temporal stretch—long clauses mimic dilated time, then fragment at engine ignition. Compass rose is never named “指南针”; diction stays within her inherited lexicon. No head-hop, no filter-verb stacks. Voice is distinct, consistent, and rhythmic under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence advances stakes, image, or rhythm. Information density is high: “blessed pariah” compresses genealogy + exile in two words. Metaphors are spare and physically grounded—“bubble of echoed silence,” “time’s knot.” Final line cadence mirrors engine hum: three stressed beats, soft shudder, then lift. Minor alliteration (“profound pressure”) is intentional and pays off in sonic closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Familiar tropes—lone keeper, time dilation, generational star-maps—are re-animated through tactile specificity and the inversion of “true north” from relic to live vector. The station’s groan becoming first sound after silence is a fresh auditory image. Risk in taking 70 % of word count before external motion is rewarded by causal inevitability: only her stretched years allow the math to escape. Synthesis feels inevitable, not gimmicked.</comment>
