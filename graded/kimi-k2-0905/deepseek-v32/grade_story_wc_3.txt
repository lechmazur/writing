<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elara’s kindly-methodical trait and quiet longing are shown through tactile care of tablets and the seed, but interior contradiction is thin; the “haunted urgency” is named more than dramatized. Micro-choices (planting the seed, watching, final hand on stalk) track cleanly, yet no beat forces her to risk her methodical safety or confront a wrong assumption. Closure lands as gentle acceptance, but the cost feels symbolic rather than personal—no path is foreclosed on-page. Enough specificity to feel individual, but emotional stakes plateau early.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of latency-to-expression (tablet, spirit, seed) builds density until the bloom releases light. Orientation is swift and spatially coherent; transitions from seed to bloom are legible. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—release re-weights loss as completion; cost is conceptual (resonant silence) rather than felt consequence. One soft spot: the decisive change is observational; Elara doesn’t act in the final moment, she understands, so cost is muted.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Magnetic arbor is rendered through selective sensory anchors—iron vines, charged soil, cool thin air—each filtering Elara’s professional eye. The floating tablets double as micro-setting that constrains her gentle movements, integrating world rule with character action. Crystalline bloom’s magnetic spiral literalizes unseen forces, charging the final image. No description exceeds narrative need; every detail either guides choice or mirrors internal shift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—understanding transition—remains abstract; no external force threatens failure or irreversible loss. Pressure accumulates via pattern repetition (latent → expressed) rather than narrowing options; plant growth is observation, not contest. One meaningful deepening: bloom’s detachment mirrors Anshar, crystallizing her stance. Cost is conceptual silence, not a palpable price that alters future action.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Theme of release-as-completion emerges organically from iterated transitions—tablet wedges, dissipated spirit, seed bloom—without authorial thesis. Final image of “resonant silence” reweights prior grief into acceptance, achieving Conceptual Repricing. Subtext operates in mirrored departures (Anshar/light-spark) rather than exposition. Avoids tidy moral; ambiguity lingers, though emotional aftereffect is gentle rather than searing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays close to Elara’s scholarly perceptual filter—“fossil of a spoken word,” “mapping unseen energies”—syntax calm, Latinate, methodical. Rhythm subtly lengthens during bloom eruption, then returns to quiet cadence, mirroring release. No head-hopping; diction stays within her lexicon. One clause drifts toward editorial (“physics of transition”) but overall voice is coherent and distinctive.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, syntactically varied, and image-dense; no loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Figurative language is sparse, purposeful—“fossil of a spoken word,” “resonant silence”—each earns its place. Sentence propulsion never stalls; paragraphs advance knowledge or atmosphere. Copy is clean; opening and closing lines frame stakes and resolution effectively.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Floating cuneiform library above clouds is fresh; seed that grows by tracing magnetic force-lines deepens the novelty. Conceptual linkage of linguistic fossil → spirit latency → bloom release feels inevitable in hindsight, not pre-fab. Emotional core (grief as completion) transcends trope. Risk is moderate—quiet lyric close rather than spectacle—but execution justifies the choice.</comment>
