<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Aris’s forensic discipline and the way it collapses when physics folds feel specific; his decision to “map the echo” rather than file a believable report is a credible renunciation with visible cost. Interiority is concrete, never diagnostic. Yet he is alone throughout—no status crucible—so relationship and secondary-pressure bullets are waived; what matters is the solitary perceptual arc, which holds. The only limit: we never see a prior belief system that is overturned; the investigator persona is steady-state, so the “change” is more stance-crystallization than overturned flaw, keeping this just under the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a textbook Conceptual Repricing: the containers form a gravity-wound, the plane has been “translated,” and the new normal is a gentle breeze carrying conceptual cost—“some convergences leave only questions shaped like answers.” Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: wind data, patch, and silence accrete until pattern-break reweights reality. No causal antagonist is needed; the tightening is the recognition that the world’s rules have bent. Orientation, stakes, and single transition (climb-descend) are clean; cost is the investigator’s exile into permanent watch, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The port labyrinth is not backdrop; its geometry funnels wind and finally conceals the translated mass, directly shaping both investigation and closure. Micro-settings—container alley vacuum, core hollow—are tactile and bias-filtered through Aris’s anemometer gaze. Sensory hierarchy obeys professional priorities: eddies before rust, pressure before color. One hairline slip: “city gone silent” is announced before we feel it synaesthetically, a micro-withhold that slightly dilutes anchor urgency, holding this at 8.7 rather than 9+.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake is legible early: can Aris turn hindsight into a shield against future folds? Pressure escalates via pattern-break—the wind learns him—rather than classical reversals. The tightening moment is the aerial map reveal: the funnel geometry forecloses the possibility of a debris field and forces a conceptual pivot. Cost is psychic exile; options narrow to “listening to the quiet,” fulfilling the 8-band demand for a visible price that charges the final image.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the investigator’s tools failing him: foresight becomes endless vigil rather than prediction. The flight-patch reweights from clue to relic of ontological fracture; the breeze outward is an ironic anti-debris field. No moral is stated; the final sentence’s “questions shaped like answers” invites sustained epistemic dread. Ambiguity is meaningful, not evasive, reaching the 9-territory albeit with a hairline gap: town-silence as psychic shockwave is declared more than dramatized.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Aris’s perceptual bandwidth; anemometer readings and wind notation function as interior monologue in tool-language. Syntax is controlled, rhythmic, slightly pressurized—“a torrent shepherded through this man-made gorge, accelerating to a scream no one heard”—without overwriting. No dialogue, so voice distinction bullet is waived. Patterned elision (“the plane had simply ceased to be”) is taught early and paid off at closure; compression never breaks clarity, meeting the 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Line-level density is high—almost every sentence layers wind data, bodily sensation, and conceptual inference. Metaphors are spare and coherent: “peeling wings like paper” is brief, physical, apt. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; varied sentence openings create forward propulsion. One tiny overwrite cluster mid-climb (“towering labyrinth…terrible geometry”) drops this a hair under 9.0, but artifacts never touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Vanishing-aircraft trope is inverted: no twist, no aliens, just a fold in physics that leaves a breeze and a patch. The fusion of forensic procedural with ontological rupture feels fresh, yet inevitable once the container-funnel map locks in. Risk is taken with lyric ellipsis rather than explanatory scaffolding, and it pays off. Specificity of wind behavior and investigator ritual prevents the concept from feeling generic; transformation test passes—story collapses without these exact particulars.</comment>
