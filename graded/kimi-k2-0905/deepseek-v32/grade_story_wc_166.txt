<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The protagonist’s contradictory impulses—yearning for forbidden memory yet accepting exile—are dramatized in every gesture; the moonstone speck becomes a literal pivot for her renunciation, and the final inscription leaves a felt cost (the chill-warmth under skin) that forecloses return to sea or city. Interiority is concrete, never diagnostic: “she danced the spaces between Pleiades” fuses occupation, emotion, and worldview in one stroke. No secondary characters appear; the garden and sky act as crucible, pressure supplied by the regulated void itself. The earned stasis—she is now “full” in irreversible solitude—rings inevitable from the first anchored speck.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens is declared early—verse built by “observing gaps”—and each dance paragraph thickens pattern until the final inscription crystallizes meaning with visible cost (moonstone released, skin tingling). Orientation is swift: “twilight garden high in the silent cliffs” anchors who/where/by-word-30. Closure is a Charged Poise: the new day bleeds light, her smile a quiet coronation, options reweighted—she bears an internal scripture no ban can reach. Persistent constraint: the cosmos now prints her every heartbeat; exile is irreversible medium.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The dome of woven stone, open sky, night-blooming jasmine, and cold marble benches are not backdrop but drafting surface—every sweep of limb navigates real distances. The moonstone speck functions as micro-setting/compass, constraining choreography; its loss into soil at dawn marks the canvas complete. Spatial choreography is immaculate: we track her collar bone, sweeping arm, center of dome, eastern rim. Sensory hierarchy obeys dancer perception: starlight as “cool applause,” jasmine scent a faint edge to void.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</question>
<comment>Dominant stake—cosmic verse or oblivion—is signaled in paragraph one; each dance tightens by accretion, not reversal. The speck’s anchoring is the single decisive intensification: chaotic sky resolves into personal chart, foreclosing further hesitation. Cost is legible: year of nocturnal solitude, final trembling radiance, moonstone surrendered forever. No external coincidence; pressure is the unregulated dark itself.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.3</question>
<comment>Theme emerges solely through image and motion: exile as arrival, solitude as canvas, void as scripture. The final smile reweights “nostalgia ban” from oppression into unintended gift—freedom to write the unregulated. No explicit thesis; meaning resides in the body’s invisible tattoo. Ambiguity lingers: is her verse rebellion or complicity? The story refuses to choose, letting dawn’s ignorant light keep the question open.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</question>
<comment>Voice is lyric-omniscient yet anchored to dancer perception: verbs like “fledge,” “trace,” “draft” stay inside her kinesthetic lexicon. Rhythm mirrors tidal inhalations—long sentences swell, then fracture at speck-drop. No dialogue; none needed. Patterned repetition (“she danced… she danced…”) is taught early and pays off in final inscription cadence. Diction never exceeds coastal-born celestial reader: “obsidian grace” is precisely hers.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</question>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or motion. Metaphors are coherent: sky as parchment, starlight as ink, skin as page—no mixed vehicles. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image that recharges “obsidian grace.” Paragraph cuts coincide with dawn threat, creating visual breath before last inscription. High density: “terrestrial blooms brushed against constellations” does world, body, and scale in eight words.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</question>
<comment>The “nostalgia ban” trope is inverted—exile becomes elective studio, not punishment. Mapping void between stars onto mortal skin is fresh synthesis of dancerly and cosmic. Risky structural choice: no conflict scene, only accretive lyric; payoff is the invisible tattoo that can’t be confiscated. Would fail if transferred to generic rebel—tide dancer’s bone-knowledge makes the premise particular.</comment>
