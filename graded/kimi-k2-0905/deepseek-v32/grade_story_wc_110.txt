<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Leo’s transparency motive is embodied in the quiet act of auditing; the moment he holds the lens over the ticket we feel contradictory impulses—fear of scandal versus duty to the absent Elara. The micro-choice to project the image onto the forecourt wall crystallizes his hierarchy of values and carries visible social cost as Silas’s face crumples. Interiority stays concrete, but the epiphany phrase “freed by honesty” edges toward label-speak, muting the full bite of contradiction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The lens reveal is a clean causal pivot: because Leo fits glass to paper, hidden routing codes snap into knowledge, therefore the board’s cover-up collapses. Closure lands as Charged Poise—staff grouped under the projected truth, mistrust thawed by shared sight—cost felt in Silas’s whispered admission. One minor scaffold: “words had, indeed, become unnecessary” restates the silence already shown.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The wet crystal forecourt is no postcard; its mirrored surface literally hosts the final projection, turning paving stones into screen and witness. Rain-slick reflections echo the staff’s unburdened faces, binding setting to closure. Spatial choreography stays crisp as Leo moves from archive to auditorium to tech closet without drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore staff trust—tightens when the lens converts ambiguous doodles into irrevocable evidence, foreclosing the option to keep doubting Elara. Leo’s decision to stage a public projection exacts social cost on the board, escalating pressure under causal lens. Cost is legible yet diffuse; no single personal loss is foregrounded, keeping the score just shy of the 8.8 gate.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the refractive motif: truth literally requires the right focus; transparency is an optic, not a slogan. The final image of reconciliatory tones against the still-whispering forecourt reweights “honesty” from abstract virtue to shared vulnerability. Subtext stays in glances and wet stone rather than thesis statements, though the phrase “freed by honesty” nudges toward explicitness.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Leo’s perceptual bias—he clocks clicks, glints, strained voices—without head-hop. Syntax leans lyrical but patterned: repeated “whispered/whispering” teaches the hush motif early and pays off in the last line. Dialogue is sparse yet distinct; Silas’s clipped “We thought Elara was the thief” carries resignation, not exposition.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is rhythm-alive: varied sentence lengths mimic Leo’s cautious tread, then tighten into short beats during the lens reveal. Figurative language is selective—“wet crystal paving stones gleaming under a washed sky” condenses atmosphere without spillage. No synonym loops or filter-verb stacks; information density stays high. A single mixed nuance: “ambiguously clear” recurs as intentional oxymoron but risks calling attention to itself.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The embezzlement-via-doodle blueprint feels fresh because the lens optic reverses expectation: the artifact is accusation, not instruction. Forecourt-as-projection-screen converts a static lobby into active evidentiary surface, a risk that pays off. While corporate fraud in arts venues is familiar, the refractive reveal and collective silent gaze lend a singular shimmer just short of breakthrough.</comment>
