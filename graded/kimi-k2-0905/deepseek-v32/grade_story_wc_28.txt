<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Interiority is evocative (“warm coldness” refrain) but drifts toward thesis-statement therapy-speak (“gentle radical,” “aberrant mercy”) rather than contradictory impulse in scene. Micro-choices are present (aligning tessera, speaking name) yet the turn feels pre-explained; the cost is asserted (“steel-clad world”) not embodied. Flaw is mid-band; still, the arc of renaming mercy is legible and motive never breaks.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands: the plaza mosaic literally rewrites mercy (“Khalish”) and the sky softens—an on-page CR with conceptual cost. Causality holds under Accumulative/Textural lens; pattern of past visions → present stone → renaming tightens once. Orientation is clean within 120 words. The retrocognitive beat is a slight convenience—tessera vision delivers the name rather than forcing a harder discovery—but the rule is internally consistent. Non-closure nudge: a crisper causal trigger before the tessera click would tighten the turn.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Shattered kaleidoscope sky and plaza stones are filtered through Elara’s touch and urgency; sensory triage favors texture under fingertips over visual catalog. Cobalt tessera functions as micro-setting that constrains retrocognitive risk and final placement. Place anchors early; spatial choreography clean. Atmosphere supports theme without overt symbolism. Slight over-repetition of “chipped patterns” dulls specificity, but environment actively shapes the ritual and reappears in the softened sky—meets 9+ gate for constraining final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“rename mercy before council ban destroys it”—is signaled early. Escalation is singular but real: retrocognitive visions intensify, forcing a naming decision that narrows her world position. Cost is conceptual (she becomes outlaw) rather than visceral; no tangible loss (blood, ally, tool) is dramatized, keeping pressure abstract. Just misses high-band because the tightening beat feels cerebral, not tactical.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete ritual: mercy re-coded as “sheltered strength” via stone pattern. Subtext operates in silence—plaza “breathes” after renaming—implying structural shift without sermon. Final image reweights prior fire-scarred world; ambiguity remains (council reprisal). Avoids explicit moral; resonance is earned. Therapy labels (“gentle radical,” “aberrant mercy”) surface-state once each; minimal deduction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Elara; perceptual signature favors synesthetic temperature (“warm coldness”) and stone-touch. Syntax is controlled, with purposeful repetition that teaches pattern. No dialogue; narration avoids filter overload. One register lift—“conceptual repricing” voice nudges academic near end—doesn’t rupture. Meets 9+ test for coherent texture under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Strong read-aloud rhythm; sentence variety good. Information density high—most lines twin-task (action + image). Two micro-loops: “chipped patterns” x3, “warm coldness” x5; not scaffold but noticeable. Mixed metaphor risk (“sky did not heal but shattered into… kaleidoscope”) passes because world rule is consistent. No artifacts touch closure. Cap holds at 7.0 for repetition; ceiling 8.8 per global rule.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Post-apocalyptic mercy-through-mosaic is fresh synthesis; tessera-as-cognitive-trap gives speculative bite. Renaming as political act reframes standard resistance trope. Details particular to this plaza and cobalt shard. Final reconfiguration feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Derivative drift minor—shattered sky trope familiar—but execution is specific enough. Risks lyric compression and succeeds.</comment>
