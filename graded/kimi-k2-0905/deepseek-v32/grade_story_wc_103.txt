<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—yearning to touch the past yet imprisoned by it—drives every beat; the embodied tremor in her hands as the photograph unweaves makes the renunciation legible. The micro-choice to push the vision into the maze’s geometry crystallizes her hierarchy of values: release over possession. Cost is visible: the halo dims, the photo vanishes, her body collapses. One flaw: “quaking reverie” is repeated verbatim and drifts toward label-speak at peak intensity (−0.2).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Decisive Change: retrocognitive grip severed, photograph erased, Elara freed. Causal chain holds: hyperbolic maze + fragment + will = unweave. Orientation anchored by sentence 3; no teleporting props. The final image of her trembling hands reweights all prior material with undeniable conceptual cost. Late rule change absent; persistent constraint (fragment now inert) shapes the hush that follows.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The living bridge garden is not backdrop but instrument: vines realign along saddle curves, air vibrates, leaves rustle in recuperative rhythm after the unweaving. Micro-setting—the pedestal of living stone—literally supports the catalytic act. Sensory hierarchy skews tactile and olfactory (woven willow rails, lavender ghost-scent), filtering through Elara’s designer eye. Spatial choreography tracks her collapse without drift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“discover the texture of time or remain trapped”—is signaled in paragraph 1. One meaningful tightening: when the vision is forced into the hyperbolic lattice, options narrow to continue reliving or risk obliteration. The disintegration itself is the irreversible price that forecloses return to the old cycle. Agency is cerebral yet causal; no coincidence rescues her.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: memory must be physically relinquished to build future bridges. The fading photograph’s complete erasure is the non-literal answer—no moral appended. Subtext resides in the garden’s recuperative sigh, contrasting human exhaustion. Complexity remains: loss is both wound and liberation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays pinned to Elara; no head-hop. Diction—“pearlescent,” “saddle-shaped,” “verdant rails”—is within a designer’s lexicon. Syntax lengthens under retrocognitive assault, then fractures into filament fragments, mirroring unweaving. Rhythm modulates from measured pace to rending-silk staccato and back to recuperative hush.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Sentence variety is purposeful; no template cadence. Information density high: “she pushed the vision through the lens of the curved maze” compresses cause and method into one clause. Mixed metaphors absent; “rending silk” is singular and apt. Minor loop: “quaking reverie” reused verbatim (−0.1). No scaffold, no filter-verb stacks.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Premise—using a grown hyperbolic hedge maze as a temporal centrifuge—is non-obvious and fully committed to. The halo fragment’s ceramic hardness plus botanical architecture fuse physics and mysticism without wobble. Transformation test fails if Elara becomes generic seeker; here her occupational gaze makes the synthesis specific. Risk (+0.2):赌注是彻底抹除自我记忆。</comment>
