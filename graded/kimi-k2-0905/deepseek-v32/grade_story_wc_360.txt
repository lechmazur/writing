<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Aris’s obsessive interiority is vivid and embodied—each press-pull physically jars him. The logarithmic-grief ledger is a sharp, idiosyncratic micro-choice that crystallizes his values. Borrowed-personality cost is legible when he staggers, laughs, then weeps in one compressed beat. Final renunciation—“mathematics of emotion were not to be mastered but appreciated”—is earned by prior fragmentation and carries felt cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: halo shatters, empathies released, new constellation forms—undeniable conceptual cost. Causal linkage holds: each press act narrows identity options until the chorus-letter forces the decisive change. Ambiguity taught early (“deliberate ambiguity of the process”) pays off in the final image. Persistent price—self-fragmentation—shapes every tactic and the closing poise.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Topaz walls, amber light, and the halo fragment constrain every press decision; the fragment’s final shatter recharges the entire visual pattern. Stars vanishing act as live clock, tightening the temporal frame. Micro-setting (the press itself) steers spatial choreography cleanly. Sensory hierarchy stays tight: ink-hiss, metallic clang, crystalline ping—each matched to emotional beats.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—identity survival versus emotional knowledge—is signaled in line 3 and escalates with each borrowed psyche. Middle tightening: the jubilant inventor’s elation crashes into lingering widow-grief, forcing Aris to record manic-to-logarithmic decay in one ledger page—visible tactic shift. Cost is legible: “lucid turbulence” becomes cacophony, foreclosing further borrowing. Final stance crystallizes under Accumulative lens: accumulated fragments now externalized, options reweighted.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from concrete refrain: “mathematics of emotion” is re-priced when the halo shatters—emotion declared chaotic, not solvable. Subtext resides in silence after the clang: each stagger is an unspoken equation unsolved. Final image of new constellation offers non-literal answer—order recreated by releasing control. Avoids moralizing; ambiguity stays purposeful and charged.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Distinctive lyric cadence taught in the opening line—“stars were vanishing”—and held through parallel clauses. Perceptual signature is color- and number-fixated: “amber light,” “logarithmic decay,” matching Aris’s analytic hunger. Tense stable; no filter-verb stacks. Compression under stress—“He laughed, then cried”—mirrors identity shear without losing clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or pressure. Figurative language is sparse and patterned: “topaz sea,” “crystalline light”—taught early, paid at closure. Strong verbs—“press hissed,” “halo pulsed”—propel without modifier clutter. No mixed metaphors; clarity at climax untouched.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: steampunk letterpress + speculative empathy extraction + mathematical grief modeling feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk of “borrowing personalities” could have slid into cliché, but specificity of ledger graphs and halo fragment transforms it. Final constellation reconfiguration is a non-obvious payoff seeded by star vanishing. Voice, concept, and theme cohere as singular stance.</comment>
