<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Kael’s motivation—defy despair with light—is legible and constant; the chant, tool-handling, and on-stage mixing show embodied craft under pressure. Interior contradiction is thin: no moment pits his own doubt against the mission, so the “gravity” feels external rather than internalized. Still, the final cost (burnt-out rag, departing alone) forecloses continuation here and scales to length. Voice-specific perception and micro-choices keep him individualized; lacks the extra edge of genuine flaw or error that would push higher.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a clear Resonant Reconfiguration: the starless night is overwritten by a surrogate constellation and the hush flips from despair to awe, cost signaled by the spent rag and Kael’s solitary exit. Causal chain holds: mosaic note → tempo → fired sequence → emotional shift. Orientation anchored by word 50; no drift. One tightening beat suffices for 700-word arc. Could edge higher if the fortress’s own glow had fed back into the finale with a sharper physical consequence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fortress, courtyard tiles, and kerosene rag are tactile, plot-functional, and filtered through Kael’s pyrotechnic eye. Selective sensory triage—dust, scent of kerosene, pulsing stone—mirrors urgency without cataloging. Spatial choreography stays clean as he unpacks, mixes, lights. Setting does not literally constrain the firing angles, so it supports but does not deterministically shape the final choice—hence not quite 8.8+.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“lift the fortress’s spirits”—is signaled early and tested once: will the display penetrate collective despair? The single escalation is the crowd stepping from shadow into reflected light, a visible price paid by the atmosphere. No reversal or resource lost by Kael beyond the consumable rag, keeping cost lightweight. Sufficient tightening for this length and lens; would need a harder personal trade-off for 8.8+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of art as temporary, necessary defiance emerges through chemicals, chant, and the burnt rag rather than exposition. The surrogate constellation reweights the missing stars without moralizing. Final hush-turned-cheer offers Charged Poise: joy is fragile, itinerant, but possible. Complexity is present yet not deeply contradictory; story sides unambiguously with light, capping score below 9.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Kael’s craftsman lens; diction of spark, fuse, magnesium dust feels idiosyncratic and occupation-true. Rhythm modulates: longer compound sentences for mixing, staccato clauses for launch. No dialogue, so voice carries all; succeeds. Filter verbs minimal and justified by technical focus. Could reach 9+ with a sharper sonic echo of the mosaic melody in the final line.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sentences carry double duty—action plus sensory data—keeping density high. Figurative language is spare and accurate; no mixed metaphors. Occasional template cadence (“He adjusted… He mixed… He placed…”) lightly knocks momentum but disappears before climax. Clean grammar, strong verbs, zero scaffolding. Final paragraph lands with image, not explanation. Within hairline of 9.0; minor cadence repetition prevents it.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Pyrotechnic rescue of a “blooming” luminous fortress is fresh synthesis; mosaic musical score repurposed as launch code is the standout inflection. Familiar wanderer-artist archetype is particularized via chemical specifics and chant cadence. Risk is moderate—lyric escalation rather than twist—but coherence high. Not radically groundbreaking yet memorable and internally inevitable.</comment>
