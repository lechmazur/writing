<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s solitary, data-driven nature is vividly embodied in the meticulous tube-tying, lantern-lit mapping, and final pigeon-release; each micro-choice visibly weights her vow to “nurture integrity in solitude.” The only gap is that the interior contradiction—fear vs. duty—stays more stated than corporeally fought; a tremor or aborted ritual gesture could have pushed her to 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the pigeon’s upward arc reconfigures her stance from passive witness to active resistor, cost legible in the “new, purposeful tension” that now braids her sanctuary. Causal lattice holds: each beat (footsteps → tube → maps → whistle) is a because/therefore linkage under a Causal lens. No orientation debt; who/where/when anchored by word 60. Persistent constraint—she must stay silent—shapes tactics to the final line.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Courtyard miniatures—ivy, rain-gauge, magnolia cote—are handled, not toured: the brass tube is cool against skin, lantern light paints usable shadow, birdbath water slops when the pigeon lands. Weather data is filtered through professional bias, not dumped. The garden gate bolt and hidden cote constrain movement and enable the pigeon chain, satisfying the 9+ gate. One hairline slip: “footsteps” are heard but never sourced, leaving the pursuer a ghost.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve truth without official channels—tightens when anomalous storm data is ratified by the unsigned note, forcing a lateral counter-network. Escalation is one smooth diagonal: each datum she cross-maps forecloses the option to report openly; cost is visible in the lantern-lit isolation of the final release. No reversal, but the deepening suffices under Causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges inductively: the ethic of quiet, meticulous witnessing is re-priced when witness itself becomes insurgent. The returning image of the pigeon reweights from hobby to conduit of samizdat; no moral is stated, only the crystallized cost of continued solitude. Final image lets reader feel the paradox—integrity now depends on conspiracy—without spelling it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person intimate stays anchored to Elara’s instruments and perceptions; no head-hop. Diction—“barometric,” “flagstones,” “samizdat”-feel—belongs to a meteorologist who trusts metal and parchment more than mouths. Rhythm tightens across the hour: longer sentences for data cross-reference, clipped fragments at whistle-release. No dialogue, so voice carries all subtext; the final rustle against stars is pure indirection.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, information-dense: “She mapped the ‘rogue’ zone’s expanding perimeter against the path of the unnatural low-pressure cell” does three jobs in sixteen words. No filter-verb stacks, no mixed metaphors; lantern “painting soft shadows” is single, apt. One paraphrase loop—“quiet courtyard… tranquil layers… quiet spaces”—ticks the template check but falls outside the final third, so 9-band remains intact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: meteorological surveillance as dissident craft. The pigeon-to-pigeon lateral relay flips the usual dystopia trope—no hacking, no graffiti, just weather logs in brass tubes. Risk is quiet rather than pyrotechnic, fitting the stakes of a solitary recorder. The concept feels inevitable in hindsight yet was not obvious at entry.</comment>
