<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Aris’s motive to “archive emotional patterns” is vivid, but the pivot from scholar to prophet-actor is asserted rather than dramatized; we see no micro-choice that visibly costs him anything until the final oath. Interiority is atmospheric rather than contradictory. Earnedness is implied, not paid on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the foghorn silence, orchard-tower, and new archival oath reweight the prophecy with undeniable social cost. Causal chain is lyric-accumulative rather than tight because/therefore, but the pattern is taught early and held. One persistent constraint—wax shaving’s fragility—shapes the final act.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The skyscraper orchard is irreplaceable: living trees 300 m above sea level literalize the “silent tower bearing fruit” and physically host Aris’s final oath. Wax shaving, phonograph, and mist are micro-settings that constrain every immersion. Sensory hierarchy stays anchored to Aris’s scribe priorities—sound grooves, salt haze, unripe fruit—never tourist catalog.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.7</question><comment>Dominant stake—decode / avert the drying sea-heart—surfaces at midpoint; one meaningful tightening occurs when Aris decides to craft a counter-oath. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral; urgency is atmospheric, not tactical. Coincidence (children chanting Sumerian) complicates but is absorbed into lyric design.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</question><comment>Theme emerges obliquely: archival devotion accidentally preserves future catastrophe; the sea’s silence and the orchard’s fruit fuse into one resonant image. No moralizing; the final line archives “hope amidst uncertainty,” reweighting prior dread. Ambiguity lingers—drought literal or metaphoric—without confusion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</question><comment>Third-person lyric maintains a consistent scribe-perceiver diction: precise yet ceremonial, rhythmic without monotony. Compression (“velvet disquiet,” “wax sliver”) teaches pattern early; payoff in final oath chant. No head-hopping; perceptual signature stays tied to Aris’s ear for dead languages and phonograph hiss.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</question><comment>Sentences carry triple duty—image, sound, concept—without scaffold: “gnarled fruit trees breathed in the city’s elevated haze” fuses body, setting, metaphor. Rhythm modulates: longer clauses for immersion, staccato for prophecy. One paraphrase loop (“emotional pattern…emotional patterns”) costs −0.2; otherwise clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</question><comment>Fusion of maritime foghorn myth, rooftop orchard, and wax-cylinder Sumerian prophecy feels non-obvious and specific to this narrator. Children’s misheard chant as accidental oracle is a fresh inflection that retroactively charges the mundane field-trip memory. Risk-taking structure (lyric accumulative) stays coherent; no derivative aftertaste.</comment>
