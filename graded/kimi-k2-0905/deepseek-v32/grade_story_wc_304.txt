<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Interiority is luminous and embodied—“radiant hush,” “golden wisp”—yet Elara’s contradictory impulses (preserve vs. surrender to oblivion) are asserted rather than dramatized in a single agonizing beat. No micro-choice visibly risks failure or costs her; the memory simply rises when summoned. The endurance of ritual is felt, but the lack of a live obstacle keeps her shy of 9-band depth.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the emerald’s steady glow reweights the premise—entropy delayed, not defeated—cost encoded in the eternal return to empty slabs. Accumulative lens holds: each aurora pattern adds density until the final cadence crystallizes. No orientation drift; spatial anchors (quartz slab, low table) are fixed early. Meets 9+ cost test on the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Skyborne grotto, crystalline walls, and aurora static are not backdrop but instrument: the shifting light literally guides the extraction, constraining timing and method. Micro-setting succeeds—emerald chip functions as portable altar—charging the final shelf of sparks. Selective sensory triage (silent waves, soft rustle) keeps momentum. Tool-as-setting satisfies 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—snatch memory before obliteration—tightens once: the aurora’s randomness must resolve into usable pattern or the spark is lost. No secondary reversal, but the single deepening is meaningful and visible: static → forest path → emerald glow. Cost is conceptual (one more soul postpones void) rather than felt bodily; stays below 8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges as quiet defiance of erasure; no authorial thesis states it. Forest-path memory, emerald vessel, and stillness form a spare triad that reweights at the shelf of chips. Ambiguity survives: is she mercy or delay? Resonant without tidy moral. No echoic final statement, so avoids Q5 penalty.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person lyric remains close to Elara’s perceptual filter—“patterns in static,” “radiant hush”—syntax lengthens then compresses with ritual pacing. No dialogue, so no voice convergence risk. Diction stays within her elegiac lexicon; aurora as text is taught immediately and paid off. Distinct texture sustains 9-band control.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is rhythmically varied, information-dense; figurative layer (aurora as language) is patterned, not piled randomly. One scaffold loop—“radiant hush” repeated in adjacent paragraphs—triggers −0.3; otherwise no filter-verb stacks or mixed metaphor. Closure image untouched by artifacts.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Beautician-mortician plus post-death memory distillation feels fresh, not stitched; occupation drives every beat. Synthesis of aurora noise→data is conceptually elegant and inevitable in hindsight. Risk taken in stillness-as-action pays off. Minor point off for forest-at-dawn memory, a near-universal archetype not further particularized.</comment>
