<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara’s bruised-awe motivation is vivid and embodied; the cracked-puppet echo gives her a tangible wound. Yet she never faces a live alternative—no moment where she could choose to let the clock strike—so the renunciation feels pre-decided rather than earned under pressure. Interiority is lyrical but loops on the same cosmic ache, blunting contradiction. Still, the beautiful-flawed trait directly shapes her final gesture, meeting the 9- test at 7.2.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the dissolving hands and crumbling puppet reconfigure time itself with undeniable conceptual cost. Accumulative lens holds: the thickening pane and nested patterns tighten the stake without causal reversals. Orientation is taught early (“stone needle piercing the twilight”) so the waiver applies; no cap triggered. One scaffold loop (“layers…layers”) slightly dulls the final cadence, keeping it shy of 8.8.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The lighthouse-as-lantern becomes a micro-setting that literally constrains the final act: the puppet must touch the glass to ignite the lullaby. Dusk-to-night shift is tracked through the soft internal glow, anchoring时间. Sensory hierarchy favors hush over visual clutter, mirroring Elara’s narrowed perception. Pane-of-hush object charges the closing image, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—turn apocalypse into lullaby—is signaled in paragraph one and deepens when the pane thickens, foreclosing any chance of reversal. No antagonist needed; pressure is cosmological yet viscerally felt as silence gains weight. Cost is legible: the puppet disintegrates, her lifelong compass erased. Escalation is accumulative (density of hush) rather than causal, fitting the lens without slack.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the cracked puppet’s trajectory: flaw is the only path to grace. No moral is stated; the final dust-specks reweight all prior “broken” imagery. Bruised awe stays unresolved—cosmic grandeur still hurts—which preserves complexity. One soft echo of “every end is a beginning” nears platitude but is saved by the immediate visual of dissolving clock hands, keeping it just below 9.0.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Elara’s synesthetic perception (“silence…like a lens”). Syntax lengthens under awe, then fractures in the final sentence, mirroring the puppet’s crumble. No dialogue to distort register. One filter-verb cluster (“she sensed…she felt”) could be trimmed, but it occurs early and does not recur under peak pressure. Voice is distinctive and sustained, meriting 8.6.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet read-aloud musical; metaphor vehicles (constellation-cracks, ocean-shore) cohere without mixed collision. One paraphrase loop on “nested patterns” costs −0.2. No scaffold sentences or redundant openers. Final paragraph accelerates into a single breath-line, propelling closure. Line-level control is strong enough for 8.3, barred from 9+ only by the minor loop.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Doomsday-clock adjuster who *doesn’t* try to stop it but sings it to sleep—specific, non-obvious, and inevitable once voiced. Broken puppet as key to cosmic lullaby fuses toy fragility with ontological control, a fresh synthesis. Risky accumulative structure pays off: silence gains mass until time itself hushes. The concept commits fully, no retreat into irony, earning the high-band distinction.</comment>
