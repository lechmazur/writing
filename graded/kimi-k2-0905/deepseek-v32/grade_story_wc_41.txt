<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The “precognitively forgetful” curse is embodied only through repeated summary; concrete micro-choices under pressure are missing. The final renunciation (“some things are only real in the seeking”) is declared, not dramatized, so the cost feels abstract. Interiority drifts into lyrical abstraction (“tidal longing”) instead of contradictory impulse in scene. Chalk-in-mouth is the single embodied beat; more are needed for 7+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise—“he was content” reweights the premise—but the cost is conceptual, not visibly felt on the page. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of fading chalk + swallowed sound; pattern is taught and holds. Orientation is clear by word 60. However, no middle tightening reverses options; the driftwood trail only repeats the same beat (mark/forget) with accumulating melancholy. Causality remains loose; the finale does not foreclose a path, merely reframes it.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Fog, driftwood, and chalk function as micro-setting that constrains movement and memory; fog literally erases chalk, charging the final image. Sensory triangulation (taste of chalk dust, granular sigh) is selective and POV-filtered. Spatial choreography is clean: circular driftwood array marks the epicenter. Environment actively mirrors internal decay without overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“capture the sound of growing older”—is signaled early. Pressure accumulates via disappearing chalk and dissolving fog sculptures, but no single beat forces a trade-off or narrows options; the prophet merely keeps trying the same tactic. Cost is thematic (acceptance of forgetting) rather than tactical. Escalation is atmospheric, not consequential; meets short-form minimum but lacks visible price that alters next move.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: memory as tidal erosion, seeking as being. Subtext resides in the chalk that cannot write on fog—an unspoken comment on art’s futility against time. Final image reweights prior material without moralizing. Some abstraction (“the silence felt thick with trapped whispers”) edges toward pseudo-profundity, keeping it under 8.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Third-person lyric voice maintains consistent distance and perceptual signature: prophet notices bleached driftwood, magnetic tape stillness, chalk’s quiet comfort. Syntax modulates with pressure—short sentences at climax (“He stopped, his heart a drum”). No dialogue, so voice contamination risk zero. Patterned repetition (“tidal longing”) is taught early and pays off in final line; not a drumbeat artifact.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Figurative language is dense but patterned; fog-as-sculpture and chalk-as-memory metaphors cohere. No mixed metaphors or synonym loops. One paraphrase loop: “visions slipped away like water… leaving only a clinging to echoes” followed by “he clung to these echoes” within four lines (−0.2). Otherwise high density with rhythmic variation. Chalk dust final image is crisp.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Premise—“precognitively forgetful prophet hunts audible aging”—is fresh synthesis of memory-loss and sound-concept tropes. Specificity of junkyard videotapes and fog sculptures prevents generic nowhere. Risky lyric structure holds under Accumulative lens. Not quite 9 because the insight (seeking > capturing) is foreseeable once motif of erasure is established; lacks final reconfiguration that surprises.</comment>
