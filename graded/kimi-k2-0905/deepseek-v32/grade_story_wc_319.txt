<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Keeper’s feral patience and archival instinct are shown through concrete micro-choices—circling the pendant, hanging it on herself—so the final acceptance feels earned. The dimensional homesickness stays abstract; we never see one specific lost-stack memory that hurts, so the ache is label-adjacent rather than embodied. Still, her shift from passive waiting to active, open-ended vigil carries visible cost: she shoulders the pendant’s chaotic weight and the garden’s light boundaries soften under that burden.</comment>

<comment>Accumulative/textural lens: each frozen bloom, light-circle, and the pendant’s intrusion layers density until the final image reweights the stake—amber blooms, blurred horizons, pendant against her chest. Causality is interior but coherent: because she archives the foreign object, the garden’s rule-set reconfigures and her homesickness becomes a labeled shelf. Closure lands as Charged Poise: she sits awake inside a now-living mist, cost felt in the perpetual weight she chose to carry. No orientation debt; transitions are clean, one scene, one shard of sleep.</comment>

<comment>The frozen garden’s light-circles function as both geography and psychic prison; stepping outside one is a tactile risk that guides every move. The pendant’s obsidian shard is handled repeatedly, its heat-melted frost a sensory cue that the world-rule is mutable. Final image—pendant cool against skin, amber blooms glowing—charges the reconfigured horizon, satisfying the 9+ gate. Selective detail (ice-laden branch = sharp fact) keeps description lean yet atmospheric.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: can she archive the unknown without destroying her fragile order? Pendant’s arrival tightens this by warping light boundaries into sickly green, forcing a single decisive act. Escalation is accumulative: each sensory shift (color bleed, amber blooms) raises the cost of refusal. The price—perpetual carrying of chaotic weight, horizon forever blurred—is legible on the final bench.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</question>
<comment>Theme emerges through the archival metaphor: stewardship of uncertainty is friendship, not conquest. Subtext whispers in the shift from “boundary” to “horizon,” reweighting exile into frontier. Final image of labeled homesickness on an inner shelf offers Conceptual Repricing without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers: is the garden evolving or merely reframing its prison? Reader feels the question rather than hears it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Keeper’s feral perceptual signature: precise spatial memory, synesthetic equation of bloom = page, stem = spine. Syntax lengthens during pendant visions, then fractures into shorter units under the new weight, mirroring stress. No dialogue, so voice purity remains intact. Final “dreamed, wide awake” crystallizes the poise without ventriloquizing epiphany.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Rhythm modulates from misty legato to shard-edged staccato as the pendant intrudes; no two adjacent sentences repeat structure. Figurative language is sparse, each metaphor (light as prisoner) tied to world-rule. Zero paraphrase loops; every sentence advances image or stakes. Copy-clean, no scaffolding, high information density.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The “interiorizing exteriors” magic system reframes cataloguing as existential stance, a fresh angle on both librarian and portal fantasies. Frozen garden plus dimensional exile synthesizes climate grief and archival longing into one compressed image. Risk: quiet ending without external antagonist; coherence holds, resonance lands. Not 9+ only because the cultist’s cosmos remains a sketch—freshness is conceptual rather than fully embodied.</comment>
