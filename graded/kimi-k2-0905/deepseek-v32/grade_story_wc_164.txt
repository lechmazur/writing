<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Marin’s interiority is vivid and embodied, especially in her tactile handling of foam and glass. Her motivation is personal and signalled early, but the shift from “pain” to “integrated purpose” is more reported than dramatized; we are told she smiles rather than seeing a micro-choice that enacts the change. The contradiction between regret and determination is never allowed to create live tension inside a single beat, so the final epiphany feels pre-ordained. Still, her perceptual signature—synaesthetic attention to light, bubble, whisper—keeps her distinct.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The closure lands cleanly under an Accumulative/Textural lens: the final image of rainbow patterns on the wall reweights the premise that disappearance equals erasure. Causality is loose (seeds, foam, whispers accumulate into insight rather than force it), but the pattern is taught early and the cheerful-gloom tone holds. Orientation is anchored by word 50; no drift. Cost is present but soft—fading glyphs are felt, yet Marin suffers no concrete forfeiture—so the RR is slightly under-charged.</comment>

<comment>The iridescent cave is more than postcard: its light guides working posture (angle of glass), its cracks determine where seeds root, and the final rainbow projection is literally cast upon its wall, charging closure. Sensory triage is POV-specific—Marin notices shimmer, sigh, pop—never tourist catalogue. Spatial logic stays clean across moves; no impossible positions. The micro-setting of crater glass doubles as tool and mirror, constraining the angle at which glyphs can be read, thus shaping tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</comment>
<comment>Dominant stake—why paths vanish—signals early and tightens only once, when the sailor-glyph contradicts the regret theory. Because the story is Accumulative, a single intensification suffices, but the cost of that contradiction is cognitive only; Marin’s tactics do not visibly change. No credible loss (time, tool, social credit) alters her next move. Pressure stays coherent but flat; cheerful gloom cushions rather than escalates.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges cleanly from the central equation: vanishing equals transformation, not loss. No character articulates the thesis verbatim; the closest—"paths dissolve... into new journeys"—is tied to concrete image of rainbow map. Subtext resides in silence: the absent sailor, the unheard bird call. Final image of integrated light/shadow reweights earlier "cheerful gloom" without moralising. Ambiguity lingers: is consolation also erasure? Complex, plausible counter-readings invited.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Marin’s perceptual register—synaesthetic, salt-flecked, crystalline—without drifting into purple. Syntax tightens under pressure: fragment chains ("Glyphs told stories... But always, missing pieces") mimic popping foam. No head-hopping; POV distance stable. Diction favors Anglo-Saxon nouns (foam, glass, crack) over Latinate abstractions. Final line rests into longer cadence, earning quietus after staccato mid-section. Filter verbs avoided; perception shown via action.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Line economy is high: "She gathered more sea-foam, seeking corroboration" does three jobs—action, motive, escalation. No paraphrase loops; no synonym churn across adjacent lines. Metaphors stay physically coherent (foam = bubble = air = map). One near-mix: "cheerful gloom" is oxymoron, but pattern-taught early and recharged at end, so accepted. Read-aloud rhythm varies; paragraph cuts land on image beats. Tense stable; pronoun clean. Minor scaffold: "now" x3 within 60 words mid-story—does not obscure closure.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Premise—recollectionist who reads emotion from evaporating foam—feels fresh, yet grows logically from ancient memory-lore. Synthesis of sea-foam, meteor glass, and avian seed dispersal creates a coherent micro-cosmology rather than checklist quirk. Final reconfiguration (disappearance as integration) flips the typical grief-narrative. Transformation test fails: Marin could be any seeker, but specificity of perceptual vocabulary and iridescent cave anchor her. Risk-taking (quiet Accumulative arc) pays off without gimmicks.</comment>
