<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Aris’s “confidently uncertain” interiority is concrete and embodied in the silent keyboard ritual; the causal chain from recursive mistake to semiotic repair is legible. The meteor-pen’s warmth at the end marks a micro-choice that costs her prior certainty, earning the closure. No secondary character on page, so relationship bullets N/A. Interior contradiction peaks when she loads a sequence she half-believes will fail—stakes felt without label-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the signals return laced with anomaly harmonics, making her error a permanent dialectic layer—cost is the irreversible change in the data set (“they were changed”). Causal lens holds: recursive fold → mapped contingent relations → corrective semiotic transmission → new stable pattern. Orientation anchor (who/where) reached by word 45; no debt. One meaningful tightening when diagram reveals the fold; no off-stage resolutions.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The persistent eastward pull is used tactically—guides her body posture while diagramming and later ratchets during transmission, constraining her stance. Meteor-nib pen functions as micro-setting: its phosphorescent trails provide the only low-light visibility, directly enabling the mapping beat. Sensory hierarchy filtered through interpreter priorities: silence of arrays, hum vs. flicker, warmth of alloy. Spatial choreography clean; station gravity rule remains consistent.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore celestial voices—signaled in line 7; escalation via rising fear that the silence is permanent. Mid-story tightening when she realizes the signals are folded, not deleted, forcing a semiotic gamble that could compound the damage. Cost legible: the returned signals carry anomaly harmonics forever—she trades purity for coherence. Agency resides in transmitting the corrective sequence; luck does not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the pen’s phosphorescent edits: history is not erased but revised by incorporating error into new narrative stability. Subtext in the pen’s warmth—tool of familial lineage sanctioning her authority to edit cosmic texts. No moralizing; final image of eastward pull as “heartbeat” reweights anomaly from flaw to dialogue partner. Particulars (recursive algorithm, meteor alloy) ground abstraction without pseudo-profundity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Aris; perceptual signature in “confidently uncertain” syntactic echo and selective attention to gravitational tug. No dialogue, so dialogue bullets N/A. Free indirect clean: “the pen felt heavy with potential” retains her idiom. Rhythm accelerates during transmission beat—short sentences mirror flicker/pulse without drumbeat monotony. Metaphor cluster (“folded space-time,” “tangled skein”) is pattern-taught early and paid off in closure image.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentence openings shift; no scaffold loops. Information density high: “dried-up fountain pen with exotic nib, a family relic she used for note-taking in an analog ritual that grounded her” performs three jobs in one line. One mixed metaphor risk—“threads in a tangled skein” adjacent to “woven tapestry”—but the textile motif sustains across mapping/weaving acts, so coherence holds. No filter-verb stacks; peak beat prose remains lucid under stress.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Synthesis of celestial signal interpretation with gravitational anomaly revision is non-obvious; recursive algorithm → semiotic unbending feels inevitable only after reveal. Meteor-pen as editor of cosmic history particularizes the frame; swap any prop and the phosphorescent mapping fails. Risk taken in lyric semiotic resolution rather than physical engineering fix, yet closure remains legible. No close echoes of famous SF scenes; “edit history” trope is re-inflected through contingent relationship mapping.</comment>
