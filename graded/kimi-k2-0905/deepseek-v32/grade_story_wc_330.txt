<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s silent resolve is credibly embodied; the moment she exhales “intention and memory” into the brass shard crystallizes her hierarchy of values. Interior contradiction is hinted at (speech forgone yet yearning to make the halo sing) but never sharpened into a beat where silence costs her a live alternative. The earned stasis—she stays to mend—carries quiet cost, yet the prose keeps her flaw safely off-stage, muting full dramatic tension.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the train becomes “cradle of potential,” re-weighting the premise with undeniable conceptual cost—her life path now bound to this valley. Accumulative lens governs: pattern of quiet → found object → song → repair → perpetual hum. Causality inside each shard is sound; transitions among the four mini-shards (“wrong turn,” “compartment,” “oasis,” “twilight bench”) remain legible and motif-taught. No Orientation debt; halo fragment’s first appearance is anchored inside 120 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Selective sensory detail (glass bells, brass warmth, shattered roof sunlight) filters through Elara’s carpenter gaze; every object doubles as tool or material. The micro-setting of the gutted dining-car oasis physically constrains her next action—repair bench beside the pool—and directly enables the final image of the halo-crowned horse. Spatial choreography is clean; no floating rooms. Environment meets the 9+ gate by charging the final image through tactile integration.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“interpret silence as possibility”—tightens when the fragment’s yearning forces her to produce sound without voice, a single meaningful deepening. Agency is present: her decision to exhale intention triggers the shard’s hum and sets the repair chain in motion. Cost is visible: perpetual stay in the canyon forecloses return to former life. Pressure plateaus after the first song; further escalation is accumulative repetition rather than new trade-off, capping score just above 8.0 band entry.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of silent creation emerges inductively from wood-and-bell imagery; no authorial thesis intrudes. Final image reweights “silence” from absence to generative space, achieving CR without moralizing. Subtext resides in gesture—placing the halo on the horse’s crown declares artistry as prayer. Some symbolic overlap between bells, halo, and song edges toward echo rather than friction, keeping score shy of 9.0.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited adheres to Elara’s taciturn perceptual signature; diction favors carpentry verbs (“yielded,” “mend,” “salvage”). Rhythm modulates: longer breathers during oasis stillness, clipped fragments at the jammed door. No head-hop; psychic distancecompresses appropriately under pressure. Voice meets 9- gate but occasional lofty phrasing (“testament to that truth”) slightly lifts out of her rustic idiom, preventing full 9.0.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sentences carry double duty—image plus motion—scaffolding is minimal. Figurative layer (“whispering gleam,” “misting hush”) recurs with taught pattern that pays off in final cadence; no mixed metaphors. Filter verbs nearly absent; strong verbs propel motion. One paraphrase loop detected (“quiet music… quiet music”) but does not touch the closure beat. Line craft is controlled, muscular, and read-aloud smooth.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Abandoned-circus-train trope is refreshed through carpentry POV and the literal graft of halo onto horse; combination feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk taken: wordless protagonist in 700-word lyric arc; coherence maintained. Specificity of carousel limb salvage and brass crown prevents generic anywhere-setting. Not quite 9.0 because core engine—silent artisan revives ruined wonder—remains recognizable fairy-tale contour, albeit finely carpentered.</comment>
