<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—obedience to guild craft vs. belief in “deciduous vows”—is alive on the stairs and in the eyepiece beat; the micro-choice to keep the ribbon on wrist embodies hierarchy of values. Cost is felt when she leaves the journal breathing orchard air, renouncing guild validation. Hair-ribbon beats are emotionally specific, though “feisty” is asserted more than enacted in body. Final stance crystallizes, foreclosing reinstatement plea.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Causal chain holds: breach → orchard → journal → ritual → vision → refusal. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: she exits lighter, ribbon flagging cost, guild path foreclosed. Orientation clean by 120 words; cathedral and stakes anchored. One paraphrase loop (“She would return… perhaps not”) lightly dulls cadence but does not break causality at climax.</comment>

<comment>Sunlight through shattered ruby/sapphire glass constrains color of vision experiment; orchard dew and thorns become literal tools, meeting 9+ gate. Spatial choreography tracks from nave to loft to stairs without drift. Sensory hierarchy favors soil-citrus scent and tactility of ribbon over visual catalog. Environment actively supplies ritual ingredients, not postcard backdrop.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—personal legitimacy as mender—tightens when guild oath is shed; unripe apples/blackberry thorns force tactical improvisation with visible price (blood risk, improvised lens). Escalation is single deepening, not reversal, sufficient for 700-word scope. Pressure remains coherent under Causal lens; no coincidence resolves. Could use one more intermediate cost (failed trial?) to enter 8+ band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>“Deciduous vows” concept migrates from grandmother’s note to lived principle without thematic echo pollution; final image reweights prior guild pride as autumn leaf, offering conceptual cost. Ambiguity lingers: will new method heal or alienate? Epiphany emerges from concrete orchard ritual, not assertion. No moralizing paragraph; ribbon reprise charges poise.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Elara’s perceptual bias—quartz vision metaphor, scent filtering, tool priorities. Syntax tilts toward horticultural diction (“tangled blackberry bushes,” “mossy bench”) consistent with mender-craftsperson. No head-hop; psychic distance stable. One filter-verb cluster (“she felt… she understood… she smiled”) in closure beat softens immediacy but does not contaminate voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Prose shows read-aloud rhythm, sentence variety, high density: “Sunlight filtered through broken stained glass, painting the leaves in hues of ruby and sapphire” does three jobs. Occasional scaffold (“She remembered packing… most now forgotten”) is brief and functional. No mixed metaphors or loops in peak beats. Minor cadence repetition in descent paragraph keeps it from 8+.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Inverted cathedral-orchard is fresh macro image; quartz-eye mending as generational craft gives concrete sci-fantasy inflection. “Deciduous vows” reconfigures familiar theme of letting go into artisanal biology. Risk is moderate—lyric ritual in ruin—yet executed with coherence. Could push further if guild politics or eye-mending mechanics revealed unique societal rule.</comment>
