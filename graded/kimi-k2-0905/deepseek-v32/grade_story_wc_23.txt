<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Aris’s grief-anchored drive is palpable, but her decisions are filtered through lyrical summary more than dramatized micro-choice; the censer-foot pulses yet never forces a visible trade-off, so the final broadcast feels inevitable rather than costly. Interiority is evocative but loops the same ache, delaying contradictory impulses that would sharpen climax.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the antenna’s first light is a Charged Poise that reweights “home” as internal, with the censer cooling to mark cost. Causality under Accumulative/Textural lens holds—moon-phase pattern tightens pacing—but two reflective blocks approach the 20% ceiling and one missed spatial anchor at ~140 words slightly blurs orientation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Signal station, censer, and moonlight interlock to constrain every adjustment; the scrap-heap antenna functions as micro-setting whose glow charges the final image. Sensory triage is POV-true—starlight, copper hum, bronze temperature—without tourist excess, grounding lyric flights in tactile immediacy.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—reverse-migrate through loss—signposts early; pressure tightens when moon-phase trait forces wait/tinker cycles, foreclosing shortcuts. Cost is visible in sleepless scrap-scavenging and the cooling censer at dawn, though escalation is more iterative than reversed; still, agency stays with Aris under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: grief is a tide to be instrumented, not escaped. The antenna’s pulse answers the grandmother’s censer ritual without moralizing; the reweighting of “home” from place to transmitted solace is earned, not asserted.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays tight to Aris’s perceptual bias—star-chart fragments, tide tables in her diction. Rhythm waxes and wanes with moon imagery; no filter-verb clutter; telephone voice remains genderless and weary, distinct from narrative texture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is textured, read-aloud strong, with purposeful repetition that teaches the moon-pattern; only minor scaffold (“she would wait… she would listen”) and one mixed metaphor (“needle stitching the sky”) slightly dull the final ascent. High density elsewhere keeps momentum intact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Patchwork navigation + moon-tide relic + midnight phone oracle feels fresh, avoiding stock post-apocalypse tropes; the reverse-migration concept personalizes grief without grandstanding. Risk is moderate—lyric accumulative structure—but payoff legible, not gimmick.</comment>
