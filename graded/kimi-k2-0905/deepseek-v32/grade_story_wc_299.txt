<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction is shown in the trailer beat where Leo fondles the cloth while reciting hallmarks; the micro-choice to write in the ledger turns insulation into tool, earning the shift. Embodied emotion reads thin—only “echo valley longing” and “hollowed-out spirit” approach the body—so the gear-change feels cerebral, not visceral. Cost is present: he forecloses the quarry path, but the prose abstracts the price into “meaning” rather than a palpable forfeiture. Voice stays consistent, avoiding label-speak, yet the arc skirts genuine struggle once the plan crystallizes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: misdating vase → exile → cloth re-valued → new vocation; each step narrows options. Closure is Earned Stasis: he refuses the old silence, opens shop, tangible cost is the trailer shrinking in mirror—loss of refuge made legible. Orientation anchored by sentence 3; no teleporting props. One soft reset: the fair scandal is summarized, not dramatized, blunting the inciting pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Quarry trailer, inkwell, and speaker cloth function as micro-setting; cloth-in-pocket constrains the final choice to leave. Sensory detail is selective—dust, grimy window, rough fabric—filtered through appraisal gaze. Rock faces mirror psyche, but mirroring is overt; integration is efficient, not surprising. Weather absent, yet stillness serves the hush after applause conceit.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</question><comment>Dominant stake: restore purpose after public shame. Escalation: antique error → quarry penance → cloth reclamation → memoir-appraisal hybrid; each turn halves his options. Cost is social exile and psychic emptiness, felt but not sharpened to a single loss (no cash, no relationship). Agency is reactive—he accepts assignments rather than forcing reversals—so pressure plateaus rather than spikes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges: value lies in the undocumented aftermath, not the spotlight. Subtext operates in the cloth’s shift from trash to artifact, reweighting “applause” as communal memory worth curating. Final image of rearview mirror reprises stage metaphor without moralizing. Insight stays concrete—“quiet work of packing up” versus abstract “loss”—keeping sentimentality at bay.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Leo’s appraisal gaze; diction—“silver hallmarks,” “Marshall cabinet”—is profession-specific. Rhythm modulates: longer reflective sentences contract into ledger fragments, mirroring insulation crack. No dialogue, hence no voice convergence. Filter verbs (“he felt”) are minimal and voice-motivated, preserving immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Prose is clean: no loops, no mixed metaphors. Density is high—each sentence advances inventory, memory, or decision. Occasional elevated phrases (“echo valley longing”) risk register drift but are saved by internal consistency. Final line lands with cadence clarity; no artifact touches closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Fusion of roadie lore and antiques niche feels fresh; speaker cloth as archive is a sharp specific. Public failure-to-penance arc is familiar, but the memorabilia authentication twist reconfigures it. Risk is moderate—quiet epiphany over spectacle—yet coherence remains high. Near-echoes of “silence after applause” threaten cliché, but repetition is purposeful, not ornamental.</comment>
