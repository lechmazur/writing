<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory drives—scholarly duty vs. plant-tuned empathy—are dramatized in micro-choices (touching the violin, drinking the coffee, deciding not to authenticate). The interiority is sensory, not diagnostic, and the renunciation costs her institutional future; the slight reserve from 9-band stems from the caretaker’s edges being sketched rather than pressured.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: “It is authenticated… and everywhere” reweights the empire’s ownership rule-set. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each silent note adds density until the final image of seeded realities—felt cost is the violin’s dimmed glow and her institutional exile implied in the same breath.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Velvet drapes, bruise-colored twilight, and jasmine scent are filtered through Elara’s synesthetic bias; the observatory’s architecture literally channels her final act when drapes shimmer to the silent bow-stroke, satisfying the 9-gate that setting must charge the last image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—authentication vs. propagation—tightens with each coffee-ground vision and violin touch; the final bowing physically forecloses the empire’s vault option. Escalation is Accumulative: possibility-density increases until the dome itself becomes a seed-head; price is the violin’s depleted starlight and her career forfeit.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: ownership vs. dissemination refracted through plant memory and perforated destiny. The resonant answer is the empty cup and thriving jasmine—life borrowed from the stolen song, no moral pronounced.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Lush yet disciplined syntax mirrors Elara’s synesthesia; perceptual signature is stable (“mulberry ache,” “green static”). No head-hopping; compression in the final bowing triad is taught early by coffee-ground branchings, paying off under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Figurative layering is high but patterned—each metaphor returns (bruise → velvet → starlight) and is paid off when drapes literally shimmer. No filter-verb stacks or loops; slight register lift in “Conceptual Repricing” is justified by the conceptual stakes.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The ice-crystal violin that plays silent possibility-seeds is fresh; plant-telepathy as archival method and coffee-ground destiny as perforation map are specific syntheses, not gimmicks. Risk—lyric physics in 700 words—coheres because pattern is taught early and closure image is inevitable.</comment>
