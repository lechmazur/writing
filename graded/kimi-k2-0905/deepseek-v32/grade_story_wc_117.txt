<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses—protective caution versus the need to risk connection—play out in real time as she modulates her guitar to mirror Leo’s breathing. The embodied moment when she touches the resin curl while Leo’s hand stills shows interiority without label-speak. Leo’s shift from self-stim to shared humming is earned because the eclipse and music jointly create a sensory bridge that reweights his internal pattern. Cost is visible: she forfeits her own private grief-anchor by letting the memory become their shared door.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the final shared hum reconfigures their relationship without forced sentiment, and the cost is the irreversible exposure of Elara’s private keepsake to communal use. Causality holds: because the eclipse darkens the sky, Leo’s sensory world widens; therefore he seeks recurrence through music. Orientation is clean within 120 words. One transition (ascent→descent) is legible; no teleporting props.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The ridge’s cooling air, metallic light, and confused crickets are filtered through Elara’s auditory bias; environment dictates chord choice. The resin curl functions as micro-setting that constrains her final decision to share its memory. Spatial choreography is steady—guitar unpacked, hands tracked, eclipse viewed, descent begun. Weather shift (temperature drop, cricket chorus) directly alters the musical method, integrating setting into tactic.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can Leo access shared wonder—tightens once: the eclipse offers a single irreproducible window. Elara’s agency is her pivot from observation to invitation when she mirrors the corona with an open chord, narrowing her options to mutual vulnerability. Cost is legible: the eclipse ends, foreclosing repetition; the music must now carry the memory. No coincidence resolves; the sky’s return brutalizes the moment, forcing adaptation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through sensory pattern—sound as portable door—rather than statement. The curl’s reprise in the final descent reweights “wonder” from private relic to shared practice. Subtext resides in Leo’s imperfect hum: the eclipse can’t return, but the door can be re-opened by choice. No final moralizing; the last image of braided voices invites reader inference.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays inside Elara’s auditory perceptual field—every visual is filtered through sound or touch. Syntax lengthens during eclipse hush, compresses at diamond flash, mirroring cardiac rhythm. No head-hopping; Leo’s interior is accessed only through gesture and eventual voice. Dialogue is sparse, child-authentic: “It’s like a hole” carries subtext of absence, not metaphoric over-articulation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies: long breathy sentences under totality, staccato fragments at re-emergence. Figurative language is sparse and pattern-taught—“dreaming roots” returns as echo, not clutter. No synonym loops; “open chords” is repeated with functional purpose. One mixed metaphor risk—“silent, starry hole in the day”—but physical logic holds because the sky literally becomes an aperture.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fusion of music therapy with eclipse viewing feels non-obvious and specific to this pair. The resin-curl memento transcends sentimental prop by becoming the tactile seed of Leo’s first voluntary sound. Risk taken: withholding Leo’s interior until he speaks; payoff justifies constraint. Transformation test passes—swap eclipse for meteor shower and the emotional arc collapses.</comment>
