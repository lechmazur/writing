<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elara’s quiet deliberation is shown through tactile, embodied beats (turning the key, aligning runes), not labeled; her interior contradiction—curiosity vs. fear of unleashed reality—surfaces in micro-choices under pressure. The cost is present: she foregoes sleep and safety, and the automaton’s stillness after activation locks her into solitary scholarship. Yet the “scholar” trait stays safely noble; no flaw complicates her competence or forces a mistake, so the arc feels too pristine for 8+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each rune-alignment and telescope adjustment adds density until the final beam closes the century-old circuit. Closure is a crystallized Charged Poise—Elara sees the folded shadow-realm and accepts lifelong custodianship—cost paid in the automaton’s final stillness and her isolate vigil. Orientation anchored at sentence one; no causality breaks. The lens holds, but the tightening is single-pulse; a second deepening would have lifted it higher.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Observatory brass, floating rocks, and the bronze arm constrain every action; the automaton key becomes micro-setting that literally unlocks the climax. Sensory selection skews visual—absent are smells of ozone, the chill of altitude—so texture never reaches 9. Spatial choreography is immaculate; the key turns, arm extends, beam connects without spatial drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“where do noon shadows go?”—is declared early and tightened when the automaton’s beam forecloses all other interpretations. Cost is the irreversible awakening of sealed reality folds, leaving Elara alone with unshareable knowledge. A second pressure beat (e.g., risk of isle destabilization) would have nudged 8+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges as “knowledge expands reality, but only the watcher bears its weight.” Subtext lives in the automaton’s mute pointing—its silence questions whether revelation is worthwhile. The final image of drifting isolation reweights earlier wonder into solemn responsibility, avoiding overt moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elara’s perceptions; diction favors Latinate precision (“ocular lenses,” “conceptual repricing”) that feels scholar-apt. Rhythm tightens from measured cadence to short, percussive clauses during key-turn: “Gears clanked. Glow. Stillness.” No filter-verb stacking; every sentence advances image or action.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Line-level density is high—each sentence layers task, tool, and cosmic referent. Metaphors are few but precise (“star-scarred dome”). No paraphrase loops; however, two adjacent “quietly deliberate” tags edge toward template cadence, blocking 9.0.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The bent-spoon reality fold is a fresh, non-obvious answer to the playground riddle “where do shadows go?” Integration with runic astronomy and clockwork automaton feels inevitable, not gimmicky. Risk is moderate—quiet lyric closure rather than spectacle—but the concept commits fully, earning its speculative payoff.</comment>
