<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Silas’s quiet obsession is cleanly dramatized through the single-minded dive; the lens-install beat embodies “inadvertent stubbornness” with cold fingers and no self-talk. Interiority stays concrete, but the moment he “understood his purpose” is slightly abstract—one unearned label away from a 9.0.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal chain is tight: lens → research → descent → fit → library awakens → cataloguing forever. Closure is Earned Stasis: he renounces the surface and pays with perpetual solitude; cost is visible in “his own weariness” finding its address. One micro-transition (surface/descent) stays legible under the default two-shard cap.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Salt-stink burlap, rusty submersible, bioluminescent dome—each detail is filtered through an undertaker’s tactile bias. The coral-crusted shelves and brine waterfalls actively guide his crawl, making the impossible geometry a lived constraint that charges the final stillness.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—give lost cries a resting place—tightens when the lens actually powers the archive: failure means perpetual unrest, success means permanent exile for the curator. One decisive escalation: the glow shifts from broken glass to systemic heartbeat, foreclosing retreat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of “burial as listening” emerges through shelving each signal; no abstract sermon, only the final image of “silenced storms” reconfigures the obsession into communal memorial. Subtext resides in hush and hum, not declaration.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited keeps undertaker-perception: weight, salt, cracked glass. Syntax lengthens underwater to mimic slow drift, then fragments when fingers fumble—rhythmic control without purple drift. No head-hop, no filter clutter.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence advances burial or archive. Figurative range (“cathedral of coral-crusted spires,” “pumping light through veins”) stays precise to marine decay and never muddies causality. Final line lands with quiet propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Underwater lost-call library is fresh, yet the tale’s engine is ancient: mortal catalogues the infinite. Risk lies in making preservation feel like self-interment; that inversion feels inevitable only after the lens locks in, earning the high band.</comment>
