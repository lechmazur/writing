<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied (“cool-headed” stays credible under sonic assault); micro-choices (silence-shaping, spike-thrust) trace a clear hierarchy of values. Frustration-to-hope transliteration on the spike gives visible emotional cost. No contradictory impulse is dramatized in-scene—calm never wavers—so the 9+ test fails. Still, the earned stasis of caging divinity in a jar feels proportionate to the length.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a cleanly landed Conceptual Repricing: the garden’s lullaby is tamed, constellations flee, and Kael holds a portable god—cost legible in the sudden hush. Accumulative lens holds: each broken pattern intensifies sonic density until the final silence reweights all prior sound. Causality remains intact: zigzag → silence → spike → echo. Orientation is taught by line 5; no penalty.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The rail spike’s cold weight, the lake of audible light, and the feral vines of minor keys all constrain tactics and charge the final image. Sensory triage is POV-filtered: Kael notices what can kill or anchor. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly across the zigzag. Environment is indispensable to outcome; 9+ gate met.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“catch the echo”—is signaled early and tightens once: the webbed cage forces Kael into the ultimate silence that forecloses all sonic defenses. Price is visible: he gives up the garden’s wild music for a private, bottled god. Escalation is textural (density → chaos → hush) under Accumulative lens; agency persists throughout. One meaningful turn suffices; no reversal is needed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges tacitly: creation’s echo is only graspable by negating the very medium that nurtures it—artistic theft as self-silencing. Subtext resides in the spike’s glowing emotional captions and the predatory lullaby’s promise/rest contradiction. No final moral is stated; resonance lingers in the jarred starlight. Image reconfiguration feels earned, not asserted.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains cool, metronomic diction that mirrors Kael’s temperament; perceptual signature is selective (sound-first, tactile second). Syntax modulates with pressure: longer clauses in calm, clipped fragments during lunge-and-miss. No head-hopping; free indirect stays clean. Distinctive without purple overload; 9+ test satisfied.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, and image-dense; no loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Figurative language is patterned (sound = flora/fauna) and taught early. Information density high: one sentence often performs setting, emotion, and motion. One hairline slip—“a memory of beauty” skirts abstraction—keeps it sub-9.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fishing for a goddess’s echo in a sonic biome reframes creation myth as auditory ecology; the rail-spike-as-emotional-LED is fresh, functional, and inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric worldbuilding coheres without late rule dumps. Tropes (quest, fisher) are transmuted through specific sound-garden logic. Bold yet clear; earns the +0.4 risk bonus.</comment>
