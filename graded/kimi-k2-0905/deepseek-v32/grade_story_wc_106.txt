<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses—thief’s habit vs. emergent curator—are declared more than dramatized; the switch to “open hand” lands as epiphany rather than embodied cost. Micro-choices (moonbeam swap, forgery) align with motive, yet the guard’s moment of shared wonder is summarized, not staged under pressure, so the relational shift feels convenient. Interiority skirts label-speak but leans on luminous abstractions (“illuminated disbelief”) that dull the final hinge.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: moonbeam jar re-weights stakes via sensory density rather than causal chain. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Elara’s stance crystallizes—but the cost is conceptual (re-labeling self) not felt; no durable constraint lingers. Orientation is clear by ~100 words; however, the flower-code mechanics are revealed retroactively, softening the midpoint tightening.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Emerald marble, bronze pot, and moonbeam glow are filtered through Elara’s tactical eye; each surface guides stealth choices. The jar acts as micro-setting that constrains the final swap. Sensory hierarchy favors sight; other senses appear once, but the visual pattern teaches early and charges the exit image. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible positions.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—claim vs. release of illuminated moments—tightens once when moonbeam exposure turns theft into shared wonder. Pressure is textural: glow density increases, narrowing Elara’s identity options. Cost is intellectual (self-redefinition) rather than tangible; no tool lost, no guard pursuit. Sufficient for length, but price remains abstract.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme—art as living light that must circulate—emerges from the moonbeam projection beat, not thesis. The guard’s wonder reframes prior thefts, re-pricing “destiny’s door” as communal threshold. Final image of lighter jar offers quiet CR that reweights all prior flower-coded commands. Avoids moralizing, lets ambiguity linger.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Third-limited voice is stable, with painterly diction (“emerald-veined marble,” “cool, silver light lanced”) that mirrors Elara’s aesthetic obsession. Rhythm modulates: longer cadence for sunset awe, clipped clauses during swap. No dialogue to test idiom divergence, yet internal idiom stays consistent. Filter verbs appear only once and are voice-motivated.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm is varied; sentence openings diversify. Information density high—each line advances image or tactic. Two adjacent near-repeats (“illuminated moment” / “luminous disbelief”) create mild echo, not loop. Metaphors stay coherent; no mixed vehicles. One typo: “a ornate bench” should be “an.”</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Core combo—heist + moonbeam jar + golden-hour joy-theft—feels fresh, not checklist. Flower-code communiqué is clever micro-world detail. Guard-sharing beat subverts expected getaway chase. Risk lies in lyrical rather than causal drive; payoff lands via image re-weighting, not twist. Sufficient transformation of familiar tropes.</comment>
