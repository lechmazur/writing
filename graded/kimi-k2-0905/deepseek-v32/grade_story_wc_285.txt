<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Eamon’s palimpsest of regret is palpable through the yarn-needle turns and the hush of his vigil; his choice to gift the needle crystallizes a believable, costly shift from duty to mercy. Interiority stays concrete—‘the yarn needle smooth from years of idle turning’—and his stoic endurance carries visible cost when the gutters fall silent. The only drag is that the woman remains a symbolic mirror rather than a second crucible, so relationship pressure is oblique. Still, his renunciation lands as earned stasis, satisfying the 9+ test.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The situational lens—coherent pressure forcing stance crystallization—holds unbroken: every beat of dripping gutter and fog thickens the same question, wait or leave. Closure is a Charged Poise: the silent gutter reweights all prior journeys and forecloses further mourning runs. Cost is unmistakable in the final image—‘the yarn needle was gone, given away’—and the persistent constraint of the ferry’s absence shapes tactics throughout. Orientation is anchored within the first 100 words; no lens ambiguity at end.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fog, river, and dripping gutter are not backdrop but tactical clock; the gutter’s cadence literally times Eamon’s decision, satisfying the 9+ constraint test. Micro-setting inside the greatcoat pocket—yarn needle against cold fingers—charges the final gift. Sensory filter is character-specific: coachman notices reins, hoof-snort, grease of wet leather, never tourist catalog. Spatial choreography stays clean as the woman emerges from the rear path, not the absent ferry.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—keep vigil until gutters cease—tightens with each drop; the silence finally forecloses his life-long hearse runs, a visible price. Agency is pure endurance; the palimpsest promise complicates rather than relieves pressure. No external antagonist needed; fog and absent ferry supply coherent situational pressure. Cost is legible in the emptied pocket and the dawn village he now faces without a fare.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from iterated images of erasure—palimpsest vows, fog effacing shore, dripping that stops—rather than assertion. The final gifting reweights the needle from lonely habit to transferable grace, offering resonant non-literal answer: presence itself is the fare. No moralizing line spells this out; subtext stays in gesture. Complexity lingers—old regrets remain, just overwritten by acceptance—avoiding tidy thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tightly lashed to Eamon’s perceptions: ‘his fingers found the yarn needle,’ ‘he felt the fog’s chill.’ No head-hops; psychic distance compresses under pressure—short clauses when gutters near silence. Diction stays within a coachman’s ken—‘plosh,’ ‘reins,’ ‘greatcoat’—without sudden academic register. Rhythm mirrors ambient attention: long sentences during percolation, clipped observations at final drip.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or stakes. Mixed metaphors absent—fog is ‘spongy wall,’ gutter a ‘metronome,’ both physically apt. Information density high: ‘yarn needle smooth from years of idle turning’ simultaneously reveals habit, economy, and emotional armor. Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; paragraph cuts land on sensory pivots.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Familiar trope—lonely coachman waits for passenger—becomes specific through sensory ferry-clock and palimpsest metaphor applied to lived regret. Yarn needle as memento transforms into gifted tool, a fresh inflection. Risk of static vigil is taken and paid off by internal crystallization rather than external twist. Gloom-hill and spindrift serenity collide in memorable tonal friction.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Setup: first line names gloom-hill coachman; Development: his choice to wait shapes entire beat sequence; Closure: he turns horse homeward, hill now ‘less steep.’ Causal pressure extreme—only this role would wait by a cemetery ferry. Cost: forfeits final fare and relinquishes talisman.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Two distinct beats—idle turning in pocket, final gift—plus charged reprise. Object’s smoothness embodies years of regret; gifting transfers mending to stranger, reweighting meaning. Removal would collapse the only physical action that externalizes acceptance.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Concept frames stakes early—‘palimpsest promise written over older vows’—and returns in final paragraph: old vows still visible under new layer of acceptance. Drives decision to keep waiting, links to yarn needle surface. Not merely metaphor; it changes tactical priority.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Trait enables ambient listening that replaces frantic thought; micro-choice to keep hands on reins while attention diffuses is visibly costly when cold sets in. Without acute attention the drip-timing clock fails, so trait directly shapes plot mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>‘Let the question percolate’ stated mid-scene; method delays conscious decision until gutter silence, enabling the final gifting impulse. Swapping with ‘ponder’ would lose the slow filtration image that mirrors fog seepage.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Ambient awareness mechanics repeated—listening to river, horse, gutters—rather than named once. Allows epiphany that promise, not passenger, matters. Without it, interior logic collapses into ordinary worry.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Fog clock governs visibility and timing; river absence prevents ferry, forcing internal resolution. Setting is not backdrop but antagonist. Could not be replaced by generic dark road.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Gutter drip explicitly tracks wait length; final silence triggers departure and gift. Live clock narrows options—if drip resumed, he might keep waiting—so time directly alters tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Motivation stated early and tested: complexity of absent ferry, fog, regret must distill into single act—gift needle. Scene's minimalist gift is the distilled essence he sought. Friction between waiting duty and inner peace visible.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Spindrift serenity first named as light in fog, recurs as ‘deep airy peace’ in closing trot. Tone modulates from mournful hush to calm without emotional reset; final image reweights earlier gloom, charging closure.</comment>
