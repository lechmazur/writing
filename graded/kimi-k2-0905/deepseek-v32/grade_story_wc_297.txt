<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Silas’s contradictory impulses—curiosity vs. the agony of rooting—are dramatized in every step; the final self-immolation is earned by the scar-link trials. Interiority is concrete (“soil tighten around his ankles like a forgotten promise”) and avoids therapy-speak. The only drag is a slight rhythmic repetition of “anxious elation” that softens peak pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lattice holds: each scar contact tightens options until the only remaining path is permanent fusion. Orientation is crystal (“cobalt glade at dusk” anchors by line 3). Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the clipping dissolves, roots enter flesh, and the glade’s light stabilizes—cost made visible in fresh earth-scars.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The glade is not backdrop but instrument: root-drag alters gait, dusk-cobalt refracts decision, the maze-casting light literally points to the air-scar. Micro-setting (clipping, oak scars) functions as topology that must be navigated. Spatial choreography is immaculate—no floating bodies or drifting props.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“stabilize the intersection before dreams collapse”—is signaled in first 60 words and tightened twice: vision reveals instability, clipping dissolves to foreclose retreat. Cost is tangible: loss of mobility, flesh, solitary eternity. Agency is causal: Silas elects the root-bind; the glade does not gift it.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from recursive growth imagery: mazes, roots, scars, networks—no moral stated. Final image of perpetual balance between anxiety and elation reweights the opening “trembling joy” into earned stasis. Subtextual silence (no named dreamers) keeps focus on guardian cost, not rescued masses.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric-cumulative, patterned in parataxis (“He…He…”) that mirrors root-rhythm; taught by line 4 and paid off in root-bind cadence at close. Perceptual signature is botanist-poetic: plants exhale, soil remembers, scars whisper. No head-hop; distance remains tight third.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet breathable; metaphor chains (“liquid twilight…shadows swim”) stay physically coherent. One paraphrase loop (“anxious elation” ×3) costs −0.3. Otherwise zero scaffold, high information ratio, and no mixed metaphors in the root-fusion climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fantastic botanic mysticism feels fresh: topiary-as-key, scar-as-modem, root-as-seatbelt. Premise is non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Risk of lyric repetition is taken and mostly paid off; only the echoed emotional label feels familiar rather than newly minted.</comment>
