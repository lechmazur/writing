<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied (“excruciatingly gentle touch” used as shield and later as reconciliation method). Micro-choice—tracing the droplet—carries the entire arc; renunciation of music dream is credibly endured with on-page cost (quiet truth cradled). No secondary character on page, so bullets 7-8 N/A. Flaw: dream backstory is summarized, not dramatized, muting the contradiction that could have pushed her to 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: density of hush/crystal/petrichor imagery escalates until the final “heard quiet” reweights her life mechanism. Closure unit = Earned Stasis: she does not resurrect music yet now bears it as “a gear that no longer turned,” cost legible. No orientation debt; anchors clear by word 40. One paraphrase loop (“excruciatingly gentle”×2 inside 3 lines) nicks 0.2 but does not scar closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Crystal forecourt functions as micro-setting: droplet path she tracks literally guides her ritual choice; same crystals echo final “brighter whisper.” Petrichor is filtered through POV nostalgia and links to dream loss. Spatial choreography clean; no weather clichés. Slight over-description of light/color in consecutive sentences near midpoint costs 0.3.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—peace with abandoned music—signaled early. Single tightening: shift from regret to accepting dream as “composition of her life.” Agency is attention/renunciation rather than external fight; cost visible in final gear metaphor. Pressure is situational and accumulative; no causal antagonist needed. Lacks a second beat that further narrows options, holding it below 8.5.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: surrender as creative act—dream composes the woman. Recurrent hush/crystal images reconfigure meaning without authorial thesis. Final image of “heard quiet” offers non-literal answer. One soft moral line (“to bear an abandoned dream…was to cradle a quiet truth”) is stated, not fully dramatized, trimming 0.4.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person intimate stays close to Elara’s perceptual bias—soundless filters every observation. Syntax mirrors her delicacy: long vowel clusters, polysyllabic hush. No dialogue, so bullets 13-15 N/A. No head-hop; psychic distance tightens in droplet-trace beat. Occasional adjective stacks (“crystal whispering forecourt”) risk purple but remain within POV lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Strong rhythm modulation—clause lengthening under calm, clipped fragments at sunrise break. High density: sensory, emotional, thematic work packed into single sentences. One paraphrase loop noted above; no mixed metaphors. Copy clean. Opening and final lines both anchor and echo. Register stable.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Clock-scribe-who-yearned-for-music is familiar terrain, but treatment is specific: droplet ritual, gear-as-former-dream metaphor, acoustic imagery of silence. Risk taken in eschewing plot for lyric accumulative structure pays off. Could edge higher with one more concrete memory shard of her music failure to deepen particularity.</comment>
