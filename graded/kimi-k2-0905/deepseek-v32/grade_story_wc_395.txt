<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Aris’s obsession with “where deleted files go” is a vivid, specific motive that fuels every step; her micro-choice to lie to Kael crystallizes the interior conflict between truth and survival. The contradiction—archive keeper becomes clandestine grave-tender—is dramatized, not stated. Cost is felt: she swallows the truth and becomes the tomb herself. Flaw: we never see her body under stress; the moment is pure cognition.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each numbered breadcrumb tightens the noose toward the encrypted diary, which in turn forces the lie. Closure is Earned Stasis—Aris buries the truth inside herself, foreclosing whistle-blowing with visible moral cost: “a grave for six people…marked only by her brightly attentive silence.” The reconfiguration is legible: public archive now actively falsified, private cache now the only cemetery.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>“Vast digital necropolis” and “cold corridors” anchor immediately; the archive’s humming silence becomes the story’s weather. Micro-setting works: the derelict data-morgue is entered, carved, and physically looted—choice alters environment. The embroidered patch is tactile, carried from poem → cache → final image, recharging the closure. Spatial track is clean; no impossible moves.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether the vanished crew will vanish again—tightens once: discovery of encrypted diary → lie to preserve it. Cost is clear: moral self-interment. Pressure remains coherent; coincidence only complicates (numbers keep resurfacing). No reversal beyond the single decisive renunciation, but that renunciation forecloses every future path except complicit silence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: memory is not neutral—archives can be weaponized erasure. Patch, numbers, and poem form a small, particular set that reweights at the end; the reader feels the obscene convenience of corporate immortality versus human disappearance. No final moralizing; the silence itself is the argument. Ambiguity lingers: is Aris guardian or accomplice?</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person close stays tightly welded to Aris’s perceptual filter: numbers “pulsed softly,” archive “hummed louder than any stored memory.” Syntax flexes under pressure—short clauses when she’s caught: “She had to lie.” No head-hop. The jargon (“metadata,” “data-morgue”) sits inside her professional lexicon, never explanatory. Final image’s “quiet heart of the memory keeper” is rhythmic, fatal.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is lean and propulsive; few adjectives, strong verbs (“carved,” “excavated,” “swallowed”). No simultaneity errors; temporal sequence is clean. One scaffold-ish line: “It was a philosophical itch, a technical mystery…” could compress, but it is early and brief. Closure beat is uncluttered, letting the patch image resonate. No mixed metaphors or filter-verb stacks.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: corporate deep-fake space heroism + metadata ghost-story. Familiar trope (corporate cover-up) is reanimated through archival forensics rather than action escape. The numbers-as-coordinates gimmick is old, but here they act as heartbeat inside dead content—felt, not explained. Risk taken: story ends in complicit stasis, not exposé, making silence the new frontier.</comment>
