<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elara’s motive—share light without fire—stays legible and her tactile handling of the gear embodies sentiment versus calculation, but interiority repeats the same tension in paraphrase (“troubling serenity” variants) instead of deepening contradiction; no micro-choice escalates risk after the void ping, so the final stance feels foregone rather than paid for.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sonar ping layers pattern recognition until the gear’s hum reweights the garden’s loops in a Charged Poise closure—light diffuses without burn, cost legible as acceptance of darkness. Spatial/temporal anchors arrive by line 3 and never drift; causality is associative, not linear, but coherent to closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Nebula petals, ionized clusters, and the brass gear supply micro-setting that directly shapes navigation tactics; sonar returns make the void palpable. Sensory triage favors echo over sight, matching POV bias; environment constrains the final decision to share diffuse light.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—deliver illumination without destruction—tightens when the void anomaly threatens the pattern; gear recalculation is visible agency. Stakes stay conceptual; cost is cosmic sorrow rather than personal sacrifice, so pressure feels steady but not acute.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of cyclical light-and-loss emerges through spiral imagery and gear calculations, never sermonized; final image reweights prior fire-scar memory into serene acceptance. Ambiguity lingers whether serenity is resignation or transcendence—invites reflection without moral tag.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Lyric third-person hovers at intimate distance, diction salted with metallurgical and nautical precision (“brass,” “ping,” “ionized petals”) that feels character-specific; cadence slows to match vapor-thin time without monotony. No head-hop, no filter-verb clutter; compressions like “approximated infinity” are pattern-taught early and repay in closure hum.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm modulates between long nebula swirls and curt pings; figurative language rarely stacks in one beat. A few soft spirals—“quiet sigh of falling petals” repeated—create template echo but never obscure causality or dull the final diffusion image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Sonifying a nebula nursery into an emotional archive is fresh; using a dead civilization’s gear as cooling lens rather than weapon reframes standard “relic” trope. Risk is moderate—lyric accumulation over plot—but execution commits fully; could push further if void anomaly had forced a unique moral calculus.</comment>
