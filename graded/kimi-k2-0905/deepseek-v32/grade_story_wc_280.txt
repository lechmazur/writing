<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara’s longing for an encore is vivid, but her interiority is mostly lyric assertion (“tasting bronze of old lights”) rather than embodied contradiction under pressure; no micro-choice visibly risks anything until the final sung note, so the change feels willed rather than earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural pattern is legible—echoes braid memories until the timeline snaps whole—but closure is a declared fusion (“the fractured timeline quivered, then snapped”) without on-page cost; the lens holds yet the ending lands as gentle uplift, not charged poise.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Garden, hedge maze, and tarot coin are sensuously etched and filter through synesthetic perception; the coin’s glow finally charges the image. Spatial tracking stays clean; environment mirrors mood but never blocks or enables a tactical choice, capping short of 8.8.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Stake—“rewrite despair into new chance”—is signaled early; pressure intensifies via accumulating echoes that threaten nostalgic overload, a credible deepening. Yet the final resolution is affective crescendo, not a narrowed option or price paid, so escalation stays moderate.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme of reclamation through curated memory emerges via echo-imagery rather than statement; the orchard-audience transmutation offers a resonant reconfiguration. Some phrasing edges toward explicit thesis (“power of memory and the sweetness of return”) but stops short of moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Lyric third-person hovers at psychic distance yet stays consistent; synesthetic diction creates a signature rhythm. No dialogue to test, but syntactic repetition (“echoes of her past… drifted… Echoes of her past soliloquies…”) feels intentional rather than monotonous, supporting incantatory effect.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Varied sentence length and strong verbs keep momentum; a few purple swaths (“perfume-laden air,” “glittering shards of moments past”) slightly over-decorate the climax. No loops or scaffolding, metaphors stay coherent, and opening/closing lines are sharp.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Synesthetic ghost repairing time with staged applause is fresh; tarot coin as tuning key and orchard-as-audience transmute familiar tropes. Risky lyric structure pays off in final image, though concept of “fractured timeline” remains more poetic than procedurally inventive.</comment>
