<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Aris’s “gently meticulous” trait is repeatedly labeled but never allowed to misfire or cost him anything; the final discovery arrives through mechanical sampling, not a pressured choice that tests or reweights his nature. Interiority stays surface-level, reciting duty rather than revealing contradictory impulses. Because no alternative path is ever entertained, the Earned Stasis feels pre-ordained rather than paid for.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the vow is found inside the illusion, turning archive into authorship. Cost is present but abstract—the quartz hush “holding its breath”—so the reweighting is legible yet not viscerally felt. Causality under the Accumulative/Textural lens holds; each sampled frequency thickens the pattern until the vow emerges. Orientation is anchored early; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The frozen library is evoked with spare, cold-specific sensory hits—“crystalline air,” “memory-crystals,” “silver filaments pulsing”—that filter through Aris’s careful attention. The lantern slide functions as micro-setting: its brass holder and pulsing lines constrain the exact speed and angle of measurement, guiding the final discovery. Spatial choreography remains stable; no weather or scale drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Stakes are declared—oblivion versus preservation—but the only visible price is the abstract thinning of the sigh-frequency; Aris never risks losing access, time, or identity. Pressure escalates texturally: each sampled echo is lighter, building a pattern of loss rather than narrowing options. The final vow-discovery deepens meaning without forcing a trade-off or foreclosed path. Adequate for length, but not urgent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme—memory as intentional legacy—emerges through the inversion that vows were planted inside illusions, not extracted. Subtext is carried by the lantern’s beam and the hush, avoiding explicit thesis statements. The ending image of vows glowing on parchment offers a resonant, non-moral answer. No late symbolism or echoing platitudes.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person POV stays tightly aligned to Aris’s perceptions; perceptual signature is crisp—“quartz hush,” “ghostly archives”—and rhythmic control mirrors his metronomic ritual. No head-hopping or register drift. Filter verbs are minimal and voice-motivated. The lyric cadence is consistent without monotony; final sentence lands with quiet inevitability.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; figurative language is selective and coherent—“silent symphony of ice and stone.” One paraphrase loop (“sampled…measurement…sampling…measured”) recurs across adjacent clauses but does not obscure the closing beat. No mixed metaphors or scaffolding. High-band control with a hairline slip.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>The “library above the clouds” premise risks whimsy, yet the piece grounds it through procedural detail of frequency sampling and the revelation that vows were engineered inside illusions—an fresh angle on archival fantasy. Tropes of fading memories and luminous archives are synthesized into a specific, character-driven ritual. Risk is moderate but coherent; nothing feels grafted for quirk.</comment>
