<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is specific—her gaze on the detached tail, the soft murmur to Kael—but the “shedding” epiphanies arrive as neat abstractions, not simultaneous contradictions under heat. The final stance is earned, yet the micro-choices leading to it are summarized rather than dramatized, blurring the cost she feels in real time.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the tail in the dated vial is a Resonant Reconfiguration that reframes betrayal as regenerative possibility. Causal chain holds—betrayal → shed illusions → report + advocate—but the middle “shed” beats are compressed into exposition, softening the tightening that would lift this into the 9-band.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>The misty clearing workshop is sketched with selective sensory strokes; the tail-as-micro-setting constrains her cleaning ritual and charges the final image. Stars and damp earth recur without stalling momentum, though spatial anchors (bench → cage → window) are functional rather than vivid enough to push higher.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—restore self-respect without forfeiting compassion—surfaces early and tightens once she decides to report Leo. The cost is legible (she may lose shared history, face retaliation), yet the beat is relayed in summary, muting the visceral pinch that would force a steeper escalation curve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of regenerative integrity emerges through the tail motif rather than statement. Final image reweights the tail from mockery to talisman without moralizing, but earlier “balance” language edges close to thematic echo, capping resonance just below exceptional.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Elara’s reptile-handler perception—color-shift details, patient cadence—and modulates under pressure. No head-hop; syntax remains controlled, though occasional elevated phrasing (“quietly vivid gloom”) feels slightly writerly rather than character-bound.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; figurative language is spare and purposeful. One scaffold loop—“she shed the layer of… Next, she shed…”—repeats structure without added pressure, a minor drag that keeps this shy of the 9-band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Wildlife-handler POV fused with chameleon-tail regeneration gives fresh spin to the betrayal-recovery arc; the shedding metaphor could feel workshop-common but is grounded in her professional gaze. Risk is moderate—quiet lyric rather than twist—yet the synthesis feels particular, not templated.</comment>
