<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The double-vision condition is dramatized through the dream-engine ritual (“ghost of what was and the shimmer of what might be”) and the climactic moment when she seizes the path that “chose her.” Interior contradiction is visible: the playful calibration dance collides with the burden of relentless foresight. The final shift from cataloguing to cultivation is earned because the dream shows her own past selection, fusing grit with ethereal insight. Cost is felt: the decaying directive collapses, leaving her purpose self-forged.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: storm pressure → dream intrusion → seizure of the path → directive dissolution → new imperative. The decisive change (cultivate, not catalog) lands on-page with the wafer glowing as persistent constraint. Orientation is complete by line 5; no debt. One causal tightening suffices at this length; no off-stage resolution or luck. Cost is legible: “the decaying directive…finally crumbled away entirely,” paid in lost certainty.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The cedar-root hatch, moss-softened consoles, and bioluminescent gel are filtered through Foresight’s technician-poet gaze; details constrain action—gel turbulence mirrors dream violence, hatch rattles cue ritual timing. Spatial track is clean: hollow entrance → bunker cathedral → dream path → return to hatch. Weather actively shapes choice (storm pressure disturbs gel, intrudes as lightning-path). The wafer seal recurs as micro-setting that charges the final image. No white-room syndrome; every descriptor feeds motion or stakes.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—why paths choose walkers—is signaled in paragraph 1 and tested in the dream battlefield. One meaningful tightening: when lightning-path arcs toward her, observation flips to agency; options narrow to “be chosen or choose.” Escalation is causal under storm pressure; no coincidence resolves. Price is paid: former directive destroyed, future burden self-assumed. Sufficient for 600-word scale.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the inversion of selector/selected, dramatized when the path lunges at her. No explicit thesis; insight crystallizes in the final image of the glowing seal as “guide for when the next walker is chosen.” Ambiguity remains: is cultivation mercy or imposition? Ethereal grit tone carries subtext—soft moss against rusted steel, playful calibration against existential burden. Resonance is particular, not abstract.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited clings to Foresight’s synesthetic perception: “double vision,” “precisely playful dance,” “gel pulsed with the forest’s rhythms.” Syntax lengthens during dream descent, shortens at the lightning strike, mirroring tension. No head-hop; lexicon stays within post-human technician range. No dialogue to corrupt voice. Final line cadence—storm cleanses outside, stillness inside—reinforces Charged Poise without exposition.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sentences carry dual load: “vine-draped bunker…rusted hatch woven into the green tapestry” seeds both decay and symbiosis. Metaphors are coherent: bruise-purple storm, cathedral of machinery, paths as hungry organisms. No mixed vehicles or synonym loops. One scaffold check: “precisely playful” repeats three times but is motif-taught early and pays off in final calibration move, so waived. No artifact touches closure beat. Rhythm modulates with storm surge then settles into quiet final paragraph.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The foresight/hindsight amalgam is fresh, but the deeper twist—paths as desiring entities—reweights familiar chosen-one tropes. Dream-engine as lucid cartography feels inevitable yet not derivative. Risk in compressing apocalyptic rewilding and AI oracle into 700 words pays off because the final image localizes cosmic stakes into one glowing wafer. Specificity (cedar root, silica leaf) prevents abstract drift. Synthesis earns the +0.2 risk bonus.</comment>
