<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Arin’s “sacredly playful” trait is asserted repeatedly but never embodied in contradictory action; the only micro-choice—swapping chess pieces—reads as calmly pre-planned, not playful or risky. Interiority never fractures under pressure; instead we get summary labels (“resolve remained firm,” “smiled”). The final beat claims wisdom but no visible flaw or cost is conceded on-page, so the arc feels tidy rather than earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure lands: violet sky → normal stars is a legible Decisive Change and the sundial’s dulling shows a persistent price, satisfying cost. Causal chain, however, is thin: the chess-swap rule is introduced only when the beam reveals runes, so the turn feels conjured rather than foreclosed. Orientation is clean; single-scene spine held.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Icebound spire, thinning air, and aberrant violet glow are vivid and filter through Arin’s gaze. Micro-setting (sundial lid, chessboard) constrains the decisive act. Yet spatial choreography inside the chamber is skipped—pieces and door positions float—preventing higher band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“restore the sky”—is declared early and visibly tests success at the end. However, escalation is almost atmospheric; no mid-scene reversal or tactical trade-off complicates Arin’s path. Pressure stays flat because the chamber presents no resistance once the door opens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>“Sacred playfulness versus chivalrous duty” is stated often but never dramatized in a conflicting choice; the swap itself is dutiful, not playful. Emergent theme therefore defaults to a generic “fix past mistakes” arc without reconfiguring the premise. Final line restates motivation rather than reweighting meaning.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person voice keeps consistent distance and occasional poetic compression (“unknown was now a rushing river”). Yet syntax settles into repetitive “He [verb]” cadences that dull rhythmic urgency under peak pressure. Perceptual signature is present but not distinctive enough to elevate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.5</grade>
<comment>Sentences are clean, readable, mostly propulsive; no scaffold loops or mixed metaphors. Figurative language is serviceable but relies on stock pairings (“ice glittered,” “breath fogging”) that could swap into any frozen adventure without loss. Lacks sentence-level surprise or density expected at elite tier.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>Combining chivalric code with playful thief is fresh, and sky-as-chessboard is a nice lift. Yet beats follow a standard “climb-replace-escape” template without subverting it; the chess pieces’ hidden secrets remain abstract, so the concept feels under-exploited. Specificity is present but not memorable enough to feel inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
