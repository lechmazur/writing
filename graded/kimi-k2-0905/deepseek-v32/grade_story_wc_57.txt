<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elara’s patience is dramatized through the slow rope-reading; the fulgurite gift is a tangible micro-choice that shows motive. Yet her interiority stays general (“vast,” “simple”) and never contradicts itself; we get no bodily stress or second thoughts while deciphering. The final cost is only implied in the warming seed pod—felt, but not embodied in her muscles or breath—so the endurance lands just shy of earned flesh.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the weavers speak, the lore passes, Elara stands in a reconfigured world. The rope code is set up, tested, and paid off in one continuous causal chain. Fog-lift and warming pod give visible environmental repricing. No orientation debt; single-scene anchor arrives by line 4 and holds.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Golden dock, snow, frost-rimed rope, and fog are filtered through Elara’s seed-collector gaze; each sensory layer guides her kneeling, tracing, and final comprehension. The fulgurite acts as micro-setting, focusing her sight and later charging the gift exchange. Weather shifts (fog thickens then lifts) track the beat of disclosure, making environment an active participant rather than postcard.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—extract the secret before it dissolves—is signaled early and tightens as knot after knot resists quick reading. The single meaningful escalation is the crown knot’s revelation of glacial-silt revival; this narrows her options from “search” to “guardianship,” forcing a social gamble with the fulgurite. Cost is present but abstract (future burden of carrying lore); no immediate physical or relational price is levied on the dock.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of preservation-through-attention emerges through tactile rope memory rather than assertion. The lightning-glass vs. hand-woven knot juxtaposition quietly reweights “natural artistry” as collaborative, not possessive. Final image of the warming seed pod reprises preservation without moralizing. Ambiguity remains: she now holds power that could commercialize or sanctify the lore—an unspoken ethical tension.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person lyrical mode stays close to Elara’s patient perception; syntax lengthens and breathes with fog. No head-hop; psychic distance contracts smoothly during knot focus. Weaver dialogue is minimal, indirection successful (“knots are our memory”). Free-indirect diction keeps within her philosophical-but-grounded lexicon; no filter-verb clog.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary from spacious atmospheric units to tight tactile clauses, mirroring fog vs. knot scrutiny. Figurative language is selective (“oceanic hush,” “crown of intertwined lines”) and never stacks in high-pressure beats. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; each paragraph advances knowledge, image, or stakes. Clean grammar, precise spatial tracking of rope, glass, and body.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Rope-based agricultural cryptography feels fresh and specific; fulgurite as calling card reverses the usual “tech trinket” trope into natural art. Transformation test fails—Elara could be an antiquarian map collector without breaking arc—but the knot language and glacial-silt seed revival are non-portable inventions that anchor the piece. Risk is moderate: slow, lyric decryption instead of thriller pace, but coherence holds.</comment>
