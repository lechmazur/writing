<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elara’s “veiled dreamer” tag is evocative, but interiority drifts into label-speak (“cautious exuberance” repeated) and embodied contradiction is scarce; only micro-choice is lifting the veil. Watch acts as external compass, so agency is partly displaced onto prop. Earned stasis is present—she leaves with transformed attention—yet cost is abstract (“quiet confidence”) not felt in body or forfeited option. Character functions, but lacks visceral hierarchy of values under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: “Remember” reweights the entire interval between letters, satisfying cost. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density of mist/echo/cipher builds to final resonance. Orientation anchor (who-where-when) is clear within 120 words. Single causal glitch: watch reversal is declared helpful before any on-page failure, blunting first beat tension; still, pattern coheres to end.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Mist-propagation delay is returned to bodily rhythm—echoing footsteps narrow perception—so micro-setting constrains tactics. Library glow and shelving infinity are familiar wonder tropes, but kept in POV filter. Pearlescent/veil imagery recurs and charges final image without overt symbolism. Spatial choreography clean; no impossible moves or white-room gaps.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—decipher unspoken words—signaled early. One meaningful tightening: cipher demands backward reading, forcing Elara to rethink process under time-dilated mist. Cost is conceptual (altered attention) rather than tangible; stakes stay intellectual, limiting visceral escalation. Pressure sufficient for lyric mode but not ferocious.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Theme—meaning resides in silence/emergent pattern—arises from cipher mechanics rather than assertion. Final single-word letter provides resonant reconfiguration without moral. Subtext operates in watch whispers and veil gesture; avoids tidy profundity. Minor echo of “truth is in the silence between letters” skirts thematic statement but is earned by prior pattern.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Third-limited voice maintains consistent perceptual tilt—sound delay, light diffusion—without head-hop. Diction tilts slightly archaic (“purportedly,” “tome”) yet stays within dreamer lexicon. Rhythm modulates: longer cadence for mist, clipped phrases at exit. Filter verbs minimal; free indirect clean. No dialogue to test speech distinction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence detected. Occasional elevated adjectives (“pearlescent,” “ornate”) risk density but pattern supports wonder tone. No mixed metaphors or paraphrase loops. Punctuation and pronoun reference clean. Final line lands with image, not explanation—meets read-aloud ear test.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Library-of-unspoken-words trope is familiar, yet linkage to propagation-delay physics and backward-reading cipher gives fresh inflection. Reversible watch as truth-device repurposes con-man prop into epistemic tool—specific synthesis. Conceptual risk (time-scrambled mist) stays coherent. Could swap “veiled dreamer” for another seeker without breaking arc, capping ceiling.</comment>
