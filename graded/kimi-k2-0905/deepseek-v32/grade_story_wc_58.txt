<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Aris’s interiority is textured—“geography of healing,” the thread’s slight roughness—and his micro-choice to sit without opening the notebook signals vocation-as-intimacy. Elara’s dying wish supplies external pressure, but her voice is second-hand summary; we never hear contradictory impulse or embodied fear, so the relationship crucible stays one-sided. Closure earns a quiet renunciation (he stays, imprints her story), yet the cost is more asserted than dramatized. Still, within <800 words the contradictions of a death-witness who must keep moving are legible and character-particular.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each sensory layer (rust, rot, woodsmoke) thickens the tapestry until the final star-map image reweights “the weft holds.” Orientation is clean by word 50; causality is loose but coherent under an accumulative design. One tightening: Elara hands over the thread—this object pass crystallizes the stakes and provides the story’s persistent constraint. Closure lands as Charged Poise: Aris forecloses departure, accepting winter exile while carrying her trace; cost is felt in the frozen bench and the silence that is “not empty.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Garden description is filtered through Aris’s vocation—he maps decay the way he will map her death—so every hue or scent is purposeful. The thread micro-sets as “setting” because its roughness against palm later steers his decision to remain. Spatial choreography is tracked: cliff → gravel path → bench → caretaker → return to bench under stars. No weather clichés; “season saying farewell” is earned by the final falling leaf that clicks into the carpet motif.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake: can Elara’s life be witnessed into permanence before she dies? Pressure escalates by accretion: each remembered palace image adds urgency to the unfinished obituary. The midpoint tightening is her relinquishing the thread—this object now ties Aris to staying. Cost is legible—he misses the ship, faces winter isolation—but the beat is singular; no secondary reversal or tactical loss beyond the original stranding.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of “absence as pattern” emerges through concrete returns: vanished ship, lost homeland, impending death, empty garden—all held by an unseen weft. Subtext lives in gesture (thread passed in silence) rather than thesis. Final star-map silently reweights earlier carpet motif without moralizing. Complexity is preserved: healing is not smooth plain but “complex terrain,” refusing tidy comfort.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited adheres to Aris’s perceptual palette—colors as inks, griefs as cartographic features. Syntax lengthens under calm, shortens at twilight (“stars pricked the violet sky”), mirroring emotional cadence. No dialogue, so voice distinctness rests on idiosyncratic diction (“geography of healing,” “lonesome splendor”) that stays within his lexicon. Filter verbs appear but are voice-motivated (“he understood,” “he felt”) and paid off in embodied detail.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is lyric yet propulsive; sentences carry double duty—every sensory detail also advances metaphoric loom. No scaffold loops or synonym churn; “garden was a tapestry / tapestry of decay” is intentional parallelism, not artifact. Mixed metaphors avoided; carpet, thread, map, stars form one coherent textile constellation. One minor over-write: “sweet, poignant rot of fallen apples” pushes two adjectives where one suffices, but it does not touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Premise—“obituarist for the living”—offers fresh angle on death-and-memory tale. Carpet-thread as ancestral USB stick is specific, not quirky ornament; it constraints the close. Risk is moderate: lyric accumulative structure in <800 words could have drifted into vignette, but the final star-map reconfigures prior material. Could swap names/places with minor edits, so transformation is not absolute, yet the vocational lens gives it memorable tilt.</comment>
