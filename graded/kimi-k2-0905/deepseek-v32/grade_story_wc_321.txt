<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Kael’s obsessive steadiness is memorable, but the interiority is mostly declarative (“his heart bound,” “resiliently positive”) rather than embodied contradiction under pressure; no moment shows him doubting or recalibrating, so the final smile feels unearned. The empty hourglass–>silver glow beat does force a micro-choice, yet the cost is purely metaphorical; we don’t feel him lose or risk anything visceral. Still, his single-minded drive cleanly propels every beat, satisfying the 9- quick test’s “prior causality” requirement.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the re-stabilised ferry is simultaneously solid and “permanent transient,” a legible RR with conceptual cost. Causality is lyric-accumulative rather than tight because/therefore; the sideways-time rule set is taught early and the starlight–radio–hourglass circuit pays off. One orientation waiver applies—the grotto’s disorientation is functional—so no penalty. A hairline slip: the voice whispering through the radio is unmotivated late information, nudging score below 8.5.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Spectral grotto, starlight pathways, and translucent hull are vivid, selective, and repeatedly steer Kael’s attention and tool-use; the hourglass-as-micro-setting constrains the climax, satisfying the 9+ gate. Sensory economy is strong—no tourist catalog—yet “perpetual starlight” and “cavity in reality” flirt with abstraction without tactile follow-up, capping below 9.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Single dominant stake—stabilise the vanishing ferry—remains coherent; escalation is pattern-deepening (starlight pathways brighten, hourglass fills) rather than option-narrowing, fitting accumulative lens. Cost is conceptual (permanent transience) not visceral, keeping it from 8.5. One meaningful tightening occurs when the ferry fully vanishes, forcing Kael to act; luck never rescues.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of impermanence-as-constant emerges through recurring ferry vanish/reappear cycle and final silver light, never sermonized. Subtext in radio static and empty hourglass is effective. No late thematic echo, but abstraction in “moments bled into each other” slightly blurs emotional after-effect, holding below 8.5.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Kael’s selective attention; perceptual signature is consistent—“sideways clocks,” “metaphysical harmonics”—without register drift. Rhythm modulates: longer clauses in calm, clipped fragments during vanish. No dialogue, so voice contamination absent. One POV slip: “passengers…their memories blending softly” ventures outside Kael’s possible knowledge, minor but noted.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is lush yet propulsive; no scaffold loops or template cadences. Mixed-metaphor risk in “liquid silver glow” beside “starlight pathways” but physical logic holds. Two near-simultaneous participles (“watching…knowing”) in high-tempo beat slightly muddy sequence. Otherwise clean, vivid, read-aloud strong.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Takes the well-worn “time-slip ferry” trope but re-roots it in cosmic-maintenance labour, making Kael a ferryman-cum-quantum-tech. Starlight-as-circuit-board and hourglass-as-radio-modulator feel fresh, specific, and inevitable in hindsight. Risk in abstract time-rules is taught early and coheres, meriting +0.3 risk bonus. Doesn’t hit 9 only because the emotional cost remains cerebral rather than personal.</comment>
