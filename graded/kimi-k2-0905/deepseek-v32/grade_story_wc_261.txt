<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Aris’s compulsion to “read scars” is embodied early (coffee-ring map) and intensifies through the root-chamber communion; the final acceptance of his opening-up scar carries felt cost. Interiority stays concrete—plant thirst as “wordless pang,” root-song as “mineral-slow memory.” No contradictory impulses are staged simultaneously in-scene, only sequential realizations, keeping him just shy of the 9+ threshold. Micro-choices (watering fern, palm on root) legibly trace his shift from seeker to listener.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the hourglass flows, re-weighting time from frozen grief to living calibration; cost is the permanent displacement of his human-only perception. Causal chain (surgery → unblock → descent → communion → reframed scar) holds without skips; the buried astronomer journal pays off the coffee-ring map set-up. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) appear within 60 words and remain stable. One meaningful tightening—hand to petrified root—crystallizes the lens shift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The tower, hourglass, and petrified root-ball function as micro-settings that constrain movement and charge the final image; the root-walls literally touch back. Selective sensory detail (cool stone smell, phone-light on bone) filters through Aris’s historian bias. Spatial choreography is clean: bedside → desk → cellar → tunnel → sphere, no impossible jumps. Environment mirrors internal state—dry fern vs. grateful hum after watering—without overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—understand his new telepathy and the tower’s secret—is signaled by paragraph 3 and escalates through sensory overload in the root-chamber. Agency resides in descent and palm-press; these acts foreclose the option of remaining merely human-observer. Cost is legible: permanent perceptual displacement, relinquishing silence. No external antagonist needed; pressure is situational and coherent under the Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particular scars—coffee rings, graft suture, burn on root—rather than abstractions; closure reweights “closure” from erasure to literacy. Subtext operates in the hourglass restart: silence resumes flow, implying endless listening ahead. No final-paragraph moralizing; the last line trusts image. The concept of displaced miracle is integrated through causal events, not meta-commentary.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is consistent—meteor hush, mineral-slow memory, choral whispers—aligned with a historian’s taxonomic gaze. Syntax modulates with pressure: longer clause-stacking before descent, clipped fragments inside tunnel. No head-hopping; single POV holds. Compression (“earthly dark pressing close”) is taught early and paid off. Diction stays within plausible academic-leaning lexicon of a brain-scarred astronomer.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally; no template cadence detected. Sentences carry double duty—information and atmosphere—without scaffold. Figurative language is sparse enough to avoid density penalty; mixed metaphors absent. One paraphrase loop (“scars…damage that defined everything”) is minor and does not touch closure. Strong verb choices (scoured, prying, straining) propel momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Synthesis of plant telepathy + scar-reading + buried root-miracle feels specific and inevitable in hindsight; removal would collapse the story. The trope of telepathy is inverted—accidental, vegetal, mineral-slow. Coffee-ring cartography offers a fresh investigative method. Risk in lyrical compression heightens coherence without obscuring causality. Emotional specificity (joyous fiery song vs. searing purge) avoids generic eco-mysticism.</comment>
