<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Amir’s maimed hand stroking the geode registers embodied guilt; every micro-choice to re-activate the array costs dwindling power and bodily stamina, so his endurance carries visible price. The late speculative turn (geode singing) is accepted because his prior scientific obsession foreshadows the leap. Interiority stays concrete—no therapy-speak—and contradictory impulses (hunger for proof vs. dread of confirmation) coexist in-scene. Closure’s bleak poise is earned: having found the wound, he now must sit with it—cost made legible in the spent, silent observatory.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal lens holds throughout: drone-strike guilt → theory → perturbation hunt → leak revealed → power cut → earned stasis. Orientation anchors inside 120 words; "floating observatory" + cooldown clock grant who/where/when. One tightening: second pulse sacrifices safety protocols to force the manifestation, narrowing options irreversibly. Closure beat—"twin weights of discovery and desolation"—charges the image with undeniable conceptual cost, satisfying 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High-desert air, suspended lattice of the observatory, and cooling breaker diodes feed tactile specificity that constrains Amir’s every move. Micro-setting rule met: the geode’s crystalline cavity functions as portable "room" whose resonance state alters tactics. Weather and altitude appear through breath, static crackle, shimmer of leaked emotion—never catalogued. Sensory economy is tight; each detail either burns power or reflects damage, culminating in the "wound in the air" image that reweights the stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prove the grief-pool theory—declared early; pressure escalates precisely because each pulse spends finite coolant time + battery charge. Cost is continuously paid: breaker hiss fades, diodes dim, final plunge leaves Amir literally powerless. Agency remains causal: he, not luck, overdrives the array and looses the leak. Tightening moment (safety override) forecloses retreat; closure freezes him in charged poise beside the depleted geode.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: nothing is ever lost—yet that truth offers zero comfort, only deeper dread. Geode-as-resonator and leaked wedding music reconfigure "waste" into palpable wound. Final image of silent, cold crystal beside maimed hand delivers conceptual repricing: knowledge itself is the scar. Resonance is non-moral, anti-consolatory, and lingers because particulars (wedding flash, cousin’s smile) precede it.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Detached, observational diction fits clandestine-scientist POV—"calibrated nothingness," "fingerprint of wasted joy." Syntax lengthens during theory exposition, then fragments under pulse tension: "Time to hunt." No head-hopping; interior access stays strictly Amir-bound. Dialogue is absent by design; voice remains coherent and singular unto the bleak, exhilarated final cadence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>High information density: single sentences couple motive to physics ("hunt... perturbation... sonar pinging a silent sea"). Varied cadence avoids template; short pulse commands break long reflective clauses. Zero mixed metaphors; crystalline/wound imagery stays consistent. Only micro-slip—"thin air of the high desert" cliché—does not touch closure, so minimal deduction.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Emotion-grounded quantum-horror feels fresh; grief mapped as literal groundwater is non-obvious synthesis. Geode turned emotional antenna transforms familiar prop into necessity. Wedding-music leak re-illuminates drone-strike trope with new ethical physics. Risk in staging climax as soundless colour bleed pays off; closure would collapse if replaced with generic explosion.</comment>
