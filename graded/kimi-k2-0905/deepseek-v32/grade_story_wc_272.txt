<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elian’s grief is credibly embodied (the splintered box = his mind), but interiority drifts into stock abstract labels—“fragmented reality,” “necessary darkness”—that feel pre-packaged rather than discovered under pressure. The micro-choice to untangle threads is dramatized and links to the climactic re-perception, earning the moderate score, yet we never witness a true contradictory impulse in scene; the stance marches smoothly from despair to determination without a visible internal fight that would cost him something on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The causal spine holds: because Mara died, therefore the box is broken, therefore Elian must unknot the silk to unknot his sight. The final image—repaired box, cohesive reality—lands a clean Resonant Reconfiguration with conceptual cost (he forfeits the old “portrait” mode of seeing). Orientation is clear by line 4; the lighthouse/library geography stays coherent. A minor slack beat: the library’s “throat-tightening” is stated twice without new consequence, but it does not derail the forward linkage.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The circular library inside a lighthouse is economically anchored and used: dust becomes luminous only after the untangling reclaims it, so the setting physically mirrors the perceptual shift. The tarot box functions as micro-setting that constrains every finger movement. Sensory selection skews visual—an acceptable bias for a painter POV—and the narrowing of perception under grief is credibly maintained. Meets the 9+ gate with environment charging the final image, but not quite vivid enough across multiple senses to breach 8.8.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“can he see pattern beneath loss?”—is signaled early and tightens once: when the walls literally close, the only route is into the knotted cards. The untangling beat is agency-driven and forecloses the option to keep grief sealed. Cost is present but soft: the “luminescent ache” is felt yet not tethered to a concrete irreversible loss on the page (no canvas burned, no memory erased). Sufficient for 7+; the lack of a material price caps it below 8.5.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</question><comment>Theme emerges organically: loss as thread, not tomb. The Moon → High Priestess → Star sequence reweights “fate” into “framing,” letting the reader sense art as re-seeing rather than prophecy. No moralizing final paragraph; the last line returns to the lighthouse beam, leaving interpretation open. The insight is earned, though the rhetorical questions flirt with thematic echo, just dodging the automatic −0.4 penalty.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</question><comment>Third-person lyric stays close to painter perception—visual metaphors, color-shadow diction—and the rhythm swells then steadies in sync with the untangling. No head-hopping; distance is stable. Filter verbs (“seemed to pulse”) are minimal and voice-motivated. A faint repetitious cadence in “threads…threads…threads” is purposeful patterning rather than artifact, so no deduction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</question><comment>Prose is clean, high-density, and read-aloud smooth; figurative language is selective and tied to painter lexicon. One mixed metaphor (“kaleidoscope of memories…refused to coalesce into a whole”) is acceptable; it never obfuscates causality. No loops, scaffold, or synonym churn. Opening and closing lines are sharp, the latter recharging “luminescent ache” with new ironized hope.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</question><comment>The tarot-as-grief-map is familiar, but the specificity of silk threads literally knotting cards freshens it, and the lighthouse/library fusion feels singular. Risk is moderate—lyric accumulative structure rather than twist—but the execution commits fully. Not quite a radical re-imagining, yet the painter’s perceptual turn gives the concept a memorable slant.</question>
