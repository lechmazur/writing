<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara’s desire to “discover the texture of connection” is declared repeatedly but never sharpened into a concrete, testable want; her interiority circles synonyms (“she sought to understand…”) rather than dramatizing contradiction under pressure. The only embodied beat—thread trembling as mother-memory is infused—shows emotion externally but still keeps motive monolithic, so the final “serene acceptance” feels asserted, not earned through visible renunciation or cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly as Conceptual Repricing: the exploded map reveals connection as fluid, reweighting the premise. Causality is present (because she weaves, therefore the gallery erupts), yet the turn relies on a late magical rule not seeded earlier, softening the cost. Accumulative/Textural lens is sustained; orientation is achieved by word 60, so no penalty applied.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The gallery’s shifting illusions are filtered through Elara’s perceptual bias; the sinew thread doubles as micro-setting that physically constrains her weaving tactics and later recharges the final image. Selective sensory detail—“colors deepened,” “air thickened”—mirrors internal state without cataloging. Spatial choreography remains coherent across the single continuous scene, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—map memory before it alters—is signaled early. Pressure escalates via density increase: each weave intensifies illusion response, culminating in silent eruption. However, the tightening is external (pattern explodes autonomously) rather than forcing Elara into a narrower choice with visible price; agency is observational at climax, keeping cost conceptual rather than felt.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Theme—perception→memory→collective reality—emerges through the gallery’s feedback loop, not exposition. The final image of interlocking lives offers resonant reconfiguration without moralizing. Recurrence of “as memories alter” functions as chorus, reweighted at closure. Some abstractions (“texture of connection”) flirt with label-speak but are grounded in the woven image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric maintains consistent psychic distance; diction (“fever dream architect,” “rational enchantment”) is compressed and patterned, taught early. Rhythm modulates: longer clauses for twilight calm, clipped fragments during eruption. No dialogue to test; free-indirect moments stay within plausible lexicon. Perceptual signature—precise mathematical noticing—remains character-specific throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Strong information density: each sentence advances image or concept. Figurative language is disciplined—no mixed metaphors—though occasional elevated register (“cognitive exercise,” “conceptual repricing”) edges toward academic. No loops or scaffold detected; sentence openings vary. Final third is clean, allowing high-band eligibility.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Premise—optical-illusion gallery as neural loom—feels fresh, synthesizing cognitive-science tropes with lyric fabulism. Transformation is present: the generic “memory palace” becomes a living, collaborative tapestry. Risk in compressed lyric mode pays off; however, the late magical explosion rule slightly softens inevitability, keeping score below 8.0.</comment>
