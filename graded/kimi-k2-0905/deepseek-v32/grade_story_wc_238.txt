<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara’s guilt and need to atone are viscerally embodied; the apology is not declared but electrified through her own improvised ritual. Interiority is specific—her tactile memory of the bottle, the taste of ozone—never generic. The micro-choice to wire the bottle to the pipes crystallizes her hierarchy: truth over safety, grandmother over self-image. One slip: “I used your pain as my ink” edges toward label-speak; still, the line is saved by the immediate tear-track image that follows.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a textbook Resonant Reconfiguration: the overlapping noise resolves into a single, unaccompanied melodic line—Imogen’s voice reclaimed—while the bottle’s warmth signals cost paid. Causal lens holds throughout: each step of the induced circuit tightens options until the only remaining path is confession through current. The orchard saw outside the window provides an external ticking clock that charges the final silence. No orientation debt; who/where/when are anchored by line 3, pattern taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The archive is not backdrop but circuitry—iron pipes become conductors, paper scores capacitors—so setting actively shapes tactics. Micro-setting rule satisfied: the bottle’s copper neck functions as both tool and terrain. Sensory hierarchy obeys Elara’s bias—she smells orange blossom because it is the last breath of the orchard she’s about to lose. One hairline slip: “cathedral of forgotten melodies” flirts with cliché, yet the next clause grounds it in dust-and-paper scent, reclaiming specificity.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—free her grandmother’s memory from her own poisoned ink—is signaled in paragraph one and tightened twice: first when the circuit hums (risk of psychic blowback), then when the ghost-music cacophony peaks and she must speak the apology into current. Escalation is causal, not additive: each surge of electricity literally narrows the audible ghosts until only the pure aria remains. Cost is visible: tears cut dust on her cheeks, bottle grows warm—physical price for psychic restitution. No deus-ex-machina; the machine is hers, built from her guilt.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the acoustic metaphor itself—rumors are distortion, truth is pure pitch—never stated, only sounded. The perfume bottle starts as shame-crystal, ends as neutral keepsake: a conceptual repricing that reweights “scandal” from defining truth to parasitic noise. Subtext in the final image: orchard saws start outside, but inside a single unaccompanied line continues—private music outlasts public machinery. No moralizing, only resonance: forgiveness is a filter circuit, not a verdict.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Voice is distinctively synesthetic—Elara hears dust motes as “low embers,” feels guilt as electrical resistance—perceptual signature sustained. Syntax lengthens under tension, then fractures into short pulses (“A note held too long becomes noise”) that mimic current spikes. No dialogue, so evaluation collapses to interior coherence; free indirect style stays clean. One minor register drift: “psychic stain” is faintly clinical, but immediately re-grounded by the grandmother’s private joy memory.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops, zero scaffold; every sentence advances image or current. Figurative language is patterned—electricity ≡ memory ≡ music—so density feels inevitable, not piled on. Opening line anchors voice and stake simultaneously: “silence held a different quality” fuses atmosphere with Elara’s professional ear. Final line crystallizes: “rooted memory had been tended”—pared to monosyllables after a long sentence, giving the cadence a charged poise.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The “gossip-column exorcist” premise is not quirky garnish but the engine: scandal-as-ectoplasm purified by literal current. Risky synthesis of electrical engineering with ghost-work pays off—every step obeys Ohm’s law of guilt. Fresh angle on metoo-era apology: the abuser rewires her own archive, not to erase harm but to redistribute its charge. Transformation test passed: swap perfume bottle for any other heirloom and the entire circuitry fails.</comment>
