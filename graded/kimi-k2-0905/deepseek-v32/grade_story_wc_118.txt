<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Silas’s eccentric historian trait is shown through mismatched socks and “memory for echoes,” but he is primarily a passive observer—no contradictory impulses or micro-choice that costs him. The final act of fixing the tapestry is presented as an intuitive ritual rather than a decision forged under pressure. Interiority is vivid (“floor tilted”) yet never complicates his goal. Oddness remains decorative, not crucible-level.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of silence → diary evidence → tapestry map tightens the stake (lost inner compass) until the final image reweights meaning. Closure meets CR: tapestry as new “pole” conceptually reprices the silo’s function with felt cost (“quiet remained…dragon’s wing”). Orientation anchored by 120 wds; one clean transition down/up silo. No causality break; cost is legible on final line.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Silo is handled tactically: cool air guides descent, ash in fireplace cues diary discovery, column finally becomes literal axis for tapestry. Micro-setting (fireplace brick, rolled cloth) constrains the probe and the climactic re-hang. Sensory triad (cool, ash, dusty light) filters through Silas’s bias. Final image reuses the column as charged pole—passes 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“restore inner north”—is signaled early and deepens via diary testimony and tapestry star-map. Escalation is textural: each artifact layers proof of psychic displacement until Silas’s stance crystallizes (recalibration, not mere collection). No visible personal price (no risk, injury, or sacrifice), so cost is conceptual only, keeping it below 8.8.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly: mythic imagination as existential compass. Dragons shift from sorrowful guardians to faint wing-beat of hope—image reweights prior silence without moralizing. Subtext resides in objects (ash, stitches, stars) rather than exposition. Final resonance is concrete, non-didactic, lingering.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains tight psychic distance; perceptual signature is acoustical (“bronze quiet,” “stories walls have heard”). Syntax modulates—long spiral sentences in descent, short declaratives at fix. No dialogue, so no voice drift. Filter verbs (“felt,” “realized”) are sparse and character-apt; occasional poetic diction (“preserved chill”) is earned by mood.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong rhythmic control: variation in sentence length mirrors ascent/descent. Figurative language is selective, never stacked; metaphors are coherent (axis = inner compass). Zero loops or scaffold. One minor register lift—“conceptual repricing” idea is named internally, yet justified as historian’s idiom. Opening and closing lines anchor and resolve with image precision.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Post-dream apocalypse + silo library + tapestry star-map is a fresh synthesis; trope of “last dream” is flipped into architectural acoustics. Axis displacement is rendered as psychic astronomy—non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking (museum relic inside agrarian silo) tightens mythic stakes without gimmickry. Could edge 9.0 with higher personal cost.</comment>
