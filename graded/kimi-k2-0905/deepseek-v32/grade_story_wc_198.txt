<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Leo’s interiority is concrete—he “listened through negative space,” “poured his breath into the horn”—and his flaw (solitary guardianship of silence) directly enables the climax. The endurance/renunciation earns its stasis: he leaves with the “radiant grotto within him,” a visible cost. One hairline slip: the phrase “memory of a future noise that never came” drifts toward explanatory paraphrase, blunting emotional immediacy at the final beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the whispered note slides into the prophecy’s core, the code fractures, and the hush is re-earned rather than broken—cost is unmistakable in the crystal’s dimming pulse and Leo’s slowing heartbeat. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout: tension escalates via density of silence and light rather than causal chains. No orientation debt; who/where/when land by line three and the mist-shrouded prism atrium is re-anchored each descent.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The prism atrium and grotto are not backdrop; the mosaic “silent, open mouth” silently commands Leo to listen, and the crystal spire’s glow directly responds to his saxophone breath—environment constrains and enables the final tactic. Sensory economy is disciplined: three senses max per beat, never tourist catalog. One micro-slippage: “spectral ribbons” is a stock visual; the phrase is forgiven because the next clause grounds it in “mist shiver.”</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The dominant stake—will the prophecy’s cacophony awaken?—tightens via shortening pauses and thrumming crystal; escalation is felt, not declared. Agency is Leo’s refusal to shout, instead filling silence with softer sound; this renunciation forecloses the path of louder resistance and carries visible cost in breath spent and crystal dimming. No reversal, but the deepening of silence into near-scream then back to earned hush satisfies the single meaningful intensification rule.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges from negative-space pattern: silence as active labor, not absence. The final image—city sounds “remembering a dream of quiet”—reweights every prior sensory filter without moralizing. Subtext is carried in gesture: Leo’s smile is “faint, quiet curve,” a bodily whisper that mirrors the saxophone’s final breath. No thematic echo; the insight stays lodged in image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The perceptual signature is distinct: Leo clocks time by “drip of condensation,” reads prophecy in “intervals,” and the narrator borrows his compression—sentences shorten as thrumming rises. No head-hop; single POV holds. One cadence lapse: three successive “the crystal” noun opens in the grotto paragraph create template drumbeat; minor, does not touch closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High information density: “dewdrops formed on the wrought-iron gates, each bead a tiny, trembling lens” does three jobs—time, atmosphere, POV bias—in nineteen words. No scaffold loops; metaphor vehicles stay physically coherent. The single overwritten beat—“painfully beautiful”—is excused because the next sentence grounds the pain in vibrating mist. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with saxophone phrasing.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The prophecy-as-silence-code is fresh, and the inversion—sound used to *re-silence* noise—grows inevitably from the premise. Risk is taken: a nearly plotless, lyric escalation that could have drifted into vignette, yet the Accumulative lens keeps stakes legible. The “vested hush” concept could have slid into abstraction but is repeatedly tethered to concrete acoustic gaps. No close echoes; the grotto imagery feels singular.</comment>
