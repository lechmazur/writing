<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elias’s interior contradiction—clinging to order while courting chaos—is embodied in the workshop “monument to his own fractured sense of time” and carried through the brass-edge lock-pick moment; the final renunciation of perfect restoration is earned and costs him his lifelong defense. No secondary character on page, so relationship bullets NA; micro-choice hierarchy is legible when he snaps the compass rose. One slip: “uncertainly certain” is used as label twice before it’s dramatized, blunting peak beats −0.3.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal chain intact: broken compass → greenhouse draft → hatch → waterfall → letter; each beat forces the next tool or revelation. Closure is Earned Stasis: he forecloses perfect-order restores with visible cost—needle now points at his own heart, workshop ethic permanently shifted. One micro-turn at waterfall letter; no outline sequencing. Anchors (who/where/when) land by word 90; orientation test satisfied. Cost is legible in final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Workshop, greenhouse, cavern tracked with sensory triage (smell of decay, bioluminescent glow); cracked panes and rusted hatch constrain physical choices. Brass compass rose acts as micro-setting that finally charges the heart-pointing image—passes 9+ gate. Selective detail keeps word economy tight; no white-room syndrome. Spatial choreography clean across hatch descent and waterfall wade.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“will he surrender certainty?”—signals early and tightens when he must destroy the compass to proceed; that irreversible act forecloses the old method. Pressure grows under causal lens: each clue narrows options until the letter reframes disorder as map. Visible price: heirloom compass mutilated; future repairs now accept asymmetry. No coincidence resolves; pattern recognition is earned.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through recurring “spin” motif—clock hands, compass needle, falling leaves—culminating in stillness aimed inward; no explicit moralizing. Letter’s “accept its spin” reweights earlier chaos as guidance, achieving Conceptual Repricing. Ambiguity remains: life will keep fracturing. Final image of leaves outside window loops quietly to greenhouse draft, reinforcing uncertainty-as-landscape.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Free-indirect third stays close to Elias’s tinkerer perception: noticing hidden drafts, metal fatigue, fungal light. Syntax lengthens during contemplation then compresses during lock-picking; cadence mirrors attention. No dialogue, so those bullets NA. Diction remains within horologist lexicon without showiness. Unreliable hope (“this time order will hold”) subtly corrected by close.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong noun-verb pairs (“snapped the compass rose,” “needle trembled”) and purposeful repetition of “spin” create rhythmic cohesion. Zero paraphrase loops; no mixed metaphors. One filter-verb cluster (“he realized,” “he understood”) in final paragraph dulls peak momentum −0.2, but does not touch closure sentence. Brass-edge improvisation beat is vivid and propulsive.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Combines clock-repairer micro-craft with magnetic-compass mysticism in a fresh synthesis; admiral’s anti-battle letter reframes nautical failure as life-design manual. Transformation test fails if Eliia were any artisan, but specificity of horologist vision keeps it particular. Risk-taking modest—straight quest structure—but concept commitment high. No close echoes of famous scenes.</comment>
