<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Elara’s “mossy delight” is a vivid, embodied trait that steadies her interiority, and her monument-building micro-choices visibly enact the generational task; the final transformation is earned because every beat before it arises from her attentive labor with seeds, stones, and dust. Interior contradiction is muted—no moment where desire to decode conflicts with, say, fear of change—so the arc feels more luminous inevitability than crucible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of tiny monuments + moonstone dust intensifies until the milky sapling reweights the whole arbor from ashen to sky-bright. Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the instant sprouting and color shift crystallize a before/after for both world and vocation with felt aesthetic cost. Orientation is anchored by sentence three; no teleporting props; causality stays intact—prod → mist → monument → sapling.</comment>

<comment>“Ashen skyborne arbor” is sketched with charcoal-branch immediacy; sensory economy favors touch (moss, pebble, twig) over visual clutter. The arbor’s slow color-shift at the end is the environment constraining stakes—it literally brightens the sky—so the 9+ gate is met. Spatial choreography stays clean as Elara kneels, sorts, builds; no floating rooms.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—decode leaf-messages via monuments—tightens once: failure to integrate moonstone dust would keep the arbor ashen. Price is present but soft: the labor of building and the risk of “neglect” are implied rather than viscerally felt. Escalation is a single deepening under Accumulative lens: each monument adds luminous density until the sapling image reconfigures cost. No external antagonist or concrete loss is dramatized, so pressure plateaus below 8-band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of memory-as-renewal emerges organically through the monument motif rather than commentary; the final image of glowing sapling reweights earlier “forgotten things” without moralizing. Subtext stays in gesture (sorting, planting) not declaration. The absence of a counter-theme or ironic gap keeps resonance earnest but not complex enough for 8.5+.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric voice sustains a consistent botanical diction (“mossy delight,” “lunar symbol”) that is both sensuous and precise. Rhythm modulates: long sentences for hush, staccato for prod → shimmer. No head-hopping; psychic distance stays close to Elara. Filter verbs are minimal; metaphors (“charcoal sketches”) are clean and POV-apt.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Sentence variety is high; no template cadence or synonym loops detected. Figurative language is spare and purposeful—“grain of starlight” is the single compressed image that recurs as moonstone. Opening and closing lines do double duty: anchor tone and re-charge motif. A single paraphrase blush (“leaves fell bearing messages” echoed two sentences later) keeps it from 8.5.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Floating sky-arbor whose leaves carry memory is a fresh fantastical frame; monument-building to extinct seeds gives tactile novelty to eco-fantasy. Folklore is not expository window-dressing but an operative rule-set. The synthesis feels inevitable: dust → monument → decoded leaf feels like the only possible ritual for this world. Risk is moderate—quiet lyric rather than bold structural gamble—but specificity earns the +0.3 within-band.</comment>
