<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Aris’s claustrophobia is stated early and flares at the climax (“room seemed to shrink”), but it never alters tactics—he proceeds downward exactly as planned. Interiority leans on summary (“claustrophobia clawed at his mind”) rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The final renunciation of fear is declared, not dramatized; no micro-choice shows the cost of that release.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the blank codex signals that memory-transfer incurs complete self-expenditure; cost is legible. Causal chain holds—codex → pedestal → cables → world—though “phase transition” mechanics remain hand-waved. Orientation clear by 120 words; tidal window keeps time pressure coherent. One non-closure slip: grandfather backstory is told, not tied to a present-tense trigger that tilts choice.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Facility corridors rendered as “throats,” gold fleck pulsing against damp metal—tactile and selective. Micro-setting works: the shrinking room embodies claustrophobia and forces the final stance. Undersea cables evolve from silent to humming, mirroring restored memory; this recurrence charges closure. Spatial choreography clean; no impossible moves during phase shift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“return the unremembered”—is signaled early and tightens via the literal tidal clock; water seepage narrows options. Agency consists of activating the device, a single decisive act that costs the codex’s power. No intermediate reversals, but the deepening pressure of rising water suffices for 600-word scope. Felt price is the blank codex, visible on the final page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of memory-as-obligation emerges through the gold fleck’s migration from book to cable, avoiding explicit thesis. The refrain “crashing hush” evolves from threat to comfort, reweighting silence as earned peace. No moralizing; the blank page leaves ambiguity about whether restoration justifies erasure. Grandfather motivation remains abstract, blunting thematic personalization.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Aris; perceptual signature favors acoustic detail (“distant, echoing drips”) consistent with subterranean dread. Rhythm compresses under pressure—“water began seeping in from below”—then widens for the shore release. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk zero. Occasional abstract lifts (“return was not a physical journey”) slightly dilute immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose is lean, with high information density; each sentence advances image or beat. Metaphor engine disciplined—“walls lined with schematics” grounds tech without exposition dump. One paraphrase loop: “facility phased around him” echoes prior “phase transition” in adjacent sentence. No mixed metaphors, no filter-verb clusters; final image clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Memory-transfer via tidal-phase physics feels fresh yet plausible within its own rules. Claustrophobic spelunker is an inversion that immediately complicates mission; not merely quirky. Gold fleck as tracer for invisible loss supplies a visual through-line most stories would leave abstract. Risk taken in non-physical “return” pays off; avoids genre-default body-rescue.</comment>
