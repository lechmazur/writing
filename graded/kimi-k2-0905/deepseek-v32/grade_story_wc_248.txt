<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Ezra’s motive—the volcanic tenderness that chooses annihilation as preservation—lands as a single, sharp contradiction and powers every beat. Interiority stays concrete (“their analytically intuitive mind, trained to spot patterns in chaos”) and drives the map discovery. The final renunciation—abandoning words for stone art—pays off the flaw, but the emotional shift is declared more than embodied; a moment of bodily cost would have pushed it higher.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: arson → fragment → cipher → archive → vandalized portrait → concealed map → seed vault → new trail. Each discovery is motivated by Ezra’s logic, not coincidence. Closure is a Decisive Change: the former destroyer becomes curator, cost felt in the quiet vow to remain off-grid forever. The 120-word orientation anchor is cleanly met in the first paragraph.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The ash library, waterfall entrance, and glowing diorama are sketched with sensory economy; each locale is filtered through Ezra’s evaluative gaze. The miniature ecosystem’s “gentle glow” against soot-stained boots reweights the opening fire. Spatial choreography is clear across the single POV journey. Detail never stalls momentum, but only the final chamber actively constrains choice—slight cap.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can Ezra save anything after destroying the library?—is signaled in the first paragraph and tightens when the curator’s erased face challenges their faith in preservation. One meaningful deepening: vandalism revealed as concealment narrows options from “find knowledge” to “protect it.” Cost is visible: perpetual exile as guardian. Pressure stays causal; no coincidence resolves the conflict.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme—destruction as genesis—emerges through image sequence: fire → ash → seed-light. The tapestry and scraped portrait literalize the idea that erasure can preserve. No explicit thesis is stated; the final stone trail offers a mute, resonant answer. Subtext in the curator’s self-scarification silently critiques Ezra’s earlier “tender” arson.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person POV stays tight to Ezra’s analytical yet intuitive perception; diction (“volcanic tenderness,” “analytically intuitive”) is character-specific. Rhythm modulates: longer clauses for contemplation, staccato prepositional phrases during discovery. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk is zero. Free indirect style is clean and consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty—action + atmosphere—without scaffold. Figurative language is sparse and precise (“volcanic tenderness,” “cooled lava”). Zero filter-verb clusters or template cadence runs. A single paraphrase loop (“a need to save them… granting a spectacular end”) is minor. Opening and closing images are sharply cadenced.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The arson-as-rescue premise, art-archive civilization, and self-vandalized map feel freshly synthesized. The inverted library trope—burning to save—gains specificity through Ezra’s paradoxical motive and the living diorama payoff. Risk: non-linear, image-driven trail is taught early and pays off. Transformation test fails only if you swap the seed vault; the concept collapses without it.</comment>
