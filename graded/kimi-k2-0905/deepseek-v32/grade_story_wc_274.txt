<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elara’s “bravely conflicted” label is declared repeatedly but never shown through contradictory micro-choices; the decision to transmit is smooth, untested by hesitation or bodily cost, so the final resolve feels pre-won rather than earned under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Causal chain is clean—letter found → inspect heard → encoded pulse → rumor fallout—and the closure lands as conceptual repricing: history’s silence is broken. Cost is present but abstract (“dread and liberation”); no concrete consequence touches Elara on the page, so the moment lacks a tangible price.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The cryogenic library is vividly sketched—frost, vaults, silent channels—and the “data-splicer” tool constrains the climactic action. Spatial anchors arrive early; weather and architecture mirror internal freeze/thaw without overstatement.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve vs. release contraband truth—is signaled early and tightens once when footsteps force the encode-or-lose choice. Escalation is single-step; no new obstacle or price compounds after transmission, so pressure plateaus rather than deepens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Theme—truth must be cold-released before it can warm the world—emerges through image pattern (snow ↔ silence ↔ frozen history) rather than assertion. Final reweighting is felt when dormant wires “whisper,” turning archive infrastructure into nervous system; avoids moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited keeps steady psychic distance; diction stays cool, analytical, matching archivist temperament. Repetition of “dizzying quiet” becomes hypnotic cadence rather than clutter; no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, high-density; sentences advance image or stakes. Occasional echo (“the quiet dizzying” / “dizzying quiet”) is purposeful motif reinforcement, not scaffold; no mixed metaphor or filter-verb bloat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Frozen archive as silencer of sainted founders’ sins is fresh world-angle; transmitting scandal through antique wiring repurposes dormant infrastructure as resistance vein. Conceptual risk is moderate—quiet release, not riot—but execution feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
