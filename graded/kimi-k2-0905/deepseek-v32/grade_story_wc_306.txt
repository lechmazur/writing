<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Aris’s “sincerely insincere” stance is asserted more than dramatized; we never see him tempted to drop the mask or pay a price for it, so the contradiction stays abstract. Lena’s shift from certainty-hunger to doubt-acceptance is cleanly legible, but the interior labor is summarized (“she realized…”) rather than embodied in a beat where we feel the recoil. The hollow shard beat gives one vivid micro-choice—her chill—yet Aris withholds any parallel revelation, keeping him a cipher. Enough grounding for the arc to function, but not enough pressure on either psyche to lift this into high band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: repeating wind-chime motif and shard image tighten the emotional field until the high clear “release” note lands as Charged Poise. Causality is present—Lena’s looking into void → conceptual shift—but the causal chain is thin; the beat is more epiphany than forced choice, so cost is conceptual rather than visceral. Orientation is swift and spatially clean; single-scene default met. Closure reweights the premise (doubt = space, not curse) with undeniable conceptual cost; meets 9− gate tests but lacks persistent constraint that would shape future tactics, capping below 9.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Lighthouse, breeze, dawn, and chimes are filtered through POV priorities—sound over sight, air over rock—so setting never stalls momentum. Shard as micro-setting object is handled twice and charges the final image, satisfying 9+ gate. One anchoring lapse: “breezy lighthouse” is named but we get no interior staircase, lamp room, or physical obstacle; space feels weightless. Enough sensory specificity to serve the concept, yet environment never constrains a tactical choice.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—Lena’s need to escape binary morality—is signaled early and deepened when the shard shows her absent reflection. Single meaningful tightening: she “no longer wanted certainty, but to welcome nuance into certainty,” a conceptual micro-turn that forecloses fundamentalism. Pressure is situational and intellectual; no external antagonist or resource lost, so cost is purely interior. Sufficient for this length, but absence of felt price or foreclosed option keeps it below high band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Theme—doubt as generative space—emerges through chime-to-shard pattern rather than lecture. Final image of “doubt had become a cloak, not a curse” is an articulated thesis, but it recasts prior motifs so the repricement is legible. Avoids tidy moral; ambiguity remains. One thematic echo too explicit in closing clause, nudging down from 8+.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited hovers near Aris yet keeps psychic distance consistent with his performed detachment. Prose rhythm is controlled, with sentence variety that breathes at emotional peaks. Lexicon stays within character frame except for one lifted register: “conceptual repricing” locution sneaks in via narration, not Aris. Distinctive perceptual signature—wind as language—sustains voice unity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Clean,-loop-free sentences; high information density; no mixed metaphors. One paraphrase loop (“certainty was a cage…black-and-white judgments”) and a template cadence run (“she…she…she”) knock minor points. Otherwise propulsive and ear-tested. Artifacts do not touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade>
<comment>“Conscience for hire” and hollow-mirror conceit give fresh angle on the familiar mentor-seeks-wisdom frame. Wind-chime divination is novel but under-used; mechanics never complicate tactics. Core arc could transplant to tarot or tea leaves without revision, limiting freshness. Still, synthesis of shard + doubt-cloak generates a memorable image that reweights the premise.</comment>
