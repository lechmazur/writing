<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara’s skepticism is asserted more than embodied; luminosity and taste-method never complicate her choices under pressure. She observes, walks, asks one question, then quietly accepts the answer—no interior contradiction or visible cost. The climactic “understanding” is granted, not earned by a micro-choice that forecloses a path. Consequently the arc reads as passive reception rather than earned shift.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: weather-as-memory re-weights the premise, and the aurora–lavender image reprises the opening with new meaning. Causality remains thin—compass vibrates, figure appears, explanation delivered—but the accumulative pattern is legible and the lens holds. Orientation is taught early; spatial track stays clean. Cost is felt conceptually rather than through action, satisfying the short-form threshold.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Lavender bluff, tin ring, and aurora are textured through tactile and olfactory filters; the ring’s cold band and ozone taste anchor the POV. Environment subtly guides the walk to the cliff edge, so setting constrains movement. The terrestrially-cosmic bridging image recurs and charges the final tableau. Selective sensory triage keeps momentum; no white-room drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Stake—why people carry weather—is signaled early and deepened when the figure claims “past, condensed.” However, escalation is expository: the stranger explains, Elara absorbs; no narrowing of options or tactical trade-off occurs. Pressure remains atmospheric rather than character-level. Sufficient for short-form single tightening, but visible price is off-stage.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of emotional atmospheres emerges through recurrent weather-as-memory image rather than statement. Final aurora tapestry re-prices earlier sensory cues, inviting reflection without moralizing. Subtext operates in the metallic taste shift and ring hum—gesture over declaration. One sentence flirts with thesis (“She realized her own luminosity was a kind of weather”) but is grounded by embodied context.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Elara’s perceptual filter; diction (“tasted the air and found it static”) carries signature. Repetition of “terrestrially cosmic” reads deliberate pattern, taught early. Syntax breathes with scene pace; no head-hop. Dialogue虽然只有两句，但保持了距离感与象征调性。Minor cadence echoes (“lavender bluff… lavender scent”) serve reprise function.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, seldom overwritten; figurative layering justifies lyric mode. No loops or scaffold; information density high. Occasional elevated phrasing (“terrestrially cosmic”) risks register drift but is consistent and pattern-motivated. Closure image remains clear, so artifact penalties minor.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Weather-as-emotional-residue trope is refreshed via synesthetic taste-method and democratic forest elections; combination feels idiosyncratic. Premise follows implications without flinching. Final convergence image is inevitable yet not predictable from opening. Specific detail keeps concept from abstraction, earning the risk bonus.</comment>
