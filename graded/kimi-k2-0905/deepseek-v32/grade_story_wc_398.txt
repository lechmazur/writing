<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Interiority is poetic but abstract; “passionate subtlety” is asserted more than embodied. The burned-letter touch is concrete, yet Leo’s shift from ache to empathetic understanding is narrated rather than dramatized through micro-choices. No contradictory impulse is staged in real time; the arc is a smooth summary, so the final peace feels lightly earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: parallels between vines and romance layer until the final quiet reconfiguration. Orientation is swift; amber pavilion / vacant station anchors by line 3. Closure lands as Charged Poise—lantern light reweights the letter’s ash and the vineyard rows with accepted cost. No causal break, though escalation is gentle, not tightening sharply.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Sensory selection is tight and autumn-specific; scent of decay mirrors internal renewal without overt symbolism. Pavilion, station, and vine rows are tracked cleanly; lantern flame becomes micro-setting that charges the final image. Details filter through Leo’s rural custodial eye—no tourist catalogue. Environment does not constrain a pivotal choice, capping Q3 at 8.8.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—make peace with mismatch—is declared early. Pressure accumulates via metaphoric layering rather than narrowing options; no concrete obstacle or trade-off appears. The climax is a cognitive parallel, not a decision that forecloses a path, so cost is atmospheric, not tactical. Sufficient for length, but escalation stays tepid.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme of destined mismatch emerges through vineyard imagery rather than thesis. Subtext resides in grafting, hail damage, and the burned fragment—no moralizing summary. Final star-streak image reconfigures the love story as fleeting brightness, offering resonant ambiguity. Complexity is honored; no tidy lesson imposed.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Leo’s reflective diction; rhythm mirrors seasonal slowing. No dialogue, so no voice convergence risk. Occasional elevated phrasing (“passionate subtlety”) nicks authenticity but remains internally consistent. Tense, psychic distance, and metaphor register hold steady.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is clean, read-aloud fluent, with high information density. A few soft abstract nouns (“intersubjective understanding”) drift toward therapy-register. No loops, mixed metaphors, or scaffold. Occasional template cadence in reflective sentences but never in the closure beat. Approaches 8+ but diction slip keeps it sub-8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Vineyard-as-relationship metaphor is familiar, yet execution is specific to grafting, hail, sun-versus-shadow stocks, giving it fresh bite. Burned letter edge repurposes a trope into an empathy catalyst. Risk level modest—no structural experiment—but particulars feel individual, not cribbed. Could travel further from中心意象 to be truly startling.</comment>
