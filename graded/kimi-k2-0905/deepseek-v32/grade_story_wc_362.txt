<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid—her shift from cataloguing discrete emotions to accepting their riverine fusion is embodied in her tightened grip on the prism and the melting frost. The “firmly grounded” refrain risks label-speak, but her final, transformed conviction earns the cost. No contradictory impulses are shown in-scene; the change is more observed than enacted, capping the score below 8.0.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the prism’s rainbow collapse reweights her rule-set—emotions are real yet interpretation is co-created. Causal chain holds: failed sunlight method → frost workaround → prism refraction → merged vision. The drive lens (Accumulative/Textural) is taught by pattern and held to the end. Cost is legible in the melting frost that erases the very proof she sought.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Quartz arbor, mist, and frost patterns are rendered with selective sensory economy; the micro-setting of the car-window frost constrains her method and charges the final image. Spatial choreography remains clean across the single location. The setting never evolves causally (frost melts but doesn’t alter next action), keeping the score just under 8.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prove objects absorb emotions—is signaled early and tightened when the frost patterns force a methodological pivot. The sunbeam’s accidental intervention complicates rather than resolves, deepening pressure under the Textural lens. Visible cost: the melt erases her data, foreclosing verification. Escalation is single but meaningful; no further reversal keeps it below 8.0.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: the union of matter and mind in meaning-making. The frost-prism image reconfigures prior material without moralizing. “Truthful lies” motif stays implicit, charged in the final melt. Ambiguity is purposeful and tied to Elara’s transformed stance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person lyric voice maintains stable distance and perceptual signature—Elara’s mystic precision surfaces in “listened to the silence between heartbeats.” Syntax modulates with pressure: short clauses during revelation, longer rhythmic loops during reflection. No dialogue to test; no head-hopping. Register stays within her plausible lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and propulsive; no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is sparse and purposeful—“river of emotions” is earned. High information density: each sentence advances atmosphere or knowledge. A single mixed risk—“the truthful lies of her work became clear”—reads slightly abstract but does not dull closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Frost-on-car-window as emotional medium feels fresh and specific to this voice. The premise of mineral emotion-storage is familiar but transformed through the prism-frost refraction protocol. Risk is present but modest; the final redefinition of proof versus interpretation provides the non-obvious inflection. Slight proximity to “crystal memory” tropes keeps it under 8.0.</comment>
