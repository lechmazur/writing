<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Kael’s motive is stated early and stays consistent, but interiority is filtered through generic “conspiracy debunker” tags rather than idiosyncratic thought. The only micro-choice—placing the diamond under the brief sun-break—reads as pre-ordained, not wrestled with; no contradictory impulse is dramatized. Earned cost is asserted (“truth would be slow”) rather than embodied in the moment. Fits functional single-POV scope, yet lacks the embodied contradiction needed for 8+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: fragments → map → diamond beam → hatch → archive, each step triggered by on-page action. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—the liquidation lie is exposed, social cost felt—satisfying Q2’s cost test. Orientation is clear by word 60; no penalty. Escalation is linear, not tightening; only one meaningful turn. Satisfies short-form scope, one shard, single POV; lens stays Causal, no contradiction at end.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Radioactive orchard is vivid, selective, and woven through action—glowing fruit, dust crunch, mineral grit on diamond. Micro-setting (diamond flaws vs soil crystals) constrains the final placement choice, meeting 9+ gate. Spatial anchors hold; hatch location is tracked. Sensory economy favors visual/geological cues that mirror Kael’s observant lens; no exposition dump.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“excavate truth”—is signaled early and presses every beat. Pressure escalates once: shredded fragments → beam → hatch, narrowing options. Cost is conceptual (exposure of regime lie) but not viscerally felt by Kael on the page; no resource lost, no personal risk dramatized. Sufficient for 600-word scale, yet lacks tangible price to enter 8-band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Theme—truth vs comfortable lie—emerges through recovered documents, not authorial lecture. Final image of Kael re-entering storms with “enlightened” diamond reweights the curse motif, offering resonant ambiguity. No moralizing sentence closes the piece. Could deepen if Kael’s own complicity or self-deception were interrogated; as is, reads as one-note heroism.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited keeps consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature—“sharply observant”—shows in leaf-decay notice and symmetry spotting. Syntax is steady, not drumbeat; no filter-verb clusters. No dialogue to test voice distinction. Register stays within wasteland idiom; diamond “trapped stars” is lone poetic reach, justified by POV wonder.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length; strong verbs (“crunch,” “refracted,” “raced”) propel. One scaffold loop: “the comfortable lie” is repeated thrice without new charge. No mixed metaphors; geological light-beam reads clear. Information density is high; each paragraph advances plot or atmosphere. Closure line unobstructed.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Post-apocalyptic orchard & document archive are familiar tropes, but coupling diamond inclusions to soil minerals gives fresh geological key beat. Premise remains standard “lone truth-seeker vs regime”; no character-specific twist beyond occupational label. Risk level moderate; execution competent but not transformative. Sufficient spark for 7-band, shy of 8+ memorability.</comment>
