<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Kael’s “orderly intuitive” label is declared but never dramatized in conflicting micro-choices; the stone chip is handled several times yet never once alters a decision or risks anything. His big speech re-states stakes already narrated, so the interior contradiction is summarized rather than enacted. The ending “brittle optimism” is asserted, not embodied, so the cost feels assumed rather than felt.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Causal spine holds: graffiti summons → clandestine meet → tactical plan → eve-of-sale vigil. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the raft will be sold but the carnival’s “net of shared intention” is now visible, cost legible in the reflected corporate lights. One transition (mural→barge) is clean; orientation anchored by word 80. No reversal or tightening inside the scene weakens escalation, keeping it short of 8-band.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Sensory triage is sharp: salt wind, frying dough, lantern-sway in hold—all filtered through Kael’s cataloguing bent. The perpetual carnival is sketched more than tested; no deck layout or physical constraint ever limits the plan. Still, the raft’s slow drift and mirrored corporate lights provide a micro-setting that charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate for this length.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“embed culture into the buyout terms”—is clear early, but pressure plateaus after the meeting; no new obstacle or trade-off complicates the scheme. The graffiti network is declared effective rather than challenged, so escalation is flat. Closure offers Charged Poise, yet the cost is prospective; nothing is forfeited on the page, capping intensity.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme of cultural endurance under capital encroachment emerges through the graffiti archive and communal artifact rather than authorial thesis. Final image of the net beneath the decks reweights earlier chaos as intentional fabric—an earned, non-literal answer. A slight nod toward sentimental uplift (“perhaps…the carnival could remain afloat”) blunts ambiguity, holding it below 8.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Third-limited stays tight to Kael; perceptual signature—“orderly intuitive mind cataloging”—threads diction and metaphor. No dialogue to test voice distinction, but narration carries salt-soaked specificity. Two near-clichés (“heart a drum of dual beats,” “tide that washes away”) momentarily flatten texture, preventing 8+.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and openers; information density high—e.g., “graffiti bloomed with new complexity” compresses days of action. One paraphrase loop (“carnival’s music seemed louder, more frantic, as if sensing its own impending silence”) and one mixed metaphor (“desperate hope that was now their collective sail”) slightly bruise the finish, but clarity stays intact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Raft-city carnival facing gentrification is fresh, yet plot beats (clandestine meeting, inspirational token, encoded flyers) follow a standard resistance template. The graffiti-as-data-system and the stone chip as passed totem supply specific inflections that keep it from feeling generic. No conceptual or structural risk pushes it into the 9-band.</comment>
