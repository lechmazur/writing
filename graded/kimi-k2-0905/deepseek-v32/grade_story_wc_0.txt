<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Aris’s need to “strip needless drama” is concrete and threaded through every beat; the micro-shift from clinical detachment to humbled witness is embodied in her hand on the rotting wood and the decision to cap the slide. Interiority stays specific to her neutron-star lexicon, avoiding therapy-speak. The cost—loss of protective detachment—is legible, but the change is more declared than dramatized in a single decisive action, keeping it short of the 8+ band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the final image of “preprocessing into something new” reweights the premise with conceptual cost under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality is internal but coherent—each dust observation accrues until the spectrum burst reframes meaning. Orientation is clean within 120 words. A firmer external constraint or forfeiture would nudge it into the 9+ tier.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Broken glass, damp wood, and butterfly-scale dust are tactile and POV-filtered; the greenhouse’s decay directly constrains her method and finally offers the spectrum she can’t model. Spatial anchors hold; the microscope and slide function as micro-setting that charges the final image. Slight over-description of “mold-streaked wall” and “twisted frames” slows propulsion a hair, capping it at 8.0.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—mastery through measurement—tightens when beauty erupts unmodeled, forcing a stance shift. No external antagonist, but internal pressure escalates via humidity-logged dust and the spectral flare that reframes her goal. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral; a tangible forfeiture (smashing the slide, abandoning the logbook) would sharpen the 8+ edge.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges quietly: entropy’s patient dance produces both loss and luminous rearrangement. The butterfly-dust reprise from data to teacher charges the closure without moralizing. Subtext resides in the spectrum’s refusal to be quantified, inviting reader reflection. One near-late “humble drama” phrase almost states the thesis but is saved by its placement mid-paragraph.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Aris’s perceptual lens—neutron-star metaphors, particulate sight-lines, clinical diction. Rhythm modulates from cool, clipped observations to longer, breath-held sentences during the color burst. No dialogue to test, yet interior syntax stays character-specific. Filter verbs (“she noticed,” “she looked”) appear but serve her observational mode, not distancing.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; metaphor density is high but patterned (cosmic↔microscopic) and pays off in the spectrum image. A few soft repeats (“dust,” “decay”) and one mixed metaphor—“mountain range of fractured scales”—muddle clarity. Elsewhere, information density is strong; no scaffold or loops obstruct the final line.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Fusing astrophysicist cognition with greenhouse restoration feels fresh; the accretion-disk pollen rings and spectral flare refract familiar post-disaster tropes through an uncommon lens. The stakes remain intimate, resisting cosmic inflation. Risk is moderate—quiet lyricism over plot pyrotechnics—but the synthesis is specific and memorable.</comment>
