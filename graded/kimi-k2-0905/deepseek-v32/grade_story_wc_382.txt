<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Alex’s desire to “learn the language of old buildings” is dramatized through micro-choices—borrowing sugar, climbing to the roof, pocketing the seal—so the want drives visible action. Mrs. Elara’s motivations remain off-page; her decision to teach is asserted rather than embodied, so the relationship lacks crucible pressure. The final “earned stasis” moment lands because Alex’s silence and the seal’s weight show cost, but the tutor’s stake stays abstract.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the rooftop silence and the groaning building re-weight the premise—translation is futile, attention is the language. Causal chain holds: sugar → tea → seal → rooftop interrogation → silence. The meteor shower acts as accumulative intensifier, not coincidence. Orientation is clean; who/where/when anchored by 80 words. Cost is felt: Alex pockets the “key to nothing” and forecloses literal answers.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The rooftop garden, parapet, and meteor shower are rendered through Alex’s tuner-ear bias—“the building… release a long, contented groan”—so environment constrains his final stance. The brass seal functions as micro-setting, handled in three beats and charged in the final image. Selective sensory layering (jasmine, cold brass, sky-crease of meteors) supports the mysterious-familiar tone without tourist catalog. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible positions.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“decode the buildings’ language”—tightens when Alex realizes the code is silence itself; this deepening narrows his options from verbal translation to embodied listening. Escalation is accumulative: weekly tea, sealed notes, rooftop skywatch each layer density rather than causal reversals. Cost is conceptual but legible: he abandons the quest for literal meaning and accepts perpetual ambiguity. Mrs. Elara’s mysterious stakes remain off-page, blunting full pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges without thesis statement: knowledge as attention, not translation. Subtext lives in gesture—her “patiently nimble” hands, the seal’s cold weight—never explained. The meteor shower re-prices prior “lies” as doors; ambiguity is the payoff, not a problem. Final image of silent rooftop and groaning masonry offers non-literal answer: listening is the language.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tightly anchored to Alex’s sensory funnel; no head-hop. Voice carries perceptual signature—buildings “groan,” meteors “race,” seal “weighs”—syntax mirrors his tuning-fork attention. Dialogue is sparse but natural; Mrs. Elara’s diction is older, softer, distinct. Register stable; no corporate drift. Compress/elide pattern taught early (“agreed upon lies”) and paid off in final silence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies: long breath for rooftop sky, staccato for sugar-borrow beat. Information density high—“It authenticates promises between stones” does triple duty (world rule, theme, foreshadow). No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or knowledge. One mixed metaphor—“dialogues between time and material”—but物理 logic intact. Final line “key to nothing, and to everything” earns its cliché inversion via accrued weight.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Premise— buildings speak through silence—avoids haunted-house trope by grounding perception in mundane ritual (tea, seal). Fresh synthesis of linguistics + architecture via micro-gestures rather than info-dump. Risk taken: climax is renunciation of answer, yet causality holds. Could edge higher if Mrs. Elara’s stake felt as specific as Alex’s; slight symmetry keeps it from full 8.5+.</comment>
