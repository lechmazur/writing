<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Kael’s restless dock-grace and bone-deep yearning are embodied in every micro-choice; the whalebone hand-off to Elara crystallizes the cost of leaving. Interior contradictions (“This weight pays” vs the marrow-summons) play out in scene, not summary. The final shedding of clothes reads as earned renunciation once the leviathan’s eye re-prices his identity. Only mild safety-hedge: Elara’s fortress-heart opens a touch too easily off-page.</comment>

<comment>Causal lens holds: because the whale sings, therefore Kael’s tether snaps; because he hands Elara the “key,” therefore her guarded stance flips without dialogue. Orientation is anchored by line 6; no teleporting props. Closure is the decisive descent into the channel with concrete cost—he is naked, the island already fading. One hairline slip: the disappearance rule is named, not demonstrated, before the island solidifies.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Sublittoral fringe is never a postcard; crates, nets, black sand, and unfamiliar stars are filtered through Kael’s dock-tuned senses. The whalebone’s grooves reappear as tactile memory at the exact moment of hand-off, charging the final image. Spatial choreography across the swim is clean; no impossible geography. Environment constrains the final choice—only the channel the whale cuts exists; no alternate path is offered.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—freedom vs. dock-security—is signaled in the first argument. Escalation is the bone-vibration that forecloses lingering: stay ashore or follow. Cost is visible: he loses Elara, clothes, identity, and the island itself begins to erase behind him. One tightening beat suffices; no external antagonist needed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of self-belonging emerges through the whale’s call reweighting “grace” from dock to ocean. The scrimshaw leviathan returns as lived truth, not symbol tacked on. No final moral—just the image of his naked strokes into the channel. Ambiguity lingers: is home the whale or the self? Resonance lands without thesis sentence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Kael’s sinuous perception: “fluid contrast,” “marrow of his bones.” Rhythm accelerates into short, surf-like clauses during swim. No dialogue clutter; single whisper “It’s a key” carries subtext. Filter verbs minimal; perceptual signature distinct—he catalogs space via cargo, tides, then star-patterns.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Varied sentence openings, muscular verbs (“traced,” “surrender,” “shattered”) avoid scaffold. One paraphrase loop detected: “freedom the docks could never provide” / “restlessness...not a flaw but a compass” back-to-back—minor. No mixed metaphors; black sand, salt breath tactile. Final line cadence mirrors whale-song falloff—intentional echo.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: maritime myth meets gritty dock realism through whalebone heirloom. Leviathan-as-mirror beats tired “white whale” arc; island visibility rule feels discovered, not contrived. Risk taken with nude rebirth could slide into cliché, but tactile pool entry grounds it. Not 9+ because premise still recognizable as “call-to-sea” tale, albeit polished.</comment>
