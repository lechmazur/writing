<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid, embodied, and stakes-aligned; the fierce-tender contradiction lives in micro-choices like pressing the shard to her forehead. The apology-to-sister motive stays legible and escalates via the unsent letters. Yet the sister remains off-stage; the crucible is purely internal, so status/relationship pressure is inferred, not dramatized. Closure renunciation is earned, cost visible (“vowed to honor…daily”), but the beat is compressed into one declarative sentence—slightly under-played for 9+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of condensation messages + shard healing reweights the stake in a single cadence shift at moonrise. Orientation anchor (who/where) secured by line 4; no debt. Closure is Charged Poise: “Some apologies are lived, not spoken” reconfigures the premise with undeniable conceptual cost. One persistent constraint—the moon-dependent shard—shapes tactics and final image; cost is legible in the vow itself.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mangrove roots, brackish water, and moonlit shard form a tactile micro-setting that constrains movement and choice. Condensation-on-glass mechanic is economically taught and recurs to deliver exposition without halting propulsion. Final image of “clear and calm” water mirrors internal shift, charging closure. No spatial drift; every object is handled on-page.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will she speak the apology?—is signaled early and tightened once: when moonlight fuses the shard she must decide to speak or transform the apology into action. Agency drives the turn; spirits merely chorus confirmation. Cost is the renunciation of verbal absolution in favor of lifelong praxis—felt and visible. No coincidence; escalation is purely accumulative density approaching moonrise.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the concrete particular: unsent letters → lived amends. Final sentence reweights “apology” from speech to daily practice without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers—will living apology suffice?—inviting reflection. No thesis statement; chorus lines approach echo but stay diegetic.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person lyric maintains fierce-tender diction—”fierce tenderness” repeated but modulated under pressure. Syntax stretches slightly at moonrise then contracts into the renunciation beat, mirroring emotional arc. No head-hopping; perceptual signature stays medium-close to Elara. Filter verbs minimal; condensation messages act as external thought-text.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence detected. Figurative language is selective—moonlight “pierced,” roots “parting gracefully”—and never floods a high-pressure beat. One paraphrase loop: “fierce tenderness” used three times; minor scaffold. Otherwise dense, clean, propulsive; closure image unobstructed.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Synthesizes familiar tropes—ghost labyrinth, moon-healing artifact—into a fresh emotional engine: apology transformed into lifelong praxis. Shard’s moonlight rule and condensation messaging feel inevitable in hindsight, not bolted on. Risk taken in quiet, non-verbal closure lands cleanly. Could edge 9+ with slightly sharper sensory surprise.</comment>
