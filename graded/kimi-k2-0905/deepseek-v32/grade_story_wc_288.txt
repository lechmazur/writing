<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is specific—her fingers “tracing its cool, engraved surface” shows embodied memory. The arc from isolation to independence is legible because each remembered extinction lands as a visceral tremor (“images flashed… she had been a keeper of forests”). Final choice—“she would live her own life”—carries cost: the sundial fades, ghosts remain. One slip: “profound isolation” is labelled emotion rather than shown, but contradiction moments (“brittleness… made her tremble, but she held steady”) outweigh it.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the sundial’s final glow reweights memory so independence now means “carrying the past without being bound.” Causality holds: because she aligns the dial at dawn, therefore the stone hum rises and unlocks the archives—no off-stage cheats. Orientation is fixed within 120 words: “tidal library… floors shifting… above the clouds” gives who-where-when. Persistent constraint: every projection of extinct species forces her to steady her hand—cost is iterated, not just declared.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Micro-setting works: the sundial’s “atomically reflective face” doubles as mirror and key, constraining her ritual posture. Tidal floors tilt toward aperture—physical gradient that times her kneeling. Selective sensory hierarchy: she notes “first light of dawn” but filters out extraneous fauna, fitting a lone ex-botanist. Lost tenth: “brass sundial rested on a pedestal” risks white-room verb; more tactile placement could anchor space.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—translate isolation into independence—is signaled in paragraph 3 and tightened when holograms force her to “accept them without being consumed,” narrowing options to integration or collapse. Agency sits with her manual alignment; no coincidence resolves. One visible price: the hum stirs memories that “made her tremble,” a bodily tax paid on page. Could push higher if an external resource (time, tool durability) visibly depleted.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through image pattern—extinct species holograms migrate from loss to legacy without authorial tag. Final reconfiguration (“she would preserve the knowledge… live her own life”) offers non-literal answer: coexistence equals stewardship plus self-authorship. Subtext in gesture: her steadying hand while ghosts swirl implies endurance > erasure. Avoids sermonizing; only dip is line “coexistence meant acknowledging their presence,” which edges toward echo.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person hovers at a lyric distance that matches mythic tone; perceptual signature is botanist-precise—“atomically reflective,” “eastern aperture.” Syntax lengthens during hum crescendo, contracts at decision (“She smiled”), mirroring pulse. No head-hop; knowledge stays bounded to Elara. One register bump: “conceptual cost” phrase feels academic amid sensory flow.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies: caesura in “She watched them, feeling a deep sorrow but also a resolve.” Information dual-load: “tidal library, its floors shifting with the lunar pull” situates and personifies. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances memory, tool, or stance. Metaphor discipline: “brittle awakenings” recurs but gains substance via hologram fragility.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Reincarnation-as-extinction-archive is fresh synthesis; sundial-cum-data-crystal repurposes archaic tech as quantum drive. Risk in tidal library above clouds pays off by literalizing “memory tide.” Specificity anchors novelty: lunar-slatted floors and hum frequency are concrete. Could edge higher if extinct species carried one never-seen bio-detail that re-enters final image.</comment>
