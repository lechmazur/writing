<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Kael’s interiority is concrete—his “fingers worried a smooth reed whistle,” “heart a drum”—and every micro-choice (climbing the spire, blowing the sequence, choosing retreat) is rooted in the spiral-shell obsession. The quiet-engine motive never slips; even the final refusal to chase the watchers carries a felt cost: the gate stays rusted, the dread merely re-shaped. Interior contradiction is light (we don’t see him doubt the patterns), but the endurance itself becomes the character change. Easily clears the 9− gate: motive → choice → cost all on-page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds throughout: fracture → whistle test → turtle course-shift → box discovery → decision to turn away. Each beat is a because/therefore linkage; no off-stage shortcuts. Closure is Earned Stasis: the city forecloses the watcher quest forever, the price is the sealed gate and the lingering mirror-dread—both legible in the final paragraph. Orientation is secured by word 60 (“city drifted on the backs…”) and never loosens; no lens ambiguity at end.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The turtle-shell plaza functions as micro-setting: the hot bleached spire burns Kael’s palms, the widening fissure literally rewrites the map he stands on. Sun-Stepper’s living carapace constrains every action—he must scale it, read it, sound it. Even the “sunwashed dread” is atmospheric pressure that narrows perception to glare and silence. Final image of diminishing watchers recharges the same light-dread, now re-priced as respectful distance rather than annihilating gaze.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“question the silent watchers”—is signaled in the first third and tightened twice: the fracture invalidates old charts, the journal reveals the watchers’ madness, forcing the final reversal away from them. Agency is continuous: Kael’s whistle sequence is the literal pivot that alters the city’s drift. Cost is visible: the gate remains sealed, the dread persists, the expedition’s fate is accepted as unmendable. One meaningful escalation suffices; no causal gaps.</question>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</question><comment>Theme emerges as “the only answers are the maps we carry”—no character moralizes it. The watchers act as mirror-metaphor, but the insight is earned through Kael’s tactile reading of shell, fracture, whistle, journal. Final reconfiguration—turning the turtles away—re-weights the spiral from quest-symbol to self-contained cosmos. Ambiguity lingers: is retreat wisdom or avoidance? Resonance is concrete, not asserted.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Kael’s perceptual filter: growth lines, harmonic intervals, “sunwashed dread” color every clause. Syntax is controlled—long accumulating sentences for drift, staccato lifts for the whistle beat. No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens under pressure (spire climb). Register remains within the cartographer’s lexicon; no corporate drift. Reed whistle’s “thin” note is a perfect sonic touch that reprises at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.1</comment>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances map, shell, or whistle. Figurative language is spare and precise: “sunwashed dread,” “quiet engine burning without flame”—no mixed metaphors. Information density is high: one line can layer stellar alignment, shell fracture, and emotional jolt. Rhythm adapts—looped “spiral” and “pattern” become incantatory without monotony, charging the final quiet turn.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</comment>
<comment>City-turtles as migratory islands, cartographer who maps living shells, whistle that steers by harmonic resonance—synthesis feels inevitable, not gimmicky. Lost-expedition trope is inverted: the horror is silence, not monsters; solution is retreat, not conquest. Conceptual risk—retreat as victory—lands cleanly because the shell-pattern logic is seeded early. Specificity throughout (growth lines, oilcloth journal) prevents generic drift. A fresh inflection that lingers.</comment>
