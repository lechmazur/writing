<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Oren’s quiet, paradoxical power and his gentle, stone-lifting hands are shown, not told; the interior contradiction (guardian duty vs. distaste for violence) drives the decisive act of inscription. The single on-page choice—planting the rune—carries visible cost: the ink and mist dissolve, implying irretrievable expenditure of his curated calm. Only the clerk’s sudden tearful collapse feels slightly summary, muting the relational crucible pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the pretender’s illusion unravels in real time, Oren’s stance reconfigures from reactive to sovereignly still, and the library’s sigh marks conceptual cost—“truth needs no monument.” Causal chain is taut: altered glyph → Oren’s ink → hinge-moment insertion → spoken rune → dissolution. No props teleport; the mist-parchment vanishing is the earned price. Lens (Causal) is unambiguous at exit.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The library is evoked through olfactory vellum, dust motes in centuries-old light, and tactile stone tablets too heavy for scholars—details that double as power gauge for Oren. The “collected starlight” basin and mist-parchment weaponize setting into plot gear, constraining how the rune must be written. Spatial choreography holds as Oren slides from shadow to shelf and back. One minor slip: “labyrinthine passages” is a touch generic amid otherwise razor-sharp specificity.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—protect the True Name—ignites on first altered glyph and tightens when Oren decides to answer with the rune of drift; the hinge of constellations provides a live clock that forces the insertion beat. Cost is palpable: the ink’s acidic tang and the final smoke exhale signal irreversible expenditure of Oren’s curated quiet. Escalation is single-track but sufficient; no fake reversals. The clerk’s off-stage ambition is the weak pressure node, never directly endangering Oren.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of quiet permanence vs. loud usurpation emerges through image alone—dust, starlight, dissolving ink—without sermon. The rune of drift reweights the idea of authority: legitimacy is not seized but gently released into air. Final image of the drifting smoke re-prices the premise that power must leave a monument. No thematic echo lines; the library’s sigh does the talking.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>third-person limited clings to Oren’s sensorium: child-sized hands, scent of gall ink, perception of “slow dance of dust.” Syntax lengthens during contemplation, then fragments slightly at hinge-moment—“He waited… He placed… He retreated”—mirroring held breath. No head-hop; clerk’s collapse is seen strictly from Oren’s vantage. Register stays archaic-minimal, never slips into modern gloss. Distinctive, compressive lyricism taught by line 3 and paid off in final smoke.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet breathable: “iron gall ink pellet, a dense sphere of potent black” packs tactile and chemical data in one breath. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or tactic. Metaphors (majesty “drifting apart like ash”) stay coherent and physically matched to library air. Only nit: “regally unpretentious grace” is reused verbatim; would benefit from variant cadence on reprise.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fusion of dwarf titan and star-named monarchy feels myth-fresh; rune that unbinds instead of binds flips standard sigil trope. Specificity of iron-gall chemistry and starlight collection grounds fantasy in materiality. Conceptual risk—conflict resolved by dissolving illusion rather than duel—pays off in thematic resonance. Could edge higher if clerk’s provincial backstory carried one concrete, unexpected detail.</comment>
