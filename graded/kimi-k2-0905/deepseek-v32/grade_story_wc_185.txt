<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Kael’s motivation—“find the quiet”—is vivid and embodied; his tactile reading of ice fractures and the bone-ache of the stone give interiority weight. The final renunciation (amplifying stillness instead of fighting noise) is earned by the-map-as-body logic. No contradictory impulse is dramatized mid-scene, so the 9+ test fails, but the arc is coherent and personal.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: fracture patterns → cave entrance → ceiling bloom blueprint layers density until the single sigh-conjuration reweights the stake. Closure—settled lichen-light and Kael sliding down—pays the cost of bodily exhaustion and permanent cave alteration. Orientation is anchored by word 65; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Ice-light, obsidian disc, and converging cracks are handled, not catalogued; their evolving glow guides Kael’s micro-choices. The Harmonic Caves function as both shelter and resonator, constraining the conjuration mechanics. Final image of lichen-like beings fused to walls re-uses the “gently luminous” attribute to charge closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“quiet in the storm”—is signaled early and tightens when the beings shatter the cave’s hush; Kael’s pivot to amplifying internal silence forecloses escape option. Cost is legible in bodily exhaustion and the irreversible silencing of the world. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of silence as active force emerges through fracture-reading and the final bloom, never stated. The lichen-image reweights earlier chaos into coexistence, offering conceptual repricing without moral. Ambiguity lingers: world healing starts here, but Kael’s personal cost is fatigue, not triumph.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains consistent perceptual filter—cracks “sang,” stone “made bones ache.” Syntax compresses under stress (“The storm was gone.”). No dialogue to test voice distinction; lyric diction stays within mapkeeper’s plausible lexicon. Rhythm modulates from measured observation to exhausted single-line coda.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence or synonym loops detected. Information density high—“kernel was the bloom of hush” packs world-rule, metaphor, and stake in five words. Figurative language is sparse and patterned (“hammered repose,” “flower of absolute quiet”), avoiding density penalty. Closure line is clean, no scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>“Silence as conjured ecology” feels fresh; ripple-mark literacy and ice-fracture cartography supply specific vocational lens. Energy beings subdued into lichen reverses typical victory-through-violence tropes. Conceptual risk (quiet as weapon) is fully committed to and pays off in the final image.</comment>
