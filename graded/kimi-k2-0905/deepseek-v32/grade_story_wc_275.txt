<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s pacifist ethic is embodied in every micro-gesture—sheathing the grafting knife, pressing the canvas into soil—so motive stays legible. The father visit supplies external pressure, but because he exits quickly, relationship-as-crucible never fully ignites; the interior contradiction (growth vs. looming violence) is vivid yet static after midpoint. Closure cost is present yet diffuse: the tremor is external, her refusal reactive; a sharper personal forfeiture would push this to 9+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each repetition of “engraved quiet” and tactile garden act thickens the stake of continuity. Closure is a Charged Poise—sheathing the blade under tremor reconfigures pacifism from creed to lived risk; cost is felt in the instant of choosing stillness while the world shakes. Orientation is clean by word 60; no causal break; one reflective block stays under 20 % and feeds present action. Meets 9+ test: persistent constraint (dome, pacifist vow) shapes final tactic.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Glass dome, canvas scrap, grafting knife, and rose hybrids are handled, not catalogued; each constrains choice (knife used only for life, canvas repurposed as root anchor). Sensory hierarchy mirrors Elara’s priorities—thirst in bones, dust vs. bloom scent—so environment is filtered through vocation. Final image of canvas buried while petals “hold the light” recharges earlier flight/weight metaphor, satisfying 9+ gate. Spatial choreography is tight; no floating props.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve continuity against collapse—is signaled in paragraph 1 and tightens when tremor intrudes; pacifist code forbids violent response, so option space narrows to endurance. No reversal, but deepening: canvas insertion and ritual sheathing escalate personal cost from symbolic to physical endangerment. Escalation is textural, not causal, fitting the lens; price (risk of shattered dome) is legible. Slight reserve: external tremor is author-supplied, not protagonist-triggered.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of continuity-through-care emerges via recurring tactile acts rather than thesis statements; only one soft echo (“weaving it into something that lasts”) but it is spoken in-scene and earned. Subtext in father’s seed gift implies possible generational shift without spelling it out. Final image reframes tranquil blaze as quiet defiance, offering resonant non-literal answer. Avoids moralizing; complexity (pacifism’s fragility) remains intact.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Elara’s perceptual signature—soundless shifts in atmosphere felt in bones, color of dawn held in petals. Syntax lengthens during calm, compresses at tremor, mirroring breath. No dialogue, so voice distinction clause is N/A. One lyrical pattern (“engraved quiet”) is taught early and repaid at close; no filter-verb clutter. Meets 9+ bar: rhythmic control heightens pressure without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet aerated: “she whispered stories of resilience to the seeds” fuses action, metaphor, and theme in one stroke. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or stakes. Mixed metaphors avoided—canvas/weight/flight stays coherent. One hairline slip: “tranquil blaze” is repeated; intentional motif but marginally close to over-patterning, keeping this just under 9.0.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Pacifist botanist daughter of bounty hunter is fresh angle; using grafting knife only for life reframes weapon trope. Airship-ballast-canvas turned soil-anchor is specific repurposing that feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk—quiet lyric instead of action climax—pays off via Charged Poise. Could edge higher if world rule (tower fall aftermath) showed unique physics or social ripple beyond dome.</comment>
