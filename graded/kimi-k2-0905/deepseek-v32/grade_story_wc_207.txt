<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s “sensibly eccentric” tag stays ornamental; no contradictory impulse is dramatized until she wades into paradox-water, and even then the choice is presented as inevitable rather than wrestled-with. Interiority leans on labels (“profound peace”) instead of embodied contradiction. The micro-choice to fill the final vial carries cost, but the emotional stakes feel pre-cooked rather than earned in-scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the lagoon’s anti-gravity drip reweights her premise, compass lightens to signal story now hers—visible conceptual cost under Accumulative lens. Causality is thin getting there—compass warmth and psychometry are author-given rather than fought for—but the final image crystallizes options without cheating. Orientation anchors by ~120 w; single transition (surface→cavern) is legible. One loop: “resonant hush” repeated without intensifier.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Limestone fissure, black mirror lagoon, and rising droplets are tactile, selective, and mirrored in her inverted worldview. Sensory triad (scent/touch/sight) is filtered through petrichor bias. Spatial choreography holds; no floating bodies. Environment actively constrains the final float—water physics force renunciation of explanation—meeting 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“where explanations fail”—is signaled early and tested once in the impossible hydrology, a meaningful tightening under Accumulative lens. No secondary pressure or tangible price (cold alone doesn’t alter tactics). Agency is mostly receptive: she records, floats, accepts; the lagoon does the overturning. Still, the single deepening reweights her collector identity, foreclosing rationalist path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges quietly: knowledge collected vs. knowledge surrendered. Final vial of “a place beyond words” is a concrete thematic reprise, not an abstract assertion. No moralizing; ambiguity survives. The inversion of rain-from-stone lends conceptual repricing that lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited maintains steady psychic distance; perceptual signature skewed to olfactory obsession—“petrichor so profound it felt ancient.” Syntax modulates with pressure: longer clauses above ground, clipped fragments inside cavern. No dialogue to test. Filter verbs are sparse and scent-driven, not explanatory. Voice stays character-bound without register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is lyrical yet propulsive; sentences carry dual duty (action + atmosphere). No loops or synonym churn. Mixed metaphors avoided—“inverted cathedrals” is singular and earned. Final paragraph resists tidy summation, letting image do work. One scalpel trim could excise the echoed “resonant hush,” else clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Fusion of petrichor hobby with underground anti-gravity lagoon feels non-obvious and specific; premise would collapse if scent motif removed. Psychometry-as-door to prior expedition is familiar but reanimated by olfactory linkage. Risk taken in quiet, accumulative structure rather than twist. Ending image reframes earlier factory silence as cosmic hush—inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
