<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Aris’s quiet, stubborn stone of motivation stays credible; embodied emotion (the cork warmed by palm, climbing with “screaming tenderness”) gives specific interiority. The internal contradiction—yearning to save yet refusing the loud signal—remains present in scene, not summary. The Keeper does supply late relationship pressure, but micro-choices (naming the whisper, handing over authority of gaze) cost Aris visibility inside the hierarchy; the price is legible but modest. Voice stays individual, but no flaw compounds; closure choice is motivated and earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the cobalt glow fades into sunrise while the smack glides safe, reconfiguring the lighthouse’s authority from glare to whisper with conceptual cost for the Keeper’s old rule-set. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; the scent pattern intensifies until the final image reweights meaning. Orientation is clean by line 6; no ambiguity at end. Persistent constraint—the lamp’s hum now gentled—shapes future signals and Keeper tactics. A hairline slip: the captain’s jasmine memory is convenient, yet it complicates, not resolves, so allowed under lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The cobalt tower, iron railing, and cork serve as micro-setting that directly constrains action: Aris must climb, place, and channel through these exact props. Sensory selection stays urgent—heat-slick skin, salt air, night-blooming phlox—mirroring internal need without overt symbolism. Spatial choreography is invisible yet flawless; bodies and distances track. The lighthouse lens recurs and charges the final image, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prove a whisper can save—signals early and tightens when the lamp’s hum shifts from mechanical grind to heartbeat, narrowing options to gentleness or failure. Escalation is textural: scent density increases until it reweights the moral cost of “shout versus whisper.” Protagonist agency drives every beat: climbing, recalling, placing cork, willing the vibration. Price is visible—Aris ends exhausted, the Keeper’s authority silently overturned—meeting 8+ demand.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: silent intent outperforms brute warning; no character states this axiom. Jasmine/cork reprises at end, recharging earlier memory with new authority instead of tacked-on symbol. Subtext flourishes in gestures—the Keeper’s slow nod carries dawning abdication of the shout ethos. Emotional after-effect is concrete: reader left tasting salt and phantom jasmine, feeling the hush that saved.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person hovers at a lyric distance that matches mythic tone; perceptual signature leans into synesthetic scent and color. Syntax flexes—long breathless clauses for ascent, short pulses for lamp beats—without monotony. No dialogue, so voice purity remains. Filter verbs are minimal; only two instances (“seemed to shimmer”) serve character uncertainty, justified.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>High information density: each sentence layers scent, color, and motion without scaffold. Mixed metaphors are controlled—cobalt bleeding into walls, vibration as heartbeat—coherent under lyric pattern. No loops or synonym churn; paragraph cuts are lean. Opening and closing lines anchor and recharge motif cleanly. A lone participle opener (“leaving the world gasping”) is sequential, not simultaneous—no penalty.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The scent-as-signal premise is fresh yet inevitable in hindsight; trope of lighthouse beam is inverted not discarded. Risk of gentleness over spectacle heightens meaning without gimmick. Specificity—jasmine under heavy moon, phlox, soil aroma—grounds abstraction in sensory truth. Conceptual integrity holds: world commits to vibrational metaphysics throughout.</comment>
