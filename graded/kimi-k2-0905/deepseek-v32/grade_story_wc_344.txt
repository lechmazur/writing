<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Arin’s want—“to learn the rhythm of repair”—is stated early and re-animated by each tactile micro-choice (selecting gears, uncapping the mainspring). Interiority stays concrete, keyed to lunar-eclipse locksmith lore; contradictions are present but soft (“driftwood nostalgia for things he had never known”). The final renunciation—repair as balance, not restoration—pays off prior causality and carries felt cost in the thawing library, satisfying the 9+ quick test. One-note emotional calibration in the mirror hall keeps it under 8.8.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the uncapping redefines repair from recovery to acceptance, shown in the unified mirror image and immediate environmental thaw—cost is legible on the page. Causal linkage holds: scrap prophecy → gear chest → mirror hall → uncap; no teleporting props. Orientation is anchored by word 50; the single transition (tapestry door) is clean. One tightening only, but it meaningfully forecloses the “restore the past” option, meeting the 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Library above clouds functions as pressure cooker: thin air, frost-rimed pages, and the warming mirror hall constrain pace and body. Gear assortment and eclipse-lock serve as micro-settings that gate progress. Sensory selection favors paper, frost, and brass, filtered through Arin’s lock-tuning expertise. The final thaw is an environmental mirror of internal reweighting, satisfying the 9+ constraint test.</question>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“learn the rhythm of repair”—is signaled in para 1 and deepened when the mirrors show loss/repair juxtapositions. Escalation is accumulative: each shard (prophecy, gears, eclipse lock, uncap) adds density until the mainspring release reweights the stake from “fix the past” to “balance the now.” Protagonist agency drives every beat; coincidence is absent. Cost is conceptual but undeniable in the unified reflection; a second, more visceral price would push it higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges implicitly through the repair motif shifting from mechanical restoration to temporal acceptance; no final moralizing. The unified mirror image offers a non-literal answer that reweights earlier fragments without sentimentality. Driftwood nostalgia motif threads from opening to closing, charged anew by the thaw. Complexity is honored—no forced symmetry between loss and gain.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person POV stays tightly latched to Arin’s perceptual filter: lunar-eclipse rhythm, lock-picking kinesthetics, scent of old paper. Syntax lengthens during contemplative beats, then compresses for the uncap—“He took a deep breath and uncapped the vessel”—mirroring tension release. No head-hop; diction remains within his artisanal lexicon. A hairline slip into abstract “truth” statement costs the final 0.1.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, and image-dense; no paraphrase loops or scaffold. Figurative layers (ghosts of breath, driftwood nostalgia) are selective, never clotted. Sentence variety supports the accumulative cadence; opening and closing lines bracket the arc with sonic recurrence. One strained mirror-stack metaphor (“mirrors stretching into infinity”) is the single hairline flaw.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Lunar-eclipse locksmith merged with clockwork-time-mending is a fresh synthesis; prophecy scraps and ice-bound library feel specific to this tale rather than stock fantasy. The repair-as-balance reweighting is non-obvious and inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking is moderate—lyric accumulative structure—but no formal gambit threatens clarity. Could edge higher with a sharper cultural or technological inflection unique to this world.</comment>
