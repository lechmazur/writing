<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation is legible and consistent—she wants to decode why thresholds feel sacred—but the interiority stays abstract (“featherly determination” is repeated, never embodied). She traces wood grain and decodes weather, yet these acts never cost her anything or force an irreversible choice; the logbook does the work. No live contradiction or micro-choice undercuts her stance, so the “earned” closure feels inherited, not fought for.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The lens is Accumulative/Textural: each new wood-grain or code fragment layers pattern until the final convergence image reweights meaning. Closure is a Charged Poise (the shimmered threshold) with conceptual cost—she can now “hear” the world’s fractured music—but the causality is retrospective, not tactical. Orientation is met by line 3; no teleporting props, yet escalation is flat because every beat succeeds on first try. One soft reset: the terrace “stabilized” without her having to sacrifice distance or code.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Prism light, corn-stalk doorway, and wood-grain micro-setting are vivid, selective, and filtered through Elara’s search. The terrace’s shifting surfaces constrain her footwork—she must “maintain precise gaps”—so environment actively shapes tactics. Final chair-grain image recharges earlier mapping motif, giving the 9+ gate. Weather codes stay off-page abstractions; no sensory anchor for humidity or pressure, a minor missed opportunity.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.7</grade>
<comment>Stake—“discover why thresholds feel sacred”—is declared early but never materially tested; no consequence for mis-stepping a distance. Pressure is static: each new code or grain line immediately confirms her path, so the maze feels permissive, not perilous. No option is foreclosed, no price paid; the “storm” never arrives. Escalation is decorative pattern accumulation, not risk amplification.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges obliquely: sacredness = precise spatial/emotional distances made visible by chaos. The refrain of “necessary distances” accretes meaning without sermonizing. Final image of harmony restored is earned through prior grain/code parallels. Some abstraction drifts toward pseudo-profundity (“the music of the fractured hush”), blunting resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyrical voice sustains a hushed, prism-fragment rhythm that matches the fractured hush tone. Syntax is controlled, with purposeful repetition (“fractured hush,” “featherly determination”) creating chant-like cadence. No dialogue, so no voice contamination. Psychic distance stays steady; occasional elevated diction (“convergence and peace”) is justified by mythic register taught early.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm modulates effectively; no template cadence or synonym loops. High information density—each sentence advances image or pattern. Metaphors stay coherent within light/wood/weather lexicon. One paraphrase loop: “the maze had become a labyrinth of necessary distances” restates the premise; minor −0.2, not enough to touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>The butterfly-effected corn-maze that runs on weather-code feng-shui is fresh, yet the sacred-geometry reveal has archetypal echoes (Initiation Maze). Wood-grain cartography and prism-terrace locomotion supply memorable specificity. Risk is moderate—lyric accumulation over plot—but coherence holds. Transformation is present: chaos reveals hidden architecture; could not swap names without losing grain/code mechanics.</comment>
