<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elara’s translating-silence motive stays active and specific; every camera-click and signed note is a micro-choice that costs her solitude. The contradiction between her need to be remembered and her art’s demand for invisibility is embodied, not declared. Leo’s reception of the “score” provides credible external evidence of her charisma without speech. Only the final “quietly charismatic” tag feels slightly external; internal evidence already made it legible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Leo’s perception is re-tuned and Elara’s isolation is re-priced when he “remembers” under the moon. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—each framed silence adds density until the pattern ruptures into felt music. Causality is internal but coherent: because she maps quiet, therefore he hears; because he hears, the harbor’s silence sings with new cost. One soft spot: the line “her action to disrupt his noise was complete” editorializes the moment the image should own.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Harbor moonlight is not backdrop but metronome: the path of reflection dictates where she “places” each rest or note. Camera, pier planks, and lantern spacing are returned to twice, becoming the percussion section of her score. Spatial choreography is flawless—reader always knows where bodies, boat, and light sit. The re-use of “liquid silver” edges toward decorative loop, slightly dulling specificity at the close.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“will anyone receive her silent music?”—tightens once: Leo arrives, listens, and is altered, proving the art can reach another. Cost is understated but legible: her solitude deepens as his inner noise quiets, a zero-sum exchange. No external antagonist is needed; pressure is the risk of perpetual non-reception. Escalation is single-note yet sufficient for 700-word span.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme—silence as plenitude, memory as counter-music—emerges solely through image and gesture; no character lectures us. The reweighting of “when no one remembers you” from wound to workspace gives the concept bite. Joyful sorrow stays credibly twinned; the moment Leo hears is simultaneously her rescue and reaffirmation of loneliness. Avoids sermon even in the penultimate paragraph’s risk of summary.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person lyric remains tightly filtered through Elara’s perceptual bias: every visual becomes acoustic. Syntax lengthens and contracts like breath—long pools of description snap into single-word signs. No head-hop; Leo’s interior shift is rendered only through externally visible relief. One cadence hiccup: the triple “her action…was complete / achieved by mapping… / The harbor gleamed” stacks participles and slightly flattens the sonic drop-off intended.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is generally lean and double-jobbing; most sentences move image + music + emotional state. No synonym loops or scaffold. Mixed metaphors are rare but present: “basin of liquid silver” followed immediately by “deep” risks spatial confusion—silver is surface, not depth. Final paragraph contains three consecutive sentences beginning “The harbor…/ Leo…/ Elara…”—minor but noticeable drumbeat right at the resonance beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The “mute composer with empty camera” hook is fresh, yet the piece keeps it grounded in tactile procedure rather than trick. Risk lies in the lyric stillness itself—story dares to climax on a shared hush, trusting reader to feel the chord. Conceptual reprice feels inevitable in hindsight: of course silence is already music if you pay with solitude. Could edge higher with one more specific sensory inversion not yet common in quiet-harbor tropes.</comment>
