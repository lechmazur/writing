<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is concrete—her “suddenly timeless” disorientation is embodied in the cold obsidian cutting her palm. The micro-choice to slide the shard into the console is the single visible beat where motive turns to action; earlier garage-sale messages are clever but off-stage, diluting pressure. No second character appears, so status/relationship crucibles are N/A. The ending renunciation—accepting curator role—has causal seeds, yet the cost feels conceptual rather than viscerally paid on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the final image of “collective breath of memory” reweights the premise under Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality is clean: shard→console→map→urn→visceral sunset; each step narrows options. Orientation anchors who/where by word 60; no penalty. One scaffold loop—“time’s texture” phrase repeated three times—mildly dulls cadence but never touches the final image, so −0.2 only in Q7.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Emerald silo’s translucent mineral governs the story’s color and aquatic gloom; light refracts off the obsidian shard, guiding Elara’s hand to the slot. The sub-level console room acts as micro-setting: thinner air and time-whispers physically unsettle her posture, forcing slower breath and sharper attention. The urn’s warmth under the oak roots anchors the sole off-site cache; without that tactile heat the sensory transfer beat collapses. No spatial drift; props track cleanly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—need to feel time’s texture—is signaled in line 1 and tightens when the hologram map offers a single fragile path to restore subjective moments. Agency: inserting shard and later touching warm urn are irreversible acts that foreclose anonymity; each narrows her future to curator role. Cost is conceptual (ironic timelessness, outsider status) but still felt on page. No external antagonist; pressure is situational and coherent under Accumulative lens.</question>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges as the conservation of subjective time against numeric collapse; never stated, only dramatized through sensory caches. Subtext lives in garage-sale code: “music box that plays forgotten hours” whispers the archive’s existence without exposition. Final image of “collective breath” reweights earlier loneliness into communal stewardship, achieving resonance without moral. No late allegory; urn, shard, and silo stay material, not symbolic proxies.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-limited voice is stable; perceptual signature favors mineral light, temperature, and haptic edges—“cold and sharp” repeats as tactile refrain. Syntax stays precise, no filter-verb stacks; rhythmic elongation in “time behaved oddly, stretching and compressing in whispers” mirrors content. No dialogue, so voice distinction N/A. Lexicon remains within Elara’s plausible salvage-world register; no corporate drift. Final line cadence—”waiting always to be rediscovered”—deliberately exhales, earning quiet closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong information density: one sentence often juggles setting, motive, and object (“She aimed to rediscover…scrambled and leaking chronological essence”). Minor scaffold: “texture of time” appears three times; penalty −0.2. No mixed metaphors; “aquatic gloom” is consistent with silo mineral. Sentence openings vary; no template cadence. Copy-clean except one missing comma after “Today” — negligible. Closure beat is uncluttered, allowing 8.2 despite micro-loop.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Premise—post-numeric time preserved as feeling—feels fresh yet emotionally grounded. Garage-sale code as covert archive net is a risky, delightful device that actually shapes plot beats. Obsidian shard sampled from sensory urn repurposes mundane object into literal key; trope is transformed, not checked. Specific detail—green light refracting off black glass—creates indelible visual memory. Risky choices heighten stakes without obscuring closure; earns +0.3 within band.</comment>
