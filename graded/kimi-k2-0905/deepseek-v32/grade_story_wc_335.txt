<comment>Elian’s contradictory impulses—his compulsive backward walk and ferocious tenderness—are dramatized in every beat; Kael’s micro-choice to reclaim the playground shadow without bitterness crystallizes the arc with visible emotional cost. Both men’s flaws drive the plot and the final image of the still swing. Interiority stays concrete (“He walked backwards slightly, nervous that Kael might reject...”) and never drifts into label-speak. No puppet gestures; every annotation, pour, and backward step reveals hierarchy of values under pressure.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: Kael’s declaration “I am not exiled anymore” is earned by the annotated map of his soul and the ledger hand-off that forecloses Elian’s solitary path. Causal chain holds: spiral-leaf → fracture → playground shadow → memory reclaimed → exile reversed. One soft spot: the reversible-exile rule-set is asserted rather than dramatized before the first shard work, a fractional motivation gap. Orientation is anchored by line 3; no disorientation serves the ending, so waiver applies.</comment>

<comment>The cracked pane, oak table’s stain rings, and drifting swing operate as micro-setting that constrains mood and choice; the swing’s final stillness charges the closure image. Selective sensory economy—dusk hush, creak, tea-steam—keeps momentum. Spatial choreography is clean despite Elian’s backward dance. Library never becomes museum tour; every shard and shadow is handled tactilely.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—can exile be reversed by understanding—tightens when the playground-shadow shard is linked to the day before exile; visible price is Kael’s relinquishing of bitterness. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: each annotation, spiral interpretation, and final mirror confrontation narrows options under the causal lens. One deepening suffices; no coincidence resolves. Cost could be sharper—no persistent physical price after hours of shard work—but emotional forfeiture is legible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: resilience is mentored, not claimed; annotation is love made geometric. The swing’s motion→stillness and the ledger’s passage from Elian to Kael reweight the premise without moralizing. Subtext lives in Elian’s backward walk and the spiral-leaf silence. Final image of fresh tea poured for the next exile avoids tidy thesis; ambiguity lingers—who will next resist bitterness?</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Lyrical, hushed third-person hovers close to Elian’s nervous body, then Kael’s skepticism, without head-hop. Syntax mirrors archivist precision: “annotated every discovery in a leather-bound ledger” is tight, concrete. Rhythm modulates—long sentence for dusk entry, staccato for spiral identification. No filter-verb clusters; diction stays within lexicon of forgotten-library recluse. Register never drifts into academic thesis.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances story or image. Figurative vehicles are spare and coherent (“combative tenderness was a forge”). Opening and final lines serve as cadence brackets. Information density is high yet transparent. No mixed metaphors, no synonym churn, no template cadence even in peak annotation beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Shard-mirror + tea-leaf geometry feels inevitable and fresh; the annotative alchemy turns a gimmick into soul-mapping. Reversible exile as a social construct rather than a plot coupon lifts the premise above banishment tropes. Risk is taken—quiet mentoring instead of heroic rescue—and coherence holds. Minor deduction for near-echo of “afternoon shadow caught in glass” phrasing used twice without semantic shift.</comment>
