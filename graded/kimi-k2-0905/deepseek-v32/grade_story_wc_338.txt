<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Aris’s “shielded openness” and methodical curiosity are embodied in the stillness of the vault and the algorithmic comparison of silent footage; the final renunciation of documentation shows earned cost. Interiority stays concrete, never lapses into therapy-speak. No second character, so relationship/status bullets skipped. Micro-choice—turning off all gear—crystallizes values and ends the quest.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: discrepancy in shadow density across fifty years is the taught pattern; closure reweights the tear as sacred threshold. One clean shard, no orientation debt. Final image—“the chapel… closes once more”—delivers Charged Poise with conceptual cost: knowledge must remain unmapped. Persistent constraint: the map can never be mended.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Vault body, shadow-curl, and rain-scoured pigment constrain every beat; the northern wall’s breathing shadow becomes the micro-setting that charges the final image. Sensory hierarchy is cartographer-precise: damp stone, barometric ear-pressure, vanished pigment. Weather and saturation are causal, not backdrop. Spatial choreography is immaculate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake: reopen the chapel by hearing it. Escalation is accumulative: shadow thickens, rain saturates, ear pressure arrives—each ups ante under the henge receiver logic. No causal antagonist; pressure is climatic and archaeological. Final stance crystallizes when Aris abandons documentation—visible forfeiture closes the path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the tear itself: knowledge is completed only when left unmapped. Silence as shared awe accrues through pigment loss, shadow breath, and withheld notes. Final image reweights premise without moralizing. Avoids tidy binaries—accepts necessary incompleteness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Voice is distilled cartographer: “I document nothing,” “frame the void.” Syntax is clipped, rhythmic, mirroring methodical pressure. No dialogue, so no voice leakage. Perceptual signature—comparing grainy 1972 to digital silence—stays consistent and character-specific.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; sentences carry dual duty (action + atmosphere). Figurative language is sparse, never stacked. “Stone itself is breathing” is single, taught metaphor paid off by barometric ear-pop. Read-aloud rhythm accelerates into the final ascension without monotony.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fusion of climatology, archival silence, and empathic cartography feels novel. The chapel-as-acoustic-artifact reweights familiar henge trope. Risk in withholding all visual revelation pays off via ear-pressure climax. Without Aris’s vocation the logic collapses—irreplaceable synthesis.</comment>
