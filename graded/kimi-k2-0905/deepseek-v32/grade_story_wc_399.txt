<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elian’s interiority is evocative but abstract; the “half-mask” split is stated symbolically rather than enacted through contradictory micro-choices. The consecration act is the only beat where motive crystallizes, so the arc reads more as ritual than struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the parapet’s respectful halt and Elian’s bare-faced honesty reweight the premise with felt cost. Orientation is firm by word 100; causality under Accumulative/Textural lens holds, though escalation is gentle—one deepening, not a turn.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The pavilion, dunes, and kinetic parapet are vividly filtered through Elian’s peripheral gaze; still air “where the dunes seemed to hold their breath” is a lean, sensory anchor. The parapet’s motion constrains the final placement of light, earning micro-setting credit.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes—“preserve the echo before it fades”—are signaled early and tighten once when the last clearing dissolves. Cost is conceptual but legible: Elian’s mask removal marks irreversible exposure. One meaningful deepening satisfies short-form bar; no secondary pressure or loss is shown.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme of transience vs. preservation emerges through image pattern (echo, dew, light) rather than statement. Final image of “dunes slept under the watchful sky” offers quiet CR without moralizing. Could sharpen ironic edge if the echo’s future misuse were hinted.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Lyric third-person hovers close to Elian’s senses; peripheral diction (“shapes and sounds form indirectly”) teaches the pattern early and pays off at closure. Rhythm modulates—long breaths for calm, clipped phrases for consecration—without losing coherence. No dialogue to test voice distinction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and image-dense; no loops or scaffold detected. Occasional elevated phrase (“whisperfield calm”) risks register drift but stays within mystic idiom. Sentence variety supports momentum; final paragraph lands with cadence match.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>“Kinetic parapet” and “conjured clearings” feel fresh yet inevitable; the blend of desert mysticism with moving architecture transcends stock prophet tropes. Risk is moderate—quiet accumulation rather than radical rupture—but specificity grounds the concept.</comment>
