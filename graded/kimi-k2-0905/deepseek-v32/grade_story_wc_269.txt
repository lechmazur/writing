<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kai’s grief-anchored curiosity is vivid: the tapping habit embodies obsession, the bleaching memory is body-felt (“skeletal white”), and the final quiet act of folding the atlas page shows renunciation with cost. Interior contradiction is light—more ache than clash—and the micro-choices (correlating data, drumming slower into silence) could be sharper under rising pressure, keeping the score just below the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the vanished paths are reweighted when Kai realizes landmarks of life, not cartography, are gone. The causal chain (bleaching → erosion → sediment → lost seagrass → lost clarity → lost routes) is tight, and the cost is legible in the slowed tap becoming “acceptance and resolve.” One minor slack: the atlas page could exert more explicit constraint earlier.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The station’s metallic hum, tide pulse, and console beeps filter every beat through Kai’s attentiveness; the atlas page itself functions as micro-setting that guides the final correlation. Spatial choreography holds steady; no object teleporting. To enter 9-band the environment would need to physically impede or endanger Kai in the closing beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“why paths disappear”—is signaled early and tightens when data whisper links algal blooms to abandonments. The deepening is internal (knowledge) rather than an external option cut-off, satisfying Accumulative lens. A visible resource loss or tactical forfeiture would sharpen the cost to 8.8+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges inexorably from the cascade: delayed human action erases living maps. No moralizing; the folded relic reconfigures meaning without comment. The coral-bleaching witness motif migrates from memory to explanatory engine, charging the ending with conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person lingers inside Kai’s sensory filter—“ocean sighing,” “staccato code”—and rhythmic sentence variety mirrors tidal ebb. No head-hop; POV knowledge stays bounded. Voice could push slightly deeper under final revelation to hit 9+.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, and image-dense; no loops or scaffold. Metaphors (“ghostly echo,” “ghost on sonar”) cohere. One near-repeat: “periodically eternal” appears twice; trimming would secure 9-band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Linking vanished shipping lanes to coral-reef nursery loss feels non-obvious and specific; the atlas relic reframes eco-catastrophe as cartographic amnesia. Risk is present but modest—no formal experiment—so stops shy of 9+ bonus.</comment>
