<question>1</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Interiority is poetic but abstract—Aria’s “gravity defier” trait and labyrinth quest are declared rather than embodied in micro-choices. Only late mirror-touch shows contradiction and cost, so the prior beats feel performed. Earned stasis lands, but emotional specificity is diluted by lyric summary. Meets baseline for single-POY arc with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure qualifies: mirror-touch integrates timelines with conceptual cost (“she was the drop…”). Accumulative lens holds—pattern of glowing/rain/retrace tightens into final image. Orientation clean by 120 words. One causality hiccup: tablet warms but never constrains a middle turn; its blank payoff feels convenient rather than priced.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Viaduct, rain, and glowing stones anchor every move; mist, amber shift, and liquid-shadow floors filter Aria’s mood. Micro-setting (tablet, mirror) doubles as tool and mirror. Environment directly shapes action—gravity loss, path shift—charging the final image. Sensory economy is strong; no world-rule drift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“conquer the labyrinth of self”—is clear early. Escalation is textural: each corridor adds rejected selves, tightening emotional cost until mirror forces integration. No external antagonist, but internal pressure accumulates under Accumulative lens. Felt price is legible at mirror-touch; could be sharper if tablet had exact trade-off mid-sequence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of fractured identity emerges through image, not thesis—timeline mist, dissolving selves, final drop/ripple reweighting. Subtext stays in gesture: reaching for sorrow-self that evaporates. No moralizing; complexity retained. Periodic eternity motif recurs with shifting meaning, fulfilling resonance requirement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Lyric third-person hovers close to Aria’s sensory filter; diction (“thorny light,” “liquid shadow”) is consistent and purposeful. Rhythm modulates—long sentences for float, fragments at mirror. No head-hop; distance stable. Experimental compression is taught early and paid off. Minor poetic overlap in “glow/rain” couples, but voice remains distinct.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</comment>
<comment>Strong read-aloud cadence, high density; most sentences double-duty. Few scaffold stems repeated. One metaphor stack at darkening-brightness peak risks purple, but fits lyric mode and doesn’t dull closure. Grammar clean, pronouns clear. Could trim two near-synonyms (“shimmering pathways/spiraled”) to tighten further.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Drop→ripple reframe of selfhood feels fresh; procedural psyche-maze literalizes memory without gamey detachment. Glowing viaduct as liminal therapy-space fuses archetype with sensory specificity. Risk in lyric nonlinear structure pays off. Not wholly unprecedented, but synthesis and final reweighting are memorable.</comment>
