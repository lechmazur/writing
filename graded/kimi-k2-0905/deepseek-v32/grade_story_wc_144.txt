<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elara’s meticulous calm and sensory substitution are credibly lived-in; the micro-choice of “selecting a vial of adhesive resin” crystallizes her hierarchy of values. Blindness is not a label—it constrains every diagnostic beat. The ending smile is too safe, shying away from showing the cost of letting the ship (and perhaps her own last chance) slip away; hence no 9-band.</comment>

<comment>Causal chain holds: cracked lens → mis-coding → patch → clear feedback → ship sails. Anchor-chain cadence supplies on-page clock, tightening until the final chord. Closure is Earned Stasis—she succeeds yet is left behind; cost is audible (chain leaving) but not sharpened to a stinger, so no 9+.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The tower workshop, water dish, and slanting sunbeam function as micro-setting that literally steers her repair choices. Sensory triangulation (oil smell, damp wood, tin-roof vibrato) keeps locale tactile without catalogue sprawl. Could edge higher if the depot’s social strata (other workers, fares) nudged her isolation.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Single stake: restore drone before Aethelstan sails. Each clang shortens runway, tightening the causal noose. Agency is pure craft competence; since failure never threatens (she calibrates on first try), pressure plateaus rather than spikes, capping tension just under 8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of “mending as proxy for voyage” emerges through prismatic light and anchor echo, never declared. Final harmony of clear rainbow vs. departing chain quietly reprices her triumph as solitude. Avoids overt moral yet stays slightly safe—no crack in her composure to complicate the motif.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person hovers at intimate psychic distance, mirroring her haptic focus; diction (“magnetic calm,” “resonant clang”) is consistent without purple drift. Rhythm modulates: long clauses for meditation, clipped “It whirred to life” for lift-off. Distinct sonic signature compensates for near-absence of dialogue.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry dual freight—“light bent through the water” advances action and metaphor. No filler loops; every paragraph toggles tool, body, or ambient sound. One mixed metaphor cluster (“silent choir of color”) is forgivable at the climax. Clean proofing, strong verbs, high density.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Using water-refraction as diagnostic for a blind engineer feels novel yet inevitable. stakes stay personal, avoiding sci-fi spectacle cliché. Could push further if a latent flaw in her method had forced improvisation; as is, ingenuity lies in concept execution rather than surprise pivot.</comment>
