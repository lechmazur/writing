<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s “abrasive calm” is vividly embodied in her stillness under the scouts’ lanterns and in the flat edge she gives her voice; the contradiction between detachment and need is present in every beat. The moment she places the cog, her breath “like her first” is a clean micro-choice that shows the cost of conviction. What keeps her from the 8-band is that the interior split between scholar and rebel is announced more than enacted in the middle third; the agonizing is summary, not a visible wrestling of options. The earned stance at the end—watching the council inherit her find—lands with quiet cost, but the causal path could be sharpened by one earlier failed compromise.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The causal spine is lucid: cog discovery → interpretation → sealing threat → deeper descent → cog completes Master Model → council forced to look. Orientation is complete by line 6 and the “vertical crawl through history” is an elegant compressive transition that keeps time-line intact. Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the beam re-weights both narratives and the scouts’ arrogance dissolves without exposition. The 0.1 deduction is for a faint ellipsis between “she would have to prove” and the actual descent—one paragraph of tactic detailing would remove any causal haze.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The sewer conduit is tactile—bone-white ribs, silt under fingernails, brass teeth still sharp—every detail filtered through Elara’s archeological gaze. The crystalline archive chamber is sketched with three precise strokes (circular walls, lattices, brass console) that let the reader finish the picture. Most importantly, the setting constrains action: only the sedimentary descent makes retrieval possible, and only the archive’s absent cog-slot makes her find meaningful. Environment, tool, and body interlock at the climax, satisfying the 9-band gate for constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—“will the past’s precision be silenced?”—is declared in paragraph 2 and tightened twice: first by the sealing order, then by the realization that preservation now demands an irreversible descent. Each tightening costs Elara safety and solitude, visible in the vertical crawl where rubble grades to older stone. The final image does not resolve safety; instead it reconfigures social perception, a conceptual price that feels sufficient. A hair more physical risk on the climb would have pushed this into the 8.5+ band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the accumulating pattern of discarded cogs, ribs, and narratives: complexity humiliates simplicity only when demonstrated, not argued. The luminous cycle-map is an image that re-prices both worldviews without moralizing. Subtext in the scouts’ “wordless awe” lets the surface’s myth of progress collapse in silence. A half-point deduction because Elara’s early “building on sand” line flirts with explicit thesis; the rest of the piece trusts the reader.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elara’s perceptual filter: brass teeth, green patina, abrasive calm. Syntax lengthens during contemplation and compresses under threat (“She said nothing, simply pointed”). No head-hop; even the scouts’ awe is inferred from outside. A slight rise in poetic abstract nouns (“profound correctness”) is the single moment the voice over-leaps her diction, keeping it from the 9-band.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary from sinuous reflective coils to hammer-stroke declaratives; no template cadence. Figurative language is sparse and precise—“bone-white ribs,” “clumsy joy”—never flooding the high-pressure beats. One paraphrase loop (“competing narratives” repeated in adjacent lines) is the only loop visible. The beam etching “interlocking cycles” is concrete enough to avoid abstraction bleed. Clean grammar, unambiguous pronouns, zero scaffolding.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>The post-plague sewer-philosopher is fresh, and the Master Model as a brass ethical calculator re-energizes both steampunk and Atlantis tropes. Using a seafarer’s cog to complete a moral abacus is a specific, non-obvious synthesis that feels inevitable once revealed. Risk is taken with the vertical-descent history metaphor, but it pays off in the final image. The piece stops short of a bolder structural risk that would push it into the 9-band.</comment>
