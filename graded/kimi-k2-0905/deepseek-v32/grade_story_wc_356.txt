<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kaelen’s interiority is lucid and odor-led, giving credible specificity; the shift from frantic control to witnessing is embodied in breath and motion. The final renunciation is earned: “he simply sat” reframes every prior beat. Flaw: the olfactory gift is named, not tested under real opposition—no scene where it misleads or costs him—so the trait feels ornamental rather than crucible-forged. Still, the arc lands with visible cost and resonance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/lyric lens holds: scent-cadence and wrapping-paper pattern deepen until the storm-breath snap reweights the stake. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—“peace found in witnessing a force greater than his own will”—with felt forfeiture of control. Orientation is clean inside 120 words; causality is intentionally cyclical rather than linear, taught early by tidal chimes. One minor slack: the seed’s requirement of “dissonance” is asserted but never demonstrated to fail, so the final stillness feels slightly convenient rather than inevitable.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Treetop village is sketched via lived motion—water clocks, canopy hush, storm breath entering glass—rather than postcard exposition. The terrarium and journal pages function as micro-setting that constrain choices; their states evolve beat-to-beat. Odor hierarchy is consistent and character-specific. Spatial track is sound; no floating props or impossible moves. For 9+ it would need one environmental obstacle that actively defeats a tactic—here the setting enables but does not resist.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—stillness vs. mastery—tightens once, when frantic tweaking gives way to storm-fed surrender. The tightening is textual: scent shifts from “decay” to “electric rain,” forcing hands-off stance. Cost is legible—he abandons prior methodology and the years-long wait is stated—but the page does not dramatize a concrete resource lost (time, social credit, tool). Sufficient for the length; would need sharper price tag for 8.8+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme—serenity within motion—emerges through olfactory cadence and paper-spiral reprise, never moralized. Final wrapping-paper frond reweights the spiral from control symbol to acceptance sigil, a light but genuine Conceptual Repricing. Ambiguity is preserved: village will still gossip when the giant bloom stinks. No thesis line mars the close; the insight stays rooted in the seed’s silence and storm’s arrival.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person distant is stable, with consistent odor-filtered diction: “subterranean stir,” “crisp, electric tang.” Syntax breathes—long vegetative clauses calm, then shorten at the storm snap. No dialogue to test, yet interior monologue avoids therapy-speak. One minor cadence repeat: “his motions becoming frantic, a parody of the serenity he sought” is self-explanatory; trimming would sharpen the fall. Still, voice is character-specific and sustained under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose is lyric but disciplined: metaphor density drops when action accelerates, preventing purple overload. No synonym loops or scaffold; “seedling remained stubbornly dormant” is the clearest, most propulsive line. One mixed image: “foreign vine” of frustration is abstract next to real vines; a body cue would ground it. Otherwise clean mechanics, strong paragraph cuts, and read-aloud rhythm.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Corpse-flower cultivation as spiritual discipline is fresh; pairing it with scent-led journaling and tidal canopy culture feels specific rather than borrowed. The spiral-to-frond reprise is an inevitable-in-hindsight turn. Risk is moderate—quiet botanical epiphany—but coherence justifies the gamble. Could push further by letting the olfactory gift mislead once, creating a false-positive beat that genuine stillness later corrects; that would elevate ingenuity into the 8.5+ band.</comment>
