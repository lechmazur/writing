<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid—her hands “humming,” her perceptual shift from erosion to intentional channels—yet the final epiphany lands as lightly given knowledge rather than embodied cost. The “perpetually learning” trait shows in interpretive carving, but no contradictory impulse tests her. Earned stasis is credible: she renounces GPS, but the price feels conceptual, not viscerally felt on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the star-path reweights navigation itself, cost visible when she “ignored” the revived GPS. Causal chain holds: slide → recognition → carving → lattice activation. One continuous scene, anchored by 120 words; turbine-hum as taught pattern. No teleporting props; driftwood socket is prefigured by “water-worn grooves.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Archway, tarp, skiff, and driftwood function as micro-setting: the socketed carving physically completes the circuit. Selective sensory hierarchy—turbine-hum replaces visual roar—guides choice. Storm-pulse evolves from threat to power source, mirroring internal reconfiguration. Spatial choreography clean: lee-side mooring, apex lost in cloud, carving fitted at base.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake: restore/renew the beacon. Pressure tightens when storm becomes power source and GPS failure becomes summons; no escape option remains. Carving the lattice is the single decisive act that forecloses passive observation. Cost is conceptual—she forsakes satellite certainty for star-path—but legible in the final shrug at the GPS.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: navigation as collaborative art across time, simplicity scaffolding complexity. No moral stated; final image of ignored GPS reweights premise. Timewoven alliance motif shifts from mystery to responsibility without abstraction. Subtext in carving-as-prayer avoids platitudes.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Elara’s sculptor perception—seeing “channels” not erosion. Turbine-hum diction permeates syntax: pulsing clauses, verb choices like “knitted.” No head-hopping; knowledge strictly bound. Voice modulation under stress: shorter clauses as hum swells into chord.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Clauses vary; no template cadence or paraphrase loops. Metaphors disciplined—“turbine-hum,” “woven light”—stay within storm/loom lexicon. Information density high: slide image, socket fit, and star-path compressed into three sentences. No scaffold; every sentence advances image or action.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Driftwood sculptor as cosmic interpreter is fresh; slide-as-treaty reverses usual tech-vs-nature trope. Storm-powered star-path feels non-obvious yet inevitable after lattice reveal. Risk taken in lyric ellipsis—beings of light nod—but pattern taught early. Could swap arch for any stone gateway; slight generality caps upper band.</comment>
