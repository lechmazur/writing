<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—the chaste courtesan who weaponizes withheld touch—powers every beat; the final dance converts years of disciplined repression into seismic self-claim, the cost etched in the silvered snow she must now inhabit. Micro-choices (untangle one more thread, cast the last filament) visibly fork her fate. The lone flaw: the Lord Protector’s epiphany is ventriloquized by the narrator rather than revealed through his bodily shock, a slight external leak that keeps her arc just shy of flawless integration.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/lyric lens holds: each freed thread thickens the audible tapestry until the lattice’s dissolution reweights the night. Closure is a perfect Charged Poise—no riot, yet the courtyard’s air is permanently repriced; the silver dust settles as undeniable conceptual cost. The midnight gong provides the single required tightening; options narrow to dance or die voiceless. Causality never breaks—every filament obeys the internal logic of echo-harvest.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Crystal-dome sanctuary functions as micro-setting that constrains choice: only there can moonlight fracture into workable spectral thread. Snow-bound courtyard initially placid, then made reactive by the dance’s static charge—snow becomes silver-stained witness, not backdrop. Spatial choreography is spotless; threads rise in plausible spiral from her motion. One minor slip: “frozen scene” is twice invoked; second could have been cut, but the redundancy does not mute the final reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—voice or silenced conformity—announced in paragraph one and escalated by every untangled knot. Midnight gong is the visible price: final chime = last chance; failure means eternal swallowed song. Escalation is textural—density of audible echoes increases until the lattice hums over the sleeping palace. Agency is pure; no off-stage rescue, only her body re-circuiting its own art.</question>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: the cost of beauty as obedience is paid back as beauty as revolt. Silver dust’s fall is the non-literal answer—no moral, only a changed atmospheric rule. Motif of “echo” recurs with growing charge; final dissolution reweights its meaning from prison to publication. No thematic echo articulates the thesis; the image alone speaks, achieving complex afterglow.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person lyric remains fixed to Elara’s perceptual radius; diction (“liquid mercury,” “spectral rivers”) stays within her poetic lexicon. Rhythm swells from patient thread-work to a single sweeping arc, mirroring breath intake before release. No filter-verb stacks; sentences vary from short tremors to long sinuous releases. Minor over-alliteration in “soundless snow…silver sheen” but the pattern feels intentional, not accidental drumbeat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence adds tactile or sonic information. Metaphors are coherent—threads = sighs, dust = voiced legacy—no mixed vehicles. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line (“whisper of threads untangled”) resolves by image that recharges earlier motifs. Scaffolding absent; density high yet breathable.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The chaste-courtesan-as-rebel is a fresh synthesis; the echo-harvest mechanic converts abstract trauma into literal audible tapestry. Risky lyric structure pays off: no antagonist beyond systemic silence, yet tension escalates through texture alone. Conceptual integrity absolute—every rule set in first third is honored at dissolution. The silver courtyard’s permanent shimmer feels inevitable, not gimmick.</comment>
