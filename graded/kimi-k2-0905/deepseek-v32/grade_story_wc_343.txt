<comment>Elara’s interiority is only label-curious; we never see her mind contradict itself under pressure. The “sociable isolation” is asserted, not embodied—no bodily tic, no contradictory impulse while the crew watches. Aris’s absence is pure backstory engine; the dog-eared page supplies motive but no on-page micro-choice that proves diligence costs her anything. Closure is a soft pat on the shoulder; the path to the light is open, no path foreclosed, no cost scaled to her person.</comment>

<comment>Causal chain is clean: hopscotch → pattern → phrasebook → course change → luminance. Orientation fixed in first 50 words; single transition (deck→bridge) is legible. Closure is an earned Resonant Reconfiguration: the airship sails on, but the light’s image reweights the premise—Elara’s solitude is now a chosen instrument, not a wound. Cost is present but diffuse (she remains alone); a sharper forfeiture would lift this to 9 territory.</comment>

<comment>Micro-setting triumph: the dusty hopscotch board is tactile, spatially tracked, and literally steers the ship. Starling murmurations act as living chart instruments—an elegant fusion of fauna and tool. “Antique airship” stays generic scaffolding; no rivet, gauge, or engine part constrains choice. Still, the board and birds alone satisfy the 9+ gate by charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—chart the next discovery—signalled early and tightened once: the hopscatch pattern forces a single course correction. Pressure is coherent but mild; no live option is foreclosed, no resource spent. Agency is observation→decoding→announcement; the captain ratifies rather than resists. Escalation is present but flattens into admiration rather than risk.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.6</grade>
<comment>Theme of disciplined solitude emerges through the repeating image of starlings that socialize while Elara does not. Subtext stays implicit: the phrasebook’s polyglot pages suggest knowledge can substitute for company. Final image reweights isolation from burden to tool—quiet but genuine resonance. No moralizing, though the insight is gentle rather than searing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric distance holds steady; perceptual signature is map-maker precise (“strange sequence, reminiscent of ancient constellations”). Syntax stays light, no filter-verb bloat. Dialogue is minimal but natural; captain’s diction is sailor-brief, distinct from Elara’s star-chart lexicon. No experimental compression, yet voice is consistent and atmospheric.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, and propulsive; sentences vary in length and opening. No scaffold loops or synonym churn. Metaphors are spare and integrated (“sky seemed to weep light”). One near-miss: “waterfall of stars caught in time” edges purple but fits POV awe. Information density high; every paragraph advances plot or atmosphere.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: avian choreography + hopscotch = living star map. Stranded luminance as literal waterfall of trapped light is gorgeous yet causally earned. Antique airship trope is shell only; starlings and board supply the real novelty. Risk is moderate—lyric而非cataclysmic—but coherence and specificity make the invention memorable.</comment>
