<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elara’s motive is legible and sustained, but interior contradiction is narrated rather than dramatized; the moth-wing lattice is the only micro-choice that visibly costs her anything. The final loosening of the structure registers as symbolic assent, not a decision that forecloses a fresh option. No second character appears, so relationship crucible is N/A; the arc is a quiet endurance without visible mistake or trade-off, keeping the performance below the 9-band gate.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the monarch alights, then departs, reweighting the lattice as a transient echo—cost is felt in the grotto’s “blushing silence.” Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each knot adds density until the final undoing releases the cadence. The beat sequence is coherent, but the story never risks a causal reversal; escalation is purely cadence shift, acceptable under chosen lens. Orientation within 120 words is clear; no teleporting props or plot amnesia.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The grotto’s mist, moss, and cloud-swept ledges are filtered through Elara’s selective attention; the lattice’s placement on sunlit rock directly enables the monarch’s pause, satisfying the 9+ gate. Sensory economy favors filtered light and tactile vines over visual catalog. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly as Elara gathers, knots, sets, then loosens the structure. Weather remains static but thematically apt; no world-rule inconsistency.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</question><comment>The dominant stake—honoring the final migration—signifies early and tightens through each knot added to the lattice. Pressure is textural: density accumulates until the last butterfly’s alighting crystallizes the cost of absence. No external antagonist or reversal occurs; escalation is purely pattern-deepening, permissible under Accumulative lens. The price is conceptual (loss of chorus) rather than a tactical forfeiture, keeping the score below 8-band ceiling.</question>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through iterated images of transience: moth wing turned diurnal beacon, lattice doomed to decay, final loosening. No explicit thesis is stated; resonance is earned via the monarch’s solitary alighting that reweights prior knots. Ambiguity remains—will any future witness see the echo?—inviting reflection without moralizing. The interrupted cadence motif recurs organically, not as token symbolism.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays anchored to Elara’s esoteric-realist perceptual signature: precise yet mystical, filtering grotto light as “blushing stillness.” Syntax modulates from long, vine-like sentences to clipped final loosening, mirroring cadence break. No dialogue appears; therefore dialogue bullets are waived. Diction remains within plausible lexicon; no head-hopping or filter-verb stacks.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Rhythmic control supports the accumulative design: repetitive “knot / promise / history” phrasing is pattern-taught and pays off in the final undoing. No mixed metaphors or synonym loops; figurative language is sparse, pressure-appropriate. One paraphrase loop (“transient tribute to transient lives”) is forgivable at closure. Sentence variety and paragraph cuts keep momentum; zero scaffolding artifacts in final third.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The monarch-migration elegy is familiar terrain, but the esoteric-realist stance—practical mysticism enacted through ephemeral lattices—offers fresh inflection. Temporary architecture as memorial is specific and non-obvious. Risk is moderate: no formal experimentation, yet the accumulative lyric structure commits fully. The piece would collapse if the lattice were swapped for a generic cairn, satisfying transformation test.</comment>
