<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elara’s “warmly methodical” trait is repeatedly labeled rather than dramatized; micro-choices in the re-braiding scene show competent precision but no contradictory impulse or visible cost. The internal arc (confusion→clarity) is declared, not embodied; no tension between her need to know and fear of what she’ll find. Closure earns mild resonance because the rope/seal act is causally tied to her goal, yet the beat feels frictionless—no risk, fatigue, or irreversible consequence touches her.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: re-braiding + seal opens the impossible door, translating confusion into clarity with conceptual cost (the university’s official history is now destabilized). Causal chain is intact—seal found earlier triggers final interface—though escalation is single-step rather than tightening. Orientation is swift; no lens ambiguity. One causality hairline: “door shouldn’t exist” is repeated but never conflicted with an on-page guardian or institutional force that would raise stakes.</question>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Clock-tower mechanism room is tactile and specific—gears, pendulums, brass chest—details filter through Elara’s archivist gaze. Spatial choreography is stable; the shimmer-door’s appearance is anchored to the paused beat. Micro-setting (rope’s braids) literally constrains the climactic act. No weather or larger campus texture is needed; selectivity fits length. Setting never becomes a crucible that endangers her, so it tops out at 8.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Single dominant stake—solve the anomalous door—signaled early. Pressure escalates only once: silence at 3 → door appears → she must decode it. No meaningful narrowing of options or visible price; success feels pre-arranged. Agency resides in the re-braiding act, but the text presents no risk of failure, lost time, or institutional backlash, so cost stays conceptual rather than felt.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Theme—absence as hidden connection—emerges through the merged rope and re-visioned ambassador; no explicit moralizing. Subtext is thin: no gesture or silence carries irony beyond the literal plot. Final image (“fables of presence”) reweights the premise cleanly. Complexity is asserted more than dramatized, keeping the score shy of 8.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Third-limited clings tightly to Elara’s perceptual filter; diction stays precise, slightly antiquarian, matching an archivist. Rhythm is steady, serviceable, rarely varied for pressure. No dialogue to test. Occasional padded stems (“warmly methodical precision”) dilute distinctiveness. Voice is coherent but not yet unmistakable.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is clear, free of loops or scaffold. Some modifier stacks (“warmly methodical precision,” “deep silence fell”) edge toward cliché. Syntax is uniform; no acceleration under the hinge moment. Clean copy—no tense drift or pronoun tangles. High information density overall, yet final third stays safe, denying 8+.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Fusing archival detective work with living clock-tower lore feels fresh; the braid-key mechanic literalizes theme without seeming forced. Ambassador-as-bridge twist is understated but plausible. Risk level is moderate—no formal experiment, just a neat conceptual overlay. Could transplant to another university with minor edits, limiting upper band.</comment>
