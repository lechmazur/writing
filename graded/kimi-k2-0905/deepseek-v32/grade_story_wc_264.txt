<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The guard’s “quiet purpose” is believable, but every choice is reported rather than dramatized: he “remembered the method,” “closed his eyes,” “focused,” then the clock ticks—none show contradictory impulse or micro-cost under pressure. Interiority stays abstract (“visions…scorched from him,” “empty spaces where dreams used to be”) without embodied sensation that would make the second-hand jump feel like personal risk. Because the final beat is acceptance rather than renunciation, the needed earned cost is only implied, not paid on his body or future options.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Causality is cleanly maintained: arrival at dune → touch clock → charm attempt → one-second advance → pollen release. The frozen-midnight image delivers a crisp Decisive Change with felt conceptual cost—the world’s timeline restarts, committing him to perpetual cultivation. Orientation is clear by 120 words; the speculative rule-set (“charm through wave functions”) is taught early and obeyed. Closure would rise higher if a concrete, personal price (fatigue, archive loss, exile) were foregrounded in the final sentence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The ash plain, soot-boot crunch, and warm brass clock are tactile and specific; the humming lullaby bridges external and internal atmosphere effectively. Selection favors the POV’s freight-guard priorities—weight, vibration, temperature—so detail never feels touristic. The dune itself could exert more causal constraint (flowers that sting, light that blinds), but the micro-setting of the clock-as-anchor satisfies the 9+ gate by shaping the final action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Single dominant stake—“cultivate sparks”—is signaled in line 1 and tightened when the clock refuses to turn. The one-second advancement is a meaningful, irreversible trade-off: time restarts and he must endlessly walk and tend. Pressure escalates through his remembered prohibition against forcing, but the cost remains conceptual rather than visceral; no resource is spent or option closed for him personally, keeping the score just below the 8.2 high-band gate.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of renewal-through-attention emerges inductively from pollen settling into ash, avoiding moral statements. The chess clock’s shift from frozen to ticking reconfigures the world’s metaphysics without explanatory sermon. Subtext stays implicit: his dreamlessness lets him become the world’s metronome. Final image of “midnight…a memory of beginning” offers Charged Poise that invites reflection on cyclical time versus linear loss.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person voice sustains a consistent mythic cadence—“visions scorched,” “archive…whispers of data,” “spectrum of midnights”—without register drift. Syntax lengthens and contracts with the lullaby rhythm, teaching the reader its fractured pattern. No head-hopping or filter-verb clutter; perceptual signature remains the guard’s haptic attention to weight, vibration, heat. Dialogue is absent by design, and the prose supplies the musicality promised by “fractured lullaby.”</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm is deliberate and varied; no template cadence or synonym loops detected. Metaphors stay coherent within the speculative ash-world physics. Occasional elevated phrasing (“quantum probabilities collapsing”) is justified by the archive concept and introduced early. Only minor scaffold: “glowing blooms…brightened, their light waxing and waning” could compress, but it does not obscure causality or dull the closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The post-forest cargo-cult of archived maybe-worlds feels fresh, synthesized through the guard’s mundane freight strap and children-song static. Frozen chess clock as planetary on/off switch is an inventive stake-anchor that avoids generic time-bomb tropes. Risky lyric exposition is taught early and paid off when midnight becomes “a memory of beginning.” Concept commits fully: no retreat to familiar apocalypse or redemption arcs.</comment>
