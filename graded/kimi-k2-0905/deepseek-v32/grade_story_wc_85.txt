<comment>Kael’s guilt and hunger for truth are embodied through tactile rituals (numb fingers on wood, watch hand burning a hole) and micro-choices (black-market trace, long drive). Interior contradiction—crafting lies for others while craving one honest fact—drives every beat. Final renunciation of denial costs him the father he can never confront, earned by the prior siftings and revelation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Causal chain holds: broken watch hand → shore hunt → glyph → terrace → Elara → paternity. Each because/therefore step narrows options and raises emotional cost. Closure lands with Resonant Reconfiguration—acceptance of love shaped by fear—felt in the tightened fist around the hand; weight equals burden of love is the conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Desolate gray shore and cobalt terrace are sketched with selective sensory pressure (sieved hush, bruise-colored dusk) that mirrors Kael’s inner filtration. Driftwood and watch hand act as micro-settings constraining search tactics. Spatial anchors clear; no object teleportation. Environment does not charge the final image as strongly as the object, keeping it just shy of top band.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—learn why Aris vanished—signaled on page 1. Searching the shore forfeits warmth and safety; decoding the glyph back to the terrace forecloses the option to keep manufacturing lies. Final conversation with Elara crystallizes the cost: inherited guilt and unclaimable lineage. Pressure tightens once, cleanly, under causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme of love disguised as absence emerges through recurrent siftings (wood, memories, bloodlines) rather than statement. Final equation “weight of withheld truth = burden of love shaped by fear” reweights earlier false-memory trade without moralizing. Ambiguity remains: Kael neither forgives nor condemns, achieving tempered regret. No motif feels grafted; each returns transformed.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Close third-person stays tightly lashed to Kael’s perceptual filter—cobalt dusk stains his hands like old bruises, driftwood glyphs “deliberate.” Syntax lengthens under reflection, shortens during discovery (“His heart thudded”). No head-hopping; Elara’s voice is mediated through his noticing. Distinct rhythmic control supports pressure without obscurity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and propulsive; sentences carry double duty (action + atmospheric charge). Occasional poetic compression—“sieved hush,” “pressurized quiet”—is patterned early and paid off in final internal hush. No filter-verb clusters, loops, or mixed metaphors. One paraphrase loop near shore exit (“the wind carried…leaving only…”) slightly dulls momentum, preventing 9+.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Genealogist-of-shadows premise freshens the familiar mentor-as-father reveal; occupation directly enables the black-market trace that locates Elara. Driftwood code feels specific to this pair rather than generic treasure hunt. Final reconfiguration—“weight equals love” rather than simple betrayal—avoids melodrama. Slight risk in lyric compression, but coherence holds.</comment>
