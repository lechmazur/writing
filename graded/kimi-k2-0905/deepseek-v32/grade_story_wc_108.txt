<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Leo’s dread of water, stunt reflexes, and the reflexive tremor that never paralyses him are kept in scene; the final choice to flood the library uses that exact flaw as a weapon, paying the cost of terror fully on the page. Carl is functional but thin—his one laugh line and brute lunge suffice for 700 words, yet we get no glimpse of why he once protected the infant he later sold. Interiority is vivid, specific, and free of therapy cant; the only label used (“phobia-ridden”) is the prompt descriptor, not the prose. The arc lands in Earned Stasis: Leo walks away still trembling, path foreclosed, father-substitute drowned, identity rewritten—cost is visible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal lens holds throughout: adoption letter → shell whisper → decrypt cast → trigger collapse. Closure is decisive—Carl submerged, Leo’s self-definition rewritten—and the price (betrayer drowned, fear faced) is on-page in the final image. Orientation is secured within 60 words; no teleporting props or knowledge cheats. One minor knuckle: the pencil code survives decades of damp with implausible legibility, but it is seeded early and motivates the climax, so the break is hairline, not structural.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The rusted library’s geometry—corrugated walls eaten orange, skeletal rafters framing specific starfields—constrains every move: sight-lines for the shell lure, weak beam chosen by Leo, water seepage that becomes the trap. Sensory hierarchy narrows to touch and sound once the roof is a grid of starlight; pulp-soft books underfoot mirror Leo’s own melting certainties. Micro-setting (child-hand cast, single rusted beam) directly enables the decrypt beat and the collapse beat. Environment is indispensable to victory, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—who Leo is and whether Carl can bury the truth—is signaled in paragraph one and tightens twice: decrypt reveal narrows options to confrontation; collapse trap forecloses escape. Pressure is causal and protagonistic: each of Leo’s discoveries drives the next risk, culminating in the deliberate kick that floods the floor. Cost is visible (terror confronted, mentor condemned, self-identity rewritten). No reversal beyond the necessary single tightening, but it is sufficient for 700 words; Carl’s off-stage earlier choices are the only non-protagonistic push, a minor debit.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme—identity as an adaptable stunt rather than fixed fate—emerges through shell, cast, and collapsing floor without once stating a moral. The whispering shell moves from “luck” to truth-teller to bait, re-weighting the motif inside the action. Subtext of paternal betrayal is carried by the child-hand cast, an object both sentimental and evidentiary. Final image of Leo breathing with the night offers quiet Charged Poise that invites reflection on who writes the script next.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited clings to Leo’s sensory filter: starlight “milky,” rust “orange decay,” fear “clenched fist in chest.” Syntax tightens under pressure—fragments when the floor groans, then elongated sentence as he breathes with the night. Dialogue is minimal but distinct: Carl’s sneer “Sentimental junk” contrasts with Leo’s steadied diction. No head-hop, no filter-verb clutter; voice modulation matches pulse of scene. Elision (how Leo decrypts in near-dark) is brief and accepted at this length.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is crisp, rhythmic, information-dense; every sentence advances image, motive, or tactic. No paraphrase loops, no mixed metaphors. One stretch—“orange decay” beside “skeletal roof”—pushes visual metaphor density in a single clause, but the pattern is set early and does not recur in the climax. Opening line anchors stakes; final line resolves by image. Minor copy issue: “a art piece” should be “an,” a typos-level flaw that does not obscure causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Adoption-reveal plus mentor-betrayal is familiar ground, but the fusion with stunt-work physics, aquaphobia as tactical edge, and the library-as-trap refreshes the template. Specificity of the plaster cast with child hand and penciled date feels unique; shell-whisper as audio flash-drive is a light speculative touch that stays metaphorical enough to avoid gadget-exposition. Risk is moderate—single-location showdown, one collapse—but cleanly executed. Not breathtakingly unprecedented, yet the synthesis is memorable and internally inevitable.</comment>
