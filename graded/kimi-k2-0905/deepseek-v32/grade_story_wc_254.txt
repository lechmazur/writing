<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Interiority is lyrically consistent, but contradictions stay abstract (“beauty in ephemeral things” never collides with a concrete counter-desire). Micro-choice is limited to touching quartz and speaking; no embodied cost or loss sharpens the final stance. Motivation remains a static label; the ban-lift supplies external permission rather than an internal flaw that must pay a price.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the hum migrates into her bones, reweighting prior silence with undeniable felt cost. Accumulative lens holds: each sensory layer (hush, hue, vibration) deepens the pattern rather than forcing causal turns. Orientation is clean inside 120 words. One paraphrase-loop (“paraphrasing the hum into language” immediately restated) slightly dulls the final cadence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Cobalt atrium and quartz colonnade are rendered through painterly, POV-filtered detail that constrains movement and pacing. The frozen lake re-enters as a mirrored witness, its slow crack charging the final image with natural paraphrase. Spatial choreography is tracked cleanly; no impossible shifts. Environment qualifies for 9+ gate: the colonnade’s vibration literally shapes her closing decision.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“stride through boundaries once sacred”—is signaled early. Pressure escalates via accumulative texture: hum grows, boundaries dissolve, heartbeat syncs. Yet the tightening is experiential, not tactical; no option is foreclosed or resource spent. Cost is felt but not materialized as sacrifice, keeping entry below 8-band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: art as permeable boundary between self and world. Final image of ice cracking reframes earlier stillness without moralizing. Subtext is carried in hum-to-bone transference rather than statement. Could ascend higher if a specific prior poem or memory were repriced by the closing transformation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person lyric voice maintains consistent psychic distance and rhythmic control. Diction stays within poet-aesthetic register; no filter-verb clutter. Syntax modulates with emotional swell, culminating in shorter declaratives as certainty solidifies. Distinct perceptual signature sustained under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Strong read-aloud rhythm with purposeful paragraph variation. Occasional conceptual overlap (“paraphrase” iterated four times in 70 words) slightly thins density. No mixed metaphors or scaffold. Information density high; each sentence layers sensory or thematic weight. Remains shy of 9+ due to minor paraphrase-loop in closure vicinity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Premise—silenced poets re-entering a resonant quartz sanctuary—feels fresh. Accumulative lyric structure is taught early and coheres. Risk is moderate: chooses atmospheric intensification over plot shocks. Could push further if the colonnade’s ancient makers left a paradox or trap that forced a non-obvious moral choice.</comment>
