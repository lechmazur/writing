<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Interiority is lyric, but repetition of “anguished joy” and “end of innocence” flattens contradiction into mantra. Micro-choices (abrupt memory shifts) are shown, yet they feel procedural, not risky; no bodily cost is attached to the ritual. The final renunciation is asserted (“knowledge imprisons”) rather than dramatized through a visible forfeiture. Voice stays coherent, but emotional hierarchy never sharpens beyond the initial binary.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the purified atoms re-weight memory from curse to hope, with the veil now signifying transformation. Causality is loose (Accumulative/Textural lens): ritual success follows rhythmic density, not strict because/therefore links. Orientation is clear within 60 words; no spatial drift. One meaningful tightening—archive “breathes”—but the cost is atmospheric, not personal, keeping the beat just shy of high-band punch.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Bronze prism pagoda functions as micro-setting: its light beams and emotional resonance directly constrain Elara’s mental choreography. Selective twilight filters (dying light, inner fire) mirror stakes without cataloguing the archive. Sensory economy holds; no geography slips. Object-state tracking (pagoda hums → brightens → silent) is clean and charges the final image, meeting the 9+ gate for constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—purify nostalgia or remain poisoned by it—is signaled early. Escalation is textural: density of atoms and pulsating walls intensify mood, but options never narrow; success feels pre-ordained. No visible price (injury, memory loss) is exacted on-page, so cost is conceptual only. Meets single tightening rule yet stays below 8-band for lack of felt forfeiture.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme—memory as both wound and heritage—emerges through iterative imagery of atoms and veil. Final reconfiguration (atoms become hope) reweights prior material without moralizing. Subtext is thin; archive visions of civilizational collapse are stated, not ironized. Earned wisdom avoids platitude, but repetition of “anguished joy” edges toward sentimentality, capping resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Elara’s perceptual filter: saffron, prism-light, and random memory shifts shape cadence. Syntax varies from long accumulative strings to abrupt fragments, mirroring the “avoid patterns” method. No dialogue, so voice convergence risk is nil. Diction occasionally over-leans on abstract Latinate pairs (“anguished joy,” “grim determination”) but remains distinctive enough under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Strong information density: most sentences layer sensory, emotional, and mythic registers. Rhythm breathes with scene tempo. Minor loop: “steadily unpredictable” appears four times without new inflection; “across the end of innocence” becomes refrain fatigue. No mixed metaphors or scaffold clutter in the closure beat; readability stays high.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>“Atoms of nostalgia” as memory quanta is fresh; coupling purification to anti-pattern cognition gives the trope operational stakes. Archive-as-breathing-organ feels inevitable yet not derivative. Risk is moderate—lyric accumulative structure rather than causal plot—but serves the concept. Could swap pagoda for another relic without breaking arc, so synthesis falls short of 9-band inevitability.</comment>
