<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The Keeper’s “loose grip on reality” and desire to witness without judgment are stated repeatedly, but no contradictory impulse ever materializes on-page; the journey costs nothing and changes nothing, so the final fold feels ornamental rather than earned. Interiority is lush yet circular, never crystallizing into a visible trade-off or renunciation. The character never risks error, stake, or loss—hence no genuine flaw drives the arc.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the Keeper returns to the hut, silence thickened, having merely re-experienced the same cycle. Cost is conceptual—acceptance of perpetual decay—but remains abstract; no option is foreclosed, no price is felt in body or future. Lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of fold-and-return deepens texture rather than narrows choice. The swan’s mechanics are taught early and hold, but the ending’s stasis repeats the opening state without re-configuring stakes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Catacombs, moss-choked shelves, obsidian walls, and paper swan are vividly recurrent; each constrains transit and charges the final image. Spatial choreography is tracked cleanly; the origami fold ritual grounds transitions. Sensory hierarchy skews toward tactile and auditory absence—silence has texture—mirroring Keeper’s loosened grip. Setting never stalls; every detail is filtered through Keeper’s synesthetic time-sense.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade>
<comment>Stakes are “to witness without judgment” and to refill on regenerative silence; they are declared early but never tested by contradiction or rising price. Pressure is situational—accumulative texture of decay—not a narrowing of options. No beat forces the Keeper to risk judgment or loss; silence simply soaks in. Escalation is poetic density, not actionable cost; final quiet is identical to initial quiet.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Theme of regenerative silence emerges through iterated images of crumbling paper, sprouting vines, black stone hush—never named as thesis. Final image of folded swan tucked away re-weights prior material: silence is portable, perennial, self-renewing. Moral remains ambiguous—peace in decay is neither valorized nor mourned. Avoids overt allegory; resonance arises from tactile particulars rather than abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Voice is lush, languid, synesthetic—syntax elongates then compresses in mimicry of breathing silence. Diction favors Latinate decay-words (“crumbling parchment,” “vegetative gloom”) that feel lived-in for this centuries-old observer. No dialogue; interior monologue stays within Keeper’s plausible lexicon. Rhythm pulses like slow river—long sentences swallowed by caesuras—mirroring stretched time-sense without monotony.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Sentence variety is strong; no template cadence or synonym loops detected. Occasional elevated phrasing (“time bled like sap”) risks purple but stays coherent to Keeper’s sensibility. Information density high: one line often layers sensory, metaphoric, and mythic work. A few near-repetitions of “crumbling peace” and “untold seasons” lightly blunt edge; still propels.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Folds time-layered travel into origami swan—fresh, non-obvious, fully committed. Regenerative silence as active substance rather than absence is an ingenious re-framing. Risk of dense lyricism pays off: texture becomes plot. Could swap Keeper for any passive observer-poet, so individuality is slightly muted; still, the synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
