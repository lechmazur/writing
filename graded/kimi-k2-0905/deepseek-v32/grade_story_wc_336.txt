<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elara’s desire to preserve “the color of wonder” is declared early and echoed through action, but interiority is abstract (“insatiably creative” as label) and no contradictory impulse is dramatized; the sacrifice moment is soft-focus—no bodily tension, no micro-choice hierarchy, so the cost is felt more as concept than character wound.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: infusion of seed-wonder transmutes orchard and self, earning resonant stasis with conceptual cost (seed dimmer). Causal chain holds—prune → portal → transfusion → reciprocation—taught under Accumulative/Textural lens; orientation of parapet/waterfall given by ~120 words; no orientation penalty.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Verdant parapet, waterfall mist, and gnarled apple branch function as micro-setting: the branch literally supports the portal cut, the mist catches final rainbow—environment materially participates in climax; selective sensory triage (sound of falling water, sap-glow) keeps density tight although some phrases edge decorative.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“preserve wonder”—is signaled early; pressure escalates via east-wind dullness and crystal-world thirst, forcing choice to share seed vitality; one meaningful tightening when sap flow commits her irreplaceable resource, price legible (“seed dimmer”). Escalation sufficient for 600-word frame under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme of preservation-through-sharing emerges organically from the infused sap image; no explicit moralizing. Final rainbow in mist reweights prior “color of wonder” without statement. Subtext quieter than it could be—no ironic gap or dramatic irony exploited—so resonance solid but not exceptional.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person lyric maintains stable distance; diction tilts horticultural-archaic (“succor,” “chromatic life”) yet stays internally consistent; rhythmic rise-and-fall mirrors waterfall cadence, supporting emotional arc. No dialogue to test distinctiveness; no head-hop; no artifactual loops—clean, controlled voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; figurative language dense but patterned (woven/loom metaphors) and pays off in “thread of shared vitality.” Two adjacent “world of …” phrases verge on template but isolated. High information density overall; no paraphrase loops or clarity loss at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Mythic orchard-weaver conceit freshens portal-fantasy trope; pruner as inter-world life-transfuser feels specific to this voice. Yet core scaffold—fragile realm drinks McGuffin juice—remains recognizable fairy-tale logic; transformation resides more in imagery than in rule-set or moral calculus, curbing surprise.</comment>
