<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elias’s forgiveness is stated, not embodied; the “snowmelt ardor” is repeated label-speak rather than felt contradiction. His gentleness is shown once in the rope-work, but no micro-choice reveals competing values or cost. The arc lands as serene success without visible trade-off, so the renunciation feels pre-paid rather than earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Closure is a luminous CR—the rope sings, ice melts, card turns to dust—so a reweighting occurs. Yet causality is soft: why must a wax-caster’s gentleness succeed where no other could? The rope’s logic isn’t taught, so the illumination reads as lucky fit rather than inevitable outcome. Cost is poetic but not materially foreclosed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Icebound sanctum is viscerally anchored: dripping walls, pulsing aurora, coiled rope altar. Sensory selection stays tight—cold vs. “snowmelt ardor” heat—guiding Elias’s tactile braid-work. The rope itself becomes micro-setting that constrains the final choice; environment directly charges the closing image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“preserve forgotten names”—is clear early. Pressure tightens only once, when mis-alignment could damage rope or card, but no credible loss is shown if he fails. Escalation is lyric accumulation, not option-narrowing; the success glow feels predestined. Agency is gentle care, not risk, so cost is aesthetic, not tactical.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme of acoustic resurrection emerges through braid-circuit mechanics rather than exposition. Final image—names singing as ice becomes water—reconfigures memory from static archive to living chorus. Subtext avoids moralizing, but the absence of any cost to Elias blunts resonance; theme is tender yet frictionless.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Elias’s haptic attention: “cradled,” “technically gentle,” “snowmelt ardor.” Rhythm swells with aurora lights, then softens at closure; diction remains within caster’s lexicon. No head-hop or filter-verb clutter; perceptual signature is consistent and atmospheric.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose is musical but loops: “snowmelt ardor” appears six times, “technically gentle” thrice; tightens to pattern rather than evolving. Some metaphor stacking (“street organ playing, but instead of music…”) slows the climax. Otherwise clean, vivid, and propulsive; no grammar slips or spatial confusion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marrying lost-wax precision to mnemonic rope-braids feels fresh; the punched-card-as-phonograph is lovely. Concept would collapse if elements swapped, so specificity is high. Risk is moderate—lyric mysticism over plot jeopardy—but the synthesis is memorable and avoids genre cliché.</comment>
