<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The insomnia is embodied (“his eyes gritty”) and drives the initial pacing; the “wryly earnest” stance is shown in how he voices the absurdity of meeting the old woman while still kneeling. Micro-choice—deciding to follow rain trails—propels the scene; the final endurance (painting dawn, brooch pinned) is earned and carries cost of sleeplessness. Interior contradiction is present yet stays slight; no sharp second impulse complicates the beat where he accepts the keeper’s charge, so it stops just short of 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: “Paint this” crystallizes his stance, insomnia converted to vigil, cost felt in “weary to his bones.” Causal chain holds—trail → brooch → memory → exchange → vocation—each because/therefore link narrows his option from escape to witness. Early anchors (who/where/when) appear by line 4; no orientation debt. Persistent constraint (brooch as compass) shapes the final tactic and image. Cost is legible in the dawn canvas and the first deep sleep in years.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The tidal island’s twice-daily disappearance is made tactile—“damp shingle,” “slumped berm where water had undercut the peat”—and the retreating tide literally exposes the brooch, so setting drives plot. Rain trails micro-navigate him inland; the storm-glint moonlight constrains visibility and timing. Spatial choreography is clean: shack → berm → return. Final painting color-mixes dawn and amber, so environment charges the culminating image. Meets 9-band gate: island geography constrains choice and suffuses closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled early: “thresh meaning from experience.” Middle tightening occurs when the unearthed brooch forces confrontation with personal history; the exchange with the keeper forecloses solitary nihilism and demands chronicler role. Cost is visible—he relinquishes sleep and anonymity, accepting “haggard awe.” Agency drives the turn: he could pocket the relic and leave, but stays, shares, then paints. One pressure spike suffices; coincidence (meeting keeper) complicates, not resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the amber seed: continuity amid fracture. Subtext lives in gesture—the old woman’s hand to his wrist, not the brooch—implying legacy trumps possession. Final image reweights prior insomnia from curse to lens, offering CR rather than moral. No late thematic slogan; “convergence” recurs but is anchored in island geography and ritual exchange, so feels earned. Complexity survives: wars’ scars aren’t erased, only repurposed into witness.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is painterly: colors stay muted except for “silver veins,” “bruised pinks,” “amber glow,” reflecting his chromatic craving. Syntax lengthens under wonder, then compresses at decision (“Paint this”). No head-hop; interior access remains tight. The two spoken lines carry gravel-toned indirection appropriate to keeper myth. Free indirect runs clean; filter verbs (“he realized”) are sparse and voice-motivated. Rhythm modulates with tide-whisper pacing without drumbeat monotony.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>High information density: “salted wounds,” “transient kingdom of mud and revelation” fuse world and psyche. No paraphrase loops; each sentence adds texture, action, or stakes. Metaphors stay coherent (silver veins = moonlit rain trails) and physically rooted. Opening line anchors voice and sleepless stakes; final line seeds continuity. No scaffold, no mixed registers, no artifact clutter in closure beat. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with tidal cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Post-water-war tidal island as liminal atelier feels non-generic; convergence trope is re-embodied in excavated brooch rather than abstract portal. Insomnia repurposed from affliction to artistic filter provides fresh inflection. Mythic encounter avoids exposition dump via keeper’s stone-shift voice and painter’s skepticism. Risk in lyric accumulation pays off: rain trails as map, amber as compass, dawn as palette cohere into inevitable closure. Transformational specificity prevents swap-with-names test failure.</comment>
