<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elara’s quiet obsession is rendered through tactile ritual (scarf, compass, hyperbolic tracing) that externalizes inner drive; the “sanely eccentric” label is shown, not worn. No contradictory impulses play out in-scene—she proceeds without hesitation or micro-choice that costs her anything—so the arc is flat, not forged under pressure. Still, her embodied attention and the scarf’s inherited weight make her feel singular. The beat where she aligns tear to focal point is the single moment where desire meets concrete action, and it lands.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the library is revealed as literal gateway to infinite hyperbolic story-space, reweighting every prior shelf-touch. Causal chain holds: because she maps the scarf with the room’s geometry, the memory speaks; therefore she grasps the curvature axiom. Cost is subtle but legible—she inherits custodianship of an endless task, foreclosing ordinary life. Accumulated pattern (scarf → geometry → infinite) tightens once and sticks the landing.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The non-Euclidean nook is not backdrop but actuator: its saddle-curvature is the key that unlocks memory. Sensory detail is selective—copper whisper, silk warmth, chalk dust—never catalogue. Spatial choreography is clean; scarf, compass, vellum, table stay tracked. The library’s macro-description is sketched, yet the micro-setting (curved wall as lens) constrains the decisive action, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—find where stories live—is signaled early and deepened, not widened. Single meaningful tightening: geometry turns metaphor into navigable map, narrowing infinity to a path she must now steward. No external antagonist or reversal, but under Accumulative lens the density of pattern (scarf + room + equation) itself escalates. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral, keeping it below 8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: narrative space as literal negative curvature where every tale occupies a fold without overlap. No character states the thesis outright; the founder’s memory-echo comes closest but embeds it in action (chalk, sketch). Final image of Elara guiding patrons “story by story” reconfigures the opening solitude into quiet mission. Ambiguity remains—she can never reach the place, only tangent it—yielding lasting resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays latched to Elara’s perceptual filter: she notices paper scent, chalk pressure, exponential divergence—never tourist catalog. Syntax lengthens during ritual, compresses when patron interrupts, mirroring attention. No head-hop; memory-echo is presented as perceived scene, not omniscient intrusion. Prose texture is lyric yet disciplined, with rhythmic control that heightens pressure without purple drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or synonym churn; each sentence advances image, motion, or concept. Figurative language is spare and precise—“compass whispering arcs,” “saddle-shaped space”—never stacked. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line crystallizes charged poise. Occasional elevated diction (“non-Euclidean,” “cosmic microwave background”) is justified by librarian’s scholarly lens and never slips into jargon for display.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Premise hybridizes Borges-style infinite library with hyperbolic geometry as living indexing system—fresh, non-obvious, yet inevitable once revealed. Risky compression of poetry, cosmology, and metaphysics into 700 words pays off without clutter. Scarf-as-archive and room-as-lens feel invented, not borrowed. The synthesis earns +0.4 risk bonus because unconventional structure heightens meaning and closure remains lucid.</comment>
