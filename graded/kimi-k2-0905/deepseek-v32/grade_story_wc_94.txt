<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied—“furiously tranquil” contradiction lives in breath and pocketed timer—but final renunciation leans on abstract self-authorization rather than a micro-choice that costs her something fresh on the page; still, scar-as-map metaphor sustains a coherent hierarchy of values under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the single pristine line reweights all prior scar imagery with undeniable conceptual cost; accumulative lens holds, timer pattern taught early, orientation anchored inside 120 words—only minor slack in causality is the unseen hand that delivered the envelope, but it complicates rather than resolves, so waived.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Observatory dome, storm pulse, and bodily attention interleave to guide the final act of writing; glass reflection moment functions as micro-setting that crystallizes the stance—timely specificity without static cataloging.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“cartography of scars”—tightens once when lightning reflection reframes scars as light-channels; escalation is accumulative, agency resides in the decision to rarefy thought into one line, but external pressure (Council) remains off-page, so cost is conceptual rather than viscerally felt.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically from scar pattern: silence becomes articulate contour; final line offers resonant non-literal answer without moralizing—“channels for light” reconfigures prior censorship wound cleanly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Lyric third-person hovers close to Elara’s perceptual bias—stormlight, timer tick, photo-chemical memory—syntax shortens under peak flash without head-hopping; distinct texture sustained.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Strong information density—each sentence advances image or decision; occasional elevated diction (“bruise-dark bellies,” “rarefy”) flirts with purple but stays within POV’s poetic lexicon; no loops or paraphrase clutter, metaphors remain coherent.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Fusion of darkroom timer with stormlit observatory feels fresh; scar-cartography trope is familiar yet reanimated through photo-developing metaphor and lightning inversion—risk taken without obscuring clarity.</comment>
