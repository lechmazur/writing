<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Arin’s interior contradiction—impatience forged into patience—remains concrete and embodied; her bootsoles humming with the viaduct’s pull externalizes the tension. The micro-choice to “guide not fight” the magnetic wave crystallizes her hierarchy of values and costs her the last of her stored stamina, shown by the slower, colder return trek. No secondary character appears, so relationship/status bullets are waived; her solitary stance is rendered as individual rather than archetype. The smile at the close is a credible, small release that still keeps her flaws intact.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through patterned lunar tracking and culminates in a Charged Poise as Arin re-weights the Citadel’s signal. The closure beat—“she had learned that true revolution is not seized, but grown, like ice over deep water”—delivers a Conceptual Repricing that reconfigures the premise without moralising. Causality is intact: because she aligned herself with the viaduct’s peak pulse, the field’s direction tilted, loosening the yoke. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are vivid by line 3; no debt incurred.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The frozen lake, basalt sanctuary, and moon-lit viaduct are never backdrop; they dictate travel speed, bodily risk, and the exact moment of intervention. The wet lodestone under her boots constrains footing and channels magnetic force that she must synchronise with internal compass—an environment-as-tool triumph. Cold is filtered through professional necessity: only horizon-mappers would notice “the moon carve its cold path through clouds” while tasting iron in the air. Final image of dawn on the lake reprises the opening but charges it with the new resonance of a population beginning to stir awake.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—the unyoking of her people’s minds—remains abstract but is made visceral through the viaduct’s hum in her teeth and the risk of slipping off the arch. One meaningful tightening: the instant moon intersects the calculated azimuth, her option to retreat vanishes; she must stand or lose the cycle. Escalation is accumulative: each tracked rainstorm, each boot-crunch, layers magnetic density until the final pivot. Cost is legible—she finishes “longer, colder, but lighter,” stamina spent for an imperceptible societal gain.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The theme that revolutions must be grown, not seized, emerges from the patterned ice-over-water image rather than pronouncement. Subtext resides in the magnetic viaduct itself: a bridge that does not transport bodies but transmits will, a silent rebuttal to Citadel force. The closing line’s conceptual re-pricing reweights every prior moon-track and frost step without sermonising. No tidy moral is offered; ambiguity lingers in how soon—or if—the loosened yoke will be felt.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Arin’s perceptual filter—magnetic taste, frost-numbed toes, horizon angles—without wandering. Syntax lengthens during patient waiting, then fragments at the pivot (“She did not fight the field but guided it, a gentle nudge…”), mirroring her internal cadence. Diction remains within a mapper’s lexicon: azimuth, lodestone, resonance, rather than borrowed academic grandiloquence. No dialogue present; evaluation focuses on narrative voice, which maintains a restrained wildness that modulates into the final hushed smile.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Rhythm varies from frost-crunch monosyllables to longer, tide-pull sentences that mimic magnetic drag; no template cadence detected. Figurative language is spare and precise—“the viaduct seemed to sigh”—without overwriting the peak beat. Information density is high: one sentence often layers weather, tool, and bodily stakes. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn; “sculpt patience from impatience” is the only conceptual repetition and it is earned by closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Fusing geomancy, lunar calendars, and anti-colonial mind control through a quiet mapper’s intervention feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Lodestone-as-signal-jammer transforms familiar tech-tropes into low-tech mythic engineering. The “ice over deep water” revolution metaphor is specific to this frozen lake and could not transplant to desert or ocean settings. Risk is taken in dramatising an invisible outcome—yet the hush after the pulse lands with undeniable pressure.</comment>
