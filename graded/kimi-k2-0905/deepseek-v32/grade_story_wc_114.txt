<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is granular and body-anchored (“hollowed-out and clear,” “the floor seemed to tilt”), her margin-dwelling reflex complicates the buried theft, and the final drawing is a micro-choice that costs her the safety of detachment. The swallowed truth stays an abstract weight a beat too long, muting the contradiction that could have detonated earlier. Still, endurance turns to active re-naming, the smudge becomes inherited scar tissue, and the grief lands as specific as pigment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a CR re-pricing: the smudge is reclaimed as confession, not error, and the pencil smear literalizes that re-weighting with visible cost. The accumulative/textural lens holds—each flawed illustration layers density until the ledger page breaks the pattern. The orienting triad (who/where/when) is fixed by word 30 inside the mountain station; no causality leaks. The final image crystallizes options: she forecloses perfect replication and accepts the inherited flaw as durable sorrow.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The station’s perpetual twilight and shredding sky mirror epistemic instability without over-telling; the cracked portfolio spine and spinning anemometer cups are tactile anchors that later charge the final smudge. Weather is not backdrop but lecture—“bright sky shredding into whiteout within minutes”–that justifies her oracle-mind calibration. The smell of cold vellum and the violet dawn narrow to the single saxifrage petal she draws, proving micro-setting can dominate at this scale. No geographic drift or impossible object states; spatial choreography stays clean across bunk, desk, window.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—naming the weight of stolen legacy—tightens once when the smudge flips from error to confession, forcing her to trade passive ghosthood for active mark-making. Pressure accretes via weather volatility and pigment flaws; each analog reading is a micro-beat that keeps the mountain unstable under her feet. The cost is legible: she abandons the safety of peripheral observation when the pencil blurs the stem, accepting visible imperfection as inheritance. No coincidence; escalation is purely textural density that reweights meaning.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from pigment physics: flawed vellum as silent scream against erasure. The saxifrage’s “bending under invisible wind” externalizes generational resilience without moralizing. Subtext lives in the quiet smudge—confession disguised as accident—so the reader completes the theft. Final image answers the question “who owns history?” with pigment, not platitude.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person focalization stays tight to Elara’s perceptual filter—wind “pushing,” fever “hollowed-out”—syntax mirrors her calibrated oracle-mind: long clauses for data, fragments for tilted floor. No head-hop; psychic distance compresses under fever’s aftermath but never breaks. Register remains within her scholarly lexicon minus jargon dump, culminating in the quiet lyric cadence of “auroral sorrow hardening into day.” Dialogue absent by design; narrative voice carries all subtext without ventriloquism.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence carries dual duty—weather data doubles as emotional barometer. Metaphors are spare and precise: “stone tooth,” “cold, heavy stone in her gut,” no mixed vehicles. Rhythm breathes with paragraph breaks that mark ritual shifts from data to vellum to drawing. Closure line “certainties would always sway” lands as earned anaphora, not template cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Freshest synthesis: meteorological station as confessional booth for archival theft. Smudge-as-legacy reverses the usual “perfect botanical” trope; flaws become the true archive. Risk is quiet—no villain, no storm rescue—yet stakes feel large because pigment carries ancestral sin. Conceptual repricing of error→testament feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
