<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Lev’s trembling hands and “uncertain alchemist” label are vivid, but interiority drifts toward explaining rather than embodying uncertainty under pressure; the final beat of “terrible, enchanted certainty” lands as an asserted flip rather than a visible cost. No contradictory impulse is shown mid-scene—his doubt is stated, not enacted—so the arc feels tidy instead of earned. Still, the alchemist’s embodied craft (placing charm, narrating aloud) keeps agency alive and ties motivation to tactile choice.</comment>

<comment>Causal chain holds: each charm-fit produces gold light → recovers memory → rewrites history, tightening stakes until the last match ignites closure. The statue-heart placement is a decisive change with felt cost—the workshop literally shears apart as the vision completes. One micro-turn suffices; no reversals are required. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 3 and remain stable; no lens ambiguity at end.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Acid-sea, gears-and-cogs hull, brass table, and porthole fog are selective, sensuous, and filtered through Lev’s tool-centric gaze. The environment actively threatens: acid spray breaches the wall precisely when the last memory locks, so setting shapes the final cost. Micro-setting rule satisfied: the corroding workshop doubles as both body and tool constraining escape. Spatial choreography stays clean as Lev moves charm to cheek, brow, heart without drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“conjure meaning before the world dissolves memory”—is signaled early and escalates because each successful charm-fit recovers costlier truth while the acid sea gnaws the hull. One meaningful tightening: the final fit triggers simultaneous structural breach, linking knowledge gained to survival lost. Price is visible on-page: “a major gear shearing off with a scream of metal.” No coincidence resolves; the acid surge complicates but does not save.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: broken things made more luminous by their fractures. Kintsugi shifts from metaphor to method as pockmarks become constellation map and charm becomes gold seam. No explicit moral; final image of Lev clutching glowing-cracked statue reweights earlier destruction as intentional sacrifice. Subtext lingers: remembrance itself is the only vessel that outlasts corrosion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Voice is alchemist-technical: “constellation of pockmarks,” “crystal shards,” “amber flashes”—diction stays within Lev’s esoteric lexicon. Rhythm compresses under pressure: clauses tighten as acid enters, mirroring urgency. Perceptual signature is consistent—dusty sculptor hands, ozone scent, gear-scream—all filtered through Lev’s sensory priorities. No head-hopping; single POV holds.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; sentences layer job—image, motion, consequence—without scaffold. Only one paraphrase loop spotted: “fragile epoch between breaths held underwater” echoes later “final moment between a breath and the inundation,” but the reprise is purposeful, charging closure. Mixed-metaphor risk (“kintsugi intentions made manifest”) is justified because the concept is literalized on-page. No filter-verb stacks; verbs stay strong.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: kintsugi + memory-quilt + corrosion-as-archive feels inevitable yet unclichéd. Statue-pockmark cartography and charm-legend reverse typical treasure-map logic—erosions are intentional data. Risky second-personish narration of memories (“She marked it…”) is earned by the diegetic need to speak truth solid. Not a template plot; removal of any element breaks the closure engine.</comment>
