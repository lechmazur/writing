<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s longing is palpable, but interiority sometimes drifts into lyrical summary (“symphonically minded” repeated) rather than moment-by-moment contradiction; the micro-choice to strum is present yet cost is more aesthetic than felt. Hedgehog cue works as embodied trigger, sustaining credible motivation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the grove sings again, silence overturned with on-page auditory shift. Causal chain is light—analysis of cracks → strum → resonance—but coherent under Accumulative lens; no orientation debt. Persistent constraint (future silence possible) is implied, satisfying cost test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Micro-setting triumph: porcelain insulator and stress-cracked sculpture function as tactile environment that constrains each strum. Alder grove is sketched via selective sound and touch rather than visual catalog, integrating action with atmosphere. Final glow of the insulator charges image, meeting 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—restore sound—remains clear; escalation is textural (whisper → note → symphony) rather than causal narrowing, appropriate to Accumulative lens. One meaningful tightening occurs when cracks “teach” resonance, but no tangible price or lost option is dramatized on-page, capping entry into higher band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of empathy-as-voice emerges through concrete recurrence of touch/listen cycles; no moralizing summary. Final image reweights earlier silence without literal statement. Slight abstraction in “conversation between earth and life” keeps it from top tier, but subtext remains earned.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Lyrical third-person hovers close to Elara’s synesthetic ear; perceptual signature is consistent (“entire movements in the rustle”). Rhythm modulates with sentence length, mirroring sonic build. No dialogue, so distinction not tested; compression and repetition serve musical intent without head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is sonorous yet disciplined; a few looping phrases (“empathy in motion” x3, “symphonically minded” x2) create faint drumbeat. Metaphors stay coherent (cracks as staves). No scaffold obscuring closure; minor paring could elevate density further.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Fusion of dendro-musicology with cracked-sculpture resonance feels fresh; porcelain insulator repurposed as tonal probe offers specific, home-grown tech. Hedgehog trigger is light but charming. Core arc—reading fracture lines to birth sound—avoids genre templates and sustains conceptual integrity.</comment>
