<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara’s “patiently strategic” trait is dramatized in every beat—ankle-chain geometry, daily mallet ritual, light-loop trap—so her final graceful throw feels earned. The only minor slack: interiority occasionally drifts toward label-speak (“her motivation was simple”) instead of embodied contradiction. Still, the cost is visible when her chains drop and she steps into dust still wearing ankle scars—state change with physical memory.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Causal lens holds: each micro-choice (hook chain, swing mallet, cross wires, decode keys) tightens the next, culminating in the charged poise of seeds in dawn light. Closure lands as conceptual repricing—vault opened, automaton halted, dry soil now weighted with possible forests. No orientation debt; wall-fall anchors time/space by line 2. Persistent constraint (chains→scars) shapes final image, satisfying cost proof.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Setting is micro-scaled body-tool-environment fusion: ankle chain + rusted post = geometry of captivity; piano-key map = tactile cipher; sparking copper lines = immediate physics. Each detail is filtered through Elara’s engineer-like attention, never tourist catalog. Final seeds in dawn dust re-weights every earlier texture—irreplaceable closure charge.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Single dominant stake—liberate seeds—tightens twice: wall fall (external clock) and automaton approach (internal clock). Protagonist agency drives escalation: she creates the short-circuit distraction and the arrow-in-conduit kill-switch. Cost is incremental (months of wrist scar tissue, lost arrow, residual ankle welt) and accumulates to final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme of “resilience as encoded grace” emerges from concrete particulars—crow-fletched cipher, ivory intervals, germination cycle—never stated. Final image of seeds in dust offers resonant non-literal answer: grace is the latent life now lodged in barren substrate. No moralizing, only re-weighted matter.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Elara’s perceptual signature—measured silence, interval math, felt chain weight. Syntax mirrors her patience: long vowel cadences broken by hammer blows. No head-hop; diction stays within scavenger lexicon. Arrow-as-cipher metaphor is legible without academic leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high info-density—one sentence often performs spatial, emotional, and tool mapping simultaneously. Rhythm accelerates precisely at sparking wires and arrow toss, then exhales into dawn silence. Metaphors stay coherent (dust motes as forgotten tokens) and don’t clog causality. Read-aloud ear test passes.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Fusion of post-collapse carnival noir with botanical heist feels singular; piano-key cipher as vault combo is non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Risky choice to make climax a graceful toss upward, not brute strike, pays off via earlier “patiently strategic” seeding. World logic stays internally consistent—no late rule patches.</comment>
