<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Kael’s interiority is lyrically particular—“borrowed dawn,” “patterns behind reality”—but the pivot from control to connection is declared rather than dramatized in body or choice; the only micro-choice is sprinkling dust he already intended to use, so the renunciation feels lightly earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each painted rock adds density until the final dissipation reweights meaning. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration—he lets the sphere drift into aurora, foreclosing control with visible cost (the promise reframed). Causality is internal and coherent; no orientation debt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Tidal bluff, luminescent tides, and aurora are filtered through Kael’s bias, narrowing to the central rock that channels star-dust; the setting’s luminous physics quietly guides the final release, charging the image. Spatial choreography is clean; environment mirrors internal shift without overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—understanding versus control—tightens when he chooses release; the sphere’s dispersal is felt cost. Pressure accumulates through descriptive density rather than external opposition; one meaningful deepening suffices. Coincidence absent; escalation is internal and legible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges via pattern: dust-aurora fusion reweights “harness” into “belong.” No overt thesis; final image reframes prior symbols. Ambiguity lingers—visions remain fragmented—avoiding tidy moral. Resonance is earned through sensory particulars, not assertion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distanced third-person maintains lyric compression; diction (“collapsed star dust,” “luminous tides”) is consistent and POV-bound. Rhythm swells toward the sphere beat, then breathes at release. No dialogue, so no voice contamination. Elision is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is lean, image-dense, and loop-free; figurative language is selective and patterned. Sentence variety supports auroral cadence. No mixed metaphors or scaffold. Opening and final lines anchor and recharge the motif cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Fusion of eel-herding, star-dust arithmetic, and post-friction physics feels specific to this narrator; premise is fresh yet internally coherent. Risk is moderate—lyric accumulative structure—but payoff justifies choice. Could not swap elements without breaking aura.</comment>
