<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses—shrewd parsing versus innocent hope—surface in the embodied micro-choice of clenching the coral while decrypting the cast, but the final “quiet peace” is asserted rather than dramatized with visible cost, so the arc feels completed off-page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of cast-decryption thickens meaning until the coral reweights it. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—she sees the cast as “canvas for their shared, resilient heart”—with felt conceptual cost. Orientation clear by word 80, no disorientation served, transitions clean.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The atrium’s mist/glass/coral micro-setting acts as tactile constraint—coral ridges against palm direct attention, humidity softens time—charging the final image. Sensory selectivity filters through translator’s bias (notes, phonetics), body as setting anchors every beat. Spatial choreography clean; no props teleport.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—unknot memory to graft new meaning—tightens once: decryption rewrites fear into shared dialect. Agency is attentional endurance; no reversal, but deepening reweights options under Accumulative lens. Cost is legible as “lotus ache” that forecloses numbing; persistent constraint of cast/coral keeps pressure coherent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges inductively: shared language as survival tool. Brain-coral colony metaphor reappears to reframe collective trauma without sermon. Final image offers resonant, non-moral answer—cast as canvas of care—repricing prior violence. Ambiguity lingers: ache remains, hope begins.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Lyric third-person hovers close to Elara’s perceptual filter—porous coral / smudged cast—syntax lengthens under anesthetic haze, shortens during decryption. No head-hop; register stays within translator’s lexicon. Patterned elision (“slow tide…adrift”) taught early and paid off in final “anchored” cadence. Distinct texture sustained.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm breathes with cognitive drift—long sentences mirror anesthetic, then tighten as notes are parsed. No synonym loops; figurative language sparse enough to avoid muddle. One paraphrase loop (“lotus-hearted ache” restated as “compassionate pang”) keeps it from 9-band. Clean grammar, strong verbs, high density.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fusion of medical-atrium stillness with war-zone cast-decryption feels fresh; coral-as-colony-metaphor for shared anxiety is non-obvious synthesis. Risk-taking in anesthetic time-fold pays off. If swapped to any relic or generic sea-shell the center cracks, proving irreplaceability. No close echoes.</comment>
