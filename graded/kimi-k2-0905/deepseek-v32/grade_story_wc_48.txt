<question>1</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Elian’s interiority is lyrical but abstract; “lucidly watchful” is asserted, never embodied in a micro-choice that costs him anything. The collected hopes weigh on him only as “solemn duty,” a label that never sharpens into contradiction or stakes. Closure feels sentimental rather than earned because the causal link between listening to the shell and solving the novel is skipped.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each cameo adds a textured hope-datum that thickens the mist. Orientation is swift; the nexus is named by word 50. Closure lands as Charged Poise—the swirl of hopes now inside the manuscript—but the cost is asserted (“weight of each collected shape”) rather than dramatized; we never see a live option foreclosed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>The mist is evoked with hush and damp rock, but it never constrains movement or endangers Elian; it’s atmospheric wallpaper. The spiral shell finally warms, a nice tactile reprise, yet its physical state never limits what he can do. Micro-setting (pocket, rock, desk) is clean and tracks; still, environment stays symbolic rather than instrumental.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade>
<comment>Stake—“collect shapes or the novel dies”—is declared early but never tested by obstruction; cameos offer no resistance, only gifts. No reversal or narrowing occurs; the only “tightening” is the abstract whisper of closing pages. Escalation is therefore flat; the soldier’s hope adds another datum, not a complication.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of art as witness to ephemeral hope emerges through pattern, not lecture. Final image of endless spiral reweights the shell from keepsake to archive of human yearning. A pseudo-moral (“he had mended his own hope”) intrudes in the last paragraph, blunting resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric voice is consistent, with nice rhythmic echo (“swirling hush” returns). Perceptual signature is thin—Elian notices hope-shapes, not sensory grit—but diction stays purposive and uncluttered. No head-hop, no register drift; voice holds under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Lines are clean, mostly loop-free; a few template cadences (“He… then he…”) appear mid-story. Figurative load is moderate and coherent. Momentum drifts only when hopes are summarized in successive near-repetitions, softening the beat before closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade>
<comment>“Collecting hope-ghosts in a mystical mist” flirts with familiar literary magic, but the focus on novelist’s block gives it a fresh vocational angle. Yet the cameos remain generic types (woman, child, old man, soldier) without individuated detail; risk is present but muted.</comment>
