<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elara’s trauma and artistic identity are credibly fused; the scorred ledger triggers a believable need to retrace. Interiority is concrete (“the world felt brittle”) and embodied, but the beat where she decides to cast the ledger into glass is summarized rather than dramatized, blurring micro-choice hierarchy. Still, her final stance of carrying the fragile slab out carries earned cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: frost → ledger → cave → glass slab, each image tightening the thematic density. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the fused slab reweights “pause” from trauma void to material legacy with visible cost (“fire-kissed and rough”). One transition (dawn to night walk) is legible, anchors stable; no orientation debt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Canyon, frost, and silica function as micro-settings that constrain choice: frost patterns literally reveal the ledger; cave silica supplies the final medium. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true (“smelling of ancient smoke”). The fused glass slab at the end is charged by these environmental particulars, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—find purpose in pauses—tightens when the ledger shifts the task from observation to making. Agency is present: nightly walks, kiln building, crucible gathering. Cost is felt via bodily risk and the irreversible destruction of the relic in molten glass. Could use one earlier obstacle that threatens the trek to deepen pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of “fragility as usable testimony” emerges through frost, scorched leather, and final glass slab without overt statement. The Conceptual Repricing lands when the charred notches become veins in translucent stone, refracting starlight—an unspoken answer to “purpose in the pause.” Avoids sermonizing; resonance is image-anchored.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person lyric remains close to Elara’s perceptual filter: glassmaker’s diction (“molten silica,” “crucible”) and nocturnal rhythm mirror her caution. No dialogue, so voice distinction not tested. Filter verbs are few; free-indirect glints (“she understood her own fractured journey”) are earned, not explanatory.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, and image-dense without metaphor pile-ups. Occasional elevated phrasing (“drifting resonance,” “luminous artist”) risks register drift but stays within lyrical covenant. No loops or paraphrase stacks; final kiln paragraph propels through tactile verbs (“gathered,” “purified,” “pulled”). Clean mechanics.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fusing smugglers’ ledger with clandestine glassmaking is fresh; using frost patterns as map reads inevitable after the fact. The risk of lyric summarization is mostly paid off by the concrete fused slab closure. Minimal overlap with familiar trauma-recovery arcs because the material transmutation is specific and irreversible.</comment>
