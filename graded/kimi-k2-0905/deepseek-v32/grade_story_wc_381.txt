<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The summoner’s single-minded calm is consistent but depth is limited; no interior contradiction surfaces while he works, so the “earned cost” registers only as ritual fatigue rather than personal change. His motivation is declared early and never questioned, so the emotional arc is flat. No secondary pressure or flaw complicates the hush-mapping; the task proceeds with competent serenity until the sphere dissolves. A stronger beat of resistance or self-doubt inside the flow would have sharpened the turn and raised the score.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Causal chain is coherent—wing on water → collects code → folds → sinks—and closure lands with a clear Earned Stasis: prophecy silenced, cost paid by wing’s dissolution and the summoner’s spent calm. Orientation anchors who/where arrive within the first 120 words, so the Q2 cap is avoided. However, escalation is linear rather than tightening; each mapping beat repeats the same level of threat without a spike that forecloses a live option. Still, the lens holds and the cost is visible on the final image, satisfying the 9− quick test floor.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Brook, fireflies, starlight, and damp earth are vividly filtered through the POV’s need for quiet; micro-setting (the wing on moving water) literally charts the conflict and thereby charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clean—kneel → release → drift → fold → sink—and sensory selection narrows to sight/touch as silence deepens. The nocturnal haven never feels generic because its details are repurposed as tools of the ritual. A fractional deduction for slight over-painting (“terrestrially cosmic” abstractions) keeps it just below the 8-band gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—prevent worldwide chaos by muting the prophecy—is signaled early and steadily pursued. Pressure is accumulative rather than spiking: each ripple absorbed incrementally deepens the hush but never forces a last-ditch choice or visible trade-off beyond fatigue. The final silence is satisfying but not sharpened by a sacrificed alternative; options do not narrow, they simply evaporate into the brook. A mid-ritual complication that threatened to expose or corrupt the summoner would have lifted the score into the 8+ band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme of “some knowledge must be left unmapped” emerges organically through the ritual’s quiet absorption rather than statement. The crane-wing’s transformation from tool to tomb quietly reweights the value of silence versus revelation. No moral is declared; the brook’s ongoing flow implies perpetual guardianship. Resonance is modest because the prophecy itself remains abstract, limiting conceptual repricing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Third-person POV stays tight to the summoner with clean psychic distance; perceptual signature favors hush, glow, and ripple imagery that suits his vocation. Syntax is lyrical but controlled, compressing time without confusing sequence. Occasional elevated phrases (“terrestrially cosmic”) slightly exceed the POV’s likely lexicon, creating minor register drift. Otherwise the voice is distinct and consistent through the climax.</comment>

<comment>Prose is rhythmically varied, with sentence length modulating to imitate water flow; figurative language is selective and rarely overwritten. No paraphrase loops or scaffold sentences; each line advances image, motion, or silence. Metaphors (fireflies as low stars, ripples of silenced sound) stay coherent and purposeful. Minor nominalizations (“traced paths that only silence could follow”) could be stronger verbs, but artifacts do not touch the closure.</comment>

<comment>“Mapping silence” with an origami crane on water feels fresh, combining origami ritual with cartographic magic. The prophecy-as-code-in-ripples offers an inventive visual grammar that sustains the piece. Although the lone mystic calming cosmic chaos is familiar, the specificity of method and object differentiates it. Greater personal risk or ethical ambiguity would have elevated the concept further.</comment>
