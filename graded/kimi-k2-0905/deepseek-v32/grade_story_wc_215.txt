<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is consistent—“tranquilly perceptive” governs every beat—but the text never lets contradictory impulses collide in scene; the arc is a smooth gradient from observation to action without a visible moment where motive is tested or falters. The ghosts’ instruction is accepted without resistance, so the final resolve feels preordained rather than earned under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the renewed oasis reconfigures meaning with undeniable conceptual cost—the recluse’s life is now bound to perpetual tending. Causality is lyric-accumulative rather than punch-counterpunch; each “contextual clue” beat tightens the covenant’s weight without a single reversal, sufficient for the inferred Accumulative/Textural lens. The stained-glass box is tracked cleanly from first mention to final glow, satisfying the persistent-constraint requirement for 9+ eligibility, though the mid-story orientation stays loose (who, when remain vaporous) keeping the score just sub-9.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The bleached hive frames, fractured glass colors, and lavender shoots are filtered through Elias’s beekeeper eye; sensory selection narrows to what can be coaxed back to life. The box’s luminous panels literally steer his final choice—setting as active constraint—meeting the 9+ gate. Only the timeline of the Event and the oasis’s exact geography stay hazy, preventing the top band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—“preserve the weight of unspoken words”—is signaled early and deepens as each revived bloom makes the covenant’s silence heavier. Agency is present (watering, hive alignment) but pressure stays tonal; no moment forecloses an alternate path or exacts a visible price from Elias beyond indefinite labor. The ghosts’ fade supplies a soft victory without a corresponding loss on the page, capping escalation below the 8.8 tier.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: legacy is not archival but horticultural—silence grows only if tended. The stained-glass box reprises as a non-literal answer, its colors now echoing living lavender rather than fractured promises. No moral is stated; the final image reweights all prior ghost-gazing as seed-time rather than mourning, achieving resonance without abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person psychic distance stays tight to Elias’s calm, pollen-dusted perception; syntax is unhurried, mirroring steady irrigation rhythm. Lexis is beekeeper-specific (“hive alignment,” “bloom cycles”) without showiness. No head-hop or register drift; the lyric repetition of “mute eloquence” is pattern-taught early and paid off in the final line, meriting high-band consideration.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean—every sentence advances image or stakes; no paraphrase loops or scaffold. Figurative load is light and consistent (“green memory,” “tangible echo”) without metaphor pile-ups during the climax. Occasional elevated diction (“mute eloquence,” “conceptual repricing”) fits the meditative register and does not obscure causality, keeping artifacts below the 9+ disqualifier threshold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Post-apocalyptic beekeeping with visible regret-ghosts is fresh, yet the narrative route—loner redeems land through ancient covenant—follows familiar eco-pastoral chords. Specificity of beekeeping gesture (frame alignment, bloom-cycle decoding) transforms the trope sufficiently to feel memorable rather than borrowed. The risk is moderate, the payoff coherent, landing in the strong tier.</comment>
