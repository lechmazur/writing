<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied—breath-burn, frost-forming sting, tremor stakes. Contradictory impulses (fear vs. wish for wholeness) run together in the same beats, not in summary. Micro-choices (hold breath, steady quill, decide when to exhale) visibly foreclose failure and cost her lungs. One slip: “reminders of failure” edges diagnostic; keeps it under 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: because she fears the tremor → holds breath → ink obeys → scars rewrite → exhale releases new identity. Orientation anchored by word 60; no penalty. One meaningful tightening: storm winds return the instant she exhales—external clock ratifies internal change. Closure is Charged Poise: crystal runes gleam, cost is the spent breath and dulled quill; path to old self is foreclosed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Platform, body, and quill operate as micro-setting: the levitating stone demands absolute stillness, turning breath-hold from superstition into physical necessity. Moonstone-tear ink and storm timing supply concrete rules learned through action. Silver-veined stone and frost-flower runes are re-used, not catalogued. Final image re-uses the “saturated hush” now interiorized on her skin—setting charges closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—turn scars into living narrative or lose nerve—signalled in second paragraph. Escalation is purely causal under breath constraint: each second of held lung narrows options until crystallization locks. No antagonist needed; ink’s stress-glass physics is the opponent. Visible price: dulled quill, burning lungs, storm resumption—options reweighted.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges: stories are not erase-and-replace but alchemize pain into readable light. Superstition motif returns reweighted—childhood ghost-ward becomes adult focus-ward. No moralizing; final peace is an image, not a lesson. Ambiguity lingers: crystal is beautiful yet brittle, hinting future fragility.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Elara’s pulse and perceptual filter—crow secrets, moonstone chill, thunder hush. Rhythm compresses under breath-hold, then loosens on exhale—syntax mimics physiology. No head-hop; diction stays within rune-scholar lexicon without pedantry. Voice feels singular, not stitched.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Sentences pull double duty—e.g., “solution that crystallized when stressed” embeds stakes inside object description. Figurative layer is restrained to two extended metaphors (breath between storms, frost flowers); neither muddles causality. Zero paraphrase loops, clean pronoun tracking. Only hairline slip: “world’s magic settled like dust” is stock simile, but it sits early and doesn’t recur at climax.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Takes the trope of magical tattoo/scar-marking and makes the medium breath, not blade—fresh. Crystallization physics plus childhood superstition synthesize into credible ritual. Platform-as-lab and ink-as-memory-device are particular to this world. Risky choice—no dialogue, single micro-scene—pays off by letting hush itself become character.</comment>
