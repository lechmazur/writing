<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elara’s longing for “the rhythm of belonging” is vivid, but her interiority drifts into poetic shorthand (“softly ingenious adjustment”) rather than concrete micro-choices. The feather prompts theory, not action; her final insight is declared, not dramatized through a cost-carrying decision. Relationship with Kael is ornamental—no status shift or mutual pressure. Earned stasis is hinted but not paid for on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the feather reframed from ash to seed, reweighting belonging as syncopation, not place. Causality is lyric-accumulative; the bloom’s arrival is coincidence, not consequence, but the final image crystallizes cost under sea-light. Orientation anchors within 120 w. One soft reset: the anonymous arrival of the feather is never revisited or paid for. Lens holds; lens ambiguity waived because closure is legible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Deep-sea city is sketched with disciplined selectivity: “pressure-black depths,” “bioluminescent algae smeared blue ghosts.” Glass wall and desk-feather function as micro-settings that constrain attention and later reconfigure meaning. Spatial choreography clean; no encyclopedic dumps. The bloom is sensory payoff that also reweights the thematic stake. Could edge higher if environment physically impeded or enabled a final micro-choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—belonging—signaled early; pressure tightens via cosmic/sea correlation quest, not external jeopardy. The bloom arrival is observational lift, not agency-forced reversal; no option is foreclosed or price paid. Escalation is textural: density of light in dark, not narrowing options. Serviceable for lyric mode but lacks visible cost or tactic shift.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through image pattern: ash ↔ seed, drowned city ↔ transformed home. Subtext resides in shared exhale syncing with bloom—belonging as attunement, not possession. Final image reweights premise without moralizing. Slight sentimentality in “rhythm of belonging” phrase, but ambiguity remains fertile.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited sustains consistent perceptual signature: starfalls mapped onto fault lines, “carbonized void.” Syntax flexes with pressure—long breathy clauses calm, short pulses at bloom ignition. No dialogue to test voice distinction; interior diction stays within astrologer lexicon. Filter verbs minimal and voice-motivated.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Rhythm varies; paragraph breath matches emotional swell. No scaffold loops or synonym churn; “softly ingenious” is the only near-repeat. Metaphors disciplined: “forest of gloom,” “dazzling storm.” Opening line anchors voice; final line seeds closure. Minor register lift—“conceptual repricing,” “syncopated beat”—but fits POV. Clean grammar, tense, pronoun track.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Landscape astrology + drowned city yields fresh conceptual splice; feather as cosmic trace-to-bloom seed is non-obvious synthesis. Tropes (underwater ruin, biolum bloom) are re-animated through star-chart causality. Risk: lyric coincidence bloom could feel convenient, but image reweights theme. Specificity keeps it from devolving to prompt checklist.</comment>
