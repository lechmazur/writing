<comment>Elara’s “find lost things” attribute is not a label—it bites her when she draws the naiad’s agony into her own body and feeds the Blightseed that same frozen confession. The interior contradiction between serene resolve and internal hurricane is dramatized in one continuous embodied beat. Cost is visible: ash on her palm, spark cradled at the end. Minor slip: “warlike serenity” is named twice rather than shown through fresh gesture.  </comment>

<comment>Causal chain holds: failed ritual → vortex → spiral penetration → ice confession → seed fed truth → collapse. Closure is a Decisive Change with felt cost—the lake still, the druid scarred, naiad spark fragile. Orientation clean within 120 words. One micro-template repetition (“the time for…”) nicks perfection but does not touch the final image.  </comment>

<comment>The vertical liquid forest and ice pillar function as micro-setting that literally steer tactics—she spirals inward because the current geometry demands it. Sensory hierarchy obeys crisis: snapping branches, biting roots, ash taste. No weather clichés; “shuddering shore” is the only borderline phrase. Tool-as-setting (staff glow) constrains visibility and timing.  </comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—“discover what mirrors don’t show”—is signaled early and paid off when reflective ice shatters to reveal planted malice. Escalation is radial: each concentric circle narrows physical options and deepens knowledge. Protagonist agency drives every turn; coincidence absent. Persistent constraint: seed grafts to her palm, forcing the lethal feeding choice.  </comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through image pattern: reflection (lake surface, ice mirror) vs. refraction (vortex, spiral path). Final sky-mirror reconfigures meaning—surface now empty, depth reclaimed. No moralizing; insight is earned via corporeal cost. One abstract noun cluster (“conceptual repricing”) leaks through but is grounded by ash residue.  </comment>

<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Elara’s perceptual signature—she clocks geography by druidic function (root, current, seed). Syntax lengthens under calm, fractures during seed contact: “It convulsed, blackened, crumbled.” No head-hopping; psychic distance controlled. Distinctive without mannerism.  </comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>High information density: one sentence often does setting work + emotional filter + causal push (“She did not swim against the flow, but let it carry her in a spiral, unbending the path where she could”). Figurative language is selective; mixed-metaphor risk avoided. One paraphrase loop (“the time for tricks… the time for resolve”) costs 0.2. Otherwise propulsive.  </comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Mythic trope—naiad in ice, cursed lake—is retooled through anti-reflective metaphysics and radial ingress tactic. “Feeding a seed the truth it cannot digest” feels non-obvious and inevitable in hindsight. Risk: vertical orchard vortex could read gimmick, but anatomical detail grounds it. Specificity of druidic lost-finder gift lifts material above eco-fantasy template.  </comment>
