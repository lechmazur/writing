<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elara’s stillness and micro-choices (uncorking vial, hovering spark) physically manifest patience, earning the final fusion. Interiority stays concrete, but the heartbeat-as-map motive is stated more than dramatized, and no contradictory impulse tests her resolve under pressure. The sealed map costs her nothing personally; endurance is shown, yet stakes feel external. Voice remains singular; no dialogue or secondary character to pressure her.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The accumulative/textural pattern is taught early—discard sigil, starlight ink—and lands a Charged Poise closure: the flash-fusion permanently reweights the orchard’s silence into artifact. Causality is lyric but coherent; each placed fragment thickens density until the spark precipitates the binding. Orientation is swift; place, time, and POV are anchored within 50 words. Only minor loop: “pattern neared completion” restates prior detail without new pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Frozen orchard, blue vials, and copper plate constrain every motion; cold dictates slow choreography, starlight supplies the only workable ink. Sensory triage is POV-filtered—frost-rimed soil, silent white burst—integrated into action rather than catalogued. Spatial track is clean; no floating objects. The etched copper charges the final image, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve the orchard’s pulse—signaled in paragraph two and deepens via each placed shard. Escalation is textural: density of sigil + starlight until only the flash-seal can fix it. No active opposition or price to Elara beyond time; risk remains conceptual, not visceral. Sufficient for this length under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly: memory as cartography, loss made legible through patient attention. No statements of meaning; final gleam on copper offers Conceptual Repricing—silence now holds a readable heartbeat. Motif of “discarded” reappears in shards and nails, accrues weight without overt symbolizing. Resists moral, invites contemplation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person POV stays tight to Elara’s perceptual filter—selective attention to frost, etched trees, flash-paper curl—no head-hop. Syntax slows to long clauses during placement, then fragments at ignition; rhythm mirrors patience → flash transition. Diction stays within alchemical lexicon; no register drift. Distinctive voice texture sustains throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sentences carry dual duty: “She lifted a warped apple branch… tracing its contours” shows action + cold + motive in one stroke. Figurative control disciplined—“white-hot burst” is the only overt flourish at climax, justified. No paraphrase loops; one tiny scaffold “the pattern neared completion” could trim. Read-aloud rhythm varies; strong propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Flash-paper alchemist charting heartbeats via refuse-sigils is fresh synthesis; not a stock trope. Starlight bottled in blue vials feels specific to this world. Concept follows its rules: patience as physical force, cartography of silence. Risk is quiet but coherent; no late gimmicks. Transformation test passes—story disintegrates if vocation or starlight removed.</comment>
