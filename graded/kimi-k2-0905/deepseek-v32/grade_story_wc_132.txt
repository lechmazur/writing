<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Elara’s interiority is concrete—her “clenching and unclenching” hands, the shift from “grim precision” to “exhausted defiance”—and her micro-choice to dismantle her own cedar trellis visibly costs her pride. The contradiction between control-seeking botanist and facilitator-of-chaos is held in scene, not lectured. One hairline slip: “circuitously sincere” is named, not dramatized, in the customer beat. Still, her final stance crystallizes with felt cost, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>

<comment>Causal lens holds throughout: storm → wreck → rigid rebuild → living weave → new resilience. The linden leaf acts as both pivot and price, its placement on the ruin forcing the reversal that forecloses the cedar solution. Closure is a Charged Poise: the customer receives the leaf, replicating Elara’s own reconfiguration, with conceptual cost legible in the whispered apology and the visible “history of breakage integrated.” No orientation debt; every beat advances because/therefore logic.</comment>

<comment>The mossy trellis after rain is not backdrop but tool: its fragility triggers the entire causal chain, its rebuilt woven form constrains the final image. Sensory hierarchy is botanist-specific—xylem/phloem vocabulary, scentless cedar, “green logic of growth”—filtering every detail through Elara’s professional eye. Weather is causal, not decorative: each storm narrows options and rewrites tactics. Micro-setting (the leaf, the cedar posts, the willow whips) is handled tactilely, charging the closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—can the wisteria survive without forcing human order—tightens once: the cedar trellis solution is actively dismantled after the leaf’s intervention, foreclosing the “correct” path. Cost is unmistakable: Elara’s surrender of control leaves the nursery visibly vulnerable to the next storm, a price she names aloud to the customer. Escalation is driven solely by her agency; no coincidence rescues. The single deepening is sufficient for this length and lands with felt weight.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the reversal of horticultural control: release as reconstruction. The linden leaf’s reprise reweights the entire metaphor—support must be living, not rigid—without moralizing. Subtext resides in gesture (handing the leaf) rather than thesis. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer: the woven trellis’s visible scars integrated into new growth, inviting reflection on human resilience.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elara’s perceptual signature—botanical diction, rain-smell, cedar scent, “green logic”—with no head-hop. Psychic distance compresses under stress: short, declarative clauses during dismantling mimic exhausted defiance. The free-indirect “she whispered apologies” keeps voice intact while admitting vulnerability. No dialogue contamination; the single customer line is filtered through Elara’s interpretive bias.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with scene tempo: longer sentences for observation, staccato fragments during storm repair. Figurative language is plant-specific and sparse—“splintered history,” “weeping vines”—never overwrought. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances knowledge or image. One minor scaffold: “circuitously sincere” is reused verbatim; −0.2 for template cadence, but it does not touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The core trope—storm-wrecked garden as emotional crucible—is refreshed by the inversion: rebuilding via dismantling control. The living-willow scaffold is specific, not ornamental; its pliability becomes the story’s rule-set. Risk is taken in the quiet, anti-heroic climax—no triumphant arbor reveal, only a leaf passed on—yet coherence remains. Specificity of botanist’s gaze and the irreversible choice to leave breakage visible elevate the piece above garden-variety recovery arcs.</comment>
