<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Leo’s quiet obsession is rendered with calm, embodied micro-choices (pocketing the shard; kneeling in clover). The final interior shift—“his own heart felt sanctified, displaced no more”—is earned, but the self-blessing arrives in a single, slightly abstract beat rather than a visible trade-off; cost is felt but not dramatized. Still, contradictory impulses (wonder vs. self-doubt) stay alive in scene, keeping the arc credible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The orris root as inciting lure → circle ritual → corporeal “shard of hush” crystallizes a clean causal chain under a lyric lens; closure is Renant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the bay’s lullaby reweights the premise. Cost is legible: Leo recognizes his own house’s potential and surrenders the objects, accepting an open-ended guardianship. Orientation locked by word 80; no prop or lens drift; because/therefore linkage holds.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Bay-salt air, hesitant streetlight glow, and the clover patch are filtered through Leo’s “slow-changes” gaze; every sensory pick is purposeful. The orris-root scent constrains his ritual choice and charges the final image, satisfying 9+ gate. Spatial clarity is maintained across the single lawn location.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</question><comment>Dominant stake—can attention sanctify a living house?—tightens once when the circle births the shard; option is not narrowed externally but internally re-configured. Escalation is accumulative: density of found objects and rising violet scent intensify until the visible silence manifests. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral, limiting upper band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</question><comment>Theme of inadvertent sanctity emerges through concrete pattern—displaced objects → held silence—without authorial commentary. Final bay-whisper image reweights “hush” from absence to sacred repository, achieving non-literal resonance. No late moralizing; ambiguity lingers about whether the aliveness is projection or spirit.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Leo’s perceptual filter: “streetlights daydream,” “windows…watched the bay with gentle awareness.” Syntax lengthens in calmer beats, fragments under wonder, showing rhythmic control. No dialogue to test; no POV drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</question><comment>Strong informational density: one sentence can compass scent, light, and metaphysics without pausing. Metaphors stay coherent—no mixed vehicles. Occasional poetic elevation (“hushed blaze,” “endless, gentle lullaby”) borders on overwriting but remains in character; no loops or scaffold detected. Final third kept clean.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</question><comment>Concept of “shard of hush” as palpable quiet is fresh and non-obvious; transforms familiar trope of haunted/alive house into contemplative ecology of lost objects. Risky lyric compression is sustained without clarity loss. Specific detail (orris-root wedge) prevents concept from drifting into abstraction.</comment>
