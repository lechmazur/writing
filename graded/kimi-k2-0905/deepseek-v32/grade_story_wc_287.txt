<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Aris’s quietly stubborn motive is concrete from the first paragraph and drives every micro-choice; the embodied “steady, dipping, forward-pressing motion” while polishing mirrors shows felt cost. Interiority stays specific, avoiding label-speak. The final stance—tending a “fleeting garden of reflections”—is earned by prior因果, with visible renunciation of seed-time for mirror-time. No contradictory impulses are staged simultaneously, so the arc is slightly tidy, keeping it under 8.8.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the master-mirror push reframes dark corners into “finally seen” vulnerability, reweighting the premise with undeniable conceptual cost. Causal chain holds: petal-fall → gauge gift → mirror array → light river, each step narrowing options. Orientation anchors by line 6; no disorientation serves the image, so no penalty. One persistent constraint—theGauge’s precise “tooth” dictating mirror angles—shapes tactics through the climax.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Harbor moonlight functions as both macro-setting and micro-resource: its angle determines mirror placement, directly constraining the final alignment. Iron-grating, tin-can holders, and “rusted railings” are tactile and POV-filtered. Spatial choreography across the multi-location install remains coherent. Environment charges the ending image, meeting the 9+ gate, but density thins slightly during alley montage.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“reflect light into dark corners”—is signaled early and tightens once: rose path foreclosed, mirror path chosen. Protagonist agency drives each beat; no coincidence resolves. Cost is visible in scraped hands and forfeited sleep implied by “night after night.” Escalation is single-wave rather than multi-turn, sufficient for 600-word scope but limiting upper band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through image pattern: petal → mirror beam, both “silent petals of light.” No explicit thesis; final reconfiguration invites reflection on attention versus possession. Subtext in Hal’s grumbled gift shows legacy passing without sentimentality. Ambiguity remains—“darkness felt not chased away, but finally seen”—avoiding tidy moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays welded to Aris’s perceptual filter: “vast, silver-black plate waiting” is her metaphor, not authorial. Rhythm modulates from languid petal fall to staccato “cut, polish, set, adjust,” mirroring effort. No head-hopping; Hal’s interior is opaque. Free-indirect diction—“wistfully pragmatic acceptance”—is consistent and purposeful.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm breathes: long sentence for petal spiral, short imperative beats for craft. No synonym loops; “light” recurs but accrues new weight. Mixed metaphor risk in “river of cold light” is saved by sustained aqueous motif tied to harbor. One filter-verb cluster (“seemed to beckon, seemed to tremble”) slightly dulls immediacy, keeping below 9.0.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fire-escape gardener who engineers moonlight plumbing is highly specific; vocational detail (bitting gauge as mirror jig) transforms lock tech into optic poetry. Synthesis of rose-petal ephemerality with DIY urban intervention feels inevitable in hindsight. No recognizable trope echo. Risk in lyric escalation pays off without obscuring causality, meriting bonus +0.3 within band.</comment>
