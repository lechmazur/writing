<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Marta’s interiority is concrete—hands on ash, gouge channeling ache—yet the “hauntingly practical” label is self-diagnosed twice without embodied contradiction. The endurance of carving earns cost, but the promised contradiction inside “lion-tamer’s widow” never surfaces; she feels calibrated, not volatile. Still, micro-choices (hollowing to “make room,” not to imprison) track consistent values under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: each shaving thickens the sediment of years until the final Charged Poise (“a lid for a void”) reweights grief. Orientation anchored by word 60; kettle clock tightens the single scene. Closure carries undeniable conceptual cost—the carving now demands future labor, foreclosing amnesia—fulfilling the 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Rain-beaded skylight and ash blank evolve from backdrop to constraint: rain sets heartbeat tempo, wood’s scent marks time passage. Loft’s negative space (“where a body might have leaned”) directly charges the final image. Micro-setting (gouge, kettle, steam) alters tactics—she stops when whistle pierces, not when emotion “feels” done. Tool-as-setting meets 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—can she contain grief without being drowned—signaled early. Single meaningful tightening: channel deepens, option to flee the loft is foregone; cost is visible wood shavings and future obligation to keep carving. Agency remains carving/not-carving; no external antagonist needed. Price is legible but not yet viscerally painful, capping entry to high 7s.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme of “containment as continuance” emerges through sedimentary repetition, never named. Final image reconfigures the blank from absence to vessel without moralizing. Subtext in tool pauses, steam, and inverted rain-bead worlds implies grief’s scale without therapeutic labels. One hairline slip: “harvest lessons from loss” is prompt-echo thematic statement mid-text (−0.2).</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person hovers at intimate distance; perceptual signature filters every detail through tactile wood knowledge and rain metrics. Rhythm modulates—long sentences for memory silt, fragments at whistle. No head-hopping; psychic distance clean. Lyric compression (“ghost limb she kept trying to feel”) is taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Syntactic variety and read-aloud rhythm strong; sentences double-load time and sensation. Figurative control sustained—only one mixed metaphor (“rust-hued peace” beside “fractured silver”) does not dull closure. Zero loops or filler stacks. Information density high; each shaving sentence also advances grief sediment. Meets 9+ technical bar but one stray metaphor caps at 8.6.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Widow-carves-grief risks cliché, yet lion-tamer backstory and “negative space container” give fresh angle. Risk taken: entire plot is refusal to carve lions, turning absence into usable vessel. Specificity of ash scent and kettle clock prevents swap-out. Not earth-shaking novelty but executed with non-obvious synthesis that feels inevitable after final image.</comment>
