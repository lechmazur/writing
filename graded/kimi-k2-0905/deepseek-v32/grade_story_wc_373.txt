<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elara’s curiosity is steadily dramatized through micro-choices—slipping the recorder into her coat, risking the fob, stepping toward the throne—each tethered to the filial stake. Interiority stays concrete (“felt warm in her palm,” “felt in her teeth”) without label-speak. The final stance crystallizes: she owns both the recorded betrayal and the hush’s value, a credible renunciation of further exposure. Yet the father remains off-stage; the emotional cost is intellectualized rather than embodied in a relationship beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: because she needs the sound, she barters the fob; because the fob is hostage, her fate couples to the captain’s betrayal; because the young pirate exhales, she captures the sound and exits. Orientation lands by line 7; no teleporting props. Closure—Charged Poise—reconfigures the hush’s weight and her complicity. The watch fob is returned without visible price to her, softening the final cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The pier, cavern, and figurehead throne are sketched with sensory economy; lantern light on barnacles and salt-stained planks ground the space. The fob and fishing-net curtain act as micro-settings that constrain hiding and exchange. Spatial choreography stays clean across three zones. Environment never actively alters tactics beyond providing concealment, keeping the score sub-8.8.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—capture trust breaking to save father—remains singular and tight. Escalation tightens once: the fob as collateral couples Elara’s safety to the captain’s plot, turning observation into personal risk. The resigned exhalation is a visceral, small-scale cost that reweights the hush. No further narrowing or tactical loss occurs, so pressure plateaus just above the 8-band threshold.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly: silence is currency, and recording its fracture buys freedom while cheapening the recorder’s own integrity. No moralizing final line. The fob’s return without penalty slightly blunts the thematic bite—she gains knowledge but forfeits little, leaving ambiguity rather than earned irony.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-limited stays locked to Elara; perceptual signature favors haptic detail (warm silver, salt-stained planks, tension “in her teeth”). Syntax remains controlled, with purposeful compression—“the comforting unease settled in her bones”—that teaches the mood early. No head-hopping or register drift. Dialogue is sparse but idiom-apt when present.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no filter-verb stacks or loops. Mixed-metaphor risk—“tension was a living thing” beside “thick silence”—remains coherent within the POV’s sensorium. Occasional elevated diction (“acoustic oddities,” “conceptual repricing”) fits the collector frame. Zero scaffolding or paraphrase clutter; momentum sustains.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The “sound of trust breaking” as a non-visual MacGuffin inside a silent pirate market is a fresh synthesis; the exhalation payoff feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Tropes—moonshine child, pirate king, antique token—are retooled through acoustic stakes and enforced hush. Risk taken with near-plotless observation pays off via Charged Poise. Could edge higher with a sharper personal cost.</comment>
