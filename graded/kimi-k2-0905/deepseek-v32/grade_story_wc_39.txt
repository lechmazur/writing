<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Arlo’s fixation on “translator between generations” is vivid, but his contradictory impulse—hoarding sounds yet needing to share them—stays summary. The honey-thyme act is concrete; still, interiority leans on lyric label (“wistful energy”) rather than embodied cost. Closure rings as Earned Stasis: he forfeits onward wandering, but the price is asserted, not dramatized in body or resource. Voice specificity and micro-choices are strong enough for high-band, yet the final beat needs one tangible forfeiture (cold, hunger, isolation) to vault higher.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of jar-gathering intensifies via the shanty “word” he’s missing. Orientation clean by 120 words; causality is lyrical accumulation rather than because/therefore chain. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—his stance crystallizes from collector to composer—cost is conceptual (lifetime custodianship) and felt through “luminous choir.” One minor slack: the syrup trick works on first try; a grittier resistance could tighten escalation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Driftwood loft, wind-cracks, honey scent—details filter through Arlo’s sound-hunter bias and guide tactile choices (which jar, which note). The music box’s mother-of-pearl “blind eye” recharges at closure when he becomes its new lens. Environment literally supplies the stakes: if dunes collapse, jars shatter. Micro-setting (crate-table, tide breath) constrains every move; no caps triggered.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—salvage ancestral voice before sea/silence—tightens once the complete shanty surfaces; options narrow to perpetual archiving. Agency is accumulative: each jar seals a lost phoneme, foreclosing nomad freedom. Visible price asserted (“stay here… translator in his sandy cathedral”) but not yet corporally felt. Sufficient tightening for 8-band; need bodily cost or external jeopardy to breach 8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of memory-as-currency emerges through sound-trading, never named outright. Final image of “preserved time” reframes earlier penny-poet motif with conceptual repricing. Subtext whispers that archiving can become its own exile—plausible counter-reading keeps complexity. No moralizing; resonance lingers in glowing glass choir.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lyric third-person stays close to Arlo’s sensory register: “sharp, thin note of light,” “gritty, reluctant shudder.” Syntax lengthens during syrup drip, shortens at tinkle climax—rhythmic control under pressure. No head-hop; diction never exceeds vagrant poet lexicon. Distinct perceptual signature with taught pattern of glass/cork imagery paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density: waxed cork, pickled-onion jar, marram grass—each noun earns double duty. Only micro-loop: “He had jars… He had jars…” restates inventory without new pressure. Mixed metaphors avoided; vehicles stay coastal. Final paragraph’s cadence slows to match breath-held dunes—propulsion intact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sound-in-jars as memory-currency fuses fresh magic with believable scavenger tech. Honey-thyme lubricant re-enchants rusted mechanism—organic specificity, not quirk for show. Risk in quiet accumulation pays off when shanty reconstitutes across separate vessels. Transformation feels inevitable in hindsight; no close echoes.</comment>
