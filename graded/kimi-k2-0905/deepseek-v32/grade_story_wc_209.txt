<comment>Elara’s curiosity about night-blooming flowers is vividly anchored in inherited postcards and embodied through paint-mixing and cathedral study; however, her interior contradiction is summarized (“she understood that flowers bloom at night to offer solace”) rather than dramatized in a moment of costly choice, so the arc feels observed not tested.</comment>

<comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: each shard adds postcard/cathedral gloss until the mural synthesizes them; closure lands with CR (“some questions are answered not with words, but with color and light”) that reweights the premise. Orientation clean by 120 words, one soft transition (pavilion→cathedral→pavilion), cost legible as inherited grief turned into finished artwork.</comment>

<comment>Amber glass filtering “honeyed light,” etched cathedral panes, and receding snow are selective and return in the final mural image; the pavilion’s light directly constrains palette choices, meeting the 9+ gate. Sensory economy prevails—no tourist catalog—though spatial choreography inside the cathedral is skimmed.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—unlock the flowers’ secret—signaled early; pressure deepens via each postcard and cathedral layer, tightening knowledge rather than external threat. The final conceptual reweighting feels earned, but no visible price (time, paint, bodily fatigue) is shown on-page, keeping escalation lyrical rather than visceral.</comment>

<comment>Theme—“beauty unfolds in darkness”—emerges through layered glass and night blooms, never sermonized. The grandmother’s grief remains subtextual, re-priced in the closing image of glowing painted flowers, inviting counter-readings about art as consolation versus denial.</comment>

<comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Elara’s perceptual filter: paint viscosity, color temperature, cathedral refraction. Rhythm modulates with long cadences for hush, shorter beats for dawning light; no head-hopping or register drift. Voice distinctiveness plateau’s below 9.0 because syntax rarely surprises under peak pressure.</comment>

<comment>Prose is clean, vivid, loop-free; figurative language (“umbral tenderness,” “thirsty ground”) is spare and purposeful. One scaffold trace: “dawning hush” is repeated four times without new inflection—minor drag. Otherwise high density and varied rhythm support momentum.</comment>

<grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Night-bloom quest through painted mural and cathedral glass offers fresh synthesis; postcard relics repurposed as both reference and relic avoid cliché. Conceptual risk is moderate—quiet lyric closure—yet specificity of amber light and pigment mixing keeps it memorable.</comment>
