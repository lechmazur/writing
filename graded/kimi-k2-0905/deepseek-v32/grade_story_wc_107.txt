<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid—"she feared, her own" thaw—and embodied in breath, drip, tool-cool. The bookmark as emotional scar anchors contradictory impulses: preserve vs. let warp. Micro-choice to cool tool in dripwater crystallizes shift; cost is the ruined talisman. Flaw: narrated emotion occasionally flirts with label-speak ("an inner shift") but immediately re-grounds in glass action.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: letting the bookmark distort reweights her entire craft from frozen perfection to flawed acceptance. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each drip, ping, and reheat thickens pattern until the final tool-cool ruptures it. One coherent scene; anchors clear by 50 words. Cost legible in the warped bookmark and teardrop inclusion.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Cathedral of dead monitors, drip onto cracked leather, slushy exit light—selective, tactile. Micro-setting (bookmark) constrains final choice; environment supplies literal thawwater that patterns glass. Sensory hierarchy obeys glassblower priorities: heat, breath, drip-weight. Spatial choreography clean; no clutter.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: craft safe zones vs. need to accept imperfection. Pressure tightens when drip threatens pristine bookmark; she chooses ruin to seed new aesthetic. One meaningful turn under Accumulative lens—no reversals needed. Cost is the lost talisman and altered technique; visible on page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through glass process: perfectionism abandoned via material thaw. Bookmark and teardrop reconfigure meaning without exposition. No explicit moral; final image of "heart melting, then refrozen" invites lingering ambiguity. Avoids sentimentality by anchoring insight in tactile act.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Elara’s perceptual filter—tool weight, furnace glare. Distinct glassblower idiom ("gather," "pontil," "thermal stress") woven without glossary. Compression taught early ("commune with the primordial flame") and paid off in stripped final line. Rhythm modulates: incantatory narration collapses into quiet "Let it be warped."</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm varied; no template cadence. High density—single sentences fuse breath, tool, emotion. Mixed-metaphor risk at "cathedral of silence" but justified by echoing hush. Zero loops or scaffold; no artifacts in final third.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fusion of glassblowing manual and thawing Arctic station feels inevitable, not grafted. Bookmark-as-flawed-template and thawwater-as-tool are non-obvious syntheses. Risky lyric narration stays coherent. Could swap setting only with major rewrite—freshness sticks.</comment>
