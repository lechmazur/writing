<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Leo’s “weightless burden” is a vivid, embodied contradiction that stays active; his micro-choices (dust study, ceiling probe, reassembly) all spring from the ghost-seeing trait. The final acceptance of purpose is credible because every beat has shown him cataloguing the unseen. Interiority is concrete, never diagnostic. No secondary character on page, so no status crucible, but solo arc is complete.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: ghost hint → dust pattern → barrel discovery → ceiling compartment → mechanism repair → ghost release. Closure is a clean Decisive Change: Leo reweights his burden from curse to vocation, cost is the lifelong guardianship he now knowingly embraces. Orientation anchored by 120 words; no ambiguity. One meaningful tightening when the loose tile forecloses the option of walking away.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Derelict ticket office is rendered through technician’s eyes—peeling paint as “old bandages,” fluorescent buzz that times the ghost’s arrival. Dust patterns function as readable text, guiding movement; the ceiling cavity becomes the decisive micro-arena. Tool-as-setting (mainspring barrel) constrains the final mechanical fix. All sensory picks are filtered by Leo’s professional attention, no tourist catalog.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“will Leo free the ghost and accept his sight’s cost?”—is signaled early and tightened once: the out-of-place tile forces the choice to engage or retreat. Price is visible: he seals the compartment, assuming perpetual custodianship. No reversals needed; one credible escalation suffices. Agency drives every turn; coincidence merely whispers.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme of “seeing as silent responsibility” emerges via dust, cracks, and clockwork—no explicit thesis. Final image reweights the childhood memory: the sorrowful eyes are now his own reflected in elevator chrome. Ambiguity remains—he is both liberator and perpetual witness—without moral tagline. Subtext in ghost’s rust-paper voice implies time itself is broken and nursed by humble keepers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Voice is hushed, methodical, slightly melancholy—syntax lengthens during observation, shortens under ghost proximity. Perceptual signature centers on mechanical detail and air-pressure shifts, never drifting into generic spookiness. No dialogue until the single necessary exchange; diction stays within a repairman’s lexicon. Rhythm swells then subsides with the fluorescent buzz, teaching the pattern early.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, free of loops or scaffold. Figurative language is sparse and precise (“buzz died like angry insects”). Information density high: one sentence often layers dust data, ghost cue, and emotional tint. No mixed metaphors or register drift. Opening and closing lines perform mirror work without flourish.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Ghost-seeing repairman is familiar, but pairing with horological circus elevator and dust-grain forensics feels fresh. Synthesis turns trope into memory-keeper myth. Specificity of the mainspring barrel and ceiling conveyor provides irreplaceable mechanism. Could edge higher with sharper risk, yet avoids gimmickry and lands honestly.</comment>
