<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara’s “carefully resourceful” trait is dramatized through concrete micro-choices—cord-and-globe pulley, dialect renegotiation, fungus-mirror steps—each with visible cost, showing competence balanced by real constraint. Interiority stays specific to her perceptual lens (glyph fingertips, diary cross-referencing) without therapy-speak. Final renunciation—silence as library—earns its emotional price via prior causal chain, satisfying earned stasis. Minor: flicker of label-speak “weight of it settle” could be more embodied.</question>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the library is a state of silence, reweighting all prior “unheard symphony” imagery with undeniable ontological cost. Causal lattice holds—each beat (diary → vine route → dialect chant → fungus gait) is a because/therefore link under the rescue drive; no teleporting props. Orientation anchored by 120 words; transitions legible across four shards that cohere under accumulative lens. Persistent constraint: moss instability returns to shape final quiet.</question>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mountain-bookstore is no backdrop; shelves retract, languages bloom, stone wall dissolves only when true fungal name is spoken—environment actively gatekeeps choices. Micro-setting (botanical diary, chronostatic fungus) functions as tool and terrain, constraining tactics and charging final image. Sensory hierarchy follows Elara’s arcane bias: semantic tremor in wood, taste of temporal syrup, hush of unlearned silence. Spatial choreography clean acrossfolding corridors; no impossible positions.</question>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—Kael’s rescue—tightens into secondary quest for Library; each obstacle forecloses prior option (retracted bridge, collapsing void, loop trap) with visible price (cord sacrifice, dialect risk, stamina flicker). Escalation driven by Elara’s successive diary deductions; coincidence only complicates. Final silence is not escape but deeper commitment to unheard knowledge, crystallizing stakes rather than dissipating them. One meaningful deepening suffices; cost legible in Kael’s shaken form and Elara’s quietude.</question>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: knowledge as living, symbiotic, and ethically owed—yet inevitably silenced by history. Subtext carried in fungal imagery, diary palimpsest, and final unsounded library; no character moralizes. Return of “unheard symphony” reweighted into earned quietude offers resonant non-literal answer. Avoids tidy binary of success/failure; instead posits responsibility to listen to what civilization refuses to learn.</question>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited hugs Elara’s perceptual signature—semantic shivers, fungal luminescence, syntactic precision—without head-hopping. Rhythm compresses under pressure (“crackled of displaced air,” “time dripped like cold syrup”) yet stays legible. Dialogue sparse, natural, goal-driven: Aris’s gasp relays stakes; Kael’s fragmentary map propels plot. No register drift; diction stays within arcane scholar lexicon. Filter verbs absent; immediacy intact.</question>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sentences carry double duty: “She cross-referenced linguistic shifts in plant-names with historical rift patterns” advances both character method and world rule. Figurative layer is selective, patterned, and paid off—symphony silence, syrup time, fungal roots—no mixed metaphors. Zero paraphrase loops; each clause adds new causal or sensory information. Final line (“profound, resonant absence”) lands clean, rhythmically cadenced, conceptually exact.</question>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Synthesizes library-heist, living-archive, and fungal-biopunk tropes into singular “botanical linguistics” premise; diary-as-navigator feels inevitable yet fresh. Conceptual risk—library as silent state rather than place—pays off by reconfiguring entire quest without last-minute rule change. Specificity of decaying dialect renegotiation and chronostatic fungus roots wonder in lived detail. Transformation test fails if names swapped; detail is irreplicably tied to this mountain of syntax and spores.</question>
