<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation—proving gardens remember their tenders—drives every beat; the pragmatic ritual of polishing cracked marbles gives us embodied, contradictory emotion and a hierarchy of values. The gold-veined marble for her “mended deception” crystallizes internal conflict on the page, and her final micro-choice (placing the new marble for the villager’s conversion) costs her the last shield of solitude. Status shift with the villager is legible, but his presence is brief; still, her endurance/refusal to monetize luck is earned and stings. Voice remains coherent and individual; no therapy-speak, only vine-earthy perception.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the maze’s quiet greeting plus the polished marble reweight the premise—care, not measurable luck, governs outcomes—and the cost is the lifelong solitude Elara recommits to. Causal lens holds: because she kept tending and documenting, the garden “answers,” therefore the luck-meter flips and the villager leaves converted. Orientation anchored by line 3; no teleports. One reflective block (~18 %) is anchored to present polishing and tilts her stance. Persistent constraint: the cracked marbles archive every past fragility, shaping her tactics to the end.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The garden maze is not backdrop but actor: vines curl toward her step, blossoms last longer in her gaze—environment actively constrains/affirms choices. Micro-settings—stone pedestal, thorny roses, ancient central vine—are handled in motion while she polishes, never static catalogue. Sensory hierarchy favors touch and scent over visual gloss, matching a vine-dresser’s priorities. Weather and spatial choreography remain consistent; the luck-meter’s erratic buzz is a concrete prop whose final stable reading is charged by the setting’s cooperation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—validate care over quantified luck—is signaled early and tightens when the villager’s skepticism threatens to reduce her life’s work to a sensor glitch. One meaningful turn: the luck-meter flips only after she invites touch of the central vine, narrowing future options—she can never again pretend luck is sovereign. Cost is visible: she forfeits anonymity, surrenders the garden’s secret to an outsider. No coincidence resolves; the garden’s response is earned by decades of documented labor.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme—value of unquantified care—emerges through the tactile marble ledger rather than exposition; the gold-veined crack reframes earlier deceit as necessary vulnerability. Subtext lives in gesture: the slow polish = penance and celebration simultaneously. Final image of the newest marble shimmers with conceptual repricing: society’s luck-currency is silently debunked. No closing moralizing; resonance is left in the spiral of cracked spheres catching light.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person lens stays tight to Elara’s perceptual signature—vine sap scent, weight of cracked glass, footstep-noticed tendrils—without head-hopping. Rhythm compresses during the villager’s confrontation then lengthens back to meditative polish, mirroring emotional cadence. Diction stays rural-plain: “withered,” “dresser,” “ledger,” resisting corporate register. No filter-verb stacks; metaphors are spare and vegetal, not ornamental.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence. Information is dense—one polish stroke can carry memory, present garden change, and foreshadow villager test. Figurative language is restrained; when used (“marble veined with gold”) it is concrete and付费. One paraphrase loop spotted (“each crack telling a story…each fissure telling…”) but it does not touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The measurable-luck world is fresh yet deployed only as antagonistic backdrop; cracked-marble archive feels novel and inevitable. Pragmatic vine-dresser refusing to monetize fortune subverts genre expectation of data-worship. Villager conversion avoids neat symmetry—he leaves meter behind, but Elara’s victory is quiet, not triumphalist. Specificity of plant-tending rituals makes the concept un-portable; risk is taken with lyric accumulation rather than plot pyrotechnics and pays off.</comment>
