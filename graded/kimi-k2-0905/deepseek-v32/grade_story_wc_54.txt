<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elara’s curiosity, poetic engineering lens, and repurposing impulse are consistent and embodied; the brass shard becomes a tactile extension of her mindset and the final stance (“mask of stoic wonder”) crystallizes her cost. Yet her interior contradictions remain muted—no moment where logic collides with private fear or memory—so the arc is admirable rather than piercing.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The closure is a luminous Resonant Reconfiguration: the dry fountain reborn as star-flight trajectories rewrites the terminal’s purpose and Elara’s private equation. Causal chain holds—sextant → power map → hologram—with one micro-turn and a felt conceptual cost (“the maze… suddenly cohered”). Orientation is swift, lens is Accumulative/Textural and stays legible; only a hairline slack in mid-scene pacing keeps it from 9+.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Spaceport shell, rusted pumps, carnival scuffs, and the shard are filtered through Elara’s engineering gaze; every sensory pick guides her next move and the final hologram inversion. The brass shard as micro-setting explicitly constrains the calibration choice, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“puzzle out equations for hope”—is signaled early; pressure tightens when she risks rerouting live feeds with only a relic wrench. One deepening beat (dry fountain → star trajectories) forecloses failure and pays visible conceptual cost. Agency drives escalation, no reversal overload; missing a second tangible price (burned fuse, personal danger) caps it just below the 8.8 band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of reclamation-through-reimagining emerges organically from repurposed circuitry and derelict dreams; no authorial thesis intrudes. Final image of “stars fall upward” reweights dereliction into trajectory without moralizing. Slight abstraction in “equation of hope” phrase (−0.2) is the only soft echo.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited anchors to Elara’s perceptual signature—“stoic wonder,” conduit tracing, math-poetic diction—without leakage. Syntax breathes with her pacing, compresses under tool-work, then lifts into lyrical cadence at hologram ignition. No head-hop or register drift; patterned elevation at climax is taught and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Varied sentence rhythm, high density, minimal scaffold; figurative language spikes only at climax where it is earned. One paraphrase loop (“ribbons… not water, but…”) forgiven for imagistic payoff. Clean grammar, precise technical diction, no artifacts near closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fuses decrepit spaceport + carnival residue + antique sextant into a fresh ritual of departure; the hologram fountain feels inevitable yet unseen before. Conceptual risk—light instead of water resurrection—heightens stakes without gimmickry. Only the caretaker nod flirts with trope, but restrained execution keeps it transformative.</comment>
