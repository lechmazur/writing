<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara’s “operatively gentle” trait is embodied in the surgical calm with which she counters the general; clipboard-as-memory device gives tactile weight to past concessions. The single-scene crucible keeps interiority tight, but the text still slips into label-speak (“price of redemption” repeated) and over-calibrated poise that flattens the contradiction sorely needed at the pivot beat. Family-loss motive is asserted rather than dramatized within scene, so the final smile feels pre-scored instead of paid for. Micro-choices are present but never genuinely risk her self-image, so growth is decorative.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Closure is earned: the signed accord is an irrevocable act and the rising sun reweights ideals into fragile practice. Causal chain holds—ritual setting reframes compromise, general’s scoff is parried, consensus tightens—though the “redemption costs more” aphorism does the motivational lifting instead of visible personal loss. Orientation is clean within 120 w; no prop/state drift. One tightening move suffices for the length; the lens is Causal and intact at exit.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Twin-moon marble terrace, scent of night-blooming jasmine, celestial maps carved in table—details are selective, sensory, filtered through Elara’s stake in ritual efficacy; cracked marble mirrors cracked peace. Space is choreographed cleanly around the circular table. No object or terrain feature actively constrains the final choice—the terrace mainly supplies mood—so Q3 cannot breach the 9-band gate, but it services atmosphere and theme without clutter.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—ink a peace that sticks—arrives early and narrows to one decisive beat: sign or scuttle. General’s scoff supplies the needed tightening; ritual framing converts concession into cosmic duty, raising perceived cost of walking away. Escalation is single-arc but sufficient; price is intellectual rather than viscerally personal, keeping the score sub-8.5. No off-stage rescue; agency remains with Elara, so causality and closure are secure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme of “redemption always costs more than we wish to pay” emerges through ink, land forfeiture, and surrendered hatreds rather than explicit sermon. Final sunrise image offers Charged Poise: peace achieved yet permanently precarious. Ambiguity is present—peace is flawed, beauty cracked—but the refrain of “price of redemption” edges close to Echo territory, trimming top-band eligibility. Still, resonance travels from celestial motion to human signature without tidy moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Third-person effaced hovers at a calibrated distance mirroring Elara’s public poise; syntax stays measured, Latinate, occasionally edging toward oratory register that fits negotiator idiom. No head-hop; perceptual filter favors celestial motion, scent, tactile clipboard—consistent and functional. Distinctiveness is moderate; voice never surprises or cracks under stress, which would have elevated micro-texture to 8+. Dialogue is brief but tonally differentiated, particularly general’s flinty interjection.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Rhythm modulates toward shorter pulses during confrontation; most sentences dual-load action and imagery. Occasional loops—“peace like the terrace, was never perfect” echoes earlier clause without new pressure—and adjacency echoes (“price of redemption” x3) dull momentum. Metaphors stay coherent; no mixed vehicles, but stacked abstract nouns (“cherished hatreds,” “cosmic harmony”) flirt with register inflation. No artifact near closure; global 9-band still disallowed by loop accumulation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>“Peace negotiator on ancient star-mapped terrace” gives fresh cultural palette; embedding accord in midsummer celestial ritual avoids generic conference room. Yet plot arc—lone visionary disarms hawk, weary delegates relent—follows recognizable template without subverting it. Specificity of clipboard-as-archive and floral scent elevate material, but emotional risk stays predictable. A modest +0.2 risk bump for ritual world-building, capped by familiarity of beat sequence.</comment>
