<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Aris’s interior contradiction—cold engineer vs. reverent guardian—drives every micro-choice; the hum in his molars embodies urgency. The key’s weight against his ribs and the bypass of the corroded oscillator are felt trade-offs, not labels. Final silence after absolution costs him lingering vigilance, earned by prior causal beats. No head-count clutter; single-POV focus holds.</comment>

<comment>Causal chain is clean: late cutter → figures appear → must rite now → crystal bypass → sonic lock → retreat. Closure is Decisive Change with visible cost: key now sonically booby-trapped, marina ice pacified, Aris stranded in starlit wait. Orientation anchored by word 80; no lens drift. Persistent constraint—key’s new resonance—shapes future tactics.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Drift-ice plates grinding into silence under tone-wave is environment directly constraining outcome. Lighthouse crystal array,共振铜线, and body-as-antenna supply tactile micro-setting that enables final bypass. Spatial track: pier → tower → lamp room; bodies never teleport. Selective sensory hierarchy—sound over sight—mirrors POV’s engineer bias. Final image of ice stilled recharges opening groan.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—prevent key misuse that could unseal foundational frequencies—is signaled in third paragraph and tested by oncoming figures. One meaningful tightening: sunset dying → cutter absent → invaders on pier forces immediate sonic rite; no off-stage rescue. Cost legible: botched frequency would crack ice or shatter key; success leaves Aris alone, key forever altered. Agency drives every escalation beat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from sonic absolution as preservation-through-vibration: resonance can both pacify nature and repel human greed. No moral stated; final stillness reweights prior grinding into earned peace. Key’s iron “drinking” sunlinks materiality to ethereal sound, integrating fleshly and ethereal without abstraction. Ambiguity remains—will the lock hold when key returns to crypt—inviting reflection.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person POV stays tightly bound to Aris’s perceptual filter—C-sharp in molars, wool against throat, crystal hum under fingertips. Syntax lengthens under slowing sunset then fractures into staccato adjustments as pressure peaks. No head-hop; knowledge strictly character-bound. Vocabulary—“sonic absolution,” “resonance plate”—belongs to lighthouse engineer idiom without register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary from lyrical openings to crisp conditional clauses; no template cadence. Figurative density is high but patterned early (“skeletal pier,” “water choked with pale plates”) and paid off in calmed ice mirror. No synonym loops; “groan” recurs with shifting referent. Brass knobs, copper wires, crystal array rendered without purple overflow. Closure sentence breathes clean: “tiny anchor in the vast ethereal night.”</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sonic pacification of hostile ice via lighthouse hack feels fresh, not stock fantasy tech. Conceptual risk—treating sound as both weapon and sacrament—heightens stakes without gimmickry. Transformation test fails if relocated to desert outpost; ice, marina, and maritime engineering are irreplaceable. Specificity of C-sharp tooth resonance and crystal reroute makes trope new.</comment>
