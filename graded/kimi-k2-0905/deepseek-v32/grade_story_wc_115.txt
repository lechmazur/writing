<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Alex’s skeptical baseline and “reckless” vocation are sketched strongly; the moment he steps into the mill and speaks aloud to the spectral shift he enacts a micro-choice that embodies cost. Interiority is mostly concrete, though “weight of a swallowed truth” veers toward label-speak once. Embodied emotion (“drowsy alertness”) tracks under fatigue. The final renunciation—naming the accident—earns its beat via prior radio clues plus Mara’s confession, so the arc lands, but we never feel a contradictory impulse wrestle inside him; tension is external. Secondary pressure from Mara is offstage, so relationship-as-crucible is thin.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Earned Stasis: Alex’s spoken testimony halts the looping valve wheel and dissipates the spectral hum—on-page cost is the irrevocable moral burden he now shares with Mara. The Causal lens holds: each psychic fragment therefore leads him deeper, valve image → wheel sighting → vocal acknowledgement. Orientation is crisp within 50 words; no debt. The only slip is a mild explanatory swell in the penultimate paragraph (“He understood…”) that briefly outlines what the scene has already shown, shaving top-end elegance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Tunnel air (“rust and wet stone”), boiler-room bead-work, and the cavernous mill under ghost-light are filtered through Alex’s explorer gaze—detail is selective and stakes-guided. The beaded valve wheel recurs with reweighted meaning, satisfying the 9+ object-as-constraint test. Spatial choreography stays clean across the threshold move from tunnel to mill. One missed beat: the portable radio’s physical placement fades once inside the mill, so the final crackling silence is slightly disembodied.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“will naming the truth stop the ghost shift?”—is voiced by mid-story and tightens once the beaded wheel is seen in motion. One meaningful escalation: Alex crosses from silent witnessing to public testimony, foreclosing denial. Pressure is coherent but external (spectral echo) and would gain if his skepticism actively fought the decision. Cost is legible: he accepts co-ownership of the disaster, a future moral burden.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of collective memory-as-haunting emerges via concrete machinery, not lecture. The ghost shift externalizes denied responsibility; final silence reframes earlier psychic chatter as fragmented testimony rather than hokum, reweighting premise without moralizing. Subtext in Mara’s off-stage tears and Alex’s lighter hush lands harder than exposition. Avoids tidy redemption; the valve wheel is stilled yet remains, hinting latent re-haunting.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Third-limited stays welded to Alex; perceptual signature favors tactile industrial diction (“beads worn smooth by ghostly hands”). Rhythm tightens under stress—short declaratives as machines hum. No dialogue to test. Occasional adjective clusters (“cavernous space where shadows seemed to move”) flirt with filler but remain legible. Voice never breaks register into abstraction for long.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty—information plus sensory charge—and paragraphs are trim. Figurative control holds: “weight of a swallowed truth” is the closest to mixed metaphor but is salvaged by later physicalization. No paraphrase loops or scaffold clutter. Opening and closing lines are sharp, book-ending with atmospheric return. Only micro-slip: “as if machinery stirred from sleep” hedges where declarative might seal the image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Combines rogue urban-explorer trope with psychic-call scavenging to yield fresh investigative texture; the ghost-shift-as-collective-memory is familiar but redeployed through an industrial valve code. Specificity of beaded wheel and late-night radio mechanics elevates the mix. No bold structural risk, so ceiling moderate. The synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight, satisfying transformation test.</comment>
