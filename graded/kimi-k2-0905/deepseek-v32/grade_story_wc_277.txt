<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Clear, consistent motivation: the journalist’s call triggers a logic-driven quest that escalates with each micro-choice (ledger line, picking the lock, drafting the confession). Interiority is concrete—pen “pulse,” clouds like “ink in water”—but emotion is more declared (“strange lightness”) than embodied under peak pressure. The final renunciation is causally earned, yet the father’s ghost voice is the only palpable cost; her flaw (devoted scrutiny) doesn’t visibly wound her in the beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: call → ascent → drawer → manuscript → confession; each beat narrows options. Closure is a Decisive Change with social cost—“the story would run”—sealed on-page. One transition (observatory→study→observatory) is legible; time stays continuous. No orientation debt; lens stays Causal.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Observatory above clouds anchors early; telescope, dome hum, and dawn tint supply tactile, auditory, visual layers that filter through Elara’s bias. The rosewood nib becomes micro-setting, constraining the final act; clouds-as-ink mirrors internal swirl. Spatial tracking clean; no world-rule breaks. Setting does not escalate cost beyond atmosphere, capping short of 8.8.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stake—family integrity vs. truth—signaled in paragraph two and tightens when the manuscript contradicts the integrity assumption. One meaningful turn: discovery of the spill report forecloses silence, forces confession. Cost is reputational/company survival, legible in the sealed envelope. Pressure stays causal and single-threaded; no external antagonist needed.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme—legacy as orbital cycle—emerges from telescope, “orbits of regret,” generational repetition; final confession breaks the cycle without moralizing. Subtext operates through objects (pen, manuscript) rather than exposition. Final dawn image reweights prior ink-cloud metaphor, achieving quiet Conceptual Repricing. No thematic echo or tidy maxim.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Elara’s diction—“proof by contradiction,” “financial sheets”—without POV leakage. Rhythm modulates: longer reflective sentences in study, clipped phrases at climax (“But how?”). No dialogue, hence no voice convergence. Occasional elevated phrasing (“solemn playfulness”) is consistent with her cerebral stance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; metaphor density is high but pattern-taught early (“clouds like ink”) and pays off at closure. No paraphrase loops or scaffold. Minor register lift (“conceptual repricing” moment) does not blur causality. Clean grammar, precise pronouns, strong verbs; no proof errors.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Familiar “heiress uncovers patriarch’s sin” arc is refreshed by astronomy/logic motifs and the rosewood nib as both heirloom and weapon. Specific corporate-newspaper detail (missing files, nervous retirees) grounds the premise. Risk lies in intellectual structure (proof by contradiction) that could feel schematic, but causality keeps it dramatic. Not groundbreaking, yet memorable within its niche.</comment>
