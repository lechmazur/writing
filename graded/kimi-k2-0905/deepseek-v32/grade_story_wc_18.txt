<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara’s yearning is embodied in tactile ritual; the mirrored breathing gives us real-time contradiction between grounded body and fugitive dream. The final crystallization feels earned because her hands steady even as the world frays. One slip: “a pressure in her chest like a bird wanting out” drifts toward label-speak mid-climax, muting embodied cost. Still, her refused shatter-cost holds.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the orchard-ghost overlays the ruins and the mirror now imprisons the sky, cost paid in irreversible boundary erasure. Accumulative lens holds—frost, breath, reflection layer until meaning reweights. No orientation debt; who-where-when anchored by line 3. One micro-turn at frost shimmer suffices for 700-word scale. Causality intact: because she grafts sextant to mirror, therefore dream is sheared from dawn flight.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fog, frost, and broken sextant act as micro-setting that literally bends choice: frost prisms required for capture, sextant arcs limit traced constellations. Spatial choreography clean—table, mirror, window frames track without drift. Sensory economy favors haptic cold and metallic weight over visual catalog, matching POV priorities. Tool-as-setting constrains the final image, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“keep the dream from fleeing”—tightens once: frost shimmer opens the single window, after which failure means permanent loss. No reversals needed; accumulative deepening (breath matching mirrored breath) escalates risk of shattering self-boundary. Price is paid on-page: orchard-ghost replaces real ruins, dream fixed but world blurred. Agency sits in sustained breath-choice, not external antagonist.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of erasing boundaries emerges through glass, frost, and breath rather than thesis; final mirror-constellation reconfigures what sky means without moral. Image-system (mirror, sextant, frost) returns charged, not decorative. Subtext invites counter-reading: captor becomes captive, reflection now holds the unreachable. No late articulation of meaning—silence after last em-dash carries resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lyric third-person hovers close to Elara’s perceptual filter: selective attention to metal weight, frost whisper, orchard ghosts. Syntax lengthens during inhalation beats, shortens at capture—rhythm taught early and paid off. No dialogue, so voice contamination absent. Register remains within plausible artisan lexicon; elevated diction (“conceptual anchor”) justified by instrument handling.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies with breath cadence; sentence openings avoid template runs. High density: frost-line doubles as mirror and emotional barometer. One coherence hiccup—“glass mountains” simile appears only in prompt slot, never integrated into scene texture, risking metaphor orphan. Otherwise zero loops or filter stacks; closure beat crystal-clear.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Familiar “capture the dream” trope is inverted: dream not consumed but soldered into reflective prison, turning nostalgia into artifact. Sextant-mirror graft feels idiosyncratic to this fog-ruin world. Specificity of cider-house workshop and frost-timing prevents generic transplant. Risk in lyric stillness pays off; no gimmick, just disciplined accumulation.</comment>
