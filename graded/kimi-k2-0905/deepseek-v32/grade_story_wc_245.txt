<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elan’s contradictory impulses—seeking silence while absorbing every tactile shriek—stay active in each beat; the final still-point renunciation is earned because the climb has already cost him the last of his buffered skin. Grief is never labeled, only embodied in the heat of the ring and the hollow of the limb. Micro-choices (climb, hold, absorb) reveal a hierarchy: daughter-memory > cartographic pride. The only restraint to 9-band is a slight reliance on abstract “understanding” in the chord-moment rather than a single, bodily cost sentence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the Stillpoint re-weights every prior sensory beat, and the cost is the permanent absorption of the forest’s din into his skin—he will never again feel her hand without that hollow calm. Accumulative/Textural lens is taught early (texture → pattern → silence) and held to the final line. No teleporting props; the ring’s heat and the tree’s chord are causally linked. Causality is interior but irreversible: because he absorbed the chord, therefore he must climb; because he reaches silence, the memory regains solid form—an Earned Stasis that forecloses further mapping.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The ultrasonic forest is not backdrop but a living antagonist whose pressure lessens degree-by-degree as he climbs; the ring’s temperature serves as micro-setting that physically steers direction. Spatial choreography is clean—hand-over-hand ascent tracked against fading vibration. The final limb is described only by absolute absence, letting absence itself constrain the emotional payoff. Environment, body, and tool together charge the closing image, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—retrieve the lost daughter-sensation—tightens once: the breadcrumb notes force a choice between safe retreat or upward forfeiture of his protective distance from pain. Escalation is textural rather than causal: each absorbed note increases density until the hollow calm becomes the only possible next texture. Cost is legible in the hot ring and the “strange, hollow calm” that replaces his former buffered skin. A hairline slip: the final chord moment could have carried a sharper physical price sentence to push into 9-band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: grief is a map one must physically traverse, not a problem to solve. The Stillpoint re-prices silence from absence to presence-of-memory, a conceptual reversal earned solely through sensory accumulation. No moral is declared; the final line offers a Charged Poise where being “not lost” is inseparable from permanent sensory alteration. Subtext resides in the paradox that only by taking the forest’s pain into his skin does he recover her untouched hand.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays glued to Elan’s tactile cognition; perceptual signature is consistent—“velvet across palms,” “needle-pricks on neck.” Syntax lengthens during calmer dawns, then compresses into clause fragments as the ring burns. No filter-verb stacks; every image is body-filtered. Voice modulation under pressure is precise, meriting 9-band entry.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances texture or stakes. Figurative language is sparse and pattern-taught (temperature = proximity to silence). No mixed metaphors; the “hollow calm” extends both physical and emotional registers without contradiction. Opening and closing sentences act as tonal bookends, propelling the reader into and out of the silence with rhythmic finality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Blind mapmaker who charts via pain-pressure is non-obvious and pursued to its logical end: cartography of the self. Ultrasonic forest + tactile musical notation synthesizes two fresh systems without gimmickry. The daughter-memory recovery via absolute silence flips the usual “find the voice” trope into “find the silence.” Specificity makes the concept inevitable in hindsight, earning the high-band risk bonus.</comment>
