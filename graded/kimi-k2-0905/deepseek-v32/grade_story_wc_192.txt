<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Internal conflict is present—her drive to isolate vs. need to reconnect—but the embodied emotion is sometimes abstract (“weight of centuries alone”). Decision to link scars with the encroacher crystallizes her arc and is earned by prior failures; cost is legible in the reopened vulnerability.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the threshold stabilizes and her creed flips from burning to building bridges. Causal chain holds—self-isolation accelerated the fade, forcing her to reverse method. Orientation is quick; starlight/charcoal anchors arrive by line 3. Cost is visible in her lowering the ring, now committed to perpetual contact.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Micro-setting (charcoal door, iron ring, starlight) constrains every beat; their texture shapes her tactile memories and the final linkage beat. Spatial tracking is clean; the door edges and mist coalescence are cinematic. Selective sensory detail mirrors her narrowed breath-focus, sustaining atmosphere without sprawling.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—threshold collapse vs. her refusal to connect—tightens when isolation itself speeds encroachment. Single meaningful turn at midpoint: she chooses to link scars with the presence, reversing tactics. Price is the permanent re-engagement she dreads. Escalation is steady under causal lens; one tightening suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of reciprocated breathing emerges through image, not statement; final line “waiting to be knocked” reweights her prior isolation ethic. Scars as living bridges accumulate meaning without editorial commentary. Ambiguity remains—will sustained contact truly hold?—inviting reflection beyond page.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lyric compression is consistent and taught early (“tender shadow keeper” establishes hush cadence). Perceptual signature is coherent—her attention leaps to texture, temperature, starlight. No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens during scar-link beat. Syntax modulates with urgency without drum-beat monotony.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong density: “charred and smooth like charcoal” does double descriptive work. Occasional poetic overlay (“eyes like dead stars”) but figurative chain stays coherent. No paraphrase loops; paragraphs advance knowledge or charge. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with the suffocation/respiration motif.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Merges gothic portal fantasy with wound-based empathy technology; reversal of “burn bridges” maxim feels non-obvious yet inevitable. Specific burn-lattice image distinguishes keeper from generic hermits. Threshold fading is familiar trope, but scar-linkage mechanic refreshes it. Concept commits fully—no safety retreat to pure allegory.</comment>
