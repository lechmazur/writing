<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Kael’s curiosity is steadily present but stays at label level; the only embodied contradiction is the chuckle while watching acid life mutate. The transliteration choice registers as intellectual play rather than a costly stance, so the Earned Stasis feels light. Still, the kaleidoscope-in-arrow geometry beat shows a specific tactile micro-choice that lifts the score above mid-band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: each beat adds density until the resonant frequency becomes the Charged Poise closure. Orientation is clear by 80 words and the final image reweights the premise with conceptual cost (“ringing a dinner bell for creatures that don’t even have ears”). One minor slack: the arrow tip causality (fossil → prism upgrade) is asserted rather than shown, but it does not break the pattern.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The workshop’s floating position on the acid sea is returned twice to constrain access and tether the bell transmission; the arrow tip’s geometry literally splits the light that seeds evolution. Sensory triage keeps detail selective—greasy fingers, piston hiss—without catalogue bloat. Micro-setting (kaleidoscope mirrors) functions as lever for the final action, satisfying 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—make the unheard bell resonate—is declared early and tightens once when Kael commits the transliteration to frequency. Because the lens is Accumulative, pressure builds through image density rather than option reduction; the final “colors deepened” shows visible cost paid. A clearer material forfeiture (tool fracture, cart stall) would have pushed the score higher.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of gentle intervention versus ancestral violence emerges via the hunter-arrow-to-light-split contrast without authorial nudging. The closing dinner-bell line reprises earlier hunger imagery and reweights ambition as tender absurdity. No moral is stated; the reader is left balancing awe and hubris. Slight deduction for the abstract “yearning algorithm” refrain that flirts with thesis-speak.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice carries a crisp steampunk-lyric diction (“gears-and-cogs workshop,” “acid-resistant bubbles”) that stays within Kael’s educated tinkerer lexicon. Rhythm modulates: longer cadences for wonder, staccato mutter for self-mockery. No filter-verb clusters or register drift; psych distance tightens smoothly through the kaleidoscope eyepiece. Distinct perceptual signature maintained under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Lines are lean and double-tasked; however, three near-adjacent “yearning” repeats and two “acid sea” mentions create mild synonym loops. Metaphors (“visual symphony”) are sparse and coherent, avoiding purple drift. The final clause “evolution was already singing its tune” is compressed and propulsive. A small paraphrase bump keeps it below 8.0.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Combining primordial-evolution stakes with steampunk kaleidoscope genetics feels fresh, and the hunter-arrow repurposed as optical splitter is an unpredictable turn. The piece synthesizes rather than borrows, though the “unheard bell” trope has lyric precedent. Risk is present but modest; the concept commits fully and follows implications without retreat.</comment>
