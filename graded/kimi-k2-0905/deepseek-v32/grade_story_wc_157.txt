<comment>Leo’s charm and quick-witted defiance are embodied in the moment he palms the gourd while spouting botanical Latin; the internal contradiction between smiling recruitment and simmering rebellion is palpable. Yet the “spark” never deepens into lived backstory—no memory, no micro-choice that shows why thoughts matter more than money—so the motivation stays generic. The final grin is earned by plot causality but not by visible personal cost; he exits untransformed. More idiosyncratic interiority under scanner pressure would have lifted this into the 8-band.</comment>

<comment>The warp pulse delivers a clear Decisive Change: sensors dead, message sent, agents disoriented—cost is the now-sprouting seed that will draw future raids. Causal chain holds: seed hidden → Leo retrieves → planted → shaken → reality bends. Orientation is anchored by line 5; no teleporting props. The 3-second rule is taught early and paid off; no lens ambiguity. Closure is tight, but the prior beats glide rather than tighten, keeping it shy of 9.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Greenhouse is tactile—humid glass, philodendron cascade used to hide planting, pitcher plant jaws risking hand—and the gourd vine overhead is tool-as-setting that enables the warp. Sensory selection narrows under scanner whine to visual shimmer and sound of rattle, mirroring distortion. Spatial choreography is clean: agents fan, Leo kneels, hand in soil, vine above. No environmental constraint alters final tactics beyond the warp itself, capping at 8.2.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—protect untaxed thought—is signaled early and escalates when scanners whir; the warp is the meaningful tightening that forecloses the old cat-and-mouse game. Cost is conceptual: perpetual guerilla gardens now required as seed roots. Agency sits with Leo at every beat—retrieve, palm, plant, shake. Coincidence (agents enter just then) complicates but does not resolve, acceptable under situational lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: language = life, taxation = sensorial death, gardens = insurgent code. The final image of roots weaving an “untaxable language” reweights the premise via Conceptual Repricing—no moral, only living code. Subtext runs through botany-as-cipher and the grin that masks revolt. No thematic echo or final paragraph moralizing; ambiguity lingers: future raids inevitable, code still growing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Leo’s perceptual filter—botanical Latin as shield, sweat on palms, synesthetic shimmer of warp. Syntax flexes from crisp recruits to compressed urgency during scanner whine. No head-hop, no filter-verb stacks. Dialogue sparse but goal-driven: “Just studying cross-pollination” carries subtext of evasion. Register stays within educated vernacular; no corporate drift. Voice distinct, though secondary characters blur; single-POV forgives.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>High information density: one sentence can advance plot, reveal character, and plant motif—“feigning to tie his boot” hides three actions. No scaffold loops; metaphors stay coherent (warp shimmer bends light and thought). Rhythm accelerates into warp beat then exhales into soil sprout. Minor purple adjacent—“simmering rebellion,” “cascade of philodendron”—but never in peak beat. Clean grammar, pronouns, tense. Closure line crisp, image-driven.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Tax-on-thoughts + clandestine botany club + gourd-rattle reality warp is a fresh synthesis; old tropes of rebellion are retooled through horticultural code. The warp’s 3-second freedom feels inevitable yet surprising because seed properties are seeded early. Specificity of pitcher-plant hiding place and wilt-pattern alerts anchors novelty. Risk is high—conceptual SF in 800 words—yet clarity and emotional stakes hold. Not 9 only because the emotional aftereffect is more cerebral than gut.</comment>
