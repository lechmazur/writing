<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is textured and specific—her scentless world is felt through tactile focus on bronze and drip cadence. The micro-choice to polish rather than repair the screw externalizes her own renunciation and reframes the client’s grief. Contradictory impulses (restore vs. honor) coexist in-scene, driving the final “trembling calm.” Only the client’s voice edges toward generic grief-speak, preventing a 9.0.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the gleaming screw reweights meaning from tool to talisman with felt cost for both women. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each water-drip and polish stroke intensifies the emotional density until the final quiet reconfiguration. Orientation is anchored within 120 words; fog → fog-lift frame satisfies waiver. One causal micro-turn (decide to polish ≠ fix) suffices; no meaningful options are left open, so the cost is conceptual yet legible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Water-clock shop operates as micro-setting: drip rhythm constrains Elara’s perception and times the client’s breathing. Bronze reservoir, fogged glass, and screw recur as handled objects that charge the final image. Selective sensory hierarchy (touch > scent) mirrors POV bias without checklist drift. Spatial choreography stays clean—kneel, polish, window exit—all tracked.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—how to honor irreversible loss—tightens when Elara chooses polishing over repair, foreclosing the client’s need for functional restoration. Pressure accretes via drip cadence and screw gleam; no external antagonist required. Cost is the irrevocable acceptance that the screw will never clamp again, visible in the client’s tear/smile. One meaningful deepening meets short-form bar; could edge higher with sharper risk to Elara’s own recovered equilibrium.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: integration beats repair. The screw’s shift from utilitarian to sacred object reconfigures grief without moralizing. Subtext resides in silence synced to water drops; no thematic echo violations. Final image of “trembling calm” offers resonant non-literal answer—acceptance as ordinary miracle.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lyrical third-person lingers in Elara’s tactile lexicon—“liquid sighs,” “cool bronze”—rhythm echoing drip cadence. No head-hop; POV distance stable. Compression (“scentless for five years”) is taught early and paid off in touch-based mapping. Minor register lift toward “conceptual repricing” diction is earned by reflective context.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, and image-dense; no loops or scaffold. Mixed metaphors avoided—water and metal stay coherent. Sentence variety supports breath control under low-tempo scene. One clause (“she had learned to map emotional terrain in other ways”) flirts with tell-ish summary but is anchored by prior embodied beats, so artifact is hairline.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Scent-less aromatherapist + clepsydra shop fuses fresh angles on grief and time. Screw-as-talisman repurposes a clinical artifact into sacred memory without gimmickry. Transformation test passes—swap out any element and the emotional math collapses. Risk (lyric stillness over plot twists) heightens coherence rather than obscures it.</comment>
