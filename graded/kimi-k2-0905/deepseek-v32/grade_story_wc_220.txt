<comment>Arlo’s war-weariness and obsessive leaf-ritual are embodied from line 1; the photograph reveal lets the leaf re-weight meaning, showing earned stasis. Interiority stays concrete (“wild hush” heard as engine ghosts). Only flaw: Elara remains off-page, so relationship crucible is implied not staged—acceptable for single-focalizer design.</comment>

<comment>Causal lens: because he finds the cylinder → therefore decodes riddle → therefore digs → therefore finds capsule; cost is the reopened wound that immediately settles into quiet acceptance. Closure lands as conceptual repricing: the distance he hunted collapses into preserved memory—felt cost on page in the clasped photograph and the final silence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>“Cracked wasteland,” “husks of old machines,” and the waxed leaf as micro-setting all constrain choice (scavenge, preserve, decode). Environment mirrors internal fracture; phonograph grooves become literal terrain he navigates. Spatial choreography clean; one soft moment—“quiet heart” verges on abstraction but recovers with sensory anchoring.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—close the distance to lost past—tightens when riddle forces physical search; cost is emotional re-opening paid on page. Escalation single but meaningful: each cylinder spin peels another nostalgic layer, narrowing options to acceptance. No external antagonist needed; nostalgia itself supplies pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme of preservation-versus-loss emerges through repeated encapsulations—leaf, cylinder, photograph—without explicit moralizing. Final image reweights premise: closeness is possible only as internalized artifact. Subtext in riddle voice and “wild hush” implies collective forgetting; answer is quiet endurance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-limited voice sustains tracker’s scent-oriented perceptual signature (“nose for death”). Syntax flexes with pressure—short clauses at dig, longer reflective cadence at leaf memory. No dialogue, so voice convergence N/A; diction stays within salvager lexicon. Minor filter verb cluster mid-paragraph but pattern taught and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is taut, rhythmic, information-dense; sentences multitask (“the settlement existed in a wild hush, a silence so deep it seemed to hum”). No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Opening and closing lines anchor and recharge. One near-purple phrase—“brittle memory under its glossy coat”—but earns place via sensory specificity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Post-apocalyptic phonograph-riddle is fresh inflection; autumn leaf as memory-storage device feels inevitable in hindsight. Familiar tropes (wasteland scavenger, lost love) are re-annealed through sensory tracker POV and capsule twist. Risk is moderate—quiet lyric ending rather than action catharsis—but coherence maintained.</comment>
