<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interiority is lyrical but leans on abstract labels (“profound emptiness,” “unused courage”) rather than embodied contradiction; the star-ticket punch is a tactile micro-choice yet its cold gleam is told, not felt. The guides’ silent pointing to her heart externalizes the epiphany too cleanly—no visible cost or enduring flaw complicates her new resolve. Still, Elara’s emotional arc from tethered duty to self-won agency is legible and scaled to lyric length.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: repeated lullaby cadence and star imagery reweight the stake rather than cause-and-effect linkage. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—the shoreline lullaby migrates into her heartbeat, repricing “courage” as internal rhythm, not locale. Cost is felt in the final cadence shift (“less daunting now”), though the price is oblique rather than concrete. One micro-turn—realizing courage was never external—arrives cleanly at the bridge-crossing vigil.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The veiled ridgeway’s rule against direct paths is taught early and shapes every detour; the weeping-willow arches and murmuring eddies are selective, sensorily compressed. Starlight on still water serves as micro-setting that charges the final image. Spatial choreography holds across the boat glide and shore arrival. Environment constrains tactics by forcing meander, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—finding internal courage—is signaled in paragraph four and tightened when the bridge appears only at day-night hinge. The ferry guides’ refusal to verbalize forces Elara to internalize stakes, a gentle but legible escalation. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral: the realization that past choices were the block. No concrete loss alters later tactics, keeping the score sub-8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through refrain: lullaby rhythm migrates from landscape to body, turning “courage” from quest object to metabolic beat. No moral is stated; the final image reweights the opening leash-snapping as liberation rather than loss. Ambiguity lingers—will she act differently or merely feel different?—inviting reflection without sermon. The star stamp’s faint gleam recurs just enough to feel earned, not harvested.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person lyric maintains consistent atmospheric distance; diction stays within fairytale register (“veiled ridgeway,” “spectral bridge”) without drifting into corporate gloss. Sentence rhythm mimics lullaby swell, rising and ebbing with boat motion. No dialogue means no voice convergence; the guides’ silence is a purposeful choral texture. Perceptual signature is Elara’s narrowed attention to water sounds and starlight—selective, character-specific.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is clean, loop-free, and propulsive; no filter-verb stacks or synonym churn. Occasional elevated phrasing (“enigmatic path,” “celestial imprint”) flirts with purple but stays within lyric contract. Opening and closing lines anchor and resolve via image (leash break → heartbeat lullaby). Minor scaffold: “gentle persistence” is repeated three times; because it teaches the pattern and pays off in the final line, penalty is waived.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Fairy-tale quest for internal courage is familiar, but the star-stamped ticket as passage permission and the lullaby-rhythm bridge are fresh inflections. Indirect-route rule is made literal via boat detours, transforming metaphor into geography. Risk is quiet—no twisted plot—but coherence between landscape and psyche feels inevitable in hindsight. Could swap names without breaking arc, so originality tops out short of 8.8.</comment>
