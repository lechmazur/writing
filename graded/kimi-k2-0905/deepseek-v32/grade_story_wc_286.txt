<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Kael’s calm, potter-trained patience is credibly embodied and steers every beat; his gentle exhale onto the glass is the pivot that re-tunes the oasis. Interiority stays concrete—“vibration he felt in his teeth” not “he was unsettled.” The final renunciation—clay left unthrown, truth taken instead—pays off the opening motive with visible cost. Only knock: no contradictory impulse ever rattles his zen; he risks near-saintliness, muting micro-struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of sun-tracking → glass fracture → breath-softening → timeline knit builds density without causal reversals yet lands a Resonant Reconfiguration. Orientation flawless; “scorched wasteland… beneath date palms” anchors by line 3. Closure beat—“placed the glass back… gentleness… sharp edge”—carries felt cost (he forfeits potting and claims stewardship instead). One minor lull: no mid-story tightening; escalation is slow accrual, acceptable under chosen lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Desert/oasis contrast is filtered through Kael’s potter eye—“crumbling clay walls,” “hive’s placement stone”—so every detail doubles as tool and topography. The lantern glass acts as micro-setting that literally refracts choices. Spatial choreography clean: glass set, lifted, returned; body tracked against sun and smoke. Only the distant chimney remains abstract, but its smoke plume serves as story clock, fulfilling setting’s constraint role.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: apprehend why the oasis endures. Pressure escalates texturally—fractured visions overlapping, thrum rising—forcing Kael to sustain calm or risk chaos. His gentle upkeep of the glass becomes the decisive act that pacifies timelines, foreclosing the option to “force” knowledge. Cost is implicit but legible: he accepts perpetual custodianship, abandoning former life; still, a crisper tangible loss (water, time, physical pain) would nudge higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme of acceptance versus resistance emerges through image, not lecture: comb replaced, hive lid mended, timelines “knit.” The glass’s final warm reflection reweights prior fractures into stewardship. No moral is declared—“sharp gentleness” remains an enigmatic felt quality. One decorative echo too many of “gentle” slightly softens subtext, holding back a tenth.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person hovers at Kael’s shoulder, diction earthy and rhythmic—“measured as the wheel he no longer turned.” Free indirect moments (“the potter in him recognized…”) keep perceptual signature tight. No dialogue, so voice must carry variation alone; syntax lengthens in calm, shortens under thrum, satisfying modulation. Minor cadence repetition in “gentle/gentleness” but not enough to clog.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Sentences flex from lyrical—“visions overlapped like poorly fired glaze”—to tactile—“thrum… in his teeth.” No loops or filler stacks; nouns concrete, verbs strong. One mixed metaphor: “tender will that could cut through linear time” slightly over-presses the blade image, but sense survives. Density high; every line adds texture or moves beat; earns its length.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Concept of “phototropic kindness” reframing desert-bleak survival feels fresh, marrying ecology to ethics. Timelines-as-glaze is an inventive pay-off to potter background. Oasis-beekeeping trope is familiar but re-animated through fractured-time maintenance. Still, zen-calm protagonist solving crisis with gentleness flirts with archetype; specific personal flaw or quirk could sharpen individuality.</comment>
