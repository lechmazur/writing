<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The heartbroken reaper’s interiority is vivid and embodied—“a weight of centuries” ache, sorrow catalyzes the ritual—but the singular decisive choice (folding the atlas) is understated; cost is felt yet not dramatized in a moment of irrevocable renunciation, so the 9+ quick test just misses.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each named crystal layers pressure until the atlas becomes a constellation of re-remembered sacrifice; closure is Earned Stasis—folding the page encloses both grief and duty, foreclosing any undoing of the mercy that broke the world. Cost is legible in the final line: “no longer echoing, simply remembering,” a quiet foreclosure of his former function.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The observatory’s prism, atlas page, and dusk light function as micro-setting: they constrain every tactical move—angle the prism, whisper into color, fold the page—charging the final image. Spatial choreography is impeccable; no sensory checklist, only selective, POV-filtered detail.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—name the nameless fears—tightens through each crystallization; every new shard forecloses the option of leaving terror formless. Agency is sustained in the deliberate angle of light and whispered phrases; cost is the ephemeral sublimation at dawn, a felt price that alters nothing yet reweights memory.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Emergent theme: naming as penance for unwitnessed sacrifice. No moralizing—theme crystallizes solely through the atlas constellation and the reaper’s choice to fold rather than display. Final image reweights the premise: maps of terror can be folded shut, but memory cannot, a resonant non-literal answer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct lyrical texture: archaic cadence (“monuments to forgotten watchings”), compressed syntax, and prism-scattered color vocabulary remain stable. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is the reaper’s echoing ventriloquism, paid off when his own lips fall silent at the end.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Rhythm modulates with dusk’s bleed; sentences lengthen then compress at crystallization beats. Figurative language is disciplined—no mixed metaphors, no loops. Final line lands cleanly without scaffold. Minor filter verbs (“he lifted”) are voice-motivated, not intrusive.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Freshens the “reaper with heart” trope by fusing cartographic terror with optical physics; the atlas page as memory substrate feels inevitable. Risk in lyric stasis rather than violent climax pays off: the folded map becomes a portable graveyard. No close echoes of familiar scenes.</comment>
