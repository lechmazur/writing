<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory motives—scholarly detachment vs. sisterly guilt—are vivid and embodied; the telegram beat crystallizes a believable, costly pivot. Interiority avoids therapy-speak; the final micro-choice (new logbook) visibly forecloses pure objectivity. Only minor slip: “heals with words” is asserted more than dramatized in-scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: telegram arrival → glyph re-reading → logbook renunciation, each because/therefore step tightening options. Closure is Earned Stasis: she keeps writing, abandons scientific anonymity, cost is legible in the pressed flower beside the open diary. No orientation debt; timeline and space remain clean.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dome, slit of grey light, and telegram as micro-setting constrain her actions and charge the final image. Telescope and pressed daylily are tactile, repeatedly handled, their states evolve. Sensory selection mirrors emotional narrowing; no white-room syndrome.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will she keep hiding behind stars or witness Cora—tightens once via telegram + glyph reread; option to stay detached is foreclosed when she re-opens the wound on paper. Cost is visible ink and exposure of guilt. Escalation is single but sufficient for length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Shared burdens theme emerges through shifting star-glyphs and the telegram’s floral cry; no final moralizing. Subtext of “solitude / witnessed” reweights the premise in a quiet Conceptual Repricing. Resonance lingers without tidy resolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lyric, slightly archaic diction fits a star-cipher monk; rhythmic control heightens when grief cracks the academic surface (“her breath caught”). No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens credibly under pressure. Filter verbs are minimal and voice-motivated.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet breathable; sentences vary, no template cadence. Figurative layer serves theme—stars as pulse, daylily as preserved voice—without purple overload. One paraphrase loop (“shared burden felt lighter…”) costs −0.2; otherwise clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Fusion of astro-translation and grief memoir feels fresh; star syntax = emotional semaphore is non-obvious. Telegram-daylily hybrid object is specific rather than quirky ornament. Could verge on sentimental but avoids via restrained closure.</comment>
