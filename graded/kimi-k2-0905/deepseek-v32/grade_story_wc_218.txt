<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s “brazen calm” is embodied in every soldered wire and diary cross-reference; the trait drives each micro-choice and is paid for with bodily collapse. The six-month deadline converts abstract stewardship into urgent, tactile labor, so her motivation escalates scene by scene. Interiority stays concrete—she “places her palm flat against the living stone,” not “feels connection.” Final smile and encasing bark give earned stasis with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal chain is airtight: diagnosis → diary map → copper circuitry → root-voice activation → death-as-bridge. Each beat narrows options—she can’t save herself, only the conversation—so closure lands as decisive change. Orientation is fixed by line 3; no lens ambiguity. Final image of copper swallowed by new bark crystallizes the cost under causal logic.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setting is not backdrop but wiring schematic: mineral veins, root angles, and low-frequency hum dictate every move. Micro-setting—copper against bark, ozone scent—constrains soldering tactics and charges the dying smile. Spatial choreography is immaculate; no floating bodies. Environment literally speaks back, fulfilling 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“awaken interspecies dialogue before death”—tightens when each copper coil costs dwindling stamina. One meaningful escalation: the hum becomes intelligible voice, foreclosing further physical work and forcing pure translation. Cost is legible in her final week calendar and collapsed posture. No coincidence; all pressure is metabolized through her agency.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from circuitry: respect is not advocacy but literal rewiring of oneself into another’s nervous system. Subtext in the diary’s “frantic, final entries” shows translation as lovemaking across temporal scales. No moralizing; the island’s memory of resource plunderers supplies counter-reading. Final copper-in-bark image reweights respect as irreversible fusion, not sentiment.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-limited voice stays calm, precise, syntactically parallel to Elara’s systematic mind: “She gathered… she began… she spent.” No head-hopping; island voice arrives as sensory impression, not quoted speech. Register never drifts into techno-babble or pastoral fluff. Rhythm accelerates only in the final diary scramble, mirroring bodily failure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty—e.g., “The air… thicker, sweeter, charged with ozone and ripe pear” fuses sensory payoff and causal signal. Zero paraphrase loops; each copper wrap is distinct. No mixed metaphors; stone hum and root-circuit stay physically coherent. Final line “she endured” lands monosyllabic, releasing prior syntactic control.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Combines dying-botanist trope with living-stone mycelial internet; synthesis feels inevitable once copper meets bark. Risk taken: no human antagonist, climax is seated listening, yet stakes stay visceral. Specificity of mineralized trunk veins prevents generic eco-fantasy drift. Transformation test fails if Elara isn’t a caretaker-diagnostician; occupation is plot engine.</comment>
