<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The poet’s craving to “feel the texture of time” is lucid and constant; every beat returns to that itch. The final renunciation—choosing mortal words over luminous omniscience—pays off the rope’s inherited tension and his own spoken spiral. Interiority stays embodied (fingertips on clay, hemp bite in palm) rather than abstract. Only the “ethically playful” label is asserted, never tested in action, keeping the score from the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a crisp Earned Stasis: he refuses transcendence, accepts the fray of finite language, and the beings dim in real time on the page. Causality under the Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each layered vision thickens the stake until the final hand-on-rope choice crystallizes meaning. The rope’s trigger cue (prison memory) arrives within the first 120 words, anchoring orientation. No loops or causality breaks; the single deepening tightens decisively.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The terra-cotta grotto is not backdrop but instrument: its clay walls store thermal memory, forcing the pattern-draw to unlock them. Micro-setting (rope as paperweight, dust under fingernails) constrains the final gesture of writing. Sensory hierarchy skews to touch and temperature, matching the protagonist’s haptic quest. Starlight and clay temperature are reused anchors, never generic scenery.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“feel time’s texture”—intensifies as each memory-layer makes the sensation literal, then risky (full knowledge = loss of grain). The single reversal: transcendence offered → mortality chosen, cost foreclosing omniscience. Pressure stays coherent under Accumulative lens; no external antagonist needed. Price is visible: he keeps the abrasive rope and accepts partial, word-bound knowledge.</comment>

<comment>Theme emerges without statement: time is not a dimension to possess but a friction to inhabit. The rope’s fray and the clay’s grit reweight the abstract concept into palpable ethic—accept limitation or smooth the world blank. Final image (charcoal on clay) answers the thematic question by action, not moral. Ambiguity lingers: we sense the cost of words he will never fully taste.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person retains lyric distance yet filters every detail through the poet’s haptic obsession. Syntax stretches into cumulative coils that mimic the spiral he draws, then tightens at the refusal. No head-hop; energy beings stay observed, not interiorized. Register stays within a poet’s plausible lexicon without drifting into academic gloss.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is rhythmically alive: long breath-clauses build sediment, then short cuts (“He reached out”) land choice. Figurative layer is dense but patterned—fossilized fingerprint, liquid topaz, translucent pages—each re-enforcing the texture motif. No mixed metaphors or synonym loops; every image does double duty (sensorial + thematic). One minor scaffold: “time felt different now, thicker, layered like sediment” could compress, but it occurs early and does not touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The “post-arrival” energy-being trope is refreshed by making them non-antagonistic witnesses who simply illuminate choice. Marrying a prison-rope relic to a metaphysical quest for temporal grain feels inevitable in hindsight yet is rarely attempted. Structural gamble—lyric accumulation instead of plot reversals—pays off through coherent closure. Risk (+0.4) heightens meaning without obscuring clarity.</comment>
