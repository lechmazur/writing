<comment>Aris’s quiet obsession to “teach dust to tell stories” is vivid and consistent; his copying pencil stilled by the pirate song shows embodied choice. Interiority stays concrete—no label-speak—even when he decodes light-into-dust epiphanies. However, the dust-activation climax lacks interior contradiction: the moment is pure wonder, no flicker of doubt or cost felt on the page, so the final stance reads as serene rather than charged.</comment>

<comment>The closure is a luminous Conceptual Repricing: dust literally re-storying itself under green light re-weights the famine premise with undeniable imaginative cost. Causal chain holds: radio glow → encoded lyrics → orchestral embedding → dust revival, each because/therefore step visible. Accumulation design is clean—one continuous scene, no teleporting props—and the final ember fade mirrors the seed-ember lyric, tightening cadence.</comment>

<comment>The alcove, radio dial, and settled dust function as micro-setting: the dial’s secret glow literally forges the bridge that lets dust speak, constraining the final tactic. Mist and hillside are sketched with economy; selective sensory detail (green light on stone, motes trembling) keeps spatial footing without checklist overload. Anchor (who/where/when) appears by line 3; no orientation debt.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—narrative survival after cultural famine—is signaled in line 1 and escalates through each encoded transmission. A single meaningful tightening: when the dial glow teaches dust to form shapes, the option of permanent silence is foreclosed; cost is conceptual but legible—stories now glimmer on every surface. Agency stays internal (tuning, copying, aiming light) yet alters world state; no coincidence resolves the tension.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges lyrically: memory can be re-inscribed even on the most erased substrate if encoded in shared art. Subtext resides in the radio’s “secretly luminous” quality—visibility only to the initiated—mirroring the pirate signal’s resistance. No overt thesis; final image of ember-matched dial and dust-ships offers resonant non-literal answer. The lullaby lyric reprise reweights prior material without moralizing.</comment>

<comment>Third-person close voice maintains perceptual signature: music-copyist precision (“transcribing notes onto pristine sheets”) filters every noticing. Syntax stretches into melodic cadence that mimics orchestral phrasing, then contracts under radio static, mirroring pressure. No head-hop; diction stays within Aris’s plausible lexicon. Dialogue is absent by design, so voice coherence rests on internal texture, which holds.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm modulates: long anaphoric phrases for pirate lyrics, staccato clauses for Morse-like encoding, then a hush of single-sentence paragraphs at dust-swirl climax. Information density is high—each sentence layers image, metaphor, and plot advance; no scaffold loops detected. Figurative language is patterned early (“thistled calm,” “ember alcove”) and paid off in final ember fade, avoiding purple overload. Only micro-slip: “perpetually swathed” edges toward filler adverb, but it occurs outside the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Famine-to-dust revival via clandestine orchestral code is a non-obvious synthesis; the shortwave-as-teacher that literally re-creates ships from motes feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking—lyric accretion instead of overt antagonist—heightens coherence without gimmickry. No derivative echo; premise commits fully to its own physics of light and frequency. Specificity of “ember alcove,” “thistled calm,” and copyist diction anchors universals in singular stance.</comment>
