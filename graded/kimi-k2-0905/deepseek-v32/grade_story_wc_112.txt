<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Aris’s obliging nature is asserted rather than dramatized; he never faces a real choice that costs him anything. Interiority drifts into exposition (“his motivation was not merely repair…”) and the final smile feels unearned because no contradictory impulse is acted out in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the hologram lattice makes sideways time legible and reweights the station’s scientific paradigm with conceptual cost. Causal lens holds; each beat advances Aris’s pursuit, and the lever pull is the decisive physical act that releases the lattice image. No orientation debt; who/where/when are anchored inside 120 words. The −0.4 non-closure cap applies because the cost is conceptual rather than viscerally felt on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Violet twilight, fungal forest, and the nexus are sketched with fast, POV-filtered strokes that feed the speculative frame. The mechanically warm console and hanger corner act as micro-setting that constrains the lever choice. Details are selective and linked to action; no exposition dump or white-room syndrome. Falls just short of 8.8 gate because no environmental object is re-weighted in the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—proving sideways time—is declared early and tightened once via the holographic lattice reveal. Agency is intellectual observation, not risky action; the lever pull carries no visible price or forfeited option, so escalation feels moderate. Cost is conceptual rather than felt, capping high-band entry. One meaningful deepening occurs, satisfying short-form pressure requirement.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through the lattice image: scientific paradigms can fold once time is seen as lateral rather than linear. No moralizing summary; the reweighting is visual. Subtler bat-moth motif hints at non-linear migration but stays under-used. Final smile is too tidy, blunting thematic ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person close stays anchored to Aris with perceptual signature (“mechanically warm glow”) and controlled lexicon. No head-hopping; Elara’s mindset is inferred only through Aris’s filter. Rhythm breathes with the scene’s hush; no template cadence or filter stacks. Distinguished from mid-band by consistent speculative register without academic drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no paraphrase loops or synonym churn. Information density high—each line advances image or conceptual beat. Metaphors (“sky bled into violet”) are few and apt; no mixed vehicles. Clean copy with only minor scaffolding (“the hour when…”) that does not touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Lateral-time concept feels fresh against standard time-dilate tropes, grounded in magnetic-nexus astronomy rather than hand-waving. Holographic lattice as proof device is inventive and visually specific. Bat-moth migration echoes theme but could be any creature; not fully transformed. Risk level moderate—concept drives the piece more than character, so individuality is intellectual rather than emotional.</comment>
