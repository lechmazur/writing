<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Kael’s motivation—coaxing resilience from rubble—remains steady, but interiority defaults to stock phrases (“quiet determination,” “profound exhaustion”) rather than character-particular embodiment. The single micro-choice—pressing the silk—earns its beat, yet no contradictory impulse ever threatens the resolve, so the arc is linear, not crucible-forged. Memory-loss cost is asserted, never dramatized, blunting felt price. Still, the blacksmith identity shapes tool use and gait, keeping the score above midline.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Causal chain is clean: bargain → cavern → ritual → planetary pulse restored; each link visible on page. Closure lands as Decisive Change with conceptual cost—memories traded, planet revived—though the cost is summarized rather than shown in a final image that reconfigures meaning. Orientation is anchored by word 50; no drift. One tightening beat suffices for 700-word scope; no scaffolding loops. Meets 9- gate for closure validity, but lack of persistent constraint caps below 8.8.</comment>

<comment>Orchard planet and floating arches function as more than postcard: the crumbling arches externalize the stake, and the mine-shaft conduit is tactilely navigated by moss-glow, scent of damp earth, crystal glitter. Spatial choreography is coherent; no impossible moves. Micro-setting (silk) charges the final image. Detail is selective, filtered through blacksmith eye (“shaping stubborn metal”). Environment never constrains a tactical choice, so just misses 8.8 gate.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—planet death—signaled early; ritual is the single tightening act that forecloses the memory-loss option. Pressure is coherent under Causal lens, but escalation is a single ramp rather than a reversal; no live option is closed mid-sequence. Cost is declared, not viscerally felt on page. Sufficient for 600-word scale, yet price opacity keeps it sub-8.8.</comment>

<comment>Theme of renewal-through-loss emerges via the silk’s glow and traded stones, never sermonized. Final azure sky reweights the barter without moral tag. Ambiguity lingers: restoration may be “fleeting dream,” inviting reflection. Particulars trump abstraction; no thematic echo in final paragraph.</comment>

<comment>Third-person POV remains tight to Kael; perceptual signature skews to metallurgic metaphors and subdued affect. Rhythm modulates: longer clauses for descent, clipped fragments at surge. No head-hopping. Filter verbs minimal; diction stays within blacksmith lexicon. Voice distinctiveness strong enough for high-band but not yet singular.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varied; sentences open differently. No synonym loops or scaffold. Figurative language sparse and purposeful (“arches floated like skeletal remains”). One mixed vehicle—”azure defiance” as tone label—doesn’t blur sense. Information density high; every sentence advances. Clean copy. Closure beat free of artifacts.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Familiar dying-world trope is refreshed through blacksmith POV, mine-shaft conduit, and memory-currency economy. Silk-as-battery is understated, not over-explained. Synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight. No bold structural risk; stays within classic lyric arc. Fresh enough for upper tier, not yet daring enough for 9+.</comment>
