<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Interiority is lyrical and character-specific; guilt is anchored to a single sensory memory. The amber moment crystallizes contradictory impulses—relief and regret—without therapy-speak. Still, the decision to “tether” reads more conceptual than embodied; we see the gesture but not the physical cost on her body or the lab. Micro-choice hierarchy is clear, yet the emotional plateau at the end feels slightly too tidy for the weight claimed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the meteor hush reweights all prior noise and leaves the lab in earned, unstable quiet. Causal chain holds—amber activation → constellation tattoo → firmware silence—each step paid for with escalating time-folds. One transition only (antique drawer) and orientation anchored by line 5. No telegraphing or outline drift; the folded-time rule set is taught early and obeyed at the end.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>“Laboratory of lost sounds” is evoked through tactile membranes, silver needles, resonance chambers—each object constrains the next move. The amber’s glow and insect orientation mark spatial beats that track across the final tether. Weather and macro geography are irrelevant here; the body-as-setting rule is satisfied by Elara’s needle hand and the humming banks that respond to her touch. No white-room syndrome; every new detail alters acoustic possibility.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—silencing guilt—is signaled in paragraph two and tightened when the firmware loops the very cry she misread. The meaningful turn arrives with the meteor hush: it reveals the cry was greeting, not distress, forcing her to absorb irreversible error rather than fix it. Cost is conceptual but legible—guilt is integrated, not expunged. Pressure plateaus slightly mid-scene while she reads letters; escalation would sharpen if the firmware fought back during tether.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges as the paradox of archiving sound to achieve silence—guilt as a waveform that can be mapped but never deleted. The meteor hush reframes earlier imagery without moralizing. No echo-statements; meaning is carried by the insect’s re-oriented wings and the final pulse of amber. Ambiguity lingers: integration is not absolution, a counter-reading the story permits but does not preach.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person lyric remains tight to Elara’s perceptual filter—celestial, sonic, skin-level. Syntax thins under pressure (“time snapped back”) and swells during reflection without register drift. No dialogue, so voice distinction is internal only; the prose’s rhythmic control mirrors the lab’s oscillating frequencies. One POV, stable throughout; any compression is taught by the first paragraph and paid off in the final hush.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm is musical, imitating waveforms without falling into template cadence. Density is high—each sentence layers sensory, emotional, and conceptual information. One mixed-metor risk—“meteor hush” is redeemed because the story literalizes it as a sound. No paraphrase loops or filter-verb stacks; the single passive (“was said to contain”) is justified as rumor.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes acoustic sci-fi with tattoo-art intimacy; neither trope feels grafted. The amber-as-first-voice and firmware-as-regret are fresh inflections that grow from Elara’s specific guilt. Risk is evident in folding chronology, yet causality holds. If names and places were swapped the emotional arc would still function, but the sonic-tattoo mechanism is particular enough to resist full interchangeability.</comment>
