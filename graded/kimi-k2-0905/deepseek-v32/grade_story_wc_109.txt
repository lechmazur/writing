<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Elara’s “mild obsession” is asserted repeatedly but never dramatized through contradictory choice; she inscribes in perfect calm, so the trait never complicates action. Interiority is lush yet circular (“she thought back… she remembered…”) rather than revealing new tension. The map-making want is clear, but no micro-choice under pressure shows cost or foreclosed path—she simply finishes. The booklet’s glow is felt as wonder, not as price paid.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Closure is a lyrical Charged Poise: the booklet’s inner glow reweights silence into navigable geography and the star winks out, making the endless night newly traversable. Cost is conceptual—silence is no longer empty—but lacks embodied price. Accumulative lens holds: each silence-symbol layers density until the final image reconfigures meaning. Causality is internal and coherent; no external stakes break pattern.</comment>

<comment>Storm-tossed fort, single star, and flaking booklet are vividly particular; the fort’s wind-scarred stone and ambered hush filter through Elara’s perceptual bias. The booklet’s tactile fragility constrains her careful micro-movements, charging the final glow. Sensory hierarchy narrows to sight and touch, mirroring her exclusion of sound. Spatial choreography remains stable in a single battlement workspace.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—map the endless night—is signaled early; pressure is static, not escalating. No live option is foreclosed; she completes the map exactly as intended. The “ambered hush” deepens atmospherically but never narrows tactical choices or imposes visible cost. Under Accumulative lens, density grows, yet the lack of a tightening turn keeps tension flat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: darkness as traversable territory rather than absence. Silence shifts from void to map, reweighted by the final glowing booklet image. No moral is stated; resonance is conceptual. The idea is fresh, yet its emotional cost is oblique, limiting thematic bite.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric voice is consistent, with controlled psychic distance and perceptual signature tied to sound’s absence. Syntax repeats parallel “The…” openings and layered similes (“like resin… like autumn leaves”) that teach a hymnal cadence; final star extinction pays the pattern off. Diction stays within Elara’s arcane lexicon. No dialogue to distort voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is lush but loops: “silence” and “hush” recur in adjacent sentences; “ambered hush” appears three times with no escalation. Metaphors are coherent yet piled (“marbled hush,” “breathless pause full of memory”) risking purple drift. Read-aloud rhythm is hypnotic; paragraph cuts are clean. No grammar slips, but synonym churn keeps it from 8.5+.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Premise—cartography of silence—is non-obvious and pursued with conviction. Risk lies in lyric stasis, yet the accumulative structure justifies the quiet. Tropes of oracle-and-prophecy are subverted by replacing spoken fate with annotated quiet. Specificity of pebble-shore training and gold-leaf booklet keeps concept fresh.</comment>
