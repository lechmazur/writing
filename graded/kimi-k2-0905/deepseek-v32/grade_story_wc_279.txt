<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid—tracing sand while parsing “sorrow from fear” shows embodied contradictions—but her motivation to “discover meaning in the mess” is declared, not dramatized until late. The final renunciation (scattering the mandala) is earned by the hush she orchestrates, so the arc lands with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each whispered fragment layers acoustic density; the tile flake’s hum and mandala act as pattern breaks that reweight the stake from noise to silence. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—the emergent hush blankets the grotto, costing the whispers their form—cost is felt when Elara scatters her guide. Orientation is anchored by word 50; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Grotto, mist, and tile flake constrain every choice: whispers can only be heard here, sand can only be shaped on-site, the tile must be placed at the convergence. The lilac twilight color and damp acoustic cues are filtered through Elara’s chalk-artist eye for texture. Final image—mist relaxing after hush—evolves causally from the resolved whispers, charging the closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: transform cacophony into peace. One meaningful tightening: the panic-burst whisper forces her oral interjection “Peace,” which narrows options—no further shaping, only release. Cost is the dissolution of the mandala itself and the whispers’ extinction; agency is hers, not coincidence. Escalation is modest but coherent under Accumulative lens; one turn suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges: meaning is the pattern of letting go, not extraction. Subtext lives in gesture—scattering sand equals releasing control—never stated. The tile flake’s silence revalues its earlier hum, achieving Conceptual Repricing without moralizing. Final image breathes beyond the page, resisting tidy profundity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric voice remains stable, tinted by Elara’s synesthetic perception (“lilac unease”). Diction—“whispering gallery tile flake,” “acoustic chaos”—is specific to her artist ear. Rhythm slackens intentionally as hush spreads, mirroring mist relaxation. No dialogue, so no voice convergence issues.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is thickly figurative but pattern-taught early (“mist…damp, silent sigh”) and paid off when mist “relaxes.” No mixed metaphors; density serves texture, not ornament. Minor scaffold: two adjacent “sand” mentions could compress, but loop is local and does not touch closure. High information density—each sentence layers sensory or causal data.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: chalk artist + whispering grotto + sand mandala yields “emergent hush” as tangible silence. Risk—lyric accumulative structure rather than plot—heightens resonance without gimmick. Transformation is specific: only Elara’s chalk-trained eye could hear color in panic. Premise avoids stock templates by binding acoustic magic to tactile craft.</comment>
