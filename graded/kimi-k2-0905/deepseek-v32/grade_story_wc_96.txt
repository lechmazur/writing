<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Silas’s contradictory impulses—monthly reinvention vs. the stubborn promise to Leo—stay live in every beat; the moment he pins “Begin here” to the wall, we see cost in the ache of his back and the empty tin. Interiority stays concrete, never drifting into label-speak. The molt is asserted more than dramatized, so the final “new and steady” reads slightly convenient rather than wrestled-for.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the library’s new luminescence and the empty tin visibly reweight the premise—beauty has begun to outvote anarchy, at a price (the poet’s emptied shell). Causal chain holds: promise → night’s work → sanctuary carved → emptied tin = vow kept. Lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern taught early and deepened by each shelved book. One micro-loop—“rebuild, he whispered, and the word echoed”—is a hairline scaffold but does not dull the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Corrugated roof sighing, oxidized-metal air, moonlight bleaching rust to silver: every sensory pick is filtered through Silas’s builder-eye and knits into action (books sorted by color). The tin graduates from prop to micro-setting—its false bottom clicked open on the stone table—constraining the moment the poems are released. Spatial choreography stays clean; no floating anchors. Environment charges the final image: the library now “holds its own luminescence,” a literal payoff.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—beauty from anarchy—tightens via bodily fatigue and the visible transformation of one room; options narrow from “wreck” to “sanctuary,” with the moon as live clock. No external antagonist; pressure is situational and accumulative. Cost is legible in dirty hands, aching back, emptied tin. Escalation is single-wave rather than doubled, keeping it just shy of 8+ bands.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through recurrent inversion of discard into gift: prison discards → hidden poems → hearth-library. No final moralizing; the pinned poem “Begin here” is the silent thesis. Subtext in the empty tin: the container outlives its contents, suggesting identity can be more than what it hides. Complexity lingers—tomorrow’s molt may still scrap the skin he’s earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lyrical third-person stays tightly aligned to Silas’s perceptual signature—book spines sorted by color, rust mooning to silver. Rhythm modulates: longer clauses while shelving, staccato when tin clicks open. No dialogue, so voice distinction is moot. Rare diction lifts (“molting personalities”) but remain credibly poet-vagrant. Filter verbs minimal; immediacy intact.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>High density: “luminous fracture” does triple duty as visual, thematic, and tonal. One template cadence—“He lifted, sorted, arranged”—mirrors the methodical task and is justified. No mixed metaphors; moonlight as silver bleach is apt. Opening and closing lines anchor and resolve by image. Minor loop: “rebuild” whispered twice in two sentences; −0.2, not closure-touching.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: vagrant poet who literally sheds self each month + prison-library friendship seeding a new public hearth. The coffee-tin seed-vault is a lovely inversion of smuggle-to-survive. Risk—the lyric, almost mythic tone—heightens stakes without slipping into twee. Feels inevitable in hindsight yet non-obvious at entry.</comment>
