<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Interiority is evocative—"fracture line through her spirit," "hollow glass core"—and the final micro-choice (letting the drop fall) crystallizes her arc. Yet the middle beats show almost no contradictory impulse; she glides from frustration to epiphany without risking a wrong move, so the renunciation feels pre-ordained rather than paid for. The mercury-glass body remains metaphorically vivid but never once limits her physically or socially on the page, muting cost. Still, the single POV stays coherent and the embodied emotion lifts it above mid-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the seed moment is a Resonant Reconfiguration that reframes her entire identity, cost encoded in the literal loss of bodily mercury. Causal chain is thin—feather contact → instant glyph comprehension → unerring descent—but the accumulative/textural lens holds: pattern recognition and tactile density escalate until meaning detonates in the final image. Orientation is secured by word 60; no penalties apply. One minor lapse: the stone’s rules are taught only one beat before payoff, so the turn feels lightly convenient rather than earned.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Bookstore-mountain is sketched with economy—“shelves slithered and groaned,” “geology, mythology, languages dead and dreaming”—and the shifting corridors directly obstruct backtracking, so environment shapes tactics. Sensory range favors texture over visual catalog, matching the feather-reading device. Spatial choreography stays consistent during the long descent. Final barren patch is under-described, but by then the body-tool (glass wrist, mercury drop) has become the operative micro-setting, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“shape of home”—is signaled early and tightened once: from passive wandering to active seeding. However, the tightening is not tested by opposition or reversible risk; the mountain yields without resistance, so the cost feels conceptual rather than lived. Under the accumulative lens, pattern density does intensify, but the absence of a live fork or sacrifice keeps pressure below the 7.0 threshold.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of genesis versus vision emerges organically through the final re-pricing of her mercury as seed rather than sight. Subtext operates in tactile silence—the feather’s barbs replacing spoken words—without authorial commentary. The image of “quiet, thunderous potential” resonates without moralizing. Minor deduction for abstract phrasing—“shape of home”—that is never concretized in sensory memory.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains steady psychic distance; perceptual signature is filtered through glass-bodied synesthesia—“cold veins,” “hollow core”—creating a distinct rhythmic pulse. Syntax modulates from long, dust-thick clauses to the staccato final drop, mirroring her shift from stasis to release. No dialogue to corrupt voice. Occasional elevated diction (“petrichor,” “reliquary”) nudges register but stays within a seer’s plausible lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and image-dense; every paragraph advances either atmosphere or choice. No paraphrase loops, no mixed metaphors. Figurative language is disciplined—one vehicle per beat—and culminates in the precise, non-metallic “quiet, thunderous potential.” Occasional adjective stacks (“labyrinthine bookstore occupying the entire mountain”) are tolerated because the noun phrase is necessary orientation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fusion of tactile linguistics with a living library-mountain feels fresh; the feather-as-braille device upends generic magic-item tropes. Transformation test fails—plot could survive if she were merely a mute scholar—but the mercury-glass physiology and seed inversion are inseparable from the emotional arc, so the concept coheres as a singular vision. Risk in structural compression rewards rather than obscures.</comment>
