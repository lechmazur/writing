<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s vocation-derived impulse to “rescue dying arts” is concrete, but her interiority drifts into poetic synopsis (“rosewater dread”) rather than embodied contradiction; the final catalytic choice (scatter bread) is credible yet feels lightly motivated—no prior beat shows her weighing failure cost. Emotional embodiment peaks at “warmth of continuity,” but most beats summarize feeling. Still, the heirloom lens links perception to ancestry and propels discovery, keeping motivation coherent.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the ice shatters, hive re-awakens, continuity re-established, cost visible in Elara’s acceptance of perpetual guardianship (“sharp, sweet responsibility”). Causal chain (lens → honeycomb vision → bread scent → thaw) holds; no teleportation or retro-patching. Orientation clean by 120 words; single-scene default met. Bread custom could use earlier dramatized seed, but setup echoes enough to satisfy. Earned stasis lands with felt price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Grotto acoustics, waterfall roar, and creeping ice constrain livelihood and pacing; emerald lens operates as micro-setting that filters discovery. Selective sensory layering (scent of baked ‘E’, crystalline crack) mirrors stakes without catalogue. Spatial clarity maintained through single continuous location. Waterfall and hive do not merely adorn—they gate survival—meeting the 9+ constraint test, though environmental influence on tactics could be sharper mid-scene.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“rescue dying arts” before final freeze—signaled early; pressure escalates via revealed starvation of the hive, tightening options. One meaningful deepening suffices: the shift from “ice = doom” to “ice = empty hive” re-weights conflict and forces cultural performance gambit. Protagonist drives final catalyst (bread scatter). Cost is conceptual—lifelong guardianship—rather than tangible loss, keeping it just shy of 8.8+ where visible price would need greater emphasis.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Themes of cultural continuity versus entropy emerge through sensory particulars (bread scent, honey-light) rather than thesis. Final image crystallizes responsibility without moralizing. Subtext—home as shared practice, not place—runs coherent. Rosewater dread motif threads effectively, though reprise at end is brief; complexity acknowledged in “sharp, sweet responsibility,” resisting tidy comfort. No echoing final moral; resonance earned.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited adheres to Elara’s historically tuned perception, diction consistent (“cultured museum guide”), syntax calm and fluid. No head-hop; psychic distance stable. Compression in crowd scene (“Bewildered, they came…”) is purposeful, taught by urgency. Dialogue minimal yet natural when present. Rhythm modulates—long sentence for dread, staccato “Bring your work!” cry—matching stakes. Voice distinct enough, though could risk higher with more idiosyncratic metaphor palette.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose stays vivid and lean; strong verbs (“spiderweb with light”) and concrete nouns. No synonym loops; metaphors coherent (“monumental waterfall…roared a constant reminder”). Occasional elevated phrase (“rosewater dread”) skirts purple but accrues thematic identity. Filter verbs minimal. Paragraphing purposeful; final line resolves on image. No grammar slips. Occasional soft filler (“She understood”) but not clustered; no artifact touches climax. Clean at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Fusing beekeeping, opera glass, and initial-shaped bread into a revival myth feels fresh; displaced sanctuary behind waterfall adds resonance. Hive-as-heart reconfigures standard “freeze the city” trope. Details particular to this world—song-tapestry, golden honeycomb under ice—resist generic swap. Risk in lyric compression pays off; no gimmick. Could edge higher with one more unconventional cultural artifact, but synthesis already non-obvious and internally coherent.</comment>
