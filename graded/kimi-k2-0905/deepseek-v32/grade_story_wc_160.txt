<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation is legible and consistent; the antique chain and pollen clue give her tactile micro-choices. Interiority is concrete (“her hands began to tremble…from excitement”) and shows stakes. The final choice—clear the hidden valve, keep the old gate—carries visible cost (dust fall, sweat) and is causally earned. Minor slip: “dappled resolve” is used twice as label-speak without fresh embodiment, keeping her just shy of 8+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: pollen clue → measure → locate valve → clear it → breathing steadies. Closure is a Decisive Change with felt cost (groan, dust, easing tremor). Orientation is clean by word 80; no teleporting props. One elasticity point: the volcano’s sudden violent tremor reads like a possible eruption until the text reassures; momentary causality wobble, but closure re-anchors.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid, selective: warm mineral scent, quivering chain links, stone breathing under boots. Micro-setting (stone slab, clogged valve) directly constrains her choices. Spatial choreography tracks clean; no floating rooms. The dormant volcano never rattles the reader’s credibility because the breathing rhythm is established early and paid off in the eased pulse at the end.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—heritage vs safety—signaled in paragraph one and tightened when she discovers the undocumented valve. One meaningful turn: she risks jolting the whole structure to clear it, narrowing options to “supplement, not replace.” Cost is visible (dust, groan, sweat) and alters the amphitheatre’s rhythm. Escalation is single-arc, sufficient for 700-word scope; lacks a second pressure spike that would push it to 8.8+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Theme of “encrypted compassion” emerges through the hidden valve rather than authorial statement. Subtext operates in the builders’ silent mercy and her sweat-cost respect for it. Final image reweights the conflict: legacy and safety can pulse together. One soft moral line—“They had sacrificed glory for safety”—states what the scene has already shown, clipping full resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Elara’s perceptual filter: brass links “gleaming dully,” rhythm of breath under boots. Syntax flexes with pressure—short clauses during the tremor, longer reflective ones after. No head-hopping or filter-verb clutter. Distinct diction (“slyly heartfelt,” “dappled resolve”) risks mannerism but remains consistent and purposeful; registers stay within her machinist lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; rhythm mirrors the volcanic breathing. No paraphrase loops or mixed metaphors. One scaffold phrase: “as the building breathes” repeats four times—intentional motif, but mildly dilutes urgency in the final third. Otherwise high density, concrete verbs, clean grammar; no artifacts touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Premise—hidden thermal relief valve encoded in pollen—feels fresh and specific to this volcano-theatre. Trope of “ancient builders knew best” is transformed through Elara’s machinist decryption and sweat-cost activation. Risk is taken with the breathing-amphitheatre personification, but pattern is taught early and paid off. Not quite revelatory enough for 8.5+ but memorably particular.</comment>
