<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Leo’s grief-backstory is told, not embodied, so the “teach silence to comfort” motive feels abstract until the late encounter with the woman. His micro-choices (tuning device, releasing harmonic) are logical but lack interior contradiction or felt cost; the only risk is the terrace tremor, which he absorbs without setback. The arc lands in a gentle Charged Poise rather than a personal renunciation, so the closure is more atmospheric than character-driven.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure is a legit Conceptual Repricing: the “zero-noise” moment becomes full, not empty, and the woman’s eased breathing shows silence has learned to comfort—cost is the passing crystals and Leo’s unending itinerancy. Causality under the Accumulative/Textural lens holds: whistle → crystals → harmonic → hush. Orientation is clear by line 5; no teleporting props. One minor loop: “in transit, always in transit” restates rather than deepens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>The prism terrace refracts light that Leo bends into a calming glow—an active setting that supplies the final image. Sensory selection favors visual hush over tourist catalog; canal geography is implied, not mapped. Micro-setting (storm glass) constrains timing. No weather clichés or spatial drift; bodies track cleanly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—extend the hush so it comforts—is signaled early. Escalation is density-based: crystals grow → tremor → harmonic release → silence peaks. Agency is present (tuning, frequency release) but stakes never threaten Leo with loss; therisk is merely the natural passing of the phenomenon, so cost feels light. One meaningful tightening lands at the harmonic click that locks noise at zero.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without moralizing: silence as crafted solace, transit as healing limbo. The train-whistle echo reweights from noise-prelude to promise-of-quiet, a nice CR flip. Subtext lives in the crystals’ dissolve—comfort outlasts the storm. No thematic echo sentence; particulars carry the insight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Third-limited stays locked to Leo; perceptual signature is sound-centric and metric (“noise levels dipping”). Prose rhythm is fluidly cadenced yet avoids mechanical “He verbed” runs. Lexicon stays within a gondolier’s plausible range; no filter-verb stacks. Dialogue is minimal but natural when present.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Lines are lean, triple-jobbing atmosphere, motion, and metaphor: “rainbow shards across the water” advances both setting and mood. No mixed metaphors or synonym churn; only minor scaffold: “He began by adjusting…” could drop “began by.” Read-aloud rhythm modulates with the hush. Closure sentence is clean and luminous.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Storm-glass-prophesied silence-storm is fresh; coupling it with a floating prism terrace city feels specific, not quirky overlay. Transit-as-healing and noise-tuning occupation weave into theme without template drag. The core idea would collapse if swapped to generic ferry + weather glass, passing the transformation test. Risk is present but modest; no structural gamble.</comment>
