<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara’s skeptic-to-seer shift is embodied in the cello bow-stroke; the sternum tug migrates from abstract compass to visceral alignment. Retelling-as-method dramatizes internal contradiction, but the epiphany is slightly foreshadow-light—cost is felt yet not fully dramatized on her body or future options. Still, the renunciation of publication lands as credible endurance. Interiority avoids label-speak and stays sensorily anchored.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the hum’s origin story reweights her life mission with conceptual cost—“a door she could now never close.” Accumulative lens holds: each resonance layer deepens pattern until cosmology flips meaning rather than plot. Causality intact: shell→cello→vision→renunciation. No orientation debt; anchors clear by 80 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Abandoned dome, shut eye, cliff sea—all filter through Elara’s instrument-focused gaze, constraining her to acoustic experiment. Half-built cello acts as micro-setting that literally channels the cosmos. “Gloomy cheerfulness” saturates dust-motes and paint-pulse without slipping into tourism. Spatial choreography clean: shell, bow, stand, ledge tracked without drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—decode the hum—tightens when resonance proves the hum is Earth’s own lullaby, foreclosing debunking as a life path. One meaningful deepening suffices: comet-memory re-prices her quest from puzzle to origin myth. No external antagonist needed; internal pressure of disbelief collapsing carries cost. Agency resides in choosing to finish the cello on the new tuning, a visible tactical shift.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges: the myth worth keeping is the shared vibration of all life. No explicit thesis—truth-as-connection surfaces through shell-spiral, comet-cradle, and her refusal to publish. Final image of listening anew offers resonant ambiguity without moral. Subtextual irony: myth-buster becomes myth-keeper without verbal declaration.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Lyrical third-person hovers close to Elara’s perceptual filter: “ephemeral compass,” “blind eye,” “cosmic joke” mirror her skeptical lexicon. Rhythm modulates—long cadence for reflection, clipped for bow-stroke moment. No dialogue, so voice remains internally coherent. Filter verbs (“she understood”) are minimal and earned under transformative pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and syntactic shape; density high—“the hum was the fading echo of that primordial impact” packs origin, metaphor, and stakes. No scaffold loops; figurative language disciplined to one vehicle per beat. Occasional elevated diction (“precursors of life”) stays within astronomer-lean POV. Final line lands with echoic brevity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Familiar “scientist hears cosmic truth” arc is inverted: discovery is not alien but earthly, not message but memory. Painted shell-as-cradle and cello-as-telescope feel idiosyncratic and inevitable in hindsight. Risk in lyric stillness pays off—no forced twist. Specificity of comet-seeding frequency rescues premise from New-Age generality.</comment>
