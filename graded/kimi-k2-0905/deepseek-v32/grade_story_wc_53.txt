<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Kael’s regret and hunger for borrowed memory are vivid; the moment he drops the spent camera wheel embodies cost. Still, his “young carousel-worker” ghost speaks in distilled admonition that tilts toward editorial summary, muting the interior contradiction that could have made their negotiation cut deeper.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each captured fragment thickens the murmur until the lagoon’s surface stills and the ghost arrives, a clear Resonant Reconfiguration. All motion obeys the taught logic of “collecting echoes,” so causality feels inevitable even though nothing is explosively “solved.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The lagoon’s moving mirror and the cracked plastic wheel are tactile anchors that charge the final renunciation; clouds, mist, and glassy water narrow Kael’s options as surely as walls would. Spatial choreography stays clean, and sensory selection favors hearing, fitting a story about stolen voices.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Stake—recover a self unlost—remains single and legible; the pressure tightens when the camera exhausts its film, forcing the choice to relinquish borrowed pasts. The ghost’s challenge deepens the cost, but escalation is more cadence-shift than irreversible fork, keeping it just shy of high-band punch.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges as the futility of curating others’ echoes to plaster one’s own absence; the quiet drop of the wheel lands harder than any sermon. No moral is stated—only the image of still water recharged with motion—letting ambiguity linger without confusion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Faded-carnival diction (“plastic spine,” “brilliant lights,” “stalling time”) stays filtered through Kael’s regret-tinged perception; rhythm swells then thins as the lagoon quiets. No head-hop, no POV drift; the lyric compression is pattern-taught from line one and paid off in the final hush.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, and mostly loop-free; figurative layering is restrained until late, when mixed metaphors (“kinetic haze,” “murmuring tapestry”) crowd the ghost’s arrival. The small cluster dulls immediacy but does not obscure the closure image, so the penalty is modest.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The “memory-scavenger with a disposable camera above a cloud-lagoon” conceit feels fresh, yet the ghostly confrontation slides toward familiar self-help cadence. Specific sensory detail and the final motion-restart save it from template predictability, yielding a solid high-mid score.</comment>
