<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The queen’s interior contradiction—duty versus self-knowledge—remains abstract; no embodied micro-choice on the ridge alters tactics. The keeper is a silent prop, so status shift is nil. Closure renunciation is signaled but not paid for with sensory cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal spine holds: warning → dream → climb → shared breath → conceptual repricing of power. Orientation anchored by word 80; no teleport. Final image reweights “bleeding starlight” as the price of crown, a legible CR with conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Cobalt grotto is vividly sensed—twilight walls, hissing star-pools—yet the environment never physically constrains her choices; she could step back without penalty. Micro-setting (her breath) becomes the active tool, earning partial credit.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“unravel dreams or lose self”—is declared early. Middle beat (shared exhale) tightens knowledge but does not foreclose a live option; no visible price alters later tactics. Escalation is epistemic, not tactical, sufficient for short form.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme of power’s fragile lace emerges through bleeding starlight and firefly ephemera without moralizing. Final reconfiguration lands via image, not assertion. Ambiguity lingers: reign continues, but cost is now visible.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person lyric voice sustains twilight cadence; diction stays within royal lexicon. Repetition of “lacy menace” and “shared exhale” is purposeful motif, not loop. No head-hop; perceptual signature remains queen-bound.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Sentences vary length; no scaffold loops. Occasional poetic surplus (“delicate web of dread”) does not stall momentum. High-density lines carry both atmosphere and causality. Closure image is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Familiar “monarch confronts mystic cave” frame is refreshed by bleeding starlight as slow soul-tax and fireflies birthed from breath. Synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk is moderate; no structural gimmicks.</comment>
