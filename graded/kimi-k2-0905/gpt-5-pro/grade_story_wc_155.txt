<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Interiority is gorgeously embodied and idiosyncratic—"heart light, shoes muddied with someone's happy yesterday." Micro-choices (threading film, baiting roots with marmalade) spring from a coherent, evolving motive to gift rather than hoard joy. The final renunciation—leaving the fresco under the roots, rewinding the reel—pays the cost visibly and crystallizes the arc. No contradictions, no label-speak; pressure bends her but never flattens voice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: lyric shards stack like lantern-glass until the closing image reweights the whole. Orientation is taught by line 3 ("bruised pear") and never breaks; each fragment (fresco, reel, jam recipe) returns with added charge. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: "I had not saved the past; instead I had displayed it long enough to be contagious"—undeniable social cost, felt on page. No causal gaps, no soft resets; fog’s bleach is the only coincidence and it complicates, not rescues.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Orchard-fog is not backdrop but emulsion—"a slow, breathing darkroom"—that literally swallows and reprojects images; this environmental agency constrains every tactical choice (where to string bulbs, when to let the image blur). Micro-setting objects—crate that once held honey, tin curled like a fern—are handled, weighted, and left changed. Final image of sticky pockets and chiming bulbs is inseparable from the district’s texture. Meets 9+ gate: setting charges the closing frame.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—rediscover lost joy without turning it into a museum—threads every beat. Pressure escalates as fog aggressively reclaims the projected boy; artist’s only agency is to surrender the display rather than hoard it, a tightening that forecloses possession and reweights the stake. Cost is unmistakable: she departs with only "sticky pockets," the fresco abandoned beneath roots. One meaningful turn suffices; luck merely dims the reel, never solves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges entirely through image and gesture: joy is an exposed emulsion—ruin if kept, radiance if projected. No overt thesis; final jam-recipe promise acts as conceptual repricing, turning heritage into shareable ritual. Ambiguity lingers—will the orchard re-broadcast?—but complexity is embraced. Subtext operates in silence: grandmother’s wink across decades speaks more than any manifesto could.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is intoxicatingly consistent—daydream fold, orchard as bruised pear, laughter chaffing fog like birds. Syntax flexes with emotional dilation: long breathless sentences during projection, staccato jags when bulbs trip. No head-hopping; unreliability is signaled early ("streets that knew my shoes before I did"). Diction stays inside lyric-muralist lexicon—"spare dawns," "projector on a honey-crate"—no register drift. Read-aloud rhythm modulates from woozy to wink without losing control.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Near-zero scaffold; each sentence at least dual-purpose. Metaphors are kept physically loyal—fog as emulsion, roots as antennae—no mixed-vehicle crashes. Information density is surgical: "weighed cables with stones" implies weather worry, manual skill, and precarious tech in five words. Minor loop risk in repeated "laugh/light" chiming, but it pattern-teaches the contagion motif and pays off in final bulbs-chime. No artifacts touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresco-as-projector-screen and orchard-as-darkroom synthesize vintage media tropes into a fresh epistemology of memory. Risky second-person flirtation ("you") appears once but is absorbed by dream-logic. Grandmother’s jam recipe as closure codex is a non-obvious yet inevitable reconfiguration. Conceptual integrity never retreats; specificity ("apricot laughter," "crooked ladder introduced itself like an old friend") prevents postcard fog-pastoral. Bold lyric accumulation heightens rather than obscures stakes.</comment>
