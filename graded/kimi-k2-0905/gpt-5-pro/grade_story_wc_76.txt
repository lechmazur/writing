<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The clock-maker’s stubborn inventiveness is shown through tactile micro-choices—winding runes into gears, tasting iron, tightening screws while hearing sobs—each feeding the obsessive interior contradiction. The sister-as-missing-stake motive stays primal and unabstracted; every backward tick visibly costs him years of regret, earning the final renunciation. No diagnostic label-speak; body and tool are one under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lattice holds: yoyo → reverse gear → lens swallows its own beam → sister steps out of storm-time, each linkage legible and irreversible. Closure is Earned Stasis: he binds the yoyo-pendulum vow, forfeiting outward rescue to keep ships safely unwitnessed; cost is the nightly feeding of regret-years to the stone. Orientation taught early by the “slow exhale of low tide” and rocky island anchoring; no set-piece teleporting.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment> Hunger stone, brass cradle, cracked lens, and counterclock teeth are handled, weighed, traced—objects become micro-setting that constrain every mechanical reversal. Lighthouse shifts from outward beacon to inward lung, spatial choreography exact. Stone’s “mouth that never closed” reappears at closure, now fed by the narrator’s yearly regret, charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—retrieve sister from storm-death—is tightened when the lens inhales light and time slows to expose her outline; option to “rewrite the storm” is foreclosed, replaced by rendezvous inside reversed grammar. Cost is legible: he forfeits linear life, nightly feeding the stone one year of regret. Agency drives every beat; no coincidence rescues.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges as time’s grammar versus grief’s appetite: “step beyond fate’s design” reframed into living inside fate’s backward dialect. Motif of inward light—latent radiance hoarded like diver’s breath—ripens from lyric seed to mechanical payoff without moralizing. Final image of stone dreaming of rain reweights prior etchings, offering resonant ambiguity rather than thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>First-person texture is inseparable from clockwork mind: syntax ticks, verbs like “kissing backward,” diction of sprockets and tides. Perceptual signature selective—starlight pools, dry thunder under finger—never generic. No head-hop; unreliability is subtle (moon’s silence = consent). Compression taught early (“neatly inventive and stubborn against design”) and paid off in braided yoyo-pendulum vow.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>High information density: one sentence may anchor tide, yoyo timing, and planetary gear. Rhythm mirrors tide-breath without algorithmic pattern. One paraphrase loop (“slow exhale” appears twice) but functions as deliberate tidal echo, not scaffold. Mixed metaphors (“lighthouse inhaled its own beacon”) are coherent under reversed physics rule taught on-page.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: grief-driven clockmaker uses toy-yoyo runes to reverse lighthouse beam into hunger stone, retrieving sister from storm-time. Inversion of beacon—light swallowed, not cast—feels inevitable once taught. Risky lyric compression holds causal clarity. Specificity throughout (brass teeth, planet gears, spidered glass) prevents abstract gimmickry.</comment>
