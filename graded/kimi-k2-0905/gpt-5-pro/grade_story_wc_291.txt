<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lio’s face-blindness, methodical gait-counting, and grief-mapping are vividly embodied; the ribbon test and polework externalize his limits under pressure. Interior contradiction peaks when he names the rescuer’s knot in reverse—proof he sees guilt though he cannot see faces. The captain’s confession lands as credible collapse because Lio’s prior restraint has foreclosed easy absolution. Only minor sag: “wanted to awaken dormant empathy” drifts toward thesis; the portrait itself enacts this, need not be named.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: drip, click, ribbon sway tighten density until the submerged snag reframes both men. Closure is a Charged Poise—painting freezes captain’s wrists in self-arrest, cost legible in shared outline. Orientation clean by line 6; no prop or knowledge teleport. Metronome+ribbon pattern taught early and paid off in final image; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Quarry-as-mirror constrains every move: black glass bans loud steps, silt demands pole probe, mist hides faces yet reflects guilt. Ribbon’s algae film and “quarry’s slow alphabet” charge the final canvas; environment literally stains the evidence. Spatial choreography flawless—pole, tripod, boots, car on ridge all tracked. Micro-setting gate cleared: ribbon+water+branch triad enables the climagic snag and bell-tone memory.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can a portrait force a town to re-see the vanished—signals in paragraph 3. One meaningful tightening: ribbon snag → knot recognition collapses captain’s rehearsed alibi, narrows options to confession or silence. Cost legible in captain’s emptied minute and self-clasped wrists. No escalation drift; mist, metronome, ribbon accrue rather than reverse, fitting accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</question><comment>Theme emerges from inverse portraiture: likeness achieved by mapping absence, guilt rendered via texture not visage. Final image of “doubled figure” offers non-literal answer—art unifies survivor & perpetrator without absolution. No moralizing; meaning stays in algae-stained ribbon and self-arrested wrists. “Furrowed hush” motif modulates from landscape to emotional silence, charging closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person tight clings to Lio’s sensory substitution—temperature of grief, ribbon as kite, knot felt not seen. Syntax mimics methodical mind: balanced clauses, tactile verbs (“lance,” “press,” “count”). No head-hops; captain’s interior arrives only through breath stumble and dialogue indirection. Register stable—no sudden academic diction; “quarry’s slow alphabet” stays within artist-poet lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</question><comment>High information density: one sentence often paints motion, sensorium, metaphor (“ribbon…skimming like a child’s kite over black glass”). Rhythm breathes with scene—shorter clauses during snag, longer during painting. No loops or scaffold; no mixed metaphors. Minor overwrite: “furrowed hush” repeated twice; second could prune. Otherwise exemplary control under 800-word ceiling.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</question><comment>Premise—face-blind portraitist solves cold case by texture and grief—feels inevitable yet fresh. Risky second-person moment (“You paint the ones we fail”) is earned because captain’s voice fractures under pressure. Transformation test passed: swap artist for detective and entire plot collapses. Specificity of rescuer’s reversed knot, algae ribbon, metronome clicks creates memorable signature.</comment>
