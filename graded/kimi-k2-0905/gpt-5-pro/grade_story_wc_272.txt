<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Interiority is lush and embodied—“luminescent ache” felt in her delayed brush-stroke—but the decisive shift from paralysis to painting again is asserted more than dramatized; we watch her untangle rope, not canvas. Still, the contradiction between needing light and fearing its shards stays live in scene and charges the final image.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the released shutter-beam re-lights her vocation; cost is the tacit acceptance that every portrait will carry fracture. Causal chain holds—untangle rope → free lens → internal window lifts—though the “descent into darkness” motive is stated early and never tested in a beat of real hazard.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lighthouse-as-library, dust-bodied sentences, moon-rings on floorboards: environment is textured, specific, and filters through her artist-eye; the shutter-ropes braided with hair-fine wires become the tool that constrains her choice and charges the final sweep of light.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</question><comment>Dominant stake—can she still paint when reality fragments?—tightens once: the shutter’s refusal to open literalises her blockage; freeing it re-opens her gaze. Cost is present but soft: no external jeopardy, no forfeited object, only the internal ache made visible in beam.</comment>

<question>5</question><question>8.6</question><comment>Theme emerges organically: art as lighthouse,碎片化的 reality as weather to be charted, not fixed. Final image—portraits lit by “the ache that could also heal”—offers a non-literal answer that reweights earlier cards, twine, and lens without moralising.</comment>

<question>6</question><answer>8.8</question><comment>Voice is painterly, synaesthetic, yet controlled: fog “feathers,” dust “bodies itself,” gears “shiver.” Rhythm swells and narrows with pressure; no head-hopping; diction stays within her perceptual lexicon. Minor over-indulgence in compound tropes but pattern is consistent and taught early.</comment>

<question>7</question><answer>8.1</question><comment>Almost every sentence carries double duty—image + causality—yet occasional metaphor stacks (“storm moved in the glass as if the tower were an eyeball”) risk overwriting. No loops or scaffold; final paragraph’s luminescent ache lands cleanly. Read-aloud rhythm varies, but cadence edges toward litany in mid-section.</comment>

<question>8</question><answer>8.7</question><comment>Fusing tarot, lighthouse, and painter’s block could feel grafted; here the lighthouse library and card-map feel inevitable. “Redesign the way her eyes hold a life” is a fresh angle on artist-recovery trope. Risky lyric density is sustained without obscuring causality; specific, non-obvious synthesis rewards re-reading.</comment>
