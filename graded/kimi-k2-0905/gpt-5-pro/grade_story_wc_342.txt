<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The face-blind portraitist is vividly interiorized through perceptual idiosyncrasies—mapping ceilings, breathing plaster—so interior contradiction is alive. Motive stays legible: finish a sky-portrait before demolition; every micro-choice (rubbing coin, mixing lime) feeds that goal. Cost surfaces in the final renunciation—leaving the coin and the room—yet the emotional price is more implied than embodied; an extra beat of body-level fatigue or grief would have nailed the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens: each sensual layer (graphite bloom, migrating cracks, gold constellations) thickens the stake rather than linear cause-and-effect. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the room exhales a portable sky, the imminent wreckage now weighted with unlosable memory—cost is felt in the dare to “breathe here later.” Transitions are seamless; orientation is taught by line 3 and never drifts. A hairline slip: the rubbing-to-wall pinning beat is compressed; the instant of decision could be sharper.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setting is texture engine: the tree-trunk library’s warm sap, swelling book-spines, and migrating cracks actively constrain where paint can adhere and where stars must be gilded. Sensory hierarchy mirrors the protagonist’s perceptual bias—sound of held breath, smell of old lime—so environment and body fuse. The imminent demolition clock charges every detail; the crane’s cough is a metronome. One micro-gap: spatial relation of “chemistry shelves” to the tin could be cleaner, but it never confuses action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—finish the sky-portrait before obliteration—tightens through texture accretion rather than successive reversals; each painted wall forecloses blankness and consumes dwindling minutes. A visible price is paid: the protagonist surrenders the coin and any future claim on the room, leaving the art vulnerable to rubble. Pressure is coherent and escalates via sensory intensification (siren throat, wet lime swell). The lack of an external obstacle beyond the clock keeps this just under the 8.8 gate.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: the impossibility of preserving people drives the compulsion to preserve spaces, turning portraiture inside-out. Subtext lives in gesture—the coin returned like seed, the child’s “Dad” sun—quietly reframing loss into stewardship. No moral is stated; the final note invites breath, not interpretation. The reweighting of “sky inside walls” as portable, face-blind memory gives the conceptual punch that secures 9.0.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>First-person voice is perceptually signature: ceilings breathe, cracks migrate, graphite blooms—diction never drifts into generic lyricism. Rhythm modulates with task urgency; short flick-bird sentences mirror brush speed under siren threat. Compression and elision (“I quicken without hurriedness”) are taught early and paid off in the final hush. The 9-band is blocked only by a few lush phrases that flirt with purple but stay legible.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Line-level craft is high: information-dense double-duty lines (“Graphite dust blooms like night…”) advance image and map simultaneously. No paraphrase loops; metaphors stay physically coherent. Micro-scaffold appears in two adjacent “I paint…” anaphoras, but the pattern serves cadence and is broken before closure. A single mixed vehicle (“held chord” / “held oath”) is forgiven for sonic payoff.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: face-blindness + sky-portraiture + doomed tree-library yields an inevitable-feeling concept. Risk-taking—lyric accumulative structure, no antagonist, quiet ending—heightens rather than obscures meaning. Specificity (moss index spine shudders, migrating bird flicks) prevents abstraction. The coin-map rubric feels newly mythic yet grounded in tactile process, meriting the +0.2 risk bonus inside the 9-band.</comment>
