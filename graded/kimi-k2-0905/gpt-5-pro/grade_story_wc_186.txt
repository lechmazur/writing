<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Kera’s interiority is sensorially concrete—palms to trembling panes, exhaled rhythm matching remembered engine—and her retrocognitive curse enables micro-choices that alter beam angles. Flaws (obsessive pattern-seeking) complicate, and the final stance crystallizes with visible cost: she forecloses personal retreat by calling strangers home, rope-toughening her thistle hope. Motive progression is causally tracked; no diagnostic label-speak. Voice stays distinct; no headcount penalty since choreography remains clean.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the green flare answer re-weights coincidences into communion, cost felt in the swallowed-pulse risk of inviting unknown survivors. Lens is Causal: every star-path adjustment and resin tweak is a because/therefore linkage. Orientation anchored by word 30 (“Kera listened”). Persistent constraint—mended prism still fragile—shapes final tactics and image. No lens ambiguity; cost legible in final beam sweep.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Glass humming pavilion constrains beam timbre and recharges closure when its song threads into the flare reply; micro-setting of prism tooth-gap literally directs light paths. Salt-wind dunes evolve as beacon light re-colonizes wreckage, environmental change causally tracked. Sensory hierarchy—sound of wind-glass, taste of salt, sight of kelp-green flare—mirrors internal tuning. No static white-room; spatial choreography clean through rusted stairs and lensbed crawl.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“prove coincidences have meaning”—tightens when first beam dies, forcing retro-cognitive plunge to recover calibration; options narrow to risk inviting outsiders. Escalation beats: shard canting (resin + copper), wheel snag, memory-dive, second beam success, flare answer. Cost is visceral: swallowed pulse, thistle hope toughening to rope. No off-stage luck resolves; all turns stem from Kera’s agency under causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Theme emerges non-declaratively: meaning is not inherent but engineered by attentive labor—prism resin, star angles, swallowed hush. Subtext carried in silence of shard, green flare’s kelp-color nod, thistle metaphor ripening into rope. Final image reweights earlier coincidences as communal ligatures, not solipsistic signs. No sermonizing; resonance via concrete particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays close-behind Kera’s perceptual signature—wind-combed dunes, calico pouch of grit—syntax flexes with whale-turn wheel groan. No head-hopping; distance stable. Diction within retrocognizer’s lexicon (“angles true,” “syllables in wind”). Rhythmic control: long breathy clauses for memory dives, staccato resin-whisper for repair. No filter-verb stacks; metaphor coherent (“river discovering a forgotten braid”).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances light, sound, or motive. High density: “nested the broken crystal prism in the cradle, its stump turned toward the gap that ached like a mouth” does three jobs in 21 words. Figurative language balanced—no purple drift; metaphors obey physical logic (light as river, thistle as rope). Final line cadence echoes opening wind-glass music, closing sonic circle. Minor scaffold: one “then” opener in final third, but clarity intact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Post-collapse star-navigation via singing glass pavilion fused with retrocognitive lighthouse keeper feels inevitable yet fresh. Shard of hush—sound-eating crystal—transports familiar relic quest into acoustic metaphysics. Risk taken: lyric accumulative structure, but pattern taught early (constellation-notes) and closure legible. Synthesis cannot survive synonym swap; specificity of resin-spider copper thread and kelp-green flare is irreplaceable. Emotional truth > gimmickry.</comment>
