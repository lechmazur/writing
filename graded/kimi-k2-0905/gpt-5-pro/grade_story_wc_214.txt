<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The janitor’s interiority is textured and embodied—“the ache that opens when I sweep dust”—but the turn that converts salvage crew empathy into a reprieve feels slightly too tidy; the micro-choice to hand over the lantern glass works, yet the crew’s rapid moral shift lacks a visible cost that would make the stillness earned. Still, the character’s flaws and contradictions are legible, and the final endurance reads as a credible renunciation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the sky’s rush reconfigures the station’s fate and the crew’s stance, with the lantern glass passed hand-to-hand as visible cost. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—the meteor shower’s density shift reweights the stake—and the pattern holds cleanly. One minor causality wobble: the decommission notice arrives off-stage and the crew’s instant conversion is slightly convenient, but the final image crystallizes options without contradiction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The tracking station is evoked through tactile, lived detail—“antennas sit like patient vertebrae,” “rails were asleep”—and the yellow lantern glass functions as micro-setting that constrains the final choice. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: the narrator notices frost, ozone, chalk dust, not tourist vistas. The environment directly shapes action: the open shutters invite the sky’s agreement, so the setting charges the closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserve the station from salvage—tightens when the crew arrives with measuring tape; the meteor shower provides the decisive intensification that reweights cost. Agency is present: the narrator’s choice to trace the shower live and pass the lantern glass forces the crew’s stance crystallization. The price is legible: the foreman forgets the deadline, a social forfeiture that lands on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: vulnerability as strength, attention as repair. No abstract sermon—wisdom is earned through chalk maps and the held-bird image. The final “garden of pauses” reprises earlier stillness without naming it, achieving Conceptual Repricing that lingers. The piece avoids tidy moral equations; ambiguity remains fertile.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The lyric first-person voice carries a distinct perceptual signature: cosmic janitor who sees “cosmos hiding in each glittering grit.” Syntax modulates with pressure—short clauses during the shower rush, longer rivering sentences in reflection. No dialogue to distort, so internal voice coherence is flawless. Register stays within the narrator’s plausible lexicon; the occasional elevated phrase (“primal elegance”) reads as earned poetic license.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm is varied and purposeful; no template cadence or synonym loops. Metaphors are coherent—“river that says, hush”—and do not collide. Information density is high: one sentence often does two jobs (advance + atmosphere). Minor scaffold: “I mop the night” repeats at open and close, but the reprise is intentional and paid off. No artifact touches the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The cosmic-janitor frame is fresh, and the station-as-lung metaphor feels inevitable in hindsight. The stakes are inverted: saving a decrepit observatory becomes saving the capacity to notice. Risky lyric accumulation pays off in the final “garden of pauses,” a resonant reconfiguration. Specificity throughout—“tin cup taped to a mast”—prevents abstraction from drifting into gimmickry.</comment>
