<comment>The Fractal weaver’s interiority is vivid and embodied—kerosene ritual, whale-bone cord across shoulders—but the final “acceptance of the circle” is announced more than dramatized; we feel the ribbon’s tug only after the valley-person speaks, not through an active renunciation that costs on the page. Interior contradiction is present (stay/bind vs. leave/release) yet remains lyric-stated rather than forced through a micro-choice that visibly forecloses a path. Still, the sensory anchoring of motive in metal breath and scallop-cool shingles keeps this solidly above the 7-band.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the narrator’s stitched cord becomes an Earned Stasis—visible ribbon-net of service—whose cost is felt when the valley figure nods and the shingles lift. Causality is Accumulative/Textural; pattern of “orienting properly” repeats and tightens until lamp-star alignment reweights meaning rather than inventing new plot turns. Orientation is anchored by line 3 (“After the first snowmelt…”), well within the 120-word window. The only minor slip: the final “freedom is a circle” statement could have been left to the image alone.</comment>

<comment>Bronze grotto functions as micro-setting: its breathing seams and dripstone kiln literally constrain how grief is calcified and stored; the kerosene flame must be blue because “the grotto respected flame more than breath.” Starlight on metal scales provides the final orienting axis, charging the closure image. Spatial choreography is immaculate—lamp tilt, shingle click, salt-pine breezes track cleanly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—can the valley shed its burdens and can the weaver carry them—tightens through one meaningful deepening: each newly weighed grief (widow’s absence, boy’s tremor, unfinished boat) incrementally overloads the cord until the valley itself appears to ask the price. Agency remains the weaver’s decision to calcify and stitch rather than abandon. Cost is visible: the cord’s whalebone bend across shoulders and the perpetually lengthening grotto map. No extrinsic antagonist needed; pressure is situational and accretive.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through concrete particularity: weight as shareable once named, binding as ribbon that runs “every way at once.” Subtext resides in hush-shingles that click like mute syllables—silence itself becomes a language the weaver must read. Final image reweights premise without moralizing: the circle of service is accepted, not preached. No abstract thesis statements; the whalebone reverie stays implicit.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>First-person voice carries a fractal perceptual signature—recursive syntax (“paths folded back into themselves”), metallurgic diction (“quiet metal,” “scale of quiet flashed a measure”)—that never breaks cadence under pressure. Compressed lyric elision (“I walked hours without moving from a single idea”) is taught early and paid off at closure. No dialogue to distort voice; internal register stays consistent with kerosene, cedar, and calcite lexicon. Rhythm modulates: long breath-coil sentences for immersion, truncated fragments (“So I turned…”) at pivot.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet limpid—each sentence layers image and metaphor without paraphrase loops. “Seams licked back with stories of cargoes” performs double duty: sensory action and world lore. Mixed-metaphor risk is flirted but controlled: whalebone reverie / metal tide / shingled hush all serve the acoustic-silence motif. Only minor scaffold: “some burdens need soft weather…” list could have been one sentence; still, it occurs early and does not occlude closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The conceit—valley outsourcing emotional ballast to a fractal weaver who literally threads grief into wearable beads—is non-obvious and fully committed. Tropes of snowmelt redemption and star-navigation are inverted: orientation becomes a lamp-tilt ritual rather than escape vector. Fresh synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight; remove any detail (kerosene, shingles, calcified bead) and the emotional arithmetic collapses. Risk in lyric abstraction pays off because pressure stays legible.</comment>
