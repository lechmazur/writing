<comment>Broker's dual impulse—ledger precision vs. quiet gratitude—surfaces in micro-choices (ferrying cards, counting cranes). Interiority stays maritime-specific; no therapy-speak. Final endurance of "whispers" over shouts is earned via the因果链 of shared cocoa/locket. Cost is felt: he forecloses public acclaim for invisible labor, and that renunciation lingers.</comment>

<comment>Accumulative/textural lens: images (ledger, cocoa, locket, breeze) accrue then re-weight in the closing tableau. Closure = Charged Poise: ledger breathes, options recalibrated, cost legible ("I keep delivering names"). Orientation clean by line 5; no lens ambiguity. Persistent constraint: silent contributors remain unseen, a price the narrator now shoulders.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Salt-lemon tables, gull-glides, open-window sails—selective harbor details filtered through cargo eyes. Micro-setting: ledger-book itself becomes final lighthouse, constraining future silence vs. fame choice. Spatial track clean; no floating rooms. Could use one more body-level cue at climax for 8+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: visibility for invisible labor. Tightening occurs when duo chooses whisper-campaign over banners; live option (public praise) foreclosed. Cost: perpetual anonymity accepted. Escalation accumulative—each card/cocoa beat thickens texture rather than causal turns; pattern breaks at ledger-breath final image, reweighting stakes under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from particulars: cocoa steams, cranes lift, ledger breathes—silent labor made palpable. No moralizing; final image answers thematic question non-literally. Resonant reconfiguration: invisible work becomes priceless, public applause cheap. Ambiguity preserved—city still unaware, only reader/narrator complicit—inviting reflection without sermon.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>First-person maritime voice: "counting crates and reading tides," rhythmic, concise. Syntax mirrors cargo mind: lists, parentheses, star/crane equations. No head-hop; interiority stable. Distinct perceptual signature sustained under pressure. Filter verbs minimal; diction stays within plausible broker lexicon. Final line cadence earns Charged Poise.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>High density: "gulls edit the sky with quiet glides" does three jobs. No loops or scaffold; sentences vary openings. One mixed metaphor—"lighthouse" on ledger page—minor, doesn't obscure closure. Lemon-salt, cocoa steam, velvet pouch: concrete nouns over modifiers. Read-aloud rhythm supports cautious exuberance without drumbeat monotony.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: cargo manifest + gratitude ledger = invisible labor archive. Locket photo cycles compassion across docks/stage, transforming stock "small world" trope. Risk: lyric quiet ending in sub-800 words; payoff legible. Slight familiarity of "cocoa warmth" motif keeps it from 8+. Still, angle feels non-obvious and emotionally specific.</comment>
