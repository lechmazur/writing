<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The tutor’s self-forgiveness arc is embodied through knot-tying micro-choices; the contradiction between teaching sacrifice and needing mercy is kept alive in scene. Final wrist-knot carries visible cost, earning the turn. Interiority stays concrete, but the prince remains off-stage, slightly blurring the relational crucible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each mended thread tightens the ambient hush until the final knot reweights the entire tapestry. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—crows shred sky, time resumes—cost is felt in the empty palm. Orientation, causality, and pattern are taught by 120 words and paid off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Platinum labyrinth, midair snow, and bone pawn act as micro-settings that constrain tying choices and charge the final image. Selective sensory detail (mid-blink eyelid, stiff rope) reflects POV’s tactical focus. Environment is woven through action, never catalogued.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—self-forgiveness—tightens when each mended thread forces the tutor to confront another victim of his lessons. Mid-story silver-thread loosening is the visible pressure turn that forecloses the option of permanent exile. Cost is legible on-page with every completed knot.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of restorative versus destructive strategy emerges from concrete loom-work rather than thesis. Final image—“opening called mercy”—reconfigures chess vocabulary into ethical praxis without moralizing. Subtext stays in thread color, knot tension, and pawn left behind.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyric first-person carries a precise perceptual signature: tactical chess mind filters frozen village through endgame vocabulary. Rhythm compresses under knot-tying beats, then widens into repose. No head-hopping; diction stays within tutor’s plausible lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High-density lines perform multiple jobs—image, motion, metaphor—without scaffold. Figurative language is patterned and paid off (“snow hung midair like a held breath” → “snow finally fell as snow”). One mixed metaphor (“shreds of sky”) is minor, does not dull closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Frozen-time loom-healing is fresh synthesis of chess and tapestry tropes; concept commits fully without retreat. Risky lyric compression is taught early and remains legible. Transformation test passes: story would collapse without knot-mercy conceit.</comment>
