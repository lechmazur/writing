<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The amoral-philanthropist / secretly-sentimental contradiction is lived in-scene: every micro-choice—demanding the engines stay off, cradling the egg, whispering lost names—lets us watch the conflicted impulse spark. Interiority is concrete (“I belonged to it”) and embodied in the tremor of a hatchling against palm. The final narrowing of the water release is an earned renunciation that carries visible cost on ledger and conscience. Voice stays singular, no head-hop; status pressure is off-page (directors on ridge) yet shapes every beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each image—salt mirror, cracked rivers, ceramic bowl—adds density until the hatchling’s first note reframes the whole basin as resonant chamber. Closure is a Charged Poise: future water rations are foreclosed, the song is already echoing, cost is felt in “promise hurt.” No orientation drift; who/where/when anchored by line 3. Causality intact: manufactured drought → salt flat → chamber discovery → egg placement → echo release. The final rain carrying the earlier song is the conceptual re-pricing that locks the lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Salt flat is not backdrop but instrument: its thermal throat breathes, amplifies, and ultimately reproduces the bird’s song. Micro-setting—the ceramic bowl, the valve hiss—constrains every tactical choice. Sensory hierarchy obeys POV: financier notices satellite mosaics, ledger teeth, then the tremor of down. Final image of rain “carrying the earlier song” makes environment and memory indivisible.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: can the protagonist buy himself a genuine echo without bankrupting his leverage? Pressure tightens from gala demand → single egg → hourly water gift; each step narrows options and raises reputational cost. Agency drives every turn—decision to withhold full release is on-page with ledger-teeth reminder. Cost is visible: future drought contracts stay intact, “promise hurt” is acknowledged.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from pattern: echo as commodity vs. echo as living memory. Subtext layered in gesture—stolen museum bowl, unpaid hush—avoids thesis statements. Final rain-song reweights earlier satellite map without moralizing. Sentimentality is indicted yet indulged; complexity survives.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Perceptual signature is financier-poet: precise valuations (“priced it handsomely”) collide with conch-shell memory. Rhythm breathes with scene—long sentences during thermal sighs, fragments at crack-widening. No filter-verb stacks; diction stays within lexicon of someone who commissions de-extinction. Compression (“thunder muttered like an old judge”) is taught early and paid off when rain returns carrying song.</answer>

<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or stakes. Metaphors are coherent—salt as mirror, chamber as throat—and obey physical logic. High density: “humanizing the emptiness” does characterization, setting, and moral pivot in four words. No artifact touches closure line.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses eco-financier noir with resurrection lyric; the drought-made mirror as recording device feels inevitable yet new. Risk—refusing gala spectacle for unpaid hush—heightens meaning without obscuring clarity. Specificity down to stolen museum ceramic and hourly valve schedule prevents swap-out. Synthesis of capital guilt and animal awe is non-obvious and durable.</comment>
