<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied—"I warmed my hands and my thoughts"—and the archivist’s methodical nature visibly shapes micro-choices (tracing braid, pulse-check). The final renunciation of apology feels earned because earlier beats show the same temperament choosing conversation over force. A trace more contradiction in-scene would nudge it into the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the bell’s “clarified hour” re-weights the absent week and relaxes the vellum, cost felt in the dust path and the door’s disappearance. Causal linkage holds—each gear-check and braid-pull tightens options toward the single ring. A hairline slip: the diplomat’s seal is revealed as map rather than earned discovery, slightly diluting causality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The mechanism room functions as micro-setting: gear teeth, pendulum, and ceremonial rope constrain every move; the rope’s braid pattern is the puzzle and key. Sensory selection is urgent—metal breath, dust trace—filtered through archivist bias. Final image of dust writing the restored week on the floor recharges earlier “fables of absence.” Specificity is irreplicable; setting is story engine.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—restoring erased time—signals early (“translate confusion into clarity”). Escalation is accumulative: each archive relic tightens the contradiction until the rope re-braid forcibly merges schedules. Cost is legible in the bell’s new cadence and the door’s vanishing. A slightly sharper midpoint tightening would make the price unavoidable sooner.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from particulars: absence as a mechanical glitch, history as braided tension. The final image of the tower “not apologizing” refuses moralizing and reconfigures the premise—clarity is coaxed, not conquered. Subtext lives in silence: the bell speaks only once, yet rewires civic memory. Avoids tidy moral; ambiguity is productive.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Voice is distinct—archival precision married to lyric compression (“civic patience,” “weather for the mind”). Syntax mirrors method: catalog phrasing, parenthetical clauses, then crystalline final line. No head-hopping; perceptual signature holds. Diction stays within plausible archivist lexicon while reaching for metaphor—risky but paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentence lengths contract under gear-touch tension, then elongate during rope-work. Information density high—one sentence often does three jobs (“Its fibers remembered many hands…”). Zero paraphrase loops; no mixed metaphors. A single overripe adjective pair (“slow intention”) is all that keeps this from 9+.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Premise—clock tower keeps two secret schedules—feels fresh yet inevitable. Tropes (magical door, archive mystery) are inverted: the door retires once clarity is served, not power claimed. Rope-braid as code is specific to this world. Risk taken: lyric archival voice carries plot, and coherence holds. Transformation test: swap names and the braid-logic collapses.</comment>
