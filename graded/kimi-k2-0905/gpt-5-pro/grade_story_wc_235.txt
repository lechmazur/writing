<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The lucid-dream chronicler’s contradictory impulses—envy of past selves versus the need to keep an honest ledger—play out in concrete micro-choices (tracing the ridge line on the scroll, reading aloud to the grave). Each version encountered in the dream offers a specific, embodied value that reweights the waking self; the final renunciation of immortality for custodianship is earned and visibly costs awe. The only flaw is a slight over-articulation of the jealousy method; it reads as strategy more than ache in two beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: every ring of the scroll, stuttering clock, and returned hawk image thickens the same stake—how to carry time honestly. Closure lands with undeniable cost when the narrator seals the door, letting the scroll “rattle softly,” a resonant reconfiguration that forecloses eternal return. Orientation is taught by scent and grave within 60 words; transitions from waking to dream and back are cleanly marked by table/scroll/cabin anchors.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Creosote, spruce, shale cairn, and the cabin clock are not backdrop but instruments: the smell guides feet, the cairn rewrites identity, the clock sabotages chronology. The birch scroll’s pale scars literally serve as map and mirror, constraining the final editing act on the ridge. Spatial choreography is flawless; the hawk’s tilt is an environmental response to spoken grammar. Only the mirror moment drifts toward emblem, not tool, preventing the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—keep narrative time honest—tightens when each envy dredges a lived self whose stakes the narrator must now carry. Escalation is textural: the valley sluices every year into one river, collapsing future and past; options narrow to either permanent flight or custodianship. The price is legible: awe no longer wild but “knowing the bill,” a conceptual cost that reweights the premise. One beat short of visceral loss (tool, stamina) keeps it from 8.8+.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges without slogan: memory is not private property but a mountain ledger that outlives the body. Subtext operates in gestures—the scroll accepts ink “grudgingly, then all at once,” echoing the narrator’s reluctant custodianship. The hawk’s eavesdrop and the stove’s heartbeat make meaning through silence and sound rather than assertion. Final image of the tamed-yet-wild scroll answers the thematic question non-literally: ownership dissolves into custodianship.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is unmistakable: mountain grammar of scent, mineral time, and avian grammar fills every sentence. Syntax coils like terrain—“a calendar that never learned digits”—and fractures under dream pressure without ever losing lucidity. POV distance stays tight; no filter verbs dull the hawk-eye glide. Only a single near-cliché (“paper boats in this weathered sea”) keeps it from 9.0.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Sentence-level propulsion is relentless: each line either advances image, choice, or atmosphere without scaffold. Figurative layering is dense yet precise—wind “fretted,” stove “ticked like an old heart,” jealousy “a magnet for loose iron”—all paid off in closure image. Zero paraphrase loops; no mixed metaphors. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and re-charge motif with exactitude.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The lucid-dream chronicler who edits his own grave via envy of past selves is a synthesis unseen in slush; the inversion of nostalgia into feral agent is conceptually bold. Risk—addressing the mountain as interlocutor, letting time literally sluice—heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Specificity of “creosote and spruce” ghosts, cinnamon-wrist lover, and coal-surveyed contours makes the fantastical inevitable. The final reconfiguration feels both surprising and predestined.</comment>
