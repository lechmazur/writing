<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The chalk artist’s interior contradiction—needing to “listen backward” while guiding others—grounds every stroke; the tile’s whispers convert his social perception into tactile, costly choices (the gate, the banister image). No stock therapy labels; even the child’s question is met with a bespoke, character-specific answer. The final renunciation—pressing the cooled flake back into the moss—pays the visible cost of relinquishing control, earning the arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the mandala’s dissolution by tide reweights the premise—meaning is found in balance, not answers—felt cost is the emptied pocket sigh. Causal chain holds: tile → listening → gate → offerings → tide rinse; each because/therefore tightens options until only leaning remains. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) is taught by second paragraph and held without waver. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive inside 120 words via sensory cues, no penalty.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The grotto’s mist, sand, and acoustic curvature act as micro-setting: limits visibility, dictates kneeling, and channels whispers into the tile. Weathered corduroy smell and eyelid-scale twilight are filtered through the artist’s pigment-trained eye. Spatial choreography is immaculate—bodies circle, kneel, place objects; distances track across the single scene. The tile-as-setting constrains the final gesture, charging the last image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can communal silence be shaped into bearable meaning?—is signaled in the keeper’s mute instruction. Escalation is textural: each offering thickens the hush until the tide’s rinse forces a collective stance crystallization. No reversible blow-ups, just density accrual that forecloses loud speech. Cost is the surrender of permanence; survival is explicitly rejected.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the inverse of survival: meaning is residual, not preserved. The lilac unease forecast final image reweights the whole without moralizing. Subtext lives in gesture—finger to temple, tile returned—never in exposition. Wisdom (“the grotto remembers pressure”) is earned through sand under fingernails, not assertion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is inseparable from syntax: pigments sift from cuffs, hush ripens like fruit, sand composes “something that watched us back.” Rhythm compresses under pressure—“less a blanket than a tide reversing”—then exhales into the pocket-sigh closure. No head-hopping; collective “we” stays anchored in artist’s sensory funnel. Diction never exceeds artist’s chalk-and-ear lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Near-zero scaffold; each sentence layers job triplets (image + motion + emotion). Metaphors are coherent—tide, ribs, banister—no mixed vehicles. Variation in sentence length mirrors breath cadence. One micro-loop: “the hush… the hush” but serves as taught pattern, not artifact. Closure line is clean, concrete, propulsive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Premise—mandala as collective confession that must be erased—flips the usual permanence trope. Risk of quiet ending without dramatic bang is embraced and paid off. Lilac unease as weather forecast is a fresh conceptual repricing. Could not swap artist, tile, or grotto without collapsing the entire fabric.</comment>
