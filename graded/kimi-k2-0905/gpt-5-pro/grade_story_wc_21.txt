<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is rich and embodied (“truth was a muscle and pain was how it learned to move”), her micro-choice to keep contradictions intact is earned, and Esteban’s pressure sharpens her values. One minor slip: the diary-spine touch triggers retrocognition without prior foreshadowing, a near-knowledge leap. The final stance of “parley with pain” lands as credible renunciation with visible cost, satisfying the 9+ quick test. Still, the absence of any earlier hint of paranormal mechanism keeps her just shy of the top band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the diary folds open like a throat, reweighting righteousness with complicity; cost is the humming past that will keep hurting. Lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of debris/mirror cipher taught early, density tightens once the lagoon double is grasped, and cadence shifts to crystalline confession at the end. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) are inside 120 words; deliberate disorientation (retrocognition) is paid off by the mirrored lagoon moment. No causality breaks; the final image of “pinprick confessions” makes the conceptual cost undeniable.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The obsidian lagoon is not mere backdrop; its noon-night mirror literally doubles every debris sign, supplying the second half of the cipher and constraining the decryption tactic. Spatial choreography across zeppelin, sling, and shore stays crisp. Sensory selection skews to heat, brine, tobacco—urgency-filtered. One hairline slip: “wind-torn boxes” is generic, but the overall environment charges the final image, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</question><grade>Dominant stake—truth versus complicity—is signaled in paragraph four and tightens when Alma’s betrayals surface. The meaningful deepening occurs once the mirror-lagoon reveals the state-and-comrade duplicity, foreclosing easy righteousness. Cost is legible: Mara must carry contradictions intact, pain acknowledged. Agency is attention/renunciation rather than external triumph, perfectly valid under Accumulative lens; no reversal is required.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete particulars: driftwood streets, glass fires, shell names—beach debris becomes moral ledger. The ending reweights freedom as “rain and rust,” refusing tidy moral. Subtext lives in gesture (Esteban’s closed eyes, the gondola rocking) and in the mirror doubling every sign, implying complicity echoes. No final moralizing; resonance is visceral, inviting reflection on victors’ coins and frightened fingerprints.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>First-person perceptual signature is consistent and sharp: “I felt not altitude but heat,” “breathing the lagoon backwards.” Syntax mirrors archivist precision: nested, clause-heavy, then fracturing under retrocognition. Esteban’s dialogue carries brine-and-tobacco idiom distinct from Mara’s glue-dry diction. No head-hopping; lyric compression (“sentence he could finally finish”) is pattern-taught and paid off. Rhythm control under pressure is excellent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High information density: single sentences do triple duty (“diary folded open like a throat” = object, agency, metaphor). No synonym churn or template cadence; openings vary. One mixed vehicle: “patient memory” mooring a zeppelin is briefly strained but context justifies. Minor scaffold: “both smelling of unfinished sentences” could trim, yet it advances relationship texture. Closure image is unblurred, propelling the final resonance.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</question><comment>Fusion of floating library + encrypted diary + beach-debris cipher + retrocognitive mirror is fresh, non-obvious synthesis. The lagoon-as-living-code transforms familiar civil-rights archive tropes into actionable magic-logic without gimmickry. Risk—paranormal historiography—heightens stakes and pays off thematically. Specificity throughout (colophons, twine radio coordinates) prevents abstract anywhere-ness. In hindsight, all elements feel inevitable; no close echoes of famous scenes.</comment>
