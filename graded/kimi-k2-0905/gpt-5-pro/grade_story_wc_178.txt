<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The astronomer’s interiority—his “empirically ironic faith” and ledger-like attention—drives every micro-choice; the tile-alignment and ash-mirror beats externalize his contradictory hunger for measurable transcendence. Cost is legible when he accepts reduction to “curves and sums” in the mirrored night; the vow to keep darkness from being double-paid seals a visible renunciation. Voice never slips into diagnostic self-talk; instead, body, basket, and bronze eyelid embody thought. Frugality as spiritual economy feels lived, not declared.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise: the mirrored ash reconfigures the palace and the self into a ledger that now costs eternal vigilance; the covenant’s price is undeniably felt. Accumulative lens holds throughout—each detail of dust, torch, mica, mortar accretes until the ceiling arrow and bronze eyelid crystallize meaning. Causality remains intact: tile→arrow→eyelid→ash-mirror sequence is irreversible and stakes foreclose retreat. No orientation debt; who/where/when anchored by line 3 and tightened by mortar spark at ~450 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>“Chipped lapis river” and “bronze eyelid the size of a shield” are irreplaceable micro-settings that literally steer the tile and focus the closure beam. Palace proportions translated into ratios function as lived geometry, constraining where knees and parchment may lie. Sensory hierarchy obeys scholar priorities: dust acoustics, torch angles, mortar glint—not tourist catalog. Final image reuses the ash basin as mirrored night, re-weighting the same object with covenantal cost.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—keep the sky’s accounting honest between regimes—tightens when tile meets eyelid, foreclosing the option of leaving the palace unchanged. Escalation is textural: light drains, mosaics unclasp, passage appears; each intensification is driven by protagonist’s exacting placement, not luck. Cost is visible on-page: personal reduction to diagrammatic reflection, plus vow of perpetual maintenance. One meaningful deepening suffices for 780-word piece; no reversals required.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges from repeated economies—frugal basket, unpaid darkness, double-tax avoidance—until the final mirrored night reweights “encrypted devotion” as a civic duty to the void. Subtext resides in silence: no king, no banner, only numerals vowing to a silence that cannot reward. No moralizing; the ash’s stilled shiver is the non-literal answer. Irony persists—faith proven by proofs—yet feels earned through concrete schematic labor.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person intimate maintains scholar’s lexicon—“ledger of eclipses,” “eventless spaces”—without trespassing into omniscience. Perceptual signature is quantifying: sandals counted, torchlight measured, doubt weighed in ounces. Rhythm accelerates under pressure: mortar spark→arrow→bronze eyelid in three staccato clauses. No head-hopping; distance stable. Patterned elision (“he read the palace, and the palace seemed to read him”) is taught early and paid off in mirrored reversal.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Sentence variety and information density are high; each line does double duty—e.g., “ceiling mapped with chipped lapis, animals, and a river of ash where constellations once glowed” seeds later arrow formation. No loops or scaffold; near-duplicates excised. One mixed metaphor risk—“bronze warmed like a cheek” beside “dark as a well”—but the tactile shift serves the faith-as-intimacy beat and does not obscure closure. Register stays within scholar’s diction; no thesaurus-itis.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fusion of Babylonian palace, magic-square piety, and astronomical frugality feels non-obvious and specific; removal breaks the entire premise. Risky structural compression—single scene, no dialogue—heightens ritual intensity and pays off in mirrored stasis. “Encrypted devotion” as civic accounting is a fresh angle on faith. Detail is non-portable: mica mortar, cedar glue, bronze eyelid could not be swapped without collapsing the covenant logic.</comment>
