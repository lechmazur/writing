<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The scribe’s “mild obsession” is shown through micro-choices: the slow hand that refuses to stab lines, the ear that re-tunes to silence. Interiority is concrete and biased—distances “no compass could name”—but the arc is narrated more than dramatized; the final renunciation is felt yet not visibly costly on the page. No contradictory impulse is staged in scene; the obsession simply yields to teaching. Still, the voice-specific noticing keeps characterization vivid and mostly earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the map becomes a lived set of thresholds, the night acquires “rooms,” and the booklet empties its gold—undeniable conceptual cost. Causality is accumulative/textural: each flake and hush thickens the pattern until the scribe’s stance crystallizes. Orientation is lyrically delayed yet taught by line 3 and paid off in the final image; no later ambiguity. One meaningful tightening—naming the four directional silences—drives the cadence shift that ends the story.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The fort, storm, and gold booklet constrain every beat: wind “threads sea breath through arrow slits,” flakes become “small harbors where wind could kneel,” and the ambered hush literally glazes the table, shaping the scribe’s hand. Sensory hierarchy is POV-bound—the scribe notices cartographic impossibilities, not military logistics. Spatial choreography is clean; bodies step softer, cannonballs weight corners, distances track. The final image recharges the ridge fort as the first and last threshold, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: can the scribe chart the endless night before it swallows them? Pressure accumulates through densifying hush and shedding gold; each flake narrows the option to chart by line, forcing retell-by-silence. The oracle’s stick-taps enact one visible micro-turn that forecloses hurry. Cost is the booklet’s extinction and the star’s scrape—legible, felt, but slightly abstract; the price is conceptual rather than bodily, adequate for this lyric frame.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the reversal of map-making: edges begin at the ear, not the blade; silence is the first shore. No character articulates the thesis; the oracle’s terse “edges begin at the ear” is sub-textual instruction, not sermon. The final image of goldless booklet and lowered star reweights earlier motifs without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers—will the rooms save them?—yet remains coherent and charged.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is dense, salt-licked, synesthetic: “grains clicked in her braids like soft teeth,” “syruped quietude poured from a wound in time.” Perceptual signature is obsessive-cartographic: distances, horizons, inlets, reefs are felt as emotional geometry. Rhythm controlled: long breath-paragraphs mirror the hush; fragmentary map-names act as staccato waypoints. No head-hop; distance stays tight to scribe’s sensory cortex; lyric compression taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm is oceanic: cadence swells and ebbs, sentence openings vary, no template churn. Figurative density is high but patterned—gold flakes, salt teeth, syrup hush—each reappears to reweight meaning, avoiding decorative overload. No mixed metaphors; physical logic holds. Minor scaffold: “the hush marbled...and settled without settling” verges on self-paraphrase but serves the accumulative design; does not touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The inversion of cartography—map silence, not land—feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Risk: lyric accumulative structure could have collapsed into vagueness, yet every flake and hush tightens the stake. Specificity grounds novelty: “pebble-shore oracle” with salted ankles, “shedding gold winter”—no generic apocalypse. The premise commits fully; no retreat to action set-piece or explanatory dump.</comment>
