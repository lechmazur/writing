<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The conductor’s mournful eagerness is embodied in every micro-choice—whispering to a carburetor, stroking pull-cord “spines”—so motivation stays visceral. Interiority is concrete (“urgency tastes like rain”), never diagnostic. The only soft spot: we learn nothing of the prior wound that made him willing to drink grief, so the arc’s cost feels atmospheric rather than personally earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a perfect Charged Poise: the house exhales “room” and the fork-on-sill tuning fork re-prices the whole ritual with unresolved resonance. Causal chain holds: hourglass flip → tunnel entry → off-key wind → laughter half-returned; each grain is earned. Lens is Accumulative/Textural: density of sonic motifs (harmonica pennies, frost-skein laughter) tightens until the final image reweights the stake. Cost is unmistakable: part of the laughter is left in the tunnel forever, the family still“helpless,” conductor unpaid except by what he swallowed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is the tunnel-as-throat, its oils of “hands that had pressed against this world” constraining every sonic maneuver; the blower nozzles literally cannot angle away from that skin of grief. Spatial choreography is flawless—manholes, kitchen glasses, picture frame form a vertical score the wind climbs. The tuning fork on the sill is micro-setting that charges the final image, fulfilling the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore laughter—tightens when the conductor chooses to leave part of it underground, a visible forfeiture that alters tactics (he refuses full restoration). Pressure escalates via sonic density: off-key bowed-tree wind → frost-skein laughter → candle-relit giggle; each uptick is legible under the Accumulative lens. No coincidence; every decibel is dragged by agency.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the acoustic economy of grief: laughter kept brittle cuts the mouth, so the conductor budgets joy. Subtext hums in objects—harmonica pennies, tuning fork wrapped in twine—never in commentary. Final image reweights the premise: joy needs its shadow, a conceptual cost the reader feels without being told.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Voice is a tuned instrument: syntactic gusts mimic blower rhythm (“breathed as sections, bass to treble”), diction stays within the conductor’s weather-physician lexicon. Perceptual signature is relentless—every noun is sonic or meteorological. No head-hopping; the tunnel’s “single note” is filtered through his bodily ears. The lyric elision (“a candle relighting itself between drafts”) is pattern-taught early and paid off in the final giggle.</comment>

<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: each sentence advances sonic stakes or bodily motion. No loops; no scaffold. Figurative control is extreme—mixed metaphors are avoided by keeping every vehicle in the wind family. The only hairline slip: “sliver of midnight” for baton is faintly stock, but it occurs in an early orientation line and never touches the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>Premise—leaf-blower choir conducts grief into music—is audacious yet fully grounded in tactile detail. Transformation test fails if you swap tools; only blowers produce the off-key wind that macerates unsaid names. Risk heightens stakes: letting laughter stay partial courts reader dissatisfaction, but the story commits. Synthesis feels inevitable: tuner, wind, tunnel, and household objects become one acoustic organ.</comment>
