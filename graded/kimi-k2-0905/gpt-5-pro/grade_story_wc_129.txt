<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The marsh-reed sculptor’s motive—wanting to be “woven in” by name—grounds every beat; interiority stays concrete (“salt still cataloged along their spines”) and the final bench-dedication dramatizes a renunciation of anonymity with felt cost. Status play is minimal (only Neri on stage) so relationship-crucible is n/a; flaw/competence balance is present but not pushed to compounding mistakes. Voice remains porous vs solitude without lapsing into label-speak. The earned ache lands, satisfying the 9- gate; minor swappability of Neri keeps it shy of 9.0.</question>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory layer (crystal chime, dew-tag, bench-weave) deepens the dominant stake of belonging until the sigil’s dissolve reconfigures meaning with visible cost (“permission” droplets). Orientation anchors arrive by line 5; no causality breaks; the final image is a Charged Poise that reweights prior motifs. Closure beat carries undeniable social cost: the community tests the bench while the protagonist feels “held like light is held by water.” Persistent constraint (the arbor as vow-site) shapes the dedication tactics.</question>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Crystalline orchard + obsidian arbor function as micro-setting: they refract light and faces, literally bending silhouette-choice and supplying the only place vows can translate into labor. Sensory hierarchy stays POV-driven—“breath rimed with quiet light” is not tourism but sculptor-air. Spatial choreography clean; weather (dawn pale fire) evolves with scene. Setting constrains the final image—bench must fit arbor’s “cool mouth”—satisfying 9+ gate; microscopic shortfall is lack of tool-level detail.</question>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will the sculptor be woven in?—tightens once via the shared tag quest; finding it forces the bench-dedication that forecloses anonymity. Agency is present (chooses to weave, speaks dedication) under Accumulative lens; cost is the dissolution of outsider distance felt in the silvering droplets. No second reversal, but one meaningful deepening meets scope. Escalation is modest; price is more conceptual than visceral, keeping it below 8.8.</question>

<question>5</question><grade>9.3</question><comment>Theme of communal porosity vs solitary impermeability emerges through reed/braid imagery and the bench-as-lattice; no explicit moralizing. The final “luminescent ache” reweights earlier “porous than solitude” premise without stating a thesis. Subtext operates in silence: neighbors touching the bench “testing the grammar” implies acceptance rather than declaration. Complexity intact—outsider status not erased, simply shared.</question>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>First-person lyric voice sustains perceptual signature—every metaphor is sculptor-textural (“reeds remember every hand,” “salt…soft annotations”). Rhythm modulates with pressure: long breathy sentences swell toward dawn, then shorten at dedication. No dialogue to test voice distinction; interior diction stays within reed-worker lexicon. Filter verbs rare; no POV slippage; compression taught early and paid off at sigil dissolve.</question>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</question><comment>Sentence rhythm varies; no template cadence runs. Figurative density high but patterned—thawing bells, linen rain—taught early and justified by accumulative lens; no mixed metaphors. One paraphrase loop (“woven in…braid…braid”) is intentional motif reinforcement, not artifact. Line-level propulsion maintained; droplet image sharpens closure rather than obscuring it. Minor scaffold: “they told me” x2 could compress, preventing 9.0.</question>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</question><comment>Fresh synthesis: crater-orchard grown from cooling tears, dew-tag graffiti that can only be found jointly, and reed-memory as data-storage are non-obvious yet cohere. Transformation test fails if relocated—specificity is embedded in arbor glass and crystal chime. Risk (lyric accumulative structure) heightens emotional stakes without clarity loss. No close echoes of famous scenes; premise feels inevitable in hindsight.</question>
