<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and embodied; the narrator’s contradictory impulses—grief vs. hope, staying vs. leaving—collide in the amber-lit cylinder scene. Gable’s “tail thumping like a metronome for the buried” externalizes emotion without label-speak. The final act of listening-as-bridge is earned by prior causality (leaf, riddles, river) and carries visible communal cost. Micro-choices (copying letters onto tin, turning the spindle counter-wind) reveal value hierarchy under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the settlement’s shared water reweights “distance into closeness” with undeniable social cost. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—each salvaged object layers density until the amber + phonograph re-tunes the world. The orientation anchor (who/where/when) is taught by line 4 (“cracked wasteland… wind-rattled cathedral of rust”) and pays off at closure. No causal breaks; the river’s groan is set up by counter-turn spindle and leaf-filtered light.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Scrapyard operates as micro-setting: the pipe-bolted spindle and crane-constellations constrain tactical choices (turning against wind, threading hose). Sensory selection skews auditory—phonograph breath, river swallowing shyness—reflecting narrator’s listening obsession. Amber leaf functions as mobile environment that refracts light to reveal hidden text, directly shaping closure. Idiom remains post-collapse vernacular without tourist catalog.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“translate distance into closeness”—tightens when the cylinder’s riddle forecloses passive grief and demands physical trek to western heap. One meaningful deepening: amber over horn reveals shadowed letters, shifting knowledge state and altering tactics (copy map, turn spindle). Cost is legible—communal thirst traded for shared water, narrator’s private relic made public. Agency is attention/renunciation rather than spectacle, coherent under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: salvage as sacrament, listening as bridge. No explicit thesis; resonance surfaces in final image—“the wasteland, a longer throat for our voices.” Subtext carries in gesture—Gable nosing the leaf, cranes raising arms—rather than assertion. Ambiguity lingers: brother still absent, yet closeness achieved through shared infrastructure. Emotional aftereffect is concrete communal inhale, not sentimental moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is consistent: narrator reads world through sonic metaphors (“welding torch sound shy,” “river swallowing its shyness”). Syntax compresses under pressure—“Turn the last spindle counter to wind, then listen”—mirroring urgent listening. No head-hopping; lyric elision taught early (“wind ate his name”) and paid off in final hush. Diction stays within post-collapse salvage lexicon; no register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>High information density: “nights fell in a wild hush that could make a welding torch sound shy” does triple sensory work. Rhythm alternates between long breathy sentences and clipped commands (“I copied… I pressed…”). No scaffold loops; each sentence advances stakes or texture. Figurative logic stays coherent—amber light as diary lens—without metaphor pile-up in closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: phonograph + amber leaf as decryption device transforms familiar post-apocalypse salvage trope into listening-based epistemology. Risky lyric compression succeeds because pattern is taught early and closure remains legible. Specific detail—“cranes raised their arms, the moon watched like a stitched eye”—prevents generic wasteland backdrop. Emotional specificity (grief converted to communal infrastructure) avoids sentimentality.</comment>
