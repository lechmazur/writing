<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The borrowed-time timekeeper's interiority is concrete and embodied (“my ribs answered with a hopeful ache,” “borrowed heartbeats lining my ribs like foreign coins”), but the arc is more accumulative than causal; the final renunciation feels slightly abstract because the earlier ‘debt’ is poetic rather than dramatized as a concrete threat or toll.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the ribbon settles, the capsule heals, and the narrator commits to stewardship-by-touch; the cost is the surrender of borrowed heartbeats, felt in the image of coins trembling free. Causality is lyric/accumulative rather than strict because/therefore, but the pattern is taught early and holds.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Selective, pressure-driven detail (“rye sugar-lit the fields,” “air… full of waiting, like a held chord”) anchors the emerald silo as a micro-setting that constrains the final choice; the fragment and ribbon function as tactile objects that charge the closure image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—stewarding texture instead of counting time—tightens when the ribbon asks for “a tender I could not replicate”; the protagonist’s agency is the deliberate release of borrowed names, which visibly pays the cost. Escalation is a single deepening rather than multiple reversals, sufficient for lyric mode.</comment>
<question>5</question><<grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: time as tactile texture rather than metric; the final image of “counting by touch” reweights the opening premise without moralizing. Subtext operates through object handling (urn fragment, ribbon) rather than exposition, inviting reflection on measurement versus memory.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature throughout—slant synaesthesia (“minutes taste like copper,” “keys and clocks spoke in flavors”)—with rhythmic compression that accelerates into the silo scene; no head-hopping, stable first-person interiority, patterned elision taught by line one and paid off in the final “held chord.”</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High information density with metaphorical coherence sustained; occasional lyrical stacking (“glass panes strained around us, giving the room a watery heartbeat”) borders on overwriting but remains pattern-consistent and never obscures causality at closure. No loops, scaffold, or register drift; final ribbon image is clean.</comment>
<question>8</question><<grade>8.8</grade><comment>The premise—time’s texture replacing numeric duration—feels fresh and fully committed; the garage-sale adjective map and cremation fragment are specific, non-transferable inventions. Risk in lyric structure heightens resonance without gimmickry; synthesis makes the concept feel inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
