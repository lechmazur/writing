<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interiority is richly embodied (“tuned room, resonantly soft”); every micro-choice (wedging the shell, heartbeat tuning) is a sensory, stakes-shifting act that charges the climax. The arc from compliant performer to co-conspirator with stone guardians is legible, costly, and rooted in the teacher’s legacy. No diagnostic self-talk; contradictions live in muscle and instrument. The only drag: off-page teacher is the emotional engine—slight under-crank for 9+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each image layers density until the final silence re-prices the city’s rule-set. Closure is a Charged Poise—“the new silence took root”—with undeniable conceptual cost (rails uprooted, schedule lost). Orientation is taught by sky-bridge → ladder → orchard spatial track; no anchor confusion. Persistent constraint: the locust shell as quiet amplifier shapes every tactic and the final stillness—meets 9+ quick test, capped at 8.7 by slight teacher-dependency noted in Q1.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Enchanted orchard is not backdrop but antagonist: iron rails threaded through roots literally shackle choice; statues’ copper-lidded eyes track motion and later slacken under sound. Micro-setting (locust shell wedged under violin bridge) determines timbre and thus revolt. Weathered bells, brass leaves, and “pages groan” charge the final image. Meets 9+ gate: environment constrains tactics and is reconfigured at closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—beauty vs. mechanical control—tightens when sanctioned melodies fail and heartbeat signaling risks corporal punishment. One meaningful deepening: orchard’s trained sundown tightening is reversed by three chest-thumped requests; rails rise with audible lever complaint. Cost is visible: city lamps tilt away, clock refuses chime—live institutional loss. Agency is pure (no off-stage savior); coincidence only complicates (fog stitches extra ladders).</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from tactile particulars: a locust shell, not an essay, teaches resistance. Subtext in statue’s stone lips “barely parted” and moss-blooming joints rewrites militarized beauty into shared vulnerability. Final image—“the ground to move without marching”—re-prices the city’s ethos without moralizing. No thematic echo; wisdom stays in the hush between beats.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Lyric first-person carries a violinist’s perceptual signature: sound is color, wind is lace, silence is seedpod. Syntax lengthens then clips to mimic bow strokes (“three times, then a rest”). No head-hopping; even statues’ interiority is inferred through external tremor. Register stays within a street-musician’s diction yet vaults into poetic compression without strain.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</question>
<comment>Rhythmic control mirrors musical phrasing; no template cadence or synonym loops. Density is high—one sentence often sets scene, body, and metaphor simultaneously (“statues’ granite veins threaded by thin copper”). One mixed metaphor risk—“pages groan”—but forgiven under climax pressure. Closure line clean, no artifact. Minor hedge: occasional adjectival stacking (“docile crescendos”) keeps it from 9+.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fusion of biopunk orchard, heart-rhythm counter-music, and locust-shell amplifier is non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Stakes invert the city’s smokestack logic without sermon. Risk: lyric elision could have obscured, but pattern is taught early (“listen with the skin”) and closure remains legible. Specificity of “actuary light” on fruit and “clerks’ stamp stalled midair” freshes industrial-fantasy terrain.</comment>
