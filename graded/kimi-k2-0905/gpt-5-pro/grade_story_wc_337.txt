<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The narrator-protagonist’s vocation (broken-mask restorer) is interiorized as both craft and wound (“I sometimes see my own face in the broken ones”), a contradiction that stays live during the ritual. Micro-choices—threading the needle, handing the knot to the daughter, speaking the father’s name—are concrete, embodied, and visibly costed (the sanctuary’s hush drapes their shoulders). The bond with the daughter is not a relationship arc but a crucible moment that alters her stance and his; status shifts are legible in the transfer of the net-knot. No diagnostic self-help speak intrudes; interiority stays maritime, salt-stained, and particular.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the coffer rises, the name is spoken, the father’s drag on the daughter’s sleep ends, and the sanctuary’s silence is braided with his laugh—an undeniable after-cost. Causal chain holds: each un-knot → net sigh → coffer lift → spirit release, all signaled early and paid off in the final image. Orientation is taught in the first 60 words (“prism sanctuary under starlight,” “glass ribs arc above me”) and never drifts. The lens is Accumulative/Textural: density of hush and refracted light accretes until the final gravity shift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The prism sanctuary is not backdrop but working machinery: its glass ribs refract moonlight into “patient geometry” that guides the ritual steps; the quartz floor hides the coffer whose barnacled surface is handled on-page. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true—salt smell, kelp sack, cold threads, wet compass silt—selected by a restorer who thinks in tides and knots. Spatial choreography is immaculate: daughter at threshold, net above coffer, shard fitted to bench, sack exchanged—their positions track without drift. The micro-setting (needle, coffer, net) constrains every tactical move and charges the final image.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake: free the daughter from her father’s restless drag. Pressure tightens once, causally: each un-knot narrows the option to stop; the final knot forecloses retreat and lifts the coffer. Cost is visible—daughter’s tremor, narrator’s admission of mirroring, the sanctuary’s hush gaining weight—paid on-page. No coincidence resolves; the net’s sigh is the direct effect of the last un-knot under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the concrete: mending as exhumation, silence as gravity, binding as love-knot. No character moralizes; the final image (sanctuary braided with a father’s laugh) reweights earlier hush without sermon. Subtext lives in gesture—palms-up bowl-hold, tremor as music—never decoded for the reader. The emotional aftereffect is specific: restoration costs the restorer a reflection he can’t un-see.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>First-person voice is prismatic, maritime, and tactile: “nets you cannot see until your hands are already snagged,” “sand begins to stir.” Syntax lengthens and compresses with ritual tempo; no template cadence. Perceptual signature is consistent—moonlight as geometry, silence as tide-drawn weight. Dialogue is minimal, indirect, goal-driven: “Hold it steady” while passing the knot. No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens microscopically during needle-work.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops, scaffold, or synonym churn. Each sentence advances image or causality: “threads cool as if remembering winter” does two jobs (temperature + memory). Metaphors stay inside maritime physics—no mixed vehicles. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with the ritual, never drumbeats. Information density is high yet limpid; no reader-repair required at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>Folkloric “spirit mender” is retooled through optical science and coastal labor: prism sanctuary, barnacle-coffer, net as topography. The inversion—un-knotting to mend, exhuming to ground—feels inevitable, not gimmick. Risky lyric compression is taught early and paid off in the final braided hush. Specificity of trade (needle case of rain-dark wood, tide-chart knots) prevents template drift.</comment>
