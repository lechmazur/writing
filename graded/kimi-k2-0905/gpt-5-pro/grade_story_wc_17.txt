<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interiority is rich and embodied (“bone carefulness,” sleeve-tucking ritual); the protagonist’s contradictory allegiance to both exactitude and mercy peaks when he re-charts the man’s knocking into a lull. Micro-choices (placing film strip to mantel, whispering a name) visibly tilt present stance. Cost is felt: accepting the drowned stranger dissolves grandmother’s ruthless legacy, foreclosing pure cartographer detachment. Voice remains coherent; no headcount issues.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the corridor’s healed skin and resting tone crystallize the narrator’s new ethic—maps that comfort. Causal linkage intact: grandmother’s experiment setup → narrator’s film use → echo re-charting → corridor exhalation. Legacy’s burden (stake) is visibly repriced: “lighter when I carried it as listening, not law.” Drive lens is Causal; every beat is because/therefore. Cost is on-page: the museum literally exhales the vanished man into peace, narrator’s procedural authority yielded to mercy.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setting is micro-exact: ivy, bricked doors, tiles etched like topographies guide each tactical move. Sensory hierarchy obeys cartographer bias—sound and echo over visual clutter. The fireplace throat, film negative, and negative-space corridor function as “environmental tools” that constrain chalk routes and recording angles. Spatial choreography flawless; no impossible positions.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—legacy’s burden versus merciful listening—tightens when the narrator confronts the eternally knocking man. One meaningful escalation: re-charting the echo dissolves the malignant loop, foreclosing the safety of pure documentation. Agency is continuous; each hallway chalked curve is a decision that narrows next options. Cost is felt: the museum’s new map now carries emotional liability.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges inexplicitly: attention as ethical responsibility. Montage of burned diaries, film negative, and lullaby conversion reweights “truth” from data to mercy. No final moralizing; instead, the resting tone reconfigures meaning. Particulars (echo, tile, ivy) accumulate into an aftereffect: maps must comfort.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise; perceptual signature is acoustic-archival (“soft choreography that sound remembers”). Compression taught early (“walls dream”) and paid off at closure. Rhythm mirrors breath—long clauses for hush, single verbs for rupture. No head-hopping; diction stays within self-taught lexicon of echo science.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentence openings avoid templates. Figurative language is dense but patterned (echo as cinema, walls as skin) and never muddles causality. No loops or synonym churn. Final beat—“began the day by learning where mercy echoes best”—carries propulsive closure. Occasional elevated diction (“conceptual repricing”) fits narrator’s scholarly tilt.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise fuses climate gothic with sonic cartography—fresh yet inevitable. Risk taken: entire plot hinges on metaphorical “echo mapping” yet stays physically legible. Transformation evident: swap echo for generic quest and story collapses. Bold yet coherent; no gimmickry.</comment>
