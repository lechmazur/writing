<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The genealogist’s guilt is viscerally embodied (“hair shirt,” “counterfeit shade”) and drives every micro-choice on the driftwood shore. The interior contradiction—profiting from erasing children while discovering he was one—erupts in the split crescent mark, forcing an earned renunciation. Voice occasionally drifts into abstract self-diagnosis (“tempered regret is the only armor”), blunting peak pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the terrace scale becomes readable only after the driftwood reveals the three-leaf boat and the narrator’s own sold past. The watch-hand groove click and the split crescent provide decisive, legible before/after images with conceptual cost. Causal lattice holds—because he once sold Mara’s line, therefore he must stand waiting without selling silence now—though the opening orientation (“at dusk”) is slightly late at ~130 words, a hairline slip.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Cobalt terrace boards, brined alphabet of driftwood, and the hair-in-crescent hollow are tactile, POV-filtered tools that constrain decoding choices. The watch-hand groove physically guides the lever move, charging the final image. Sensory economy is tight—salt, kelp, slivered brass—mirroring the narrator’s paring-down of lives. Spatial choreography aboard the splintered planks stays clean and legible.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—own erased identity—signals early via “weight of a withheld truth that anchors my own name.” Pressure tightens when driftwood forces recognition that three, not one, children fled: his ledger crime boomerangs. The final choice—to wait on the terrace without selling further silence—forecloses the market path with visible self-cost. Escalation is single but sufficient under Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the inverse of genealogy: falsified roots poison both victim and forger. The three-leaf boat reweights the “family tree” metaphor into a living, un-sold forest. Final image of the weighted scale reframes profit as unpayable debt without moralizing. Subtext pulses in silence: the sea “remembered my ledger,” an accusation no cash can quiet.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>First-person voice carries a distinct forensic melancholy—“stitched a vision of gulls and foam around that lie”—with rhythmic compression that taught its pattern early. Perceptual signature is consistent: clerical metaphors (“ledger,” “invoice,” “quota”) color even sensory detail. No head-hopping; legal-register diction stays within a genealogist’s plausible lexicon. Minor template cadence in “I told… I sold… I would not sell” is voice-motivated, mirroring ledger entries.</comment>

<comment>Prose is dense yet limber: “the sieved hush through the grassed dunes” packs auditory and tactile data in five words. Mixed metaphors are controlled—hair shirt, counterfeit shade, brined alphabet—each revisited to pay off. One paraphrase loop (“I would not sell… I would not sell”) is intentional parallelism, not scaffold. No artifact obscures causality or dulls the final terrace image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Black-market genealogy as memory-laundering feels fresh and fully committed: “reducing a forest of futures into a single marketable grief.” The watch-hand shard retooled as both key and accusation is a specific, irreversible invention. Risky lyric structure—one long reflective shard—pays off when the driftwood alphabet literally speaks back. Derivative-premise guardrail waived; transformation is complete.</comment>
