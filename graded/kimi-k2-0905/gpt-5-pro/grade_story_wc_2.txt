<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The tinkerer’s interior contradiction—clinging to screws/springs while chasing the compass’s random tugs—ripples through embodied beats (testing each step “with a watchmaker’s patience and a pilgrim’s doubt”). Renouncing linear time is earned: fire destroys his shop, ashes deliver the sigil, failure of old tools forces the leap. Micro-choices under pressure (climbing the machine-ribs wet-handed, leaving the rose plugged in) visibly foreclose safe withdrawal. Cost is felt: he hands his livelihood to a water-clock that will never keep commercial hours.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: fire → sigil → errand-follow → greenhouse grate → cavern machine → wire-bridge → municipal map flicker. Each because/therefore linkage narrows options (the compass refuses north, mandates vault). Closure is Decisive Change with cost: he cedes certainty, mounts charred ribs in shop, accepts customers on algal time. No teleporting props; urn, wire, socket all pre-seeded.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Selective sensory hierarchy mirrors tinkerer priorities: brass warmth, gear-tooth bite, moss-slick ledge. Greenhouse air “green grown tired of itself” is POV-colored, not tourist. Micro-settings (compass, machine ribs) constrain choices—he must climb ribs because gears are cart-wheel huge. Final breathing map is charged image that reweights urban time, not postcard.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—control of time—is signaled in line 1. Tightening is single but sufficient: compass randomness → must improvise → must wire the water-clock → must accept tidal custom. Price is legible: perpetual shop irregularity, income at mercy of drip-grammar. Agency remains his; coincidence complicates (train delay) but never saves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete reversal: measuring hush by weight and fall, not tick. Subtext hides in gesture—leaving rose plugged in = surrender to flux. Final image of “wrong just long enough to be right” reweights premise without moralizing. Befriending uncertainty gains specificity through soot-urn, wire-spool, algae-numbers on stone.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>First-person tinkerer voice owns perceptual signature: screws/springs metaphors, “water teeth,” “grammar of perhaps.” Rhythm modulates with stress—short clauses during rib-climb, longer tidal sentences in cavern. No head-hopping; diction stays within horological lexicon. Filter verbs minimal; “I thought of the admiral” is warranted inference.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Sentence variety good; information density high—“numbers I could not read warmed the walls” does three jobs. No mixed metaphors; “water teeth engaged the wheel with patient bite” extends machine ontology cleanly. Minor paraphrase loop in “uncertainly certain” refrain (−0.2). Final line ear-test strong. Artifacts do not touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: clockmaker meets water-driven timekeeper beneath city = non-obvious. Admiral-backstory, sigil-compass, algae-numbers all particular to this world. Risk in letting climax be installation rather than duel pays off; concept fully committed. “Befriending uncertainty” reframed as commercial practice feels inevitable yet new.</comment>
