<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The keeper’s quiet, scent-guided agency is consistent and embodied; the refusal to use the horn crystallizes his interior contradiction. Mara’s off-stage absence still bends every micro-choice, so the relationship functions as crucible. The final whispered welcome carries visible cost—his voice breaks, Alder’s hand finds his shoulder—earning the Earned Stasis. Interiority stays concrete, though a few lyric abstractions (“structure of longing”) flirt with label-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the skiff’s slow turn reconfigures possibility and the beam’s low angle embodies the cost of withheld sound. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each sensory layer (salt, cork-scent, dawn milk) tightens stakes until the final image reweights them. Orientation is taught by line 3; no causality breaks. The price is legible in the softened metal rail and Alder’s grudging mirrored hands.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The cobalt lens, cork vial, and breathing stair-iron function as micro-setting that constrains tactics: the lens angle decides rescue method, the cork carries the summons. Salt taste, humming panes, and cooled-sigh sea are filtered through the keeper’s professional sensorium. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from lantern room to lee of the rock. Environment directly shapes the final low-beam choice, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—retrieve Mara without sonic violence—is signaled early and deepens through sensory accumulation rather than causal reversals. The tightening beat is the deliberate lowering of the beam and release of garden scent, foreclosing the horn option with felt risk. Cost is visible: the horizon’s “aching light” and the gull’s mirrored tilt register uncertainty. Under Accumulative lens this single intensification suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges: attention as non-violent rescue—whisper over shout. Subtext lives in Alder’s doorway cough and mirrored hands, confessing conversion without dialogue. The cork’s reprise reweights “garden at night” from childhood refuge to adult instrument, closing the thematic loop. No moralizing; the final image of the lullaby-hearing eyes supplies resonant ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>First-person voice carries a distinct perceptual signature: synesthetic sea-breath, iron that listens when cradled. Rhythm modulates from long breathing sentences to the staccato “I do not shout her name again” under peak pressure. No head-hopping; Alder’s interior is accessed only through external cues. Compression like “jaw looking for argument” is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: each sentence advances atmosphere or stakes. No loops or synonym churn; “salt,” “cobalt,” “garden” recur with shifting charge. Metaphors stay coherent—lighthouse as lung, beam as bone—without purple overload. Minor register lift in “conceptual repricing” phrase is voice-justified by keeper’s reflective bent.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The whisper-vs-horn rescue via scent-tuned cobalt lens feels fresh; it inverts typical maritime melodrama. Sensory particulars (resin-stained cork, mirror-wing gull) are irreplaceable. Risk in lyric accumulation pays off when the garden scent physically summons the skiff. Transformation test fails if swapped to generic flares, proving integration.</comment>
