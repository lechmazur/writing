<comment>The librarian’s interiority is lyrically specific—“I breathe in threes,” “scarf warms”—but contradiction or visible cost never arrives. The promised arc (search → finding → custodianship) is announced, not dramatized; the final stance of humble service is asserted rather than earned through a micro-choice that closes a path. No interpersonal crucible or status pressure tests the character, so motivation plateaus. Meets baseline for embodied voice and idiosyncratic detail, but lacks the causal bite demanded at elite tier.</comment>

<comment>Closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration: the library “breathes out” and books grow heavier, reweighting the premise with conceptual cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density rises via recursive shelving, coral-like corridors, and scarf warmth until stance crystallizes. Orientation is taught early (“I keep the lights low…”) and anchors hold; the clock ticks in verses, sustaining temporal legibility. A near-miss for 8+ because the decisive emotional cost is diffuse—felt more as atmosphere than as a singular, visible price.</comment>

<comment>Micro-setting triumph: the scarf, atlas hinge, and floor-tile tessellations constrain the path and charge the final image. Hyperbolic shelves function as both labyrinth and lung, guiding the narrator’s movement and reconfiguring at closure. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true—“smell of pencil shavings and rain”—and never drifts into tourist catalog. The environment actively collaborates in the turn, satisfying the 9+ gate for constraining choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Single stake—locate “where stories live”—is signaled early and deepens through topological recursion. Agency is present (sliding ticket, shelving the air), but the tightening is poetic rather than option-narrowing; no live alternative is foreclosed with visible consequence. Escalation is textured (shelves breathe, scarf warms) yet remains accretive, not adversarial. Sufficient for mid-to-high band, but lacks a palpable trade-off that would push higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: custodial self-erasure as the price of narrative continuance. No overt thesis statements; the final image of heavier books conceptually reprices the librarian’s labor. Subtext lives in gesture—knotting the scarf, shelving silence—avoiding sentimental pity. Complexity is honored: the library both welcomes and uses its keeper, leaving plausible counter-readings of complicity or grace.</comment>

<comment>Perceptual signature is crystalline: scientific diction (“hyperbolic geometry,” “meridians”) filtered through poetic compression. Rhythm modulates with pressure—short clauses during atlas click, elongated sentences inside the bell-shaped room. No head-hopping; lexicon stays within an archivist’s plausible range. Minor hairline: occasional stacked modifiers (“quiet tables…careful waves”) but always in service of texture, not purple display.</comment>

<comment>Read-aloud ear is musical; sentence openings vary, paragraph cuts are purposeful. Information density high—“I slid my chalkboard ticket through and heard a click, not mechanical, but like a thought deciding.” Zero paraphrase loops or synonym churn. One near-artifact: “smelled of cedar and lightning” risks metaphor collision, yet the synesthetic leap fits the charged atmosphere and is paid off by closure.</comment>

<grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fusion of topology and librarianship feels inevitable in hindsight; no prior template occupies this exact space. Risk is structural—hyperbolic corridor as plot engine—yet clarity never falters. Specificity anchors universals: chalk dust, tessellated floor, Orion traced on ceiling could belong to no other story. Transformation test passed: swap any detail and the emotional calculus collapses.</comment>
