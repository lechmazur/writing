<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The historian’s contradictory urges—to hoard knowledge and to release it—drive every beat; her embodied, throat-burning presence is vivid, and the final surrender of the cages is an earned, costly renunciation that lands under the Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is cleanly earned: the release of the purified cages into the public chamber is a Decisive Change that reconfigures both the pagoda and her self-definition; the Accumulative/Textural pattern taught by irregular step-sequences and crystalline returns holds without contradiction, and the final image of twilight reframes the whole drive.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Bronze ribs, quartz cages that hum under honest longing, and stairwells that unscroll into mirrors all constrain her footwork and emotional state; the pagoda’s material logic is never violated, and the final mirror-landing recharges every prior sensory trace.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes tighten from “retrieve forbidden knowledge” to “risk becoming its dam”; each atom demands a new, unpatterned approach that forecloses routine, and the price—public exposure of her hoard—escalates under the Accumulative/Textural lens with unmistakable felt cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: memory purified by refusal of pattern becomes a civic gift; the final twilight image reweights “innocence” as shared vulnerability rather than personal virtue, achieving Conceptual Repricing without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is laser-specific—“dust in my throat,” “longing hums in quartz cages,” “rhythm of refusing to be a drum”—with rhythmic compression that accelerates under pressure; lyric elision is taught early and paid off in the unscrolling stairs, no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Almost every sentence carries double duty (image + concept + motion), yet three stacked metaphors in one late clause (“thunderheads caught in the throat of a bell”) slightly blur sensorium; no loops or paraphrase clutter, and propulsion remains intact through closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The nostalgia-atom archive that demands unpatterned movement to unlock memory is a fresh synthesis; randomness-as-peace method is non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight, and the risk of lyric accumulation pays off without gimmickry.</comment>
