<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Maris’s interior contradiction—archivist obedience vs. familial defiance—drives every beat; the moment she bows her knees to the root-room the cost of stewardship is bodily enacted. Emotion is never labeled, always sensorily embodied (“chest hurt with the nostalgia of a frontier”). The final palm-to-radio gesture is the inevitable culmination of her earlier micro-choices with the flake and drone; renunciation of sovereignty is earned and felt.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a crisp Conceptual Repricing: the throne equals a rain-radio that demands listening, not ruling—cost is the lifelong burden of stewardship announced in one image. Causal lattice holds: flake warmth → mural arrow → root coordinates → platform stairs → rain-radio; each because/therefore linkage tightens options. Sunrise deadline is live on the leaf; the orchard’s clipped-tape voice is the final causal nudge that forces ascent. No orientation debt; who/where/when locked by line 15.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The kaleidoscopic waterfall is not backdrop but passage—colors taste, spray ticks skin, and the sensory logic teaches the reader how to read the rest. The orchard’s luminous bark and ozone-scented root-room constrain movement and supply the literal stair-engine. The ruby flake cup and scanner are micro-settings that charge the final image. Spatial choreography is flawless: drone circles, platform rises, aperture floats—every object position tracked without drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prevent algorithmic coronation—announced early; sunrise timer blinks amber on a leaf, a visceral ticking clock. Escalation is driven by her agency: shaving paint, feeding flake, bowing into roots—each act narrows future options. The mural-glow match to the flake is the decisive tightening that forecloses any other route. Cost is visible: she trades personal sovereignty for perpetual listening service; the final radio-throne image makes the price undeniable.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the accreted images: throne as radio, sovereignty as listening—no statement, only final reweighting. Subtext is embedded in gesture (nod with drone) and object (cassettes as prayer flags). The question “what is rule?” is answered by the rain-radio that demands reception, not command—an elegant conceptual twist. No moralizing; the emotional after-effect is wonder laced with burden, precisely the anthem of futuristic nostalgia.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>First-person voice is irreducibly specific: “antique ears,” “planetary purr,” “broadcast fruit”—diction stays inside Maris’s archivist sensorium. Psychic distance compresses under pressure: clauses shorten as dawn nears, mirroring heartbeat. Patterned repetition (“until sunrise, until sunrise”) is taught early and pays off in the final drum of rain. No filter-verb stacks; every metaphor is physically grounded (waterfall of windows, stair-antennae).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or synonym churn; each sentence advances image or causality. Mixed-metaphor guard passed: waterfall→windows→color-taste maintains internal logic. Rhythm accelerates through enjambed clauses toward the aperture breach, then relaxes into the rain sentence—cadence mirrors ascent. Opening and closing lines are crystalline anchors that recharge one another via the radio/throne transmutation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The throne-as-radio conceit is a fresh synthesis that retroactively rewrites every mural and cassette flag. Risky second-person address to orchard (“Go, it said”) is earned by prior personification of trees. Kaleidoscopic waterfall as time-tuner literalizes the concept of history you can taste—an image unlikely to appear in any other submission. Conceptual integrity holds: the story commits fully to broadcast-as-sovereignty without retreating to generic monarchy.</comment>
