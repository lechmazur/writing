<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The “creeping normality noticer” POV is vivid and embodied in early beats—cataloging quiet losses, pocketing a shell to fix the next starting place. Relationships with Maro/Keziah, though brief, force micro-choices (sharing bread, confessing complicity) that bend the self-image. Interior contradiction is present but stays shallow; no genuine error or flaw compounds consequences, so the final stance feels more declared than earned. Voice specificity carries the day, but the arc is observation-heavy, decision-light.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as legitimate Charged Poise: the chalked bakery name erased by dew crystallizes the cost of tenuous absolution and reconfigures the group’s vigil. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of images and rituals mounts until the final image reframes prior effort. Orientation is swift (palace grounds, after birds leave) and the single transition (night → dawn) is legible. Causality holds: because they uncloak and plant, the tea house breathes and the chalk faces erasure—an on-page price under the chosen lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Secret tea-house, ivy, cracked fountain, koi tiles, tatami, shell path—details accrue as tactile resources that shape tactics (where to plant, how to sweep, what to hide). Micro-objects (bread, bell, kettle) double as setting when they constrain sharing or ritual timing. Sensory hierarchy follows the narrator’s caretaker bias: scent of cedar, whisper of sesame, weight of shell. Final image of dew on chalk re-weights the courtyard as mutable sanctuary—setting actively participates in closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</question><comment>Dominant stake—preserve sacrality inside erasure—is signaled early and tightened once: officials will arrive at dawn, so they must decide what to leave visible. Agency is collective, not individuated; the group chooses partial secrecy, paying the price of permanent exposure risk. Cost is legible in the moment they leave the chalk to be effaced. No single reversal, but the deepening from private ritual to public vulnerability supplies sufficient escalation under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme—finding the sacred in ordinary subtraction—emerges through bread, shells, bulbs, chalk: ordinary objects re-sacralized by ritual attention. Subtext resides in gestures (snip-lift-thank), silence after bell ring, and dew’s soft edit of memory. No explicit thesis, but the final chalk-a-name image answers the question of how to remember when the city forgets. Complexity acknowledged: complicity (Maro’s herbs, narrator’s letters) remains unredeemed, giving theme bite.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>First-person voice owns a precise perceptual signature—ivy as sleep-mask, tiles “more powder than color,” bread crust “whispers sesame.” Rhythm modulates from long accretive sentences to clipped imperatives (“Snip, lift, thank, return”) under peak pressure. Compression is taught early and paid off (“We will uncloak…”) without clarity loss. Dialogue sparse but distinct: Maro’s compost joke versus Keziah’s chalk marks—brief divergence enough to distinguish. No head-hopping; collective “we” stays coherent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Lyric density is high yet purposeful; metaphors are internally coherent (ivy as sleep-mask, bread steam as map). Occasional stacked modifiers (“braided the street,” “tiny flags of patience”) flirt with overwriting but pattern aligns with narrator’s cataloguing reflex. No loops or paraphrase stacks; information density strong. One comma splice in “I ring once, and the courtyard hushes…” unnecessary but does not blur causality. Final line cadence earns its resonance.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Guerrilla-gardening a derelict tea-house to seed tenuous absolution is fresh synthesis of urban-exploration and quiet resistance tropes. Specifics (sap-mended teapot, crocus crescents smiling under frost) keep concept from abstraction. Risk-taking in structure—accumulative lyric rather than causal plot—heightens coherence without gimmickry. Core angle feels non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight; transformation test passes—story collapses without these exact details.</comment>
