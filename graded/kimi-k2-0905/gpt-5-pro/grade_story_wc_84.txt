<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The drone-pilot's interiority is concrete—techno-poetic, not explanatory—and the pilgrim’s perpetual surprise is embodied in micro-gestures rather than labels. Their mutual recognition (standing in the blank, naming the other) earns a quiet cost: the pilgrim must cease motion, the pilot must accept a silence-path home. Relationship functions as crucible, but secondary-character pressure is light; the pilgrim is more catalyst than counter-force. Motivation remains sharp throughout, though the missing-pieces backstory is summarized, not dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the matrix chip can only cast absence, so “belonging” is redefined as the margin, not the letter. The pilgrim’s slow orbit inside the telescope circle is the visible cost; the drones’ final blink confirms acceptance. Causal linkage holds—each beat because/therefore narrows the translation task to silence. Orientation is anchored within 120 words; dome-cord pull and star-trail exposure obey observatory logic.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The cooling-stone smell, bronze-cord throat, and cracked comet mural are selective, POV-filtered, and directly guide the dome-opening act. Micro-setting (the chip as altar plate) constrains the final choice—no letter can be cast, only space. Spatial choreography is clean: drones ascend in spirals, pilgrim kneels, receiver cables tense. Weather is limited to dusk air and starlight, but that economy matches the beat’s urgency.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“decode the frequency of belonging”—is signaled in paragraph 4 and tightens when the chip’s inability to form letters forecloses a literal alphabet solution. The meaningful turn is the pilot’s recalibration: starlight must ink the pauses, not the consonants. Cost is visible—pilgrim must become the blank center, pilot must trade certainty for silence. Escalation is single-cycle but sufficient for this length; no reversal, yet options narrow credibly.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</question><comment>Theme emerges from material process: type cannot print letters, so belonging = the interval between them. No explicit thesis is stated; the final map of rests is the non-literal answer. Subtext runs through gesture—linen case, warming metal, orbiting body—rather than assertion. The silence-path resists moralizing and invites counter-readings: is home a table or another blank?</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>First-person drone-pilot voice carries a techno-lyric idiom—“rotors whisper like moths,” “camera stares straight down”—that remains consistent and character-specific. Compression and elision (“brilliant dimness,” “jury-rigged from an old ham set”) are taught early and stay legible. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is sharp-tech with existential hunger. Rhythm modulates: longer clauses for ascent, staccato for receiver hits.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence. Figurative language is restrained to 1–2 per paragraph, avoiding purple drift. Information density is high: one sentence can anchor time, tool, and emotional tilt. Minor scaffold: “the plan is simple enough to laugh at” is a touch self-conscious, but it occurs early and does not recur at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fusion of obsolete print tech with drone astronomy feels inevitable, not gimmicky; the matrix chip as harbor of absence is a fresh inflection. The “map made of rests” reweights the scifi search-for-signal trope into lyric pause. Risk—using silence as direction—heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. If swapped to any other macguffin the conceptual engine collapses, proving specificity.</comment>
