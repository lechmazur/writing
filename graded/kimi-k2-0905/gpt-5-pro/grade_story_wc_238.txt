<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Protagonist’s haunted self-reckoning is embodied through trembling hands and voice choices; the apology is a visible micro-choice with felt cost. Flaws (rumor-mongering past) complicate the present action, and the endurance of the archive’s song offers credible renunciation. Interiority avoids label-speak; contradictions (profit vs. remorse) act simultaneously under pressure. Relationship with Mara shifts through shared silence and touch—an earned, costly reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the cracked bottle holds the orchard’s last breath, re-weighting the stakes with undeniable conceptual cost. Drive lens = Accumulative/Textural; pattern of scent-paper-current intensifies until the final image re-tunes damage. Orientation is taught early (“sheet music archive,” “orchard held its breath”). No因果 breaks; every beat adds density or cadence shift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Archive, orchard, bottle, and fluorescent hum are filtered through exorcist-sensory bias; copper wiring and salted water are tactiled. The perfume bottle constrains the ritual and cracks to charge the final image. Spatial choreography is clean—Mara’s hand, shelves, copper tracks remain consistent. Selective detail (jasmine-diesel-apple scent) mirrors internal state without symbol overload.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake: rescue the orchard’s voice before erasure; tightening occurs when current ignites scent and unfinished hymn surfaces. Protagonist agency drives the wiring, apology, and recording; cost is the bottle’s fracture and the irreversible dawn of saws. No coincidence; pressure accumulates through sensory density. One meaningful escalation suffices under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from specific particulars: gossip turned witness, rumor turned song. No moralizing—final column vow is dramatized by handing Mara the cracked bottle. Imperfect miracles motif reweighted: “no fix, only proof.” Final image of music outliving demolition offers resonant, non-literal answer to “can apology outlast erasure?”</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>First-person voice maintains distinct perceptual signature: “paper whispering like leaves that refused to remember wind.” Syntax mirrors exorcist-metronome tension—varied rhythm, no drumbeat. Compression (“baton of silence”) is legible and paid off. No dialogue contamination; Mara’s single line carries subtext.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>High information density: one sentence often does three jobs (scent + memory + social cost). Zero loops or scaffold; no mixed metaphors. Register stays within narrator’s lexicon; “Leyden jar” is earned. Rhythm accelerates with current surge, then breathes at final handshake—line craft serves closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: gossip-columnist exorcist + sheet-music archive + orchard demolition is non-obvious and inevitable in hindsight. “Imperfect miracles” concept operationalized via cracked bottle recording. Risk of lyrical tech pays off: induced current ritual feels grounded. No derivative echoes; voice and premise are singular.</comment>
