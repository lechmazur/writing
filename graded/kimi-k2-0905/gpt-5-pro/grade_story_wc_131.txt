<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The crawl-space narrator’s interiority is rendered through concrete, embodied sense-memory beats that double as micro-choices (crawling, cupping the tape in the cheek). The “visible offering” motive crystallizes in the deliberate atlas-cache & silver-hair booby-trap; the final step forward costs anonymity and risks expulsion, paying a felt price. Relationship with Mara stays off-page, but her presence supplies adequate external pressure; no stock labels or therapy-speak mar the voice. Contradictory impulses—“shy architecture” vs. need to be seen—stay live inside every beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a textbook Earned Stasis: the narrator renounces perpetual invisibility, steps into light, and that choice forecloses the safety of duct-life. Causal linkage holds: every cache move (tape recovery → recorder placement → hair trip-wire) precipitates Mara’s arrival. Sapphire hush & outage anchors are clear inside first 60 words; mosaic pattern (library, pipe-chase, reading room) is taught early and resolves under Accumulative lens. Cost is legible in the final “wait to hear what is needed next,” surrendering control the narrator previously hoarded.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The library is not backdrop but tool: atlas case screw-thread and emergency-lamp color directly determine cache tactics and Mara’s detection. Body-as-setting (duct screws, brass breath) constrains every movement; the tape fragment’s weight in the cheek shapes the next crawl. Micro-objects (answering-machine shell, silver hair) recur with altered stakes, charging the final atlas-opening image. Sensory economy is ruthless—never a tourist catalog, always filtered through maintenance-archaeology priorities.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—becoming visible without being expelled—tightens when each cache act risks discovery. Escalation is accretive: outage → blue lamps → tape hum → atlas trap; every layer increases exposure cost. Protagonist agency is absolute: no coincidence rescues or resolves. The final step from pipe to light crystallizes the stance, trading safety for service, and that trade-off is irreversible on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of tender invisibility emerges through gesture, never statement: cached gifts, hair triggers, and renunciation of shadow life. The father’s lost gentleness re-prices Mara's loss and the narrator’s vocation simultaneously. Final image—two strangers sharing listened silence—offers resonant reconfiguration without moral. Subtext operates in silence, light color, and the unread note; no platitudes intrude.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is laser-specific: “sapphire hush,” “ferric burr,” “threaded screw beneath Antarctica.” Syntax lengthens during crawl compression, shortens at emergence, mirroring spatial constraint. No head-hopping; POV distance stays consistent inside duct walls. Lyric elision (“routes, not steps”) is taught in paragraph 1 and paid off in the final atlas-case motion. Dialogue minimal, natural, sub-textual: “You found it” carries full weight of expected miracle.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm alternates between long breathy sentences (crawl) and clipped fragments (motor complains). Metaphors stay physically coherent: tape “rigid as a leaf” foreshadows leaf-like hair trigger. Zero paraphrase loops; every line adds new texture or propulsion. Only hairline slip: “apologize for spying” line edges toward meta, but compression keeps momentum intact and it falls outside closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: maintenance-crawl archaeology + library invisible-helper myth + obsolescent tape tech. The silver-hair trip-wire is a specific invention that would break if swapped; it fuses craft signature to emotional stake. Sensory-archive premise turns familiar outage into hush of private communion. Risk—stepping from duct into open light—pays off with earned visibility rather than melodrama.</comment>
