<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Protagonist’s interiority pulses through embodied rhythm—each heel-toe syllable, valve hum, and dice clack externalizes contradiction between fear and refusal to drown. Calm defiance is lived, not labeled: the dance teaches the cameras while hiding salt in meter. Inherited dice and mentor’s last breath anchor motives; final choice to surface leaves Sora’s console behind, paying visible cost. Micro-choices (rolling, dancing, whispering) reveal hierarchy: liberation > survival > memory.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: tanks exhale, minds exit, bolts relax—cost is the flooded lab left behind and the unreadable journals that will be dismissed as “simple notes.” Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each journal entry adds density until daemon’s instinct is rewired. Pattern taught early—spider-web radial lines mirrored by coded entries—pays off when web finishes itself and protagonists rise through hatch. No orientation debt; sunken corridor anchors arrive by line 4.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Sunken laboratory constrains every move: pressure quivers Neri’s shoulders, grating dictates heel-toe grammar, frosted tank glass forces brow-press whisper. Filter 31, barnacles, intake valves—each mechanical detail becomes a beatable surface for code. Dice scarred with gallows and rust that “remembers” supply micro-setting objects that charge final image. Spatial choreography clean: bodies track from corridor to bulkhead to hatch without drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—liberate drowned minds—signaled in first third and tightens when each journal entry risks exposure. Escalation is accumulative: each coded chore raises daemon’s tolerance until midnight+12=L triggers the final chord. Protagonist’s agency is the dance itself; no outside coincidence required. Cost is legible—lab abandoned, dice left spinning, surface anonymity accepted.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from action: encryption of vulnerability into rhythm, salt hidden in meter, fear turned into key. No overt thesis—idea stays embedded in dance steps and valve pitches. Final image of unread journals reframes earlier “simple notes” as city-wide uprising—Conceptual Repricing with social cost. Resonance lingers: who owns the rhythm of resistance?</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>First-person lyric voice owns a percussive syntax—clack, hum, exhale—that mimics valve music. Diction stays within POV’s plausible lexicon: no academic register, only tidal brine and dice scars. Compression taught early (“I explain through dance again”) and paid off at closure. No head-hopping; Neri observed only through quivering shoulders and iron taste.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm varies from long tidal clauses to staccato pulses (“six and five tell me”). No scaffold loops; each line adds new mechanical or sensory detail. Metaphors stay coherent—web, salt, rhythm—without mixed vehicles. Information density high: one sentence often fuses valve number, cipher rule, and emotional stakes.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fusion of hydro-punk espionage with choreographic cipher feels inevitable yet unseen before. Hangman’s dice as both calendar and tuning key transforms familiar rebellion trope into tactile musicology. Risk taken—entire plot told through dance logs—paid off when daemon sings the taught chord. Specificity of rust remembering dancers grounds novelty in lived texture.</comment>
