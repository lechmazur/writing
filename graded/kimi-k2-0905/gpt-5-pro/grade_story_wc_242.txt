<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid—“I wet my thumb and spin the disc” shows embodied ritual—but the narrator’s motivation stays declarative (“to teach endings how to begin”) rather than tested under pressure; no contradiction or micro-choice visibly risks his creed, so renunciation feels presumed, not earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the final loop opens “into a road” while the operator stays behind, cost felt in self-erasure; the accumulative pattern (widow, baker, drummer/spouse) tightens stakes under a lyrical lens taught early; causal links are elliptical yet coherent, satisfying short-form RR.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Subway tunnel, glass disc, and rotary dials are tactile micro-settings that constrain action; disc’s wet tone “makes the air lean closer” is sensorily precise; spatial anchors arrive by line 5, keeping orientation clean; environment subtly mirrors internal distance without overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—operator’s compulsion to broker strangers’ new beginnings—intensifies via each crossed line, but escalation is accretive, not sharply reversive; final coupling of drummer/spouse deepens pattern yet doesn’t narrow operator’s own options or exact visible price, keeping pressure poetic rather than perilous.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of “teaching endings to begin” emerges through recursive loops and wrong-number alliances; no moralizing—final image of polishing disc in unused sleeve quietly reweights estrangement as both gift and scar; ambiguity lingers without confusion, resonant at sentence level.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>First-person voice sustains a haunted musical cadence—“city exhales through grates like a sleeping furnace”—with controlled psychic distance; patterned elision (“clocks are unsure”) is taught early and paid off; no head-hop, diction stays within lexicon of solitary night technician; rhythm modulates with caller tension.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry high-density figuratives yet vary in length and avoid loops; mixed metaphors (“bridge they found to the shore they lost”) are earned by emotional logic; occasional elevated phrasing (“cultivated estrangement”) fits narrator’s self-mythologizing; no artifacts obscure causality or dull final image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Mythic switchboard operator who midwives strangers’ fresh starts via mis-dials is fresh; wrong-number friendships trope is re-cast as underground sacrament; glass harmonica disc as emotional tuning fork particularizes voice; risk-taking structure (lyric mosaic) heightens poignancy without gimmickry.</comment>
