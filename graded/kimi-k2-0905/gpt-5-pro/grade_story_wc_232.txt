<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Elias’s “empirically intuitive” trait is dramatized—he tests footholds, smells limestone, trusts ants—rather than labeled. The sister-promise is the only interior driver, but it stays present via micro-choices (locking shop, sliding chip, helping neighbors). The final renunciation of “lonely” is earned because every beat shows solitude as habit, then active refusal. No contradictory impulses appear on-page, so the 9+ quick test fails by a hair.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each image (ants, chip, maps, creek) layers density until the cavern press crystallizes choice. Closure is a Charged Poise: “the word lonely no longer fit the room” reconfigures meaning with felt cost—he forfeits drift-life for civic tether. Persistent constraint—the chip and the promise—shape every tactic. Cost is legible in the final line where tomorrow’s labor is already weighted.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Heat-warped glass, torn-silk creek, limestone scent are filtered through map-dealer perception. The blooming cavern’s petal-drip light is both womb and press—environment that literally shapes the final choice. Micro-setting rule met: the matrix chip’s throat-size constrains the decisive insertion. Spatial choreography is flawless; no floating bodies or drifted props.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—keep the promise to choose—tightens as creek rises and time narrows. One meaningful deepening: the maps of foregone selves force a conscious renunciation of drift. Agency drives every beat; coincidence merely complicates (storm is backdrop, not savior). Price is visible: he forfeits the escape-fantasy and accepts perpetual responsibility—stacking pallets, hosting refugees.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from specific particulars: maps as lives, ants as paths, chip as voice. Final image of the matrix glimmer beside crumbs for ants reweights premise—small acts of choosing become the map. No explicit moral; resonance is imagistic. The sister laugh memory offers understated CR that social connection now outweighs solitary archive.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Lyric-compressed diction taught early—“scraps of paper as surviving stars”—and sustained. Ant-perception syntax (“black seam”) mirrors protagonist’s caliper mind. Rhythm accelerates with storm breath, then softens into communal lamplight. No head-hopping; perceptual signature remains map-dealer throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>High information density: one sentence often sets scene, advances plot, and delivers imagistic pay-off (“Light slain by the cliff gathered in the drops…”). No synonym loops or template cadence. Metaphors stay coherent—ants as ink, creek as torn silk. Minor scaffold: two adjacent “he”-fronted sentences in exit beat, not touching closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: colonial-era type matrix + ant trail + midsummer cavern press = original portal. Transformation test fails if Elias is swapped out—his map-dealer gaze enables metaphor. Risk in lyric elision pays off: “doorway of decisions” is literalized as readable seam without exposition. Specific detail resists generic substitution.</comment>
