<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The firefighter’s guilt-driven quest lands cleanly: his choice to save subdivisions over owls is dramatized early and the cracked box keeps that wound tactile. Interiority is concrete—“tasting salt,” “smoke etched into his pores”—and the final handshake with Mira crystallizes a believable renunciation. The only drag is a trace of therapeutic summary—“he wanted to translate pain into a universal language”—that momentarily abstracts the embodied stake.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure is earned: setting the box beneath the cairn visibly forecloses the old bargain and opens a two-way hinge mission. Causality holds under an Accumulative lens; each shard adds density to the guilt/renewal pattern and the final image reweights the stakes with felt cost. Orientation is clean—ridge, night, box—by line 10. No meaningful escalation flaw; one tightening beat suffices.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The moonlit ridge functions as a micro-setting that actively guides the ritual; the cracked porcelain box acts as a tactile “minor moon” constraining the final choice. Sensory selection is urgent—silver on rocks, coyote stitching dark—filtered through the POV’s professional smoke-scarred attention. Spatial choreography is flawless; bodies and telescope track cleanly. Setting charges the final image without tourist excess.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—guilt over traded innocence—tightens once when he names the bargain to Mira, narrowing future options to a two-way hinge mission. Cost is visible: leaving the box beneath the cairn permanently marks the loss of his earlier binary choice. Agency drives the turn; no coincidence resolves it. Sufficient escalation for 750-word scope.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from fire-forced triage rather than authorial statement. The final image—stars as “old wounds turned into navigation”—reconfigures guilt into generative memory without moralizing. Subtext runs through gesture: handing Mira the cone is confession and commission at once. Complexity stays intact; no tidy absolution is offered.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is distinct: smoke-etched pores, cracked porcelain “heartbeat,” hinge imagery. Syntax modulates—long breathless cadence up the ridge, shorter clauses at the ritual. No head-hopping; telescope woman stays externally focalized. Dialogue is minimal but voice-driven; soft mountain etiquette distinguishes Mira without collapsing into laconic cliché.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>High information density: “pulled that ribbon from a porch rail before flame lifted the roof like a closing fist” does world, object, and metaphor in one stroke. Rhythm breathes with ascent/descent. No loops, no scaffold, no mixed metaphors. Line-level artifacts never touch closure. Read-aloud ear test passes.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: wildfire triage guilt translated into star-map pedagogy is not a trope template. Specifics—charred cones, child’s looping planets, ridge cairn—anchor the concept so it could not swap names/places. Risk in lyrical mosaic form heightens rather than obscures meaning. One minor echo of “hinge” motif feels inevitable, not borrowed.</comment>
