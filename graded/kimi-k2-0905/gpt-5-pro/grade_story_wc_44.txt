<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The apprentice’s hushed curiosity and tactile habit (“my hands remember better”) individualize him, but his sole decision—closing the brass ring without extracting the shadows—reads more as received wisdom than active renunciation; cost is implied, not body-felt.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Mosaic of discovery beats accretes under an Accumulative/Textural lens; the orientation is swift (isle / night / brass rail) and closure arrives as Conceptual Repricing—shadows pay the buoyancy tax—yet the final “light weight leaves my ribs” is abstract; a crisper bodily cost would clinch the 9-band.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>The observatory’s dew, rails, and humming floorboards texture every beat; the key-as-axis literally steers the ritual, so environment constrains choice and charges the closing image of “noon that pools with lost silhouettes.”</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“where shadows go”—clarifies early; pressure escalates each time the apprentice polishes, scratches runes, and renounces prying the pods, tightening options under the Accumulative lens; still, the external consequence (island steadiness) feels distant from his personal risk.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme of circular humility emerges through spiraling images and the refrain “closing loops,” never sermonizing; the re-weighting that shadows are teachers, not waste, lands as resonant reconfiguration without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>First-person voice owns a star-bright lexicon (“ribbed heart,” “bitten frost”) yet stays calibrated to an apprentice’s awe; rhythmic elongation and compression mirror ritual pace, and no POV slippage occurs.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sentences layer action, image, and concept with high density; occasional luxuriant metaphor (“net through water,” “hive of clocks”) flirts with overwriting but never loops or stalls propulsion; clause variety keeps ear alert.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Shadow-economy as levity fuel twists classic celestial lore; apprentice-as-custodian-of-absence feels fresh, and final refusal to “take” knowledge crystallizes prior motifs without gimmickry.</comment>
