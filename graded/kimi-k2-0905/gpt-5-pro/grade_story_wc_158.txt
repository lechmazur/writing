<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The insomniac poet’s motive—turning pain into beauty—remains lyrically present yet abstract; no embodied contradiction or micro-choice visibly risks that motive under pressure. Interiority is lush, but the final concession (“I practice sleeping without closing”) feels too gentle; the cost of armistice lands on blossoms, not on the speaker’s body or identity. The voice is singular, but the lack of status shift or relational crucible keeps the arc internal and low-stakes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens: pattern of blossom warfare → postcard invitation → Spiral Choir lullaby treaty. Closure is a Charged Poise: the shell exhales, buds hold, insomnia loosens fists—felt cost is the speaker’s perpetual vigilance now redirected toward listening. Orientation anchor (who/where) arrives by line 4; no disorientation penalty. One meaningful intensification: the postcard’s heat forces public negotiation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The shell’s conch corridors, petal-armor, salt-wind acoustics are tactile, selective, and bias-filtered through the poet’s synesthetic ear. Spatial choreography is clear: door → stairs → antechamber → Choir circle; bodies track. The galaxy postcard returns in the final bark-swell image, re-weighting scale—environment constrains the treaty and charges the closing breath.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake: end blossom civil war. Tightening occurs when Red demands winter-debt payment; the poet’s reply (“edges belong…stop craving blood”) is the single narrowing choice that risks credibility with all factions. Cost is legible—thorn clicks soften, Guard’s eyes wet—but the speaker does not visibly pay a personal forfeiture; escalation is floral, not visceral for the poet.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through petal-politics as stand-ins for dialect and memory; no explicit thesis. Subtext in Guard’s wet eyes and mother-thorn murmur carries generational trauma better than any manifesto. Final image—constellations breathing—re-prices the cosmic scale of local grievances without moralizing. Ambiguity remains: buds open/close at sun/moon jokes, reflecting peace as living rhythm, not victory.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>First-person lyric voice sustains synesthetic compression (“I drink the dark and exhale petals”) without purple overload. Rhythmic control mirrors tides: long anaphoric lullaby sentences crest, then short “buds hold” trough. Pattern-taught elision (“shyly unstoppable” repeated) pays off as mantra of persistence. No head-hopping; diction stays within poet’s compass.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>High figurative density but vehicles remain coherent within organic/floral logic; no mixed-metaphor collisions. Information-dense lines (“Sleep avoids me…I say, but peace has been avoiding us longer”) advance status and theme simultaneously. Minor loop: “shyly unstoppable” appears three times—accept as motif; does not stall. Rhythm breathes with scene tempo; no template cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fusion of botanic diplomacy with conch-city acoustics is fresh; postcard-as-map-&-treaty is a lovely reimagining of chain-letter war summoning. Lullaby-as-negotiation medium turns sentimental trope into civic procedure. Risk is high—entire conflict translated to floral metaphor—but commitment is full, payoff legible. Transformation test passes: swap petals for flags and the emotional calculus collapses.</comment>
