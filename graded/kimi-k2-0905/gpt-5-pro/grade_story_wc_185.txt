<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The mapkeeper’s interiority is concrete, embodied in tactile ritual (pressing stone to ice, tasting metal and snow). Contradictory impulses—fear of erasure vs longing to guide—coexist in-scene and drive the final pact. The earned renunciation of sole guardianship carries visible cost: the cave “maps us” and the storms bow, foreclosing solitary mastery. Voice remains singular, never drifting into therapeutic self-labeling.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the “readiness” path is not traversed but crystallized, reweighting the premise that maps are imposed rather than co-authored. Cost is legible in the final image—storms bowing—an undeniable conceptual price. Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout: ripple-marks, hush-bloom, drum-chords densify until meaning pivots without causal reversal. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are taught by line 3 and payoff at the end when the cave “maps us.”</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The harmonic caves function as micro-setting: ice-drum, stone ribs, and drop-tones actively constrain tactics—harsher light would drop stalactites, the drum must be tuned before a path “unsticks.” Sensory hierarchy follows POV bias—sound tasted as metal, visuals dimmed to protect the cave. Spatial choreography is flawless; bodies and objects track cleanly through narrowing ribs to the drum chamber. Final image recharges the same setting as collaborator, not backdrop.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“find the quiet before tunnels crush”—tightens when the hush-bloom must be shared with energy beings, narrowing options from solitary guardianship to joint stewardship. Escalation is textural: each ripple, chord, and frost constellation accretes until the drum-flash reweights the cost of silence. Protagonist’s agency is the deliberate tuning act that unstucks the air-door; no coincidence resolves the crisis. Visible price: future travelers may pass only if the mapkeeper relinquishes exclusivity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: cartography as mutual listening rather than control. The bloom-of-hush motif shifts from solitary tool to shared covenant, reconfiguring meaning without moralizing. Final image—walking into “weather that loved us”—offers non-literal resonance that reprises earlier frost-bitten thyme memory. No thematic echo lines articulate a thesis; meaning is left charged and ambiguous.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Voice carries a distinct geologic-musical idiom: “stone lungs,” “iron remembering fire,” “hammered repose.” Syntax mirrors cavernous curvature—long sentences swell then contract at drum-strike beats. Perceptual signature is consistent: the narrator measures time in drop-intervals and tastes sound. No head-hopping; energy beings remain externalized light-weather, maintaining POV modesty.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with scene pressure—clause lengths compress during drum-strike, expand during hush-bloom. Metaphors are coherent within geologic/sonic domain; no mixed vehicles. Information density high: one sentence often layers sensory data, emotional tilt, and world rule. Zero loops or scaffold; each paragraph advances knowledge, choice, or atmospheric charge.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses cave acoustics with psychic cartography—fresh yet inevitable. Transformation test fails if renamed: the ice-drum tuning as portal mechanism is inseparable from ripple-mark literacy. Risky lyric accumulation is taught early and paid off when “the cave mapped us.” Specificity of “frost-bitten thyme” memory recharges universal solitude motif without generic fallback.</comment>
