<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The poet’s voice remains idiosyncratic and embodied—“lines squeeze my ribs,” “I change like the phases above us”—so interiority feels textured, not diagnostic. Monthly persona molting stays largely ornamental; it never forces a trade-off or visible cost, so the promised constraint never alters tactics. Micro-choices (seeds in wall, screws in doorway) reveal a hierarchy of values: poetry over legality, shared archive over solitary safety. Closure is a credible renunciation: they accept perpetual trespass and moon-timed homelessness in exchange for the library’s rebirth; cost is legible in the dawn chill and the child’s entrance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: density of images (stars, rust, seeds, screws) accretes until the final sign renames the ruin “library.” The closure beat is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the child enters, the gate widens, and the city must contend with a public living archive. Cost is visible—“the city will notice, will argue, will threaten”—and the new roof is still a tarp, not absolution. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive within the first 90 words; moon phase and condemned status are concretely set.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The rusted library is handled tactually: rebar braided with ivy, screws poured like coin, tarps sewn—environment constrains every move. “Luminous fracture of reflected stars” reappears at dawn, charging the final image with the same cracked light that opened the piece. Micro-setting (coffee tin false bottom) functions as both vault and archive; its hinge determines what can be carried or spent. Spatial choreography stays clean across the yard and ladder, no impossible body jumps.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—keep the library alive under neon threats—is signaled in line 4. Pressure tightens when patrol car prowls past; option set narrows to stay or quit, and they stay. Visible price: trespass citation risk, sleeplessness, perpetual impermanence. No coincidence resolves; community arrives by accretion, not miracle.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete acts: seeds = commas, bolts = stanza brackets, nails = coin currency—“beauty from anarchy” is enacted, never asserted. Final image of child with cracked skateboard reweights earlier trespass into civic invitation, no moral sermon. Subtext in silence: Mara “does not speak” when prying bars, letting gesture carry memory of prison. Ambiguity lingers—city may still bulldoze—so resonance is charged, not tidied.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is unmistakable: coin/verse equivalence, moon-phased self, synesthetic “scars written by sunlight.” Rhythm modulates: long anaphoric braids for construction, staccato whispers under patrol lights. No head-hop; first-person stays tightly bound to poet’s body and lexicon. Patterned elision (“time for leaving the gate unlatching itself”) taught early and paid off in final gateless sky.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>High information density: single sentences do triple duty—e.g., “We braid rebar with drifted ivy, a welding of green and rust against collapse” shows action, metaphor, and stakes. Metaphors stay coherent (ivy as green cursive) and physically grounded. Zero loops, no scaffold, varied sentence cadence; only minor over-alliteration in “luminous fracture of reflected stars.” Closure beat is clean, no figurative muddle.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Premise—squatters resurrecting a condemned library through poetry and guerrilla gardening—is highly non-obvious yet internally inevitable. Transformation test fails if names/places swapped: seeds as black commas, screws as coin, moon as timetable are idiosyncratic. Risky accumulative structure pays off with resonant reconfiguration at dawn. No derivative prison-library trope; friendship forged in catalog numbers feels lived, not borrowed.</comment>
