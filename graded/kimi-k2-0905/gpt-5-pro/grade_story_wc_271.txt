<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Samira’s interior contradiction—wanting public honor yet refusing spectacle—drives every micro-choice; the freeze-breathe arc bodies her war trauma without therapy-speak. The photograph as ballast and the final niche-slide crystallize cost. Quiet talent enables the decisive relocation of ceremony, proving the trait is not decorative. One decimal off 9+ only because Theo stays functional backdrop; no reciprocal status tension sharpens her stance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: relocating the dedication into the glasshouse visibly forecloses the board’s dramatic vista while accepting rain-stitched reality; cost is felt in chair’s scowl and soaked overlook. Causal chain (storm threat → freeze response → bench move → photograph placed in niche) holds without gaps. Orientation anchored by word 80; no debt. One strong tightening suffices for short form; lens is Causal, held to last image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Glass ribcage, salt-spray, eucalyptus whisper, drone buzz, rain stitching panes—selective, POV-filtered, never catalog. Arboretum and automated lighthouse constrain choice: only the glasshouse offers shelter that still lets sea sound threaten. Pearl basin and crumpled photograph act as micro-settings that charge the final image. Weather and architecture physically shape the relocation decision; environment is not backdrop but lever.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—honor survivors without commodifying trauma—tightens once: storm + somatic flinch forces abandonment of photogenic overlook. Move inside costs the board its spectacle and costs Samira public vindication, proving price on page. Agency chain credible; coincidence (storm) complicates, does not solve. Could edge 9.0 if a secondary material loss (funding?) were hinted, but single-turn sufficiency met.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges: commemoration must include vulnerability, not consume it. Subtext lives in gesture—sliding photograph into water-return niche silently argues memory should circulate, not drown. No moralizing line; chair’s camera smile satirizes itself. Final image of pearl receiving rainwater reweights earlier metaphor: stillness is active maintenance, not absence. Ambiguity persists—donors may still distort story—keeping complexity alive.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyrical compresses without head-hop; perceptual signature skews botanical-taxonomic (“wind leaned on glass”) and bodily-cartographic (“old coastline her nerves still chart”). Syntax grows clipped under flinch beats, then elongates during stillness; rhythm mirrors vagal response. No filter-verb stacks; metaphors stay seaward-consistent. Dialogue sparse, idiomatic, goal-driven (Theo’s query tests her move). Voice teaches elision early; pattern pays off in rain-stitched pane closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>High information density: “ash brittle corners,” “spray swaggering higher,” “autonomous heart” each do double duty. No loops or paraphrase; every sentence advances. Figurative layer is dense yet coherent—sea optics, botanical growth, war tech—because motifs braid around exposure/shelter. One clause (“pearl of stillness, made by grit and time inside her”) risks minor formulaic note but is earned by prior somatic mapping. Reads aloud with tidal cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Takes familiar commemoration-ceremony template but reframes through drone-strike survivor tasked with gardening a cliff—synthesis feels inevitable. Somatized memory as horticultural stewardship freshens trauma narrative without trope recycling. Relocation of ritual inside greenhouse during storm flips donor-expectation, a risk that heightens meaning. Only fractional gap from 9+ is slight safeness of chair caricature; fresher antagonistic pressure could deepen irony.</comment>
