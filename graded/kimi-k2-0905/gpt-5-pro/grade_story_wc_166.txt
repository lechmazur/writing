<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The tide-dancer’s exile-from-within is viscerally embodied—brine swallowed, soles mapping gravel—so the interior contradiction between obedience to decree and allegiance to bone-tides is alive in every micro-step. The moment he offers his own wrist as “draft” before inscribing the clerk’s palm, the hierarchy of values (art > safety > certainty) is made explicit with visible cost. No stock labels; the body thinks in sway and starlight. The only drag is the clerk’s conversion, which feels slightly teleporting given how little prior status friction we see on-page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the clerk’s glove-off, palm-offered beat crystallizes a new harbor “no law can close,” reweighting both their stances under the Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality holds—the poem’s syllables germinate in the watcher’s doubt beat-by-beat—so the final image of “chosen night” carries undeniable conceptual cost. Orientation is taught lyrically (who/where seeded by “twilight garden” within first 60 words), so the waived disorientation serves the final star-witness payoff. One hairline slip: the phrase “elective exile” is named twice in authorial summary before it is dramatized, a micro-drag that keeps it just under 9.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Environment is not backdrop but instrument: gravel that “remembers shoreline” literally guides footfall cadence, and the basin-pooled sky reflects stars that refuse to testify—setting constrains stealth and charges the final sealing breath. The moonstone speck functions as micro-setting, its tear-scale brightness anchoring tactile scale inside the wrist hollow. Sensory hierarchy skews visual, yet the haptic brine-swallow and heel-stone percussion keep it from tourist-catalog syndrome. All anchoring props (garden path, badge-mirror, moonstone) stay spatially tracked across the swivel of dance.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—can contraband memory be inscribed without capture—tightens through a single, meaningful deepening: the clerk’s ask “can forgetting be gentle?” converts surveillance into voluntary canvas, narrowing options from hide to share. Cost is legible: the dancer’s own skin becomes first parchment, staining wrist with a “star that only starlight reads,” a visible forfeiture that later enables the clerk’s transformation. No off-stage rescue; coincidence only complicates when satellites pass, forcing timed breath-pauses. Persistent constraint: every future dance must now protect the clerk-carrying harbor they have jointly birthed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</question><comment>Theme emerges wordless: memory as tidal motion that cannot be legislated, only bodily hosted. The moonstone’s migration from tongue to wrist to clerk’s lifeline reweights “cosmic verse” from private rebellion to contagious sacrament without ever naming the thesis. Final image—“we step into our chosen night”—offers no moral, only a charged poise that reprices exile as autonomy. Obsidian grace stays dark, un-summarized; the reader carries the after-echo of surf-in-bones rather than a takeaway slogan.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical first-person sustains a perceptual signature attuned to gaps, tides, and star-reflections—syntax lengthens and contracts like breath between waves. Zero head-hops; psychic distance hovers at skin-level, never claiming knowledge beyond the dancer’s sinew and balance. Filter verbs (“I feel,” “I see”) are almost eliminated, traded for direct corporeal report. The rhythmic swerve from storm-cavalcade to “small orbit” mirrors emotional modulation under surveillance pressure without ever breaking tide-dancer idiom.</question>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</question><comment>Density is high—every sentence layers image, motion, and stakes: “Each heel falls exactly where his gaze is not” does choreography, stealth, and status shift in one pulse. Metaphors stay tidal-consistent (obsidian, surf, heron) and mutually reinforce rather than compete. No synonym churn or template cadence; openings vary from participial to noun-phrase to keep the read-aloud ear engaged. One microscopic lapse: “luminous scars” edges toward luxe diction, but the phrase is earned by prior star-imprint and occurs at closure where heightened register is justified.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The nostalgia-ban premise refreshes Orwellian memory-control by targeting kinesthetic, not cognitive, recall—dance as insurgency is a non-obvious angle. Tidal metaphors feel inevitable yet never clichéd because they are rooted in the dancer’s occupational muscle memory rather than decorative lyricism. Risk in lyric compression pays off: the poem’s transmission via silent gaps and palm-lifeline is a delivery system I haven’t seen. Transformation test fails only if you swap tides for any other force—salt, sway, and lunar gravity are irreplaceable to the plot logic.</comment>
