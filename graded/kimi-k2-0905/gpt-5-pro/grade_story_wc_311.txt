<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is rich and specific—“ribs vibrate when grief leans in”—but the reaper’s contradictory impulses stay mostly lyrical, not enacted under pressure; the final naming of “Enough” is earned, yet the cost feels conceptual rather than bodily, keeping it shy of the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the atlas folded with “Enough” reframes every prior fear-beast; the Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each tape deepens the archive of dread—cost is legible in the act of folding the lexicon and walking out under night steps that “kept our lexicon burning.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The cracked prism and foxed atlas act as micro-setting that literally steers the crystallizing ritual; dusk observatory breathes cold that numbs fingers and forces haste. Spatial anchors hold from first stone echo to final stair vanish; the dome’s ribs and tape corridors track cleanly across moves. Environment constrains the final image—night “takes the steps,” enforcing departure with the lexicon now internalized.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—naming fears—tightens as each tape bays another beast onto the atlas; agency stays interior (attention, endurance) yet forecloses escape: once “Enough” is written, the reaper must leave the observatory and carry the lexicon alone. Cost is felt in the hush after the final tape, but escalation is incremental rather than a single visible price; still, the atlas warming under touch signals stakes rising.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges without thesis: unnamed terrors become drawable monsters, then fold into a portable moral atlas. The eclipse laughter line and “promise is a beast that bites” carry subtext that resists moralizing. Final image of night “keeping our lexicon burning” offers resonant reweighting—knowledge now carried, not shelved—leaving ambiguity whether naming tames or merely relocates dread.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Voice is irreducibly specific—“dust swarmed the vowels,” “paper jaw and patient eyes”—with rhythmic control that modulates under pressure: clauses shorten as the last tape stutters. Perceptual signature stays consistent: every noticed detail skews toward acoustic and mineral cold. No head-hop; prism and atlas filter perception; diction never exceeds reaper’s self-taught lexicon. Experimental elision (“the room repeated it, but worn”) is taught early and paid off in the frayed farewell loop.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>High density—each sentence advances image or stakes; metaphor strings are purposeful (gnats, mica, frost) and cohere into a single optic system. One paraphrase loop—“the echo of sacrifice… echo of sacrifice”—drops it 0.1. No mixed vehicles; physical logic holds (light crystallizes ribbon-dust). Final line varies rhythm, giving cadence release. No artifacts touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses memento-mythic atlas with audio-spiritual crystallization—fresh synthesis of archivist reaper. Sea monsters as fear-avatars feels inevitable yet unforeseen; risk in lyric accumulation pays off when atlas folds into pocket conscience. Specificity—“dog-headed fish nosing the coast of Nowhere”—anchors novelty. Conceptual integrity commits fully: no retreat to generic afterlife tropes.</comment>
