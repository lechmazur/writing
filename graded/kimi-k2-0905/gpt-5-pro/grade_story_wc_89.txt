<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The beast-whisperer’s vocation is shown, not labelled: micro-choices (bargaining with deer, kneeling to fox, tasting spices) reveal a hierarchy that privileges communion over command. Interior contradiction—grief’s pull to break vs. love’s demand to bend—remains embodied in trembling hands that steady only after inhaling star-anise galaxies. The earned transformation into feathered lover carries visible cost: bones protest, throat feathers, and the final refusal of a single human name forecloses return. Relationship-as-crucible is off-stage; the dead lover appears only as ember-shape, so status dynamics and secondary-character pressure are minimal but acceptable within single-POV scope.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Drives under Accumulative/Textural lens: each spice, beast, and dream accretes into a ritual that reweights the stake—becoming what hears the dead. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the two birds kiss beside the stone, scattering petals whose brightness is the felt cost of never again walking wholly human. Causality is poetic but intact—every inhalation of scent advances the metamorphosis; no prop or memory teleport. Orientation is taught early (“permanent moonlight” by line 2) and repays at close when moon lowers like counsel, waiving any late-anchor penalty.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The orchard functions as micro-setting: its spice-laden breath is the sole vector for transformation, constraining the protagonist to barter with scent rather than spell. Spatial choreography stays clean—fox circles, ravens fold moon into wings, stag blossoms remain tracked. Sensory selection is POV-filtered (“cinnamon unspools a road animals trust”) and mirrors internal state without overt symbolism. The moon’s refusal to sunrise and the stone shaped by hooves are reused anchors that evolve into the final image, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“become what hears you best”—is signalled in the cookie fortune and tightens when each spice inhalation narrows the option of staying human. Pressure escalates through accretion: every beast arrival heightens the cost of refusal (bones ache, throat feathers). Visible price is paid on-page: the protagonist forfeits human form and single name, foreclosing return. No outside coincidence; ember-lover’s arrival is earned by the spice road the narrator built.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the particular alchemy of scent and grief: love’s persistence demands self-dissolution, not reunion in old shape. Subtext lives in gesture—fox’s sigh, stone’s hoof-prints—never in thesis statements. Final image of two birds scattering petals offers non-literal answer: listening requires shedding the singular self. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in the fortune tucked underground, sprouting unnamed paths.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>First-person voice carries a distinct perceptual signature: synesthetic scent-constellations, feather-grammar, saffron laughter folded into rice. Rhythm modulates from long breath-spirals of memory to clipped bird-utterances (“Hear me by being me”). No head-hopping; even fox’s speech is filtered through narrator’s mythic idiom. Filter verbs are voice-motivated (“I smell… I taste…”) and compress without dulling immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud ear shows variation: urgent enjambed clauses under metamorphosis, then slowed cadence for landing. Metaphors stay coherent within spice-astral logic; no mixed vehicles. High information density—one sentence can anchor time, scent, and emotional stakes (“Clove sparks braid my hair with smoke”). Minor loop: “paradoxically steady” appears twice; does not obscure closure. No scaffolding, no template cadence in final third.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Fuses Orpheus, animist shamanism, and spice-route cosmology into a singular vision. The fortune-cookie slip reconfigured as talismanic script feels inevitable yet fresh. Risk—lyric ellipsis, talking beasts—heightens stakes without sacrificing clarity. Transformation test fails if names/places swapped: scent-alphabet and moon-orchard are irreplaceable. Bonus +0.3 for bold lyric structure that pays off in charged poise.</comment>
