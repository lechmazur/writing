<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The chronicler’s guilt-driven compulsion is embodied in every tactile micro-choice—penciling “Datum A,” shouldering the swollen door, clearing twigs one by one—so the final vow to “write toward self-forgiveness” is earned by visible, muddy labor. Interior contradiction pulses throughout: the need to confess wars with the reflex to pretty the map. The busker’s silent demand (“tell the town”) supplies external pressure that crystallizes the renunciation. Only the brother-love remains asserted rather than dramatized, a hairline slip keeping the score sub-9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the portal sealed, the atlas annotated with blunt culpability, the chronicler’s future voice forever freighted with maintenance. Causal chain holds—romantic omission → clog → death → confession → physical clearing → public accountability—each beat tightening options. The 120-word orientation gate is met by line 5; no teleporting props or retro-patches appear. Cost is legible in the final image: chalk notes that “make no promises beyond truth,” a public scar that forecloses easy absolution.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Setting is lived-in instrument, not backdrop: ivy clicks like metronome, mica flashes like dragon teeth, the accordion’s taped scales mirror river skin, all filtering through the chronicler’s cartographer gaze. The station’s spatial logic is tracked cleanly from platform to waiting room to bathroom to freight gate; bodies and tools never float. Environment constrains the climax—only by kneeling at the rusted portal can the choke be reached and the confession written. One hairline slip: the culvert’s “cough” is acoustically vivid but never physically located relative to the platform, keeping the score sub-9.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—self-forgiveness versus truthful accountability—signals in paragraph 4 and escalates through each tactile admission. The middle tightening occurs when graffiti arrows force the chronicler to relabel “irrelevant” portal as choke point, trading aesthetic map for ugly culpability. Cost is visible: muddy hands, public chalk confession, the lifelong maintenance sentence. Pressure plateaus rather than spikes after the clog is cleared; the final beat is quiet reconfiguration rather than new jeopardy, a minor flattening that keeps the score just below the 9-line.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: beauty that kills must be maintained into blunt utility. The atlas mutates from badge of pride to ledger of blame; the accordion’s patched lung becomes sonic mirror of culvert and finally silent witness—objects reweighted, not symbol-stamped. Final image of “chalk notes that make no promises beyond truth” offers Conceptual Repricing: the town’s future gaze now prices the chronicler’s reputation. No moralizing sentence intrudes; resonance is carried by the image of taped bellows relearning breath, a quiet but undeniable aftershock.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>First-person voice is irreducibly specific: “mud under thumbnails,” “ghost badges,” “rosy article” all stem from a map-maker’s perceptual grammar. Syntax lengthens during reflective guilt, then compresses into methodical imperative (“one twig, one rag, one stone”) under manual labor, rhythm tracking emotional cadence. No head-hopping; the busker’s interior is only inferred through gesture and eye contact, preserving distance. The occasional elevated phrase—“conceptual repricing,” “symmetric satisfaction”—reads as chronicler’s professional reflex rather than authorial intrusion, keeping texture intact.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: every sentence advances image, guilt, or action; no paraphrase loops or synonym churn detected. Metaphors are controlled—dragon teeth, river-scale tape—each re-enters to tighten pattern without cluttering. One mixed vehicle (“rib cage flexed” after “lung lifting”) momentarily blurs anatomical logic, a hairline artifact. Final paragraph’s cadence shift—accordion sigh relearning size—lands clean, recharging earlier bellows imagery and sealing momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Flood-culprit-as-flawed-romantic-chronicler is fresh angle; the inverse rescue—clearing debris to rescue the living town rather than the dead boy—reverses expected redemption arc. Integration of patched accordion as both sonic metaphor and breathing witness feels inevitable yet unforeseeable. Risky second-person address to self (“Daring does not require recklessness”) is earned by prior embodied labor. No derivative premise guardrail triggered; specificity transforms familiar guilt narrative into singular riverine ledger.</comment>
