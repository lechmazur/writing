<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lira’s abstinence is not a label but a honed instrument: the refusal of desire becomes the blade that can cut the city’s lullaby. Every micro-choice—barefoot steps, breath-as-metronome, unpinning hair—springs from the vow and visibly costs her body heat, balance, pulse-thinning. The braid she unweaves is her own chastity turned weapon; the cost is the city’s tremor that rattles her ankles. Interior contradiction (yearn to touch / must not) stays live in scene, no diagnostic talk—just frost-burned soles and the audible thinning of heartbeat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the prisms dim to “instruments not masters,” a conceptual repricing that reframes every prior echo. The cost is legible in the single line “the city shivered” under her unbraiding hand—collective obedience physically cracks. Accumulative lens holds: pattern of ribbon-echoes → courtyard glow → braid-burn → sanctuary inversion, each beat deepening stakes without causal leaps. No orientation debt; who/where/when anchored by line 3, speculative rule (door between breath) taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Silver courtyard under snow functions as micro-setting: the reflective surface doubles as recording medium for footprints and refracted echoes, constraining how quietly Lira must move. Snow’s crunch resistance literally times her breath-metronome; frost bite threatens her toes—environmental cost felt on skin. Door that “grows from story” is object-as-setting: its material (braided narratives) is later dismantled, so environment itself is rewritten. Final image of path newly written in snow recharges the opening “blue hush” with agency rather than stillness.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—free the city’s compressed voices—signaled in line 5; escalation is Accumulative: each untangled ribbon adds a live artery of light under ice, tightening the visual/textural density until the city-wide braid is exposed. One decisive intensification: when she burns the braid, the courtyard physically shivers—collective stake becomes somatic. Every cost (pulse thinning, snow writing new path) is on-page; no coincidences. Agency is renunciation/creation rather than combat, fitting the vow.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges as inverse prostitution: Lira sells nothing, yet her withheld touch becomes the currency that buys collective voice back. No explicit thesis—meaning accrues through refractive imagery: ribbon → artery → prism → fish-school light, all motifs of redistribution rather than possession. Final image of “interval that slid between sigh and smile” offers a non-literal answer: politics is breath-timing, not doctrine. Complexity intact—city is not utopia, just newly un-muffled; ambiguity lingers in “alarming serenity.”</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Third-person lyric compresses syntax to courtesan-precise gestures: “syllables stamped into frost” marries body and text. Perceptual signature—Lira notices temperature of breath, knot-tension in hair, pitch of whispers—never drifts into authorial tour-guide. Rhythm accelerates with micro-phrases during unbraiding, then exhales into longer clauses at release. No dialogue needed; voice carries subtext through image cadence. Non-standard grammar (“metronome for that uncounted interval”) is pattern-taught and paid off by door opening.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet aerated: every metaphor carries physical consequence—moonwater bowl holds literal frost-melt that will soak her soles. No mixed vehicles; prism logic stays optical, never becomes random crystal-spray. Varied sentence length mirrors pulse thinning: short clauses at threshold, expansive release after door opens. No loops or scaffold; each line either advances image or tightens breath-clock. Opening and closing lines act as dovetail joints, re-using “between sigh and smile” to reweight meaning.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Transforms the trope of the sacred prostitute into a politics of refusal: chastity as insurgent art. Combines lyric mosaic, speculative door-logic, and collective catharsis in a way that feels inevitable, not stitched. Risk—entire plot hinges on untangling metaphor—pays off because physical city shivers when narrative braid is pulled. Specificity of “ribbons of breath” tied to real clients’ fears could not be swapped with generic threads. Fresh inflection: the revolution is whisper-restoration, not violence—a conceptual turn that lingers.</comment>
