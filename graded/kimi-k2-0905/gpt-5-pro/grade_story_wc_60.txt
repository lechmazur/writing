<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator’s skeptical empiricist streak and lantern-glow contradiction are vividly embodied from the first sentence, giving us a coherent, contradiction-driven interiority that stays consistent. The father-fear secret lands as a credible emotional key and earns the panel-opening beat; the moment of letting the river-taste memory pass through without clinging shows micro-choice under pressure. What keeps this from the 9-band is that the interior arc plateaus there—no further contradiction is pressure-tested once the box opens, so the “change” feels more reported than re-lived. Still, the voice-specific perceptual signature (mica dust, brass letter-blade) threads every beat, so characterization remains the story’s strongest pillar.</question>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Closure is undeniably on the page: a Conceptual Repricing in which the city’s stalled time and the narrator’s filial fear are simultaneously restarted/released, with a felt gust of pepper-lilac wind as cost. Causality is lyrical-accumulative rather than tight because/then, but the breadcrumb-glass motif teaches the pattern early and the heron-shadow key completes it, satisfying the Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 5 and never drift. The only micro-teleport is the brass blade suddenly in hand for prying, but the tool has been foregrounded as a letter opener earlier, so the lapse is hairline, not fatal.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>City of motionless fountains is more than backdrop—it withholds water, coins, bird-nests, and memory-shadow, forcing the narrator’s choices (whispering, prying, thumb-press). Glass-shard breadcrumbs function as micro-setting that guides literal footsteps; heron statue shadow serves as the final lock-pin, so environment actively constrains tactics. Sensory economy is high—lilac-pepper wind, gummy pitch, mica dust—each image returns charged. Micro-setting beats macro-description, but the square’s spatial layout remains coherent across the pivot from panel to basin to sky, earning the high band.</question>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—liberate trapped memories to restart the city—surfaces in paragraph 3 and escalates through each breadcrumb and dry-fountain failure. The single meaningful tightening occurs when the narrator must confess a never-spoken fear to unstick the panel; this micro-turn forecloses the option of remaining purely rational observer and prices the victory with intimate exposure. Under Accumulative lens, pressure intensifies by pattern completion rather than new obstacles; cost remains conceptual but legible. No luck saves the day—only the aligned heron star and the narrator’s thumb-press—so agency stays intact.</question>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as the cost of empirical vigilance: total skepticism freezes the world, while selective vulnerability—admitting love-derived fear—restarts it. The stained glass box literalizes the idea that memory is fragile, communal, and constellation-ordered; its release re-prices the city’s rule-set without moralizing. Subtext resides in gesture (father’s pump lesson) rather than thesis, and the final “defiant hush” chorus keeps ambiguity alive. Insight feels earned because it is tied to the narrator’s concrete renunciation of emotional armor.</question>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>First-person voice owns a distinct perceptual signature: scientific diction (“test,” “valves like bones”) layered with glittering lyricism (“sunset blood,” “pepper and lilacs”). Syntax flexes from patient cumulative clauses to fragment bursts under pressure—“Shapes flew out, not birds, not paper, but laughters…”—without losing clarity. No dialogue, so voice coherence is judged solely on internal monologue, which passes. Filter verbs are minimal; when they appear (“I felt a small one press”) they serve tactility. The risk of poetic overwrite is flirted with but never breaks the narrative clock, earning near-top band.</question>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm modulates effectively; long breathy clauses mirror sidereal patience, then tighten into staccato releases at the un-sticking. Metaphors are dense but purposeful—each returns charged (mica lantern light reframes the glass box constellations). No mixed metaphors or paraphrase loops detected; information density is high. A few adjective-clusters (“gummy with pitch, edges stuck…”) could be trimmed, but they occur low-pressure and do not dull the final image, so the penalty is minor.</question>

<question>8</question>
<question>8.6</question>
<comment>The memory-fountains nexus feels freshly synthesized: frozen city awaiting avian signal is imaginative, yet grounded by tactile detail (coins, nests, tar-shadow). “Stained glass box of constellations” objectifies collective memory without slipping into allegory; its maker’s fingerprints literalize the human trace. Risk is taken in the lyrical-accumulative structure, but it pays off when the heron-shadow key completes the pattern. Not quite 9+ because the core quest is a classic “find the magical MacGuffin to restart the world,” albeit lushly re-skinned; the thematic reweighting is what elevates it.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Early, mid, and end: the luminous skeptic frames the quest, must decide to confess fear (middle turn), and releases memory without hoarding it (end renunciation). Cost is visible—public exposure of filial fear—so the trait is not ornamental. Swapping “skeptic” would break the central contradiction that powers every beat.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Present in first third as rumor, central to climax beats (panel opening, constellation key alignment, wind release), and implicitly reweighted when emptied box is returned for next use. Its irreplaceable specificity—constellation panes, maker’s fingerprints—drives the heron-star lock. Remove it and the entire causal chain collapses.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Concept named early, enacted through narrator’s waiting for star-shadow alignment, and pays off in the final thumb-press that costs him emotional exposure. It directly enables the release beat; without sidereal patience the box stays sealed. The idea is not just thematic garnish but tactical necessity.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Trait motivates refusal to pray yet willingness to experiment; it enables the brass-blade prying and later the rational star-alignment test. Visible trade-off: clinging to empiricism delays the necessary emotional confession. Remove the trait and the narrator would have opened the panel sooner, changing pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.7</question>
<comment>Only prying the panel after confession creates the decisive change; un-sticking is the hinge beat that transitions from search to release. The action is foreshadowed by brass letter-blade and cannot be swapped without breaking causality. Cost is immediate—pitch sigh, hinge protest—so it carries weight.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.3</question>
<comment>Breadcrumb trail structures the middle third; each colored shard narrows location and keeps stakes legible. Mechanics matter—without following them the narrator would never reach the heron square. They also accumulate textural density, feeding the accumulative lens. Late arrival would cap score, but they enter by ~30% and guide every subsequent move.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.5</question>
<comment>Setting is not backdrop but antagonist: dry fountains withhold water/memory, force whispers, supply tar-shadow that must be pried. Micro-settings—coin-crusted bowls, heron statue shadow—directly constrain tactics and final key alignment. Remove forgotten-fountains and the entire寓言 collapses; the city’s dormancy is the stake itself.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.9</question>
<comment>Paused geese provide the initial temporal anomaly and create urgency, but once the box opens they merely resume flight—no further clock pressure. Time does tighten the square’s breath-hold, yet the narrator’s patience is internally generated, not externally clock-driven. Hence high but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.8</question>
<comment>Desire is declared in paragraph 3 and conflicted throughout: skepticism vs. need to believe memories matter. Choice to free memories even at personal exposure (father-fear confession) dramatizes motive with cost. The goal shapes every tactical beat; removing it nullifies the quest.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.4</question>
<comment>“Defiant hush” is introduced in paragraph 7 and modulates—whispers in dry basins, secret confession, final murmuring chorus—keeping tone coherent yet dynamic under rising pressure. It charges the ending image by promising future chorus, satisfying the charged-poise closure. Static mood would cap lower, but here tone evolves with stakes.</comment>
