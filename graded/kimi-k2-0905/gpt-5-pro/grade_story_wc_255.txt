<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Ilias’s color-blindness and “innocently cunning” hands are shown through concrete micro-choices—slipping the reed into the phoenix, painting with smoke water, trading herbs for trust. The interior contradiction between seeking imperfection and fearing praise is present but soft; the final quiet offer to stay shows earned endurance rather than a sharp change. Because the arc is accumulative/lyric, the absence of a single decisive renunciation is acceptable, yet the cost (Mara’s burned throat, the traveler’s sunken song) is felt more by others than by Ilias himself, keeping him just shy of the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The mosaic shards (phoenix failure → reed insertion → child’s prism) braid cleanly under an accumulative/textural lens; each addition reweights “awakening” until the final chorus of cracked glass singing. Transitions are legible via repeated plant-signaling motif, and closure lands in a Charged Poise: the courtyard now practices imperfection aloud. Orientation is complete by line 4; no因果关系 breaks, and the persistent constraint of Mara’s silence keeps cost visible. Minor cap: the traveler’s boat loss is told not dramatized, a hairline slip that prevents 9.0.</comment>

<comment>The courtyard operates as micro-setting: kiln heat, ash grit, and the cracked phoenix pedestal constrain every tactical move (reed insertion angle, paint drying speed). Sensory hierarchy obeys Ilias’s value-scale eyes—texture, weight, smoke—never lapsing into color tourism. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly across the single continuous afternoon; bodies and plant sprigs never float. The final image of nettle-chamomile wreath on the now-singing bird recharges the setting with “home,” satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“will imperfect glass be allowed to sing?”—tightens via each bartered awakening: first the traveler's reed, then the child's prism. Escalation is textural: each added crack repurposes failure into voice, reweighting the stake under accumulative lens. Agency remains Ilias’s (he selects herbs, seats the reed, paints veins), but the visible price (Mara’s throat, traveler’s memory) is borne by allies, blunting cost legibility a notch. One clear deepening: when apprentice protests “glass should be silent,” silence itself becomes the final obstacle; overcoming it earns the tightening.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme—imperfection as communal practice—emerges through the singing crack, the laughing child’s broken rainbows, mint-wreath “home.” No character moralizes; the concept reconfigures via concrete reprises. Subtext resides in plant grammar: fennel = risk, yarrow = healing, nettle = stay; meaning accrues silently. Final image offers Conceptual Repricing: the once-failed phoenix now defines safety, proving perfection was never the goal—an answer felt without a preached moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person close clings to Ilias’s value-perception: “color would lie to him anyway” anchors voice early. Syntax mirrors his tactile bias—nouns of weight, verbs of leaning/tilting—creating a perceptual signature distinct from Mara’s vegetal silence or the apprentice’s spoken doubt. No head-hopping; apprentice’s interiority is filtered through Ilias’s speculation. Rhythm modulates: longer clauses for painting, staccato for reed’s first chirp, ending on a hushed participial cadence that teaches the pattern and pays off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Line-level density is high: “paints the breast with smoke water and milk lime, not for color but for texture that teaches air where to travel” performs three jobs—action, motive, world rule—in 24 words. No synonym loops; metaphor vehicles stay glass-specific (arterial fault, seam of ore). One minor scaffold: “bartered awakenings” is repeated four times—purposeful refrain, but the final instance could have been pruned for freshness. Artifacts never touch closure beat; reed hum and child laugh land clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fusion of color-blind painter + plant-code conversation + singing cracked phoenix feels inevitable yet unseen before; each element transforms the others. Risk in lyric mosaic structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. Tropes—wounded artisan, failed phoenix—are inverted: the bird’s fall becomes the year’s true blessing. Specificity anchors freshness: “concertina reed tongue” is exact, not interchangeable. The conceptual repricing of imperfection as communal festival offers durable insight beyond surface novelty.</comment>
