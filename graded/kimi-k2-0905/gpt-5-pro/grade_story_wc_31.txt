<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The lamplighter’s quiet hunger to “hear color” is concrete, embodied, and drives every beat; the admission “I was tired” and the final lifted lamp show a credible, costly shift from hiding to listening. Interiority stays specific and sensorial—no therapy-speak—yet the moment he presses the brass tag to wood to “listen” rather than open is the single micro-choice that crystallizes value hierarchy. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in scene between that beat and surfacing, so the internal conflict plateaus rather than intensifies, capping short of 9.0.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the tag’s hum gifts him a new hue of rest that reweights reality, cost felt in the open-door image. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each lantern, ladder rung, and ledger phosphor thickens density until the final color reconfigures meaning. Orientation is taught by line 3 (“meteor hush of the harbor”) and paid off when that same hush folds around the final lamp, so no penalty. Persistent constraint: the sunken library’s sideways silence literally shapes how he listens and what he can become.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The pier’s vertical ladder, weed-slippery pilings, and the ship’s rib-scrolled spine are navigated tactically—rope coil, skiff, window—and the final lift of the lamp is charged by that spatial memory. Sensory hierarchy matches urgency: tin-to-velvet sound shift narrows perception during descent, algae-lit spines widen it inside. Environment constrains the climax: only inside the drowned library can the tag become tuning plate; without that sideways hush, the new color never vibrates. Specificity is irreplaceable—no generic underwater scene could supply the same acoustic-cum-chromatic epiphany.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“discover the color of sound”—is signaled in the third sentence and tightens when the ledger entry swells, forcing an audible admission that costs him anonymity. Escalation is density-driven: each lantern vow, phonograph horn, and phosphor letter enlarges the same obsession until the cabinet hum forecloses passive hiding. No causal antagonist, but the sky lantern release acts as synchronous pressure that pulls tide and gaze upward while he steals downward, a situational tightening that crystallizes stance. Cost is legible: the open-door truth he now carries is irreversible, yet the price feels slightly conceptual rather than visceral, keeping it shy of 9.0.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the sensory paradox of hearing color; no character ever labels the moral. The brass tag shifts from talisman of refuge to tuning fork of transformation, its final song reframing every prior lantern vow as shared spectral testimony. Subtext resides in gesture—the act of pressing metal to wood “not to open, but to listen” rewrites secrecy as surrender. Final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer: an open door through which “the color of sound walks,” sidestepping tidy profundity while retaining undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>First-person diction stays within a lamplighter’s plausible lexicon yet achieves lyric compression—“paper suns,” “library leaned on its side as if reading in bed”—without self-contradictory metaphor. Perceptual signature is consistent: sound is always texture (tin, velvet, cedar-rain) and color is always tasted or heard, never seen. Rhythm modulates: short paratactic clauses surface air, longer sinuous sentences mimic underwater suspension. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk is zero; the single POV remains stable, and any experimental elision (“the room became a bell”) is taught by prior acoustic imagery and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry triple duty—e.g., “Their small suns would climb into the wind like soft-spoken stars with errands” advances image, stakes, and tonal metaphor simultaneously. No scaffold loops; each noun is specific (“weed-brown pilings,” “sailcloth ledger”) and each verb kinetic (“slipped,” “sledged,” “folded”). Figurative language peaks at the climax yet stays coherent: the “shifting dusk that stained the edges of things with rest” sustains the color-as-sound motif without mixed metaphor. Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally, and the final line’s monosyllabic pulse (“I did not hide”) provides cadence payoff after lyrical elongation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>The fusion of lamplighter lore, drowned library, and synesthetic quest feels inevitable yet unexampled; remove any pillar and the story collapses. Risk-taking—horizontal ship as reading bedroom, phonograph horn “nested with eels”—is specific, not quirky, and sharpens rather than blurs stakes. The luminous-vow motif is transformed from tourist spectacle into acoustic alphabet, a reweighting that reprises in hindsight. Emotional truth centers on exhaustion turned exaltation, a complexity that resists feel-good reduction while remaining universally legible.</comment>
