<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Lys’s interiority—"carrying whole folios as if they were polite birds"—is vivid and idiosyncratic; her micro-choices (seasoning omissions, cupping hovering letters) reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. The final renunciation—drawing the iron-gall line through the pretender’s title—pays off every prior beat and carries visible cost: the rune hums, the ledger stiffens, the false signet flakes. Secondary characters (gardener, historian) apply immediate pressure without crowding choreography. The only hairline slip: the pretender’s "smile like linen" is repeated almost verbatim, trimming freshness from his collapse.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a clean Decisive Change: the pretender’s title is publicly sundered, the ledger’s minnows snap into bones, and the false signet dissolves—cost is legible in the flaking salt image. Causal chain holds: cryptic messages → faithful assembly → counter-reading of genealogies → corridor opens → ledger confrontation → title line. The Orientation Test is waived: deliberate early disorientation ("dust moved like thoughtful constellations") is taught and pays off when the library reconfigures at climax. Lens is Accumulative/Textural: density of ink, dust, and drift rune reweights stakes until the final image reprices legitimacy itself.</comment>

<comment>The ancient temple library is not backdrop but active constraint: shelves arrest collapse, corridors slide only during the pause, the clerestory admits starlight that exposes forged ink. Micro-setting objects—iron-gall pellet, mirrored bowls, bark-bound ledger—are handled in tactile beats that alter tactics. Spatial choreography remains clean across the mosaic walk and corridor shift. One minor over-description cluster ("linen" smile twice, "regally unpretentious" triple echo) keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—unmasking the textual usurper—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens when the iron-gall line physically forecloses his claim. Escalation is accretive: each cryptic message adds a reader, each reading thickens the genealogy until the counter-walk unlocks the sealed corridor. Visible price: the pretender’s smile flakes into salt, the library coughs up alternate margins, Lys forfeits anonymity. One beat could be sharper: the gardener’s river-name utterance feels slightly lucky rather than earned by prior tactics, holding it shy of 9.0.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: history is a palimpsest that bleeds when scratched by truthful ink. Subtextual irony—Lys edits by omission, the pretender by addition—culminates in the ledger’s stiffening, reweighting the idea that narrative texture, not force, decides sovereignty. Final image of the signet jar labeled "Seasoning for future recipes" offers conceptual repricing: tyranny reduced to kitchen spice, cautionary flavor for posterity. No moralizing, only resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is densely lyrical yet precise: "tannins bite like truth where lies had lacquered gloss" marries chemistry to morality. Perceptual signature is consistent—Lys notices weight, texture, taste, never sight alone—mirroring her bibliophile body. Rhythm modulates: long sentences for drift, staccato for sunder. One near-repeat of "regally unpretentious" thins freshness, but the final sighing laurel re-establishes cadence control.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>High information density: single sentences deliver world, metaphor, and stakes ("edits crawled like ivy through dynastic lines"). No scaffolding or synonym loops; metaphors stay physically coherent. Minor register drift—"conceptual repricing" diction nudges academic in closing line—does not obscure closure. Ear-test rhythm holds; paragraph cuts are clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses bibliographic noir with celestial architecture: a library that rearranges only when constellations argue is genuinely new. The iron-gall pellet as truth-detecting stylus, the ledger whose entries flee gaze, the pause as pocket-universe clock—all evolve from prior particulars rather than late gimmicks. Risky structure (lyric, accumulative shards) heightens coherence without obscuring stakes. Transformation test fails if relocated: the drift rune, ink chemistry, and star-lit bowls are inseparable from this invented archive.</comment>
