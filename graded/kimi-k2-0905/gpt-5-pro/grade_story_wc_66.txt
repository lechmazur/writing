<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mara’s copyist precision is embodied in every micro-choice—annotating lyrics, bowing the E, teaching seams—so her luminous hands and refusal to cloak the final reply feel earned. Interior contradiction is muted; she never doubts her hidden purpose, so the arc is less a change than a steady intensification. Still, her quiet authority and the visible cost of exposure at the end supply credible endurance with felt risk.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the dust has learned words, the signal will travel beyond bells, and Mara’s open broadcast carries undeniable social cost under searchlight threat. Accumulative lens holds: each night’s lyric layer thickens pattern until the final unshawled tap names the ridge, reweighting stakes. Orientation is taught early via fog, ember alcove, and radio glow; no anchors drift. One minor loop—“the room breathed / the room kept a thistled calm”—does not touch the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The ember alcove, velvet-shawled radio, and phosphor-stained hands form a micro-setting that actively constrains every tactical choice: cloak or uncloak, ash or silence. Selective sensory hierarchy—sea-green arithmetic, salt of static—mirrors copyist attention. Spatial choreography holds as neighbors drift, boots pass, shutters lift. The ridge above the mill enters late yet charges the final tap with geographic specificity that forecloses escape.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—keep the pirate song alive long enough to teach dust speech—is signaled in paragraph three and tightens when searchlights comb the orchard, forcing the unshawled reply that exposes Mara. Accumulative escalation: each broadcast layer adds silhouettes, elders, forests, widening the square until the law must notice. Visible price: the named ridge invites patrols; the final open-air transmission is irreversible. Agency is steady rather than explosive, but the cost is legible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges obliquely: memory is not retrieved but rehearsed—dust, ash, chalk reconstituted by communal breath. The pirate signal stands in for outlawed history; teaching dust to speak becomes a quiet revolution without slogans. Final image—“the hills would carry it farther than any bell”—reweights silence itself as the loudest archive. No moral is stated; resonance is carried by the reed ladder, the cracked violin, and the powder that now dreams in words.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays tightly fused to Mara’s copyist ear: intervals map as vowels, consonants tap tempos, margins bloom metronomes. Syntax mirrors musical phrasing—comma-chained clauses that rise and resolve—while diction stays within her lexicon of staves, rests, slates. No head-hop; perceptual signature is consistent even when crowds enter. The velvet shawl, mildew paper, and reed ladder feel filtered through her tactile professionalism.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Rhythm breathes with scene tempo: long inhalations for fog, clipped bursts for tapped replies. Figurative layering is dense yet purposeful—“ripple became outline,” “bruises bloom”—each image advances the dust-animation beat. One scaffold pair: “the room breathed, and the pirate broadcast became a town square” could compress, but it does not recur. No mixed metaphors or register drift; closure line is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Familiar tropes—post-catastrophe silence, pirate radio, found-family art—are transmuted through the copyist’s score-marking craft and the literalization of “teaching dust to tell stories.” The reed-ladder breath notation and phosphor-inherited hands feel particular to this world. Risk is taken in the lyric accumulative structure, yet coherence holds. Final reconfiguration—silence itself made articulate—feels inevitable yet unforeseen.</comment>
