<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Mara’s contradictory impulses—yearning to restart the rains yet fearing the return of grind—are dramatized in the camera-wheel clicks and the final memory-payment; her fifteen-year-old vow is surrendered with wrench specificity, earning the renunciation. Interiority stays concrete (“regret loosen…as a dropped wrench”), never drifting into label-speak. The ghost’s mirror-status forces a visible cost: loss of that vow’s innocence. All beats grow from her scavenger pragmatism and chronologic disorientation without competence drift.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each camera-wheel click deposits a story-fragment that reweights the stake—“rhythm sculpted them” re-prices the past so the final spray-question mark becomes Conceptual Repricing with undeniable cost. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 3; no penalty. Closure is clean: the carousel’s shudder acknowledges the vow-forfeit, making the cost legible on-page. Persistent constraint: the vow, once paid, cannot be reclaimed—this shapes the final image under the lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The kinetic lagoon/cloud-carousel engine rules are taught through motion-silence contrasts; the camera wheel acts as micro-setting that literally prongs the water, constraining how stories surface. Sensory hierarchy (sound of dust, shivering lilies) mirrors Mara’s narrowed crisis attention. Spatial choreography holds: pontoon, paddles, ghost-distance track cleanly. Environment charges the final image—carousel flexes in response to vow-payment—meeting 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restart rains vs. restart grind) is signaled early; escalation occurs through each camera click that narrows Mara’s moral options until the ghost demands the vow-memory. The tightening is textural—stories accrue density—but the final tribute is a felt price, satisfying 8.8+ threshold. Slight short of 8.8 only because the cost is emotional, not an external resource loss that alters later tactics.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the concrete transaction: stories as currency against mechanized repetition. The final spray-question mark refuses a moral, instead reweighting “eroded ambitions” as livable material. No thematic echo or final-paragraph moralizing. Resonance is built from the particular image of a vow mineralized in time, not from abstract assertion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lyric third-person hovers close to Mara’s perceptual bias—wind “tickles the ears like dust,” chronology “slides.” Syntax compresses under pressure (“regret loosen…dropped wrench”) yet stays legible. No head-hopping; ghost’s voice is filtered through Mara’s hearing. Camera-wheel clicks create a rhythmic motif that is taught early and paid off in final spray, satisfying 9+ quick test with minimal hairline slip.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density—each sentence layers image and stakes (“song stripped to bones”). Metaphors stay coherent within the cloud-machinery physics. Variation in sentence length breathes with the carousel halt/resume. No register drift; “torque,” “vane,” “pontoon” fit scavenger lexicon. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and re-charge motif.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: memory-as-currency extracted by a broken camera wheel from a sky lagoon to barter with one’s own ghost—risky yet fully realized. The carousel-as-time-engine and vow-mineral trope are transformed through tactile specifics. Emotional truth (fear of re-grind) grounds the concept. Bold lyric structure heightens meaning without gimmickry; closure remains legible.</comment>
