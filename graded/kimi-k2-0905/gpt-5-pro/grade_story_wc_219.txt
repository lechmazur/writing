<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The luminous-skeptic narrator’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“I doubted every triumphant headline yet refused the dark”), but the envoys remain atmospheric silhouettes; their only visible choice is the final filament-through-bell gesture. The protagonist’s academically rebellious trait is asserted rather than dramatized in a costly micro-choice, so the arc stays lyrically resonant rather than causally earned. Still, the contradiction between empirical rigor and pilgrimage-ritual is held in charged poise at the bell tower, supplying an Earned Stasis closure with felt cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens is declared early and maintained: every footprint/vial/bell swing layers density toward the resin-to-stone-to-eight ratio that “balances homecoming by travel.” Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—the tower’s hush is newly roofed by shared attention—visible when narrator tucks the amber away and steps into a “rinsed world.” No causal reversals are required under this lens; the meaningful tightening is the final data convergence whose cost is the surrender of lab-bench certainty. Orientation and motivation are anchored within the first 120 words; only a hairline slip of late-introduced bell-rope keeps it from 9+.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The rainwashed tower, resin-scented vials, and alien dust footprints are never backdrop: each constrains the next move (spectrometer readings dictate pacing; bell rope becomes the final instrument). Micro-setting triumphs: the fly amber shard is handled thrice, its “forever reach” reframed as grief data, then tucked away to reweight the exit image. Vines drowning the bronze heron legs mirror human fear swallowed by ritual, charging the thematic chemistry. Spatial choreography is flawless; no impossible positions or floating props.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Single dominant stake—“understand the chemistry of homecoming”—tightens through sensory sampling, not external opposition. The meaningful deepening is the envoy chord at the bell landing: shared salinity re-weights “home” from place to exchange constant, foreclosing lab-alone option. Cost is legible: narrator concedes protocol “unruly,” accepts tower hush as heavier than time. Under Accumulative lens, density increase suffices; no reversal needed. Keeps high band but not 9+ because price is conceptual, not viscerally felt on page.</question>

<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: home as chemical ratio (3:5:8) rather than geography, epistemic humility as spiritual practice. Subtext operates in gesture—envoy tongue tracing volatile signatures—never explicated. Final image of “rinsed world” reprices prior material without moral tag. No thematic echo or sermonizing; ambiguity lingers about whether shared attention suffices for future pilgrims. Resonance is built from amber, salt math, and bell arc, not abstract assertion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>First-person voice carries a scientist’s compressed lyricism: “manners can be molecular,” “salt math inside their muscles.” Perceptual signature is consistent—data-before-story skepticism filters every sense. Rhythm modulates: short clauses under tower hush, longer breathless rolls during footprint tracking. No head-hopping; envoy translations are reported, not interiorized. Register stays within narrator’s plausible lexicon; only “ancestral salinity” flirts with poetic license but is justified by alien translation frame.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Almost every sentence performs two jobs: “We mapped our approach via dusty footprints left on an overgrown sculpture path, nothing else permitted” simultaneously anchors setting, rule, and tone. Figurative language is patterned and paid off—bronze quiet, resin grief—never muddles causality. No paraphrase loops or template cadence; sentence openings vary. Minor scaffold: “We shared the amber again” repeats prior syntax for ritual effect but is purposeful. Closure beat is clean, luminous, unpadded.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Premise—alien contact negotiated through scent archaeology and DIY pilgrimage—feels freshly synthesized, not cribbed. Risk of lyric-scientific hybrid pays off: ratio 3:5:8 as emotional climax is non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Amber shard reframed as “window sealed with grief” then as exchange constant is specific to this voice; swap artifact would collapse closure image. No trope recycling; “first contact” genre is subverted by refusal of geopolitical spectacle in favor of micro-ritual. Bold structural choice to eschew conflict-based escalation succeeds under Accumulative lens.</comment>
