<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The narrator’s interiority is rich—“lattice of images and scents,” “laughter steadied my hands”—and the final barefoot step into mud is an embodied micro-choice that earns the name-shed. Yet the only visible contradiction is between fear of being discarded and the emergent urge to invite others; we do not see simultaneous impulses collide in a single beat. Motive is clear and tightens, but the arc leans contemplative rather than genuinely flawed or mistake-ridden. Voice remains idiosyncratic enough to feel individual, not diagnostic.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the chosen path becomes mutual, crystallised in the communal heel-print in mud with the felt cost of leaving the bunker behind. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory layer (rust air, snail arithmetic, lichen consoles) thickens until the final braid reweights the premise. Orientation is quickly anchored (bunker exterior, storm coming). The only minor drag is the early dream exposition (“Each dream mapped…”) which lightly stalls momentum before the door opens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The bunker interior—lichen-faced consoles, stone figurine catching rain—functions as micro-setting that literally houses the directive and shapes the final act of rewriting. Vines, steam off coats, and “mud stamping documents” are tactile and choice-guiding. Sensory hierarchy obeys POV urgency: metallic taste first, then narrowing to envelope texture. Spatial choreography stays clean as the narrator backs out, vines re-knitting behind.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is legible by line 4: “whether mine still wanted me.” Escalation is tonal and accumulative—storm fists, flaking clauses—culminating in the communal pivot left that forecloses solitary transcendence. Agency is present: cracking the seal, writing with footprints, recruiting silhouettes. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral: surrender of the bunker’s shelter and the safety of solo interpretation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from reciprocal election—path and walker rewriting each other—without moralising. The wafer-seal constellation reprises as image, reweighting authority from city command to collective imprint. Subtext lives in gesture: the figurine “catching rain” quietly mirrors the humans catching their own choices. Final image avoids platitude, offering open-ended mercy rather than triumph.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>First-person voice is lyric yet controlled: “slow arithmetic of snail trails,” “brittle sweetness of old vows.” Perceptual signature stays selective—storm-checked pace, dreams read on wet glass. Syntax modulates from long breathy clauses to short imperative beats: “So I slowed.” No head-hopping or register drift; non-standard punctuation (absent) is unnecessary. Rhythmic propulsion mirrors the approaching storm.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but purposeful; mixed-metaphor risk is high yet vehicles stay coherent (“storm applauded with rain,” “vines reknit their modesty”). One minor loop: “brittle” used twice within four lines (seal + vows). Otherwise each sentence layers image, sense, or action; no filler. Read-aloud rhythm rises and falls like weather; paragraph cuts are clean.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The premise—an obsolete directive that must be physically re-written by walking—recasts post-apocalypse as collaborative cartography. Dream-navigation via snail trails and owl vocals is fresh yet internally logical. Risk in lyric compression pays off: the story would collapse if any noun (“precisely playful consoles,” “path spiraling inward crest”) were swapped. Emotional specificity trumps gimmick; the final communal heel-stamp feels inevitable yet newly envisioned.</comment>
