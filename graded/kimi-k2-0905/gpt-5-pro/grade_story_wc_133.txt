<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The painter’s hunger to “thresh meaning from experience” is embodied in every micro-choice: turning the brooch, following rain trails, painting the braid. Interior contradiction flickers when the cold line “pointed inland” yet he obeys, showing obsession overriding unease. The final acceptance of the brooch-back from Mara crystallizes a credible renunciation of payment, earning the stasis of gratitude. No diagnostic speak; the insomnia surfaces only as “awake when the pumps sighed,” keeping embodiment primary.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the finished mural becomes a living rain-map, reconfiguring the island’s future while the painter’s sleepless nights remain unpaid. Causal chain holds: brooch → rain trail → map → mural, each because/therefore link tightening options. Orientation is anchored by word 30 (“after the water wars”) and location cues persist. Cost is legible in the final clause—“teaching us”—where the painter’s private meaning becomes communal tool, foreclosing anonymity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Tidal island is no postcard: eelgrass-wrapped tire, salt-stiffened ropes, chapel cistern mouth “a black coin” all constrain movement and tool use. Rain threads and algae fresco are sensory, selective, and mirrored in the painted braid that will guide future floods. The amber brooch re-appears as light-casting “moons,” charging the final image. Environment is handled, not admired; it dictates scaffold placement and pigment choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—can the island relearn its own water paths without war-like machines—tightens when the map is found and must be painted publicly. One meaningful tightening: the cistern seam of light demands they haul the cylinder, risking contamination or collapse. Price is felt: elders’ flood songs keep the brush steady despite “hands shook with old nights,” showing stamina taxed. No off-stage resolution; the mural’s first rain is the on-page test.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from particulars: maps drawn in salt, ochres ground from brick, meaning threshed not by theory but by communal labor. The amber brooch’s circles evolve from pretty artifact to optic that reveals hidden seams, reweighting memory without moralizing. Final image—“rain crept down the painted lines”—offers a quiet, non-literal answer: knowledge must be lived on the body of the land. No thesis statement; resonance is tactile.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>First-person voice carries a painterly perceptual signature: tide “slid back like a tired lung,” pumps “sighed to sleep,” cistern “a black coin.” Rhythm modulates—compressed when cold “pointed inland,” expansive during fresco description—mirroring insomnia’s oscillations. No head-hopping; Mara’s dialogue stays external, filtered through painterly metaphors. Syntax reflects profession: brush-stroke sentences, color-drenched nouns.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Figurative language is patterned and paid off: tide-as-lung returns in “tired lung” of desal hall, rain “crept” like the painter himself. No mixed metaphors; vehicles stay hydraulic. Information density high—“amber holds sunlight like a breath” does twin duty of object and theme. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or causality. Clean grammar, pronouns unambiguous.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Freshenss lies in marrying climate-fiction salvage to pre-modern craft: a rain map painted in ochre on chapel ruin, replacing failed tech. The “rain cartographer” trope is inverted—his tool is jewelry, his legacy charcoal veins, not data servers. Risk of lyric obscurity is embraced yet clarity holds. Synthesis feels inevitable: of course the island’s future is hand-painted by sleepless artisans. Specificity everywhere—kelp-scab string, sailcloth coat—prevents generic dystopia.</comment>
