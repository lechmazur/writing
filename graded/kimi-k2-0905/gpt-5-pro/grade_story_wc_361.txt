<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The courier’s “jitter” is embodied early and revisited in the final image of “jittering need to prove presence,” giving interiority continuity. The contradictory impulse to keep wonder alive while cutting dependence on the pendant is dramatized in the decisive breath that releases it, earning a renunciation with cost. Mentor absence functions as lived weight, folding maps inside the reliquary, not mere backstory. Voice remains singular, though secondary characters (singer, woman) are more emblematic than crucible-level pressure sources.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly under Accumulative/Textural lens: releasing the pendant reweights the rule-set, returning “sharpness to the coming light” with conceptual cost—tomorrow’s wonder will ache. Causality is lyric rather than plot-driven; tension accrues through pattern of extension/release rather than exterior reversals. Orientation is taught early—“aurora-lit ridgeway,” first-person, night—so no penalty. One minor scaffold: “the method is simple to say and hard to hold” repeats the same idea twice; clipped but not closure-touching.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dragonfly-wing pendant operates as micro-setting that constrains every tactical choice; its quiver paces every beat. Aurora and ridgeway supply tonal silk/ribbon imagery that mirrors the pendant’s shimmer, integrating macro and micro environments. Thyme-scented sand inside the reliquary charges the final image with sensory specificity. Spatial choreography stays clean: cairn → slope → blade-narrow ridge with no impossible positions.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—keep wonder alive without addictive extension—tightens once when the courier chooses release, paying tomorrow’s “thinner dawn” as visible price. Pressure is textural: each extension thickens ambient time; refusal lets it thin, reconfiguring options. Agency is interior and sufficient for lyric mode. Cost is felt but less visceral than a physical forfeiture; hence caps just below 8.0.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through recurrent images of extension/release: wonder must be invited, not harvested. Final image of “the heart learning the instrument below it” answers the opening “ridge hums like a great sleeping instrument,” reweighting the motif without stated moral. Subtext lives in silence: mentor’s echo is cadence, not advice. Complexity acknowledged: cost is accepted, not resolved.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice owns a perceptual signature: tactile aurora silk, taffy-stretch time, cartographic absence. Syntax flexes from long breathless ribbons to the clipped “It obeys,” mirroring pendant tension. No dialogue to distort cadence; what little speech (“I know why you left”) stays in courier’s idiom. Compression taught early—“extends brief encounters without stealing time”—paid off at release; ellision remains legible.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Rhythm breathes with scene pace: aurora paragraphs languid, release sentence single-coin clang. Metaphors stay coherent (silk, taffy, tuning fork) without mixed vehicle crash. One paraphrase loop minor: “extends brief encounters” idea voiced twice in adjacent lines, but elsewhere density is high—one sentence carries scent, memory, and motion. No artifact touches closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Premise fuses memory-smuggling with sympathetic vibration, a fresh angle on familiar “place vanishes” trope. Pendant as time-thief turned self-limiting tool reconfigures fantasy gadget into ethical instrument. Risk succeeds: lyrical causality sustains urgency without conventional antagonist. Specificity—“husks twitch,” “stone warm from someone else’s pocket”—anchors abstraction in felt detail.</comment>
