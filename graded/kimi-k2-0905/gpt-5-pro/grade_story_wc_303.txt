<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority is lush, idiosyncratic, and embodied—"mulberry ache, thick sweet and stained with sky"—with contradictory impulses alive in scene. The final renunciation (melting the violin) is earned by the telepathic-plant backstory and the concrete choice to follow the stain-map; cost is visible in the river baptism and the director’s ankle-tangle. Micro-choices—setting saucers, lifting the bow—reveal value hierarchy under pressure. No label-speak; voice stays botanically telepathic and specific.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the violin liquefies, the empire’s alibi dissolves into river water the donors unknowingly taste—undeniable social cost. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural; the lyric pattern (velvet / ice / stain / root) intensifies until the cadence shift at the river reweights the stake. Orientation is taught by ~80 words (“velvet observatory at midsummer”) and waived because disorientation pays off in the final image. Persistent constraint: the melting violin forecloses reversal—winter cannot be reclaimed once poured away.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The ice violin itself functions as micro-setting, constraining every beat—its cold limits handling time, dictates velvet surface, and finally forces the choice to release it before total melt. Velvet, jasmine scent, and cosmic dust create tactile, olfactory specificity filtered through the researcher’s plant-attuned bias. Spatial choreography is clean: velvet → courtyard vines → river stones; no impossible prop jumps. The river recharges every prior sensory motif, making environment the agent of closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—return winter or let empire keep stolen season—is signaled in paragraph 3. One meaningful tightening: the promise “loses its glow” → must play now; melting violin narrows option to irrevocable release. Cost is visceral—ice becomes water slipping through fingers; donors drink the evidence. Agency is researcher’s alone; no external rescue, no coincidence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as the impossibility of cataloguing living memory—empires archive, plants propagate; the river rewrites provenance. Subtext in gestures: jasmine ankle-tangle silently indicts; donors taste truth without exposition. No moralizing; final image reweights earlier velvet gloss as shame. Metaphor of “mulberry ache” carries ethical bruise without naming guilt.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Voice is botanically telepathic, syntactically lush yet precise—“the ivy names the stations of return.” Rhythm accelerates with pressure: long sentences for observatory stillness, fragment-like pulses during bow lift. No head-hopping; single POV sustains plant-attuned perceptual signature. Diction stays inside researcher’s lexicon—no corporate register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Figurative density is high but patterned early (velvet/ice/stain/root) and paid off; no mixed metaphors. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence adds new sensory or causal layer. Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; paragraph cuts coincide with stake shifts. Minor scaffold: “the promise loses its glow” is abstract, but glow is reified by ribbon of light inside violin—accepted as lyric compression.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>Premise—provenance researcher telepathic with plants who reads coffee-stain maps to return ice violin—feels inevitable yet wholly fresh. Synthesis of museum ethics, vegetal sentience, and climate poetics is non-obvious. Risk: lyric accumulative structure could have collapsed, but pattern holds to river release. Transformation test fails if any element swapped—ice violin must melt, plants must network, stains must tear.</comment>
