<comment>Interiority is rich and singular—“gulls sound like hinges,” “palace carpet weft thread…coiled as if it remembered the loom.” Micro-choice of tying the thread to the finger crystallizes the narrator’s vocation under pressure; the renunciation of leaving becomes an earned stasis with visible cost: staying to till others’ grief while writing his own living obituary. Contradictory impulses (wander vs. anchor) coexist in-scene, not in summary. No stock therapy-speak; every emotional label is earned by concrete image.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the thread once tethering absence becomes the stitch that maps the city’s Mercy档案馆; the geography of healing is revealed as migration, not return, with undeniable social cost—the archive will outlive the archivist. Accumulative lens holds: each new obituary adds density until the final image of the thread-sketched currents reweights the premise. Cost is legible in the last line—“absence grows intimate with mercy”—a price the narrator will keep paying. No causality breaks; transitions are legible shards in a mosaic taught by the 25 % mark.</comment>

<comment>The palace carpet weft thread functions as micro-setting: it constrains every projection, physically knotting the narrator’s finger and narratively knotting each new obituary into the map. Shadowed autumn garden supplies sensory hierarchy—bronze leaves scissor down, lanterns veiled by vines—mirroring internal state while guiding the choice to plant seeds instead of sail. Spatial choreography is immaculate: thread-string between rose canes, fig shading broken fountain, shoots curling around the thread—each shift tracked without impossible positions. Final image of thread-stitched city map charges the closing resonance.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake— composing living obituaries to spare waiting grief—tightens when Mira asks for hers, then again when the narrator must write his own; each step forecloses the option to remain a detached observer. Agency is accumulative: every drafted obituary adds weight to the thread-map until staying becomes the only credible stance. Visible price: the narrator’s own absence is filed under Compassion, a lifelong tithe. One meaningful deepening suffices under Accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves the tension.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: healing is a migration that confuses the compass until new north grows credible. The final image of absence “growing intimate with mercy” reweights prior absences into a civic atlas of tenderness. Subtext operates in gesture—thread tied, seeds planted, stools left empty—never in thesis. Lyric return of “lonesome splendor” at the end modulates from ache to quiet choir, offering resonant non-literality.</comment>

<comment>Perceptual signature is relentless: “salt fog beads on tin, knives breathe iron, bread remembers the heat that birthed it.” Syntax mirrors nautical warp and weft—long sentences swell, then caesura like a cleat snapping tight. No head-hopping; first-person stays strictly bounded to what the narrator can project or touch. Compression taught early (“I send myself along its length”) pays off in every subsequent projection without clarity loss.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies from tidal cadence to single-line pulses: “There will be no ship tomorrow.” Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or stakes. Metaphors stay coherent within textile and nautical logic—no mixed vehicle crashes. Information density high: one line can anchor time, body, and metaphor—“shoots arrive like green handwriting, curling around the thread until the path of grief becomes legible.” No scaffold artifacts in closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise—obituarist for the living who projects presence via carpet thread—is non-obvious synthesis of elegy and cartography. Transformation test fails if names/places swapped: the thread-map, the seed-letter, the “registry of explained absences” are irreducibly specific. Risk in lyric mosaic pays off: closure legible under Accumulative lens. Fresh inflection: healing reframed as civic archiving rather than personal cure.</comment>
