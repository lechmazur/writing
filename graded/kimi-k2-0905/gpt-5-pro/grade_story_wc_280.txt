<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The ghost’s synesthetic gift and coin-tarot agency give concrete, idiosyncratic interiority; “taste footsteps / see pitch of silence” is embodied, not label-speak. Motivation—lure possibility back for Rowan—stays legible and intensifies through orchard echoes. No internal contradiction or micro-choice visibly fails, yet the outside Rowan arc is inferred more than dramatized, muting cost on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the ghost renounce-save gesture (coin left star-side out) costs its talisman and re-opens the nursery path; Rowan’s choice to return with volunteers crystallizes possibility regained. Causal lattice—echo mechanics → timeline loosening → blueprint recovery—holds under lyrical Accumulative lens, with each echo tightening stakes. Orientation anchors who/where arrive by line 5, no penalty. No teleport or unkept set-ups; persistent price (coin abandoned) charges final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Selective sensory economy—“pears chime,” “plums hum sour if your heart lies”—grounds magic rules through synesthetic POV without exposition dump. Micro-setting (coin, branch, prop shed) constrains Rowan’s rediscovered blueprint beat and re-configures future options. Spatial track clear across maze corridor reveal; no geography drift. Hedge-mirror tonally supports theme of cultivated second chances.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore Rowan’s hope via orchard echo playback—signals early; one meaningful tightening when blueprint re-emerges under pearly leaf corridor. Ghost’s agency drives every escalation (coin flip, echo seeding), cost visible when coin relinquished. Accumulative pressure rises through sensory density (tastes shift lime→honey); no coincidence rescue. Could edge higher if Rowan’s despair were on-page contested rather than summarized.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of reheated possibility emerges from tangible echoes and garden acoustics, never sermonized. Repricing moment: coin-star left as “light belongs to places” re-weights earlier balcony gift into communal seed. Ambiguity allowed—ghost’s own future unaddressed—keeping complexity. Avoids final-paragraph thesis statement, though Rowan’s hedge plea leans toward explicit hope; still, image of hammers synched with birds carries resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>First-person ghost voice owns a consistent synesthetic perceptual signature—color-hearing, taste-light—that modulates with emotional cadence. Prose rhythm mirrors orchard music: chiming pears, ticking coin, syntactic repetition taught early and paid off. No head-hop; Rowan’s interior accessed only through ghostly inference, maintaining distance. Filter verbs used sparingly and motivated (“I taste footsteps”) rather than diluting immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Information-dense lines—“dates grow like fruit, futures like blossoms”—do double duty (world rule + metaphor). Figurative chain stays coherent inside orchard physics; no clashing metaphors. Occasional poetic stacking (“lime turned honey”) but pattern taught and never muddles causality. No loops, scaffold, or paraphrase churn; opening anchors voice instantly; final line lands resonant image without over-explanation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Ghost stage-hand reviving hope via sound orchard is fresh synthesis; tarot-coin as echo-seed reinvents both prop and divination trope. Synesthetic theater haunting not seen in familiar lit-mag inventory; risk pays off without losing clarity. Specific inversion—“applause that never quit” repurposed into literal hedge-light—feels inevitable in hindsight. Concept commits fully; no retreat into safe symbolism.</comment>
