<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete, embodied, and particular to the map-framer’s perceptual signature; “shielded openness” and “methodically curious” traits manifest in micro-choices (pressing the abrasion, counting breaths to henge stones) that carry visible cost. The final renunciation—sealing nothing, setting the panel lightly back—earns its stoic poise through prior因果链 of respectful listening and patient comparison of silent footage. Slight reserve on 9+ because the empathy motive is declared more than dramatized in conflict with a counter-impulse; still, the endurance reads as credible, charged stasis.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the panel lifts, maps of pollen and soot are discovered, yet the narrator chooses to leave the chapel “neither hidden nor announced,” reconfiguring the meaning of access and silence. Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the tightening arrives via density of salt blooms, ribbon abrasion, lichen patterns—each layer reweights the stake of respectful disclosure. Cost is unmistakable: the narrator forgoes possession/exposure, accepting perpetual custodial tension. One minor orientation wobble: farmer’s “palm cupping a north so general” delays concrete geography past 120 wds, but the disorientation later serves the closure’s ethic of intentional ambiguity, so waiver applies.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The limestone door, rusted tongue-handle, and rain-scoured fresco vault are tactile, lived-in, and constrain every move; the protagonist’s decision not to force the tongue is dictated by the chapel’s physical whisper. Sensory hierarchy follows professional map-framer priorities: fiber grain, salt blooms, draft angle. Final image of the breathing panel is inseparable from setting’s prior damp exhale. World rules (draft, hinge hiss, lichen growth) stay consistent and charge the Earned Stasis.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—how to witness without violating—tightens through accumulating sensory clues and the visible abrasion that records past touch. The decisive turn is the choice to compare silent videos instead of prying; this agency narrows options (renounce loud discovery) and makes the final refusal legible. Cost is conceptual but felt: the narrator accepts lifelong custodial tension and the possibility no one else will find the maps. Escalation is textural rather than causal-reversal, perfectly valid under inferred lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of respectful listening emerges implicitly from the pattern of withheld speech—silent videos, whispered chapel, draft that answers only to soft pressure. Final image of the lightly reset panel reweights all prior salt tears and ribbon traces as ongoing conversation rather than archive. No moralizing; insight is earned through the tactile comparison of film reels and the physical refusal to shout the door open. Ambiguity lingers yet feels coherent: openness now defined as breathing, not broadcasting.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>First-person voice carries a distinct cartographer’s perceptual signature: angles, fibers, blooms, breath-patterns. Rhythm modulates from patient cataloguing to the short, pressured count of henge-stone breaths. Compression like “tongue dried mid-word” is purposeful and paid off when the door answers to the same metaphorical grammar. No head-hopping; unreliability never claimed, so consistency holds.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>High information density: each sentence layers sensory data with emotional charge (“salt blooms…as if rain had been arguing with the past”). Metaphors stay physically coherent; no mixed vehicles. Occasional template cadence in “I did X, and I would not Y” pattern, but it mirrors deliberate methodical stance so reads as voice rather than artifact. Closure image is clean, uncluttered, letting the hinge-hiss carry the weight.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Fusion of cartography, archaeology, and quiet ethics feels fresh; the whispered chapel that answers only to gentleness is not a trope rehash. Risky structural choice—accumulative textural beats instead of causal reversal—pays off by making silence the active agent. Specificity of pollen-and-soot maps prevents generic “hidden relic” template. While the sacred-hidden-in-plain-sight notion is familiar, the sensory encoding and refusal of spectacle transform it.</comment>
