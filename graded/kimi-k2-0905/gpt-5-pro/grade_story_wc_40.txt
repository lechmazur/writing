<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Scholar’s interiority is rich—“language still grew…in the intervals between breath and shelf”—and his listening posture is embodied. Motive stays consistent, but the stakes jump externally (Archive Court) without a matching internal inflection; we get no new flaw or fear triggered by the summons. The final renunciation—returning the crystal, accepting stewardship of unborn words—costs him the comfort of certainty, yet that cost is implied rather than dramatized in a visible beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: a Charged Poise where the library becomes “a garden of ears,” a Conceptual Repricing that reweights culture itself. Causality is lyric-accumulative; each echo-scatter tightens the same stake until the custodians’ lowered eyes certify the shift. Orientation is complete by line 6; no lens ambiguity. Cost is legible in the final image—“quiet forward like a pocket of patient rain”—a portable burden he now carries.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is micro-precision: chandelier crystal as tool-body, ledger as seedbed, ivy grammar on dust. The library’s acoustics actively constrain tactics—every shelf angle alters echo, guiding where he stands to testify. Final image recharges the “suspended hush” and is inseparable from the decision; environment is agent, not backdrop.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can culture grow unnamed?—is signaled in line 3 and tightens once: the Court demand for proof. Agency is listening/arranging shards; the visible price is the crystal’s surrender and the lifelong guardianship of unlanguaged sound. Escalation is accumulative density, not causal reversals; one deepening suffices and lands with felt cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from sonic palimpsest: growth needs silence more than definition. Subtext in custodians’ lowered eyes reframes authority as listener, not legislator. Final image refracts earlier “suspended hush” into forward-carrying rain—an earned, non-moral answer. Avoids explicit thesis; resonance is visceral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Voice is perceptually signature—“reticent,” breath-folded, acoustically precise. Rhythm modulates from hush-staccato to meadow-legato under pressure. No head-hop; diction stays within scholar’s lexicon except one near-slip (“authority is a blunt instrument” edges editorial). Crystal’s return is syntax-simple, emotionally charged—prose as character.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Read-aloud ear is musical; sentence lengths undulate like the echo they describe. No loops, no scaffold; information is dense—“footsteps of long gone children, soft as chalk dust” does three jobs. Mixed metaphors (“meadow of replies”) are purposeful, acoustically coherent. Register stable; final line cadence earns its pause without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh angle: post-dictionary era where silence is substrate for growth. Sonic gardening via chandelier crystal is specific, non-obvious, and inevitable in hindsight. Risk—the entire plot is listening—heightens meaning without gimmickry. Conceptual integrity intact; library as ear-garden reweights Western archive tropes.</comment>
