<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment> Interiority is tactile (“my voice grows roots”) and embodied; the contradictory inheritance of violence/peace drives every micro-choice. The final sheathing of the knife is earned by a visible line of dust and shared breath—cost is felt. Status shift with father is legible yet understated; his surrender of sheath to peg crystallizes the change. Daughter’s perceptiveness is shown through action (splitting canvas, threading fractures) rather than label, though “senselessly perceptive” is used once without dramatized cost on that exact beat.

<comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: knife sheathed, dome thrumming, continuity chosen over vengeance. Causal chain holds: father’s return → dust line drawn → storm beaten back → sheath hung. One shard (storm) is cleanly bracketed; transitions legible. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 3; no penalty. Cost is visible—father leaves violence on the peg, daughter forecloses retaliation.

<comment>Glass dome, sandbag scrap, and rose thorns constrain every tactic; the scrap’s seams literally stitch the fractures that would kill the shelter. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven—heat-breath sky, turbine-smoke scent—never tourist catalog. Spatial choreography is flawless: dust line poured, strips threaded, bodies crouch among petals. Final image reweights “engraved quiet” from scar to script—setting charges closure.

<comment>Dominant stake—continuity vs. vengeance—signaled in paragraph 1 and tightened once when the knife is literally placed in pruning sheath. The storm supplies external pressure, but the decisive turn is daughter’s renunciation of retaliation; father’s acquiescence is the micro-turn that forecloses the violent path. Cost is felt: father leaves his identity (sheath) on the peg. Escalation is single-wave, sufficient for 700-word span, though secondary stakes (fifty strangers) remain abstract.

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: continuity braided from thorn and wound, memory refusing collapse. “Engraved quiet” mutates from trauma-pattern to readable script—an earned conceptual reprice. No moral sermon; final image is action (sheath on peg) that reweights all prior motifs. Slight over-articulation of “continuity” twice in final paragraphs keeps it from 9-band.

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Lyric first-person voice is sustained, tactile, internally consistent—“breath held inside glass,” “thirsty midwife.” Syntax mirrors desert patience: long breathy clauses that suddenly tighten in the storm. No dialogue, hence no voice convergence risk. Filter verbs are poetically motivated (“I see his hand hover”) and paid off in image.

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with scene tempo; clauses lengthen until storm, then fragment. Information density high—each line does two jobs (“saplings, and rumors, and give back water and steadiness”). Zero paraphrase loops; no mixed metaphors. One near-repeat: “continuity through chaos” appears twice—minor, does not dull closure. Read-aloud ear test passes.

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Pacifist daughter of bounty hunter who speaks roses into reservoirs—fresh synthesis. Sandbag scrap as both memory and literal stitching material is a risk that pays off in closure. “Engraved quiet” as rewritable script transforms trauma trope. Risk distinction +0.3: lyric horticultural pacifism inside post-collapse western frame feels inevitable, not gimmicky.
