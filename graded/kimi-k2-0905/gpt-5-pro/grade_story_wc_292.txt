<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Interiority is specific and embodied (“thumb polished where I have rubbed questions”), contradictory impulses surface when the narrator questions whether exile-home still counts as home; the copper nail’s tactile re-use in two beats anchors agency. Motive to honor Seraphine is stated repeatedly but only dramatized once (cliff intake), so the higher-stakes choices feel lightly earned; competent struggle is present but not fully compounded. Closure renunciation (“I stay one more cycle”) carries visible opportunity cost—exile prolonged—so the final stance is credible and paid for.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: lyrical density increases until the forecast “clicks” and the final image crystallizes options with felt cost (the table, the nail, the softening world). Orientation is taught early (boots, red bulb, kite array), no causality breaks; Seraphine’s samples re-weight the premise rather than solve by coincidence. Closure is Charged Poise: exile permission arrives yet narrator refuses, foreclosing immediate return—conceptual and emotional price legible on-page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Waterlogged station, never-drying plywood, soggy sleeves, copper nail bridging kite sensor—every anchor is tactile and choice-constraining. Micro-setting (nail, table, cliff screws) repeatedly alters tactics; saturated air and gull imagery mirror the sky-river discovery without overt symbolism. Spatial choreography is flawless across cliff, lab, kite array; no impossible positions or props. Final image of nail pressed into map-room table fuses body, tool, and locale into one charged object—meets 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—earn return by proving Seraphine’s route—tightens when samples are found and the forecast “almost clicks,” narrowing options to stay vs. leave. Cost is visible: exile is “reversible only as long as you remain useful,” and narrator pays by refusing immediate return to finish the map. Agency drives discovery (nail repair, intake opened, data sent); no coincidences resolve conflict. One meaningful deepening suffices for 700-word piece, and it lands with felt price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of erased female knowledge resisting institutional amnesia emerges through concrete particulars—kelped journals, copper grave-nail, bureaucratic “deliverables.” Subtext in Mirek’s “spongey dread” and ministry’s fear of ghosts critiques power without sermonizing. Final image reweights earlier material: honoring the dead means extending exile—complex, non-tidy moral stance. No echoic platitudes; insight arises from tactile struggle with damp pages and salt logic.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>First-person voice sustains a perceptual signature of librarian precision mixed with salt-stung awe (“coded stanzas in shipwrecked journals I recognize as navigational poetics”). Rhythm modulates: long breathy clauses for damp quiet, staccato discoveries (“the nail fits, and I laugh”). No head-hopping; psychic distance stable. Experimental elisions (no quotation marks for intercom) are taught early and remain legible. Under stress, syntax compresses without voice slip—meets high-band test.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Sentence variation and sensory specificity keep momentum; imagery is lush yet information-dense (“gulls scissor the saturated air”). Few near-loop phrases (“the station hums like a wet animal under it”) but metaphor family stays coherent. No paraphrase stacks or filter-verb clusters in climax; final paragraph propels to charged image. Minor overwrite in middle stanzas (−0.3) prevents 9+ but never obscures cause-effect.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</question><comment>Fusing archival poetics with climate-sci-fi is fresh; the navigational stanza code feels inevitable yet unforeseen. Copper nail as both coffin relic and sensor bridge transforms mundane hardware into haunted tool—risky choice that pays off. Story could not swap setting or object without collapse; specificity is anchored. Takes bold formal risk with lyric density and earns coherence at close, meriting +0.2 within-band bonus.</comment>
<question>9 A</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Setup: self-label in open; Development: maps from journals, refuses early return; Closure: stays to finish map—decision drives final image.</comment>
<question>9 B</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Early handling, repairs kite sensor, opens cliff intake, finale driven into table—three beats plus charged return; irreplaceable.</comment>
<question>9 C</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Shapes every tactic (produce forecast, please ministry) and final refusal; exile’s reversibility explicitly governs risk calculus.</comment>
<question>9 D</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Enables public petitioning that brings journals, yet doubt surfaces in home question; tradeoff visible but not foregrounded twice.</comment>
<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Intercom questioned for silence prompts journal opening—key first turn; later questioning sea offers poignancy but less causal weight.</comment>
<question>9 F</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mechanics taught early (rhyme = drift angle), drive discovery, sample location, and map—essential across middle and payoff.</comment>
<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Supplies kite array, damp floors that never dry, and ministry oversight—environment forces nail workaround and bureaucratic pressure.</comment>
<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Jet-stream shift is given premise, not active countdown; timeframe affects world but doesn’t tighten scene-level clock—moderate integration.</comment>
<question>9 I</question><grade>8.5</question><comment>Explicit want propels petition, cliff trip, and final refusal; cost paid by extending exile—honor motive shapes ending beat.</comment>
<question>9 J</question><grade>8.0</question><comment>“Spongey dread” pulsed through Mirek, ministry static, wet-animal station hum; modulates to tentative mercy then softening dream—coherent arc.</comment>
