<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The solitary seed-saver’s interiority stays concrete—tannin taste of the cap, frost-nap of wheat—while contradictory impulses (caretaker vs. usher of borrowed time) coil inside one body. Micro-choices—pressing wood to lips, crowning the hatchling—reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost. The final renunciation (letting the cap go) is causally earned and scales to the length. Voice never drifts into label-speak; emotion is shown through tactile ritual, not summary.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the cap’s weightlessness reweights “vortex inheritance” from burden to choreography, cost felt in the lighter palm. Causal linkage holds throughout—oak cap → song → entropy drop → door sigh—without convenient amnesia. Orientation is taught by line 6 (icebound atrium, cracked dome, starlight), well before 120-word mark. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: each spiral image thickens pattern until the final cadence shift unlocks meaning.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The ice-grain lattice, frost-breath glass, and wheat kernels with “nap like frost that never melts” are not backdrop—they constrain tactics (singing to frost, walking on kernels) and charge the final image. Micro-setting triumph: the oak cap functions as both key and crown, its tactile states tracked across the beat. Spatial choreography remains clean: hatchling moves from scarf to seed tray to crowned head without drift. Sensory economy—tannin, stored-rain smell—mirrors internal thaw without overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“discover the texture of borrowed time”—is signaled early and tightens when the ark demands a vow payable in song. One meaningful deepening occurs as entropy steps down and the price (oak cap spent, voice braided with bird) becomes legible. Agency is present but gentle—coaxing rather than forcing—fitting the lyric mode. Cost is visible yet soft; a sharper forfeiture would push higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges from spirals: shells, vortices, eddies of chaff—each a literalization of “borrowed time” without sermon. Final image (cap as crown) offers non-literal answer: inheritance is not cargo but choreography. Subtext lives in silence—the atrium’s exhale says more than any verdict could. No thematic echo; the bird’s peep is action, not commentary.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>First-person lyric voice sustains a perceptual signature attuned to molecular motion: “molecules self-sort,” “wind threads frost.” Rhythm modulates—long breath-like sentences for calm, clipped fragments at unlock click. Diction stays within seed-saver’s lexicon (tannin, stored rain) without academic drift. Non-standard grammar (“furiously tranquil”) is pattern-taught and paid off at peak stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or synonym churn; each sentence advances image or causality. Figurative language is patterned—spirals, frost, breath—never muddled. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image that recharges “turning the wind.” High density: “kernels shine like coins” does world, character, and theme work in five words.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade>
<comment>Premise—entropy-decreasing seed ark unlocked by inherited song through wooden mouthpiece—is non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Vortex inheritance reframes climate grief as choreographed memory rather than data bank. Risky lyric compression pays off: entire mythos taught by 25% mark yet closure remains legible. Specificity of “fine nap like frost that never melts” makes borrowed time tactile, not metaphoric convenience.</comment>
