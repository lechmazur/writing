<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The charmed-skeptic tension is lived in every beat: tending the garden while doubting its promises, handling the shell while testing its hinges. Interiority is concrete (“I tell her… that dawn is moving”) and embodied (“bones ring”). The final shift from keeper to door is earned by a chain of micro-choices (carrying the shell, placing it, standing until the hinge answers) that foreclose the safety of quarantine with visible cost. Voice stays singular, flawed, and decision-driven throughout.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the speaker becomes the door, Reina walks “through me,” and the quarantine sign dissolves—an unmistakable before/after with conceptual cost (“practice kindness” revealed). Causality is lyric but legible: each resonance test narrows options until the only remaining path is self-transcendence. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern (garden resonance, shell echo) is taught early and pays off in the final image. No orientation debt; spatial/temporal anchors are clear by line 20.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The velvet garden, shell, and twilight operate as micro-setting: the garden’s breathing hedges and glass bell constrain every move and literally house the archive. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven—sound (whisper, laugh, chord) overrides visual, matching the ears/hinges motif. The final image of the shell left “on a nail, an ear for travelers” charges the setting with forward-looking cost. Spatial choreography is immaculate; no floating props or impossible positions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—translate isolation into independence—is signaled in line 4 and tightened when the laugh demands release versus quarantine rule. The speaker’s agency drives every escalation: testing resonance, carrying the shell, choosing to open along rather than out. Cost is visceral—loss of quarantine safety and of self as static keeper. One meaningful deepening (the laugh starts orbiting the doors) reweights options under the Accumulative lens; no coincidence required.</answer>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete particulars: quarantine as both mercy and cruelty, resonance as both archive and escape. Subtext lives in gesture—the shell left on the nail is a quiet covenant for future travelers. No moralizing; the dissolution of the quarantine sign into “practice kindness” is earned image, not thesis. Final chord left inside the speaker reweights all prior echoes without abstract statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is unmistakable: “fountains speak in unworried sighs,” “thorns a metronome.” Syntax mirrors resonance—cascading clauses that loop back like echoes, then fracture into short hinge-lines under peak pressure. Lexicon stays within the speaker’s arcane yet intimate register; no filter-verb clutter. Unreliability is subtle—the garden’s promises remain suspect until the speaker ceases to be skeptic and becomes threshold.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sentence variety and rhythmic propulsion are exquisite; paragraph cuts land on image-turns that advance stakes. Figurative language is dense yet purposeful—each metaphor extends the acoustic motif without muddle. Minor 0.1 dock for two adjacent “garden” opens mid-text; otherwise zero loops or scaffold. Read-aloud ear test passes: cadence breathes with escalating pressure and releases cleanly into morning light.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Premise—memory quarantine tended by resonance-archivist—feels freshly synthesized and inevitable. Risk of lyric non-linear structure heightens stakes yet lands cleanly. The garden-as-echo-lab and shell-as-grief-fossil are specific to this voice; swap any detail and the logic collapses. Final “door learned itself open” reconfigures familiar metaphor through earned particulars.</comment>
