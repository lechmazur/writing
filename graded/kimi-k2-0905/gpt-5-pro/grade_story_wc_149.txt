<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interiority is lush, embodied, and particular—"sap remembered thunder" anchors the gardener’s obsession. The bead-as-heart micro-choice ("clicked softly against the glass") reveals hierarchy of values under pressure. Contradictory impulses—obedience to ghost vs. fear of re-failure—are dramatized, not stated. Final renunciation carries visible cost: bead pressed into palm, endless night accepted as ledger.

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of "resonant awakenings" taught early; closure is Charged Poise—'the orchard remembers us' reweights the premise with undeniable conceptual cost. Orientation anchored by ~80 words; no penalty. Escalation via density: each cameo thickens frost, sound, memory until final spoken name crystallizes options. Cost legible in final image—orchard as perpetual debtor, gardener bound to nightly tribute.

<comment>Glass aisles, copper grafts, tendon-thin cord—every tool is tactile and choice-limiting. Bead functions as micro-setting: its carved grooves determine rhythm of breath and dictate graft survival. Endless night is not backdrop but breathable constraint that forces nocturnal stewardship. Final image—bead tapping glass while roots negotiate—charges the closing beat with spatial and sonic specificity impossible without these objects.

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: keep orchard alive under star-swallowing night; secondary: repay karmic debt. Tightening occurs when bead sings and gardener sees cart bride—options narrow to confess or lose trees. Protagonist agency: confession spoken through bead rhythm directly triggers bruise-glow pears. Cost visible—ghost dissolves, leaving gardener to eternal nightly vigil; path foreclosed.

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from sound-memory-debt triangle: music as unpaid obligation. Subtext in ghost’s "lovingly venomous" laughter—love twisted by abandonment. Final image reweights premise: orchard as perpetual debtor, gardener as instrument, not owner. No moralizing; resonance carried by bruise-glow pears and endless night held breath.

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>First-person alchemical gardener voice sustains perceptual signature—"sap remembered thunder," "tendon-thin cord." Syntax compresses under pressure: "bead sang…shivered grafts." Patterned elision taught early—“resonant awakenings” left undefined yet paid off in closing chimes. No head-hopping; ghost’s interior accessed only through gardener’s sensorium.

</question>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Density high—"winter-cracked fields," "lung-like greenhouse"—yet every metaphor advances atmosphere or stakes. No loops; each image re-weights prior material ("ash lifting from her veil like steam" reprises bread warmth denied to bride). Register remains within alchemist’s lexicon. Minor cadence repetition in "once she…" anaphora is pattern-taught and paid off, not artifact.

</question>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Premise—alchemical orchard fed by musical memory in endless night—feels fresh yet inevitable. Ghost bride as debt collector reverses typical revenge motif: she teaches, not punishes. Bead-turned-instrument transforms sentimental token into tuning key for survival. Risky lyric compression sustained without clarity loss; specificity of "bruise-glow pears" anchors abstraction.
