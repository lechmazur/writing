<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The interpreter’s calloused hands, mentor’s pouch, and final choice to “carry it” give embodied motive and micro-choice; the interior contradiction between memory-haunted caretaker and hopeful re-tuner is present but stays summary-level until the final beat, capping at 8.7.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the city’s swing pauses, the map is drawn, the cost is the weight of every new beginning they must now ferry; the Accumulative/Textural lens holds from first wind-written wire to last glowing bucket, each static strip and commercial drop tightening the stake.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The tower-gorge rig, moon-tugged cables, and bottle-cap coupling are tactile constraints that dictate where the horn can aim; the final “lullaby water” recharges the gorge from void to archive, earning the 9.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can they coax a usable signal from ruin—is signaled early; pressure escalates as static peels away and the tone demands carriage; the final bucket’s weight makes the cost legible, though the middle argument beat feels low-torque beside the cosmic set-up.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of reclamation through loss emerges via the receiver-shaped-like-goodbye image and the water that sounds like restarted lullabies; no moral is stated, but the map reframes ruin as archive, giving resonant reconfiguration without drift into maxim.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>First-person voice sustains a celestial-repair idiom—“gravity pinches the gorge,” “glitter becoming geometry”—with rhythmic compression taught early and held to the final whispered promise; no POV leakage or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>High information density—each sentence moves image or stakes; occasional lyrical stack (“serenely electric,” “glitter becoming geometry”) risks purple but stays pattern-true; zero loops or scaffold, propulsion clean through the final line.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The star-fragment-plus-hush coupling, moon-tuned catwalk city, and gorge-as-archive reversal synthesize salvage-punk with cosmic lyric in a way that feels inevitable; risk-taking heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, meriting the bonus.</comment>
