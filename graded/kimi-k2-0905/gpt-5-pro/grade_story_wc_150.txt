<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Interiority is lyrical and concrete (“ships that finally arrived”), but the protagonist’s contradictory impulses are stated rather than dramatized in scene; the single micro-choice—reassembling the dial—carries weight yet feels pre-ordained, blunting cost. The “warmly curious” trait is shown only in summary, not under pressure. Still, the embodied emotion (“tasted like a door opening slowly”) is vivid and character-specific.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the rebuilt dial reconfigures time and faith with visible cost (“shadow traveled across us like a hand in blessing”), satisfying CR. Causal chain is present—finding shards → rebuilding → bread timing—but ellipsis between discoveries is lyrical, not motivated, so lens is Accumulative/Textural. Orientation is taught early (“valley…figs…limestone”), so no penalty. One transition (crypt → orchard step) is legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Catacomb orchard is micro-setting that constrains every move: roots dictate where one kneels, skulls become lanterns, bark is ladder. Sensory economy is strict—fig sap, damp limestone, bronze smell—filtered through returnee’s alienated eye. Spatial choreography is flawless; no impossible positions. Final image of moonlit dial reweights prior dread into benediction, meeting 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</question><comment>Dominant stake—restore lost faith—signals early and tightens once: bread must rise on ancestral time, not diaspora haste. Escalation is textural (pattern break: fast bread → patient loaf) rather than causal; cost is felt in tasted loneliness but not dramatized as conflict with workers or uncle. One meaningful deepening suffices for length; agency is present in the rebuild act.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete reversal: interrupted journeys are mended by re-anchoring time, not by leaving. Subtext operates in gesture—Aram placing fragments “as if asking” rather than telling. No final moralizing; final image reweights premise. Ambiguity lingers: is faith restored or merely borrowed for a night? That complexity is earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</question><comment>Lyric first-person voice maintains distinct perceptual signature: time as something that can be “escorted,” bread that “tasted lonely.” Syntax mirrors fractured diaspora psyche—clause fragments echo broken dial. No head-hopping; psychic distance stable. Compression (“I stitched stone to stone”) is taught early and paid off. Register stays within returnee’s plausible lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</question>
<comment>Ear-test rhythm is musical, but occasional template cadence (“We…We…We…” openings) dulls propulsion. Metaphors are coherent yet dense—three in four sentences during peak beat—without pattern-teaching, triggering −0.3. No synonym loops; information density high. Final line avoids scaffold and lands with image, not explanation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: sundial as both clock and sacrament; catacomb-orchard as living cemetery. Diaspora returnee trope is re-weighted through tactile time-repair rather than identity speech. Risk-taking—lyric ellipsis, skull lanterns—pays off in closure. Specificity prevents template drift: “bronze thorn bent but whole” is unforgettable.</comment>
