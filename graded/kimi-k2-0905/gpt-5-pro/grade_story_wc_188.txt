<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lio’s interiority is lyrically concrete—his boots “mapped the cobbles like patient drumsticks,” filtering fear into breath. The contradictions are present but worked mostly in summary: “smiling not to mock sorrow but to persuade it into a chair” tells us the tactic rather than dramatizes the tussle. Micro-choices under pressure—altering trajectories when the gust hits—are rendered through ambient sensing; the cost is atmospheric rather than personal, so renunciation feels light. Still, the voice-driven embodiment and occupational specificity lift him well above template.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the silent bouquet opens “like a hand, steadying the night,” reconfiguring hope without promising stars—cost is the admitted un-returned cousin and the town’s fragile new cadence. Causality is lyric-Accumulative rather than tight because/therefore; the mosaic pattern teaches the reader early and the final hush obeys it. Orientation is clear by line 5 (“blooming fortress at dusk”), waiving any penalty. One could wish for a more concrete constraint that back-fires on Lio, but the atmospheric ledger holds.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The fortress is sensuously alive—lichen petals “cautious,” ivy leaning toward the fuse—setting actively guides placement of mortars and angles of fire. Micro-setting qualifies: the kerosene rag knot reappears as rosette in the closure, re-weighting Mara’s grief. Spatial choreography stays clean across parapet and courtyard moves. Weather (gust) instantly alters launch vectors, proving environment as tactical partner.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—reignite hope without stars—signals early and tightens through each volley; the final silent shell crystallizes the concession that copies aren’t required, only courage. Escalation is density/cadence driven: each bloom answers the mosaic’s “conversation,” raising emotional cost but not narrowing external options. No tangible resource is lost; the price is purely atmospheric, keeping cost legible but light. Sufficient for this lyric-Accumulative design.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</question>
<comment>Theme emerges as the argot of fire teaching earth to speak upward; no narrator moralizes. The silent bouquet image reweights prior blooms as listening rather than showing—conceptual repricing achieved. Ambiguity lingers: stars may stay dark, faces stay bright, refusing tidy comfort. Subtext operates in gesture (Mara knotting the rag into a rosette) rather than statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person hovers at lyric-fairytale distance yet keeps perceptual signature: Lio senses wind “like a ledger,” Mara’s torch ends “dark as an unspoken thought.” Syntax is rhythmically controlled, compressing under launch tempo, loosening into hush. No head-hopping; chant cadence becomes communal at end without rupturing POV. Distinct, consistent, and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>High figurative density is patterned early (“petals seemed cautious”) and earned by closure; no mixed metaphors. Read-aloud rhythm varies: long breath-sentence launches, then fragment-“hush symbol.” Minor template echo—“he chants while walking” repeated thrice—dulls immediacy slightly but never in peak closure beat. Information multiplexes: mortar placement, wind correction, emotional register in single lines.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Fusing pyrotechnic craft with patient-mosaic instructions feels fresh; trope of “fireworks save town” is re-coded as listening ritual rather than spectacle. Specificity—filtering charcoal “like river silt,” marigold comets weaving peonies—prevents swap-out. Risk lies in near-allegory, but grounded tool detail and grief anchor it. Synthesis seems inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
