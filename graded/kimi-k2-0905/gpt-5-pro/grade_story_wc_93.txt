<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The herder’s precognitive curse and the promise to the woman create a palpable interior contradiction that drives every stone placement; embodied micro-choices (“I hum the numbers until they taste like salt”) keep the arc visceral. The final shared holding of the bowl crystallizes an earned renunciation—he relinquishes sole ownership of the pattern—yet the cost feels fractionally under-dramatized because the woman’s presence is summoned rather than negotiated in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the cliff “grips its own seams” and the bowl stays put, a conceptual repricing paid for by the repeated promise now shared. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout—spiral, Fibonacci, triangle—each layer thickens meaning until the final image reweights the rule-set with undeniable cost: the herder can no longer slide away.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The tidal bluff, aurora, and salt-slick stones function as micro-setting that literally constrain footing and dictate pattern placement; the eel skins tied to feet tether body to terrain. Final image of the “path” hardening underfoot proves environment shaped tactics and charges the closing beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—keep the shore from sliding—tightens when each mathematical sequence fails until the promise is spoken jointly; the dust’s shift from shine to weight marks a visible price that forecloses the option of solitary ritual. One meaningful deepening suffices under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges obliquely: pattern as covenant, mathematics as love-letter. No moral is stated; the final shared breath reconfigures the earlier solitary obsession into mutual stewardship, letting ambiguity linger about how long the cliff will hold.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>First-person lyric sustains a distinct salt-cold cadence; perceptual signature filters every image through numerical taste and tidal slip. Compression (“I ride the slope as if steering a thought”) teaches the reader to accept elision, paid off when the harden-path image lands cleanly.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Sentences vary from fragment to tidal roll; information density stays high without scaffold. One mixed metaphor—“ash from a furnace above measure”—slips register but occurs early enough that closure clarity remains intact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The eel-herder who mathematically herds cliffs with collapsing stardust feels inevitable yet unseen before; synthesis of prime-number geomancy and precognitive guilt is wholly specific. Risk in second-person aurora address heightens lyric stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
