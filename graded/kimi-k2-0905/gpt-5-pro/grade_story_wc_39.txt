<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (duty to mother vs. flight from grief) drive every beat; the “jar of Kin” micro-choice crystallizes the renunciation with felt cost. Interiority is sensorily anchored (“salt-stung quiet,” “pockets full of corks”) rather than abstract. One slip: the lighthouse-widow moment is told, not dramatized, muting status shift.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of bottling sound → gifting sound → becoming bridge. Closure is a Charged Poise: the new jar labeled “Kin” reweights all prior harvests with conceptual cost—he forfeits solitude for generational translation. Causality intact; no prop teleport or missing setup; orientation anchored by word 50.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Micro-setting (loft rafters, leaking roof) constrains the final act of blending three sound-jars to survive the storm; dune fox recurs as silent witness, charging the final image. Sensory economy favors sound and touch over visual catalog. One minor spatial drift: children “between us” but exact floor position unanchored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—becoming translator—tightens when the storm forces him to risk losing the archive; the act of uncorking three jars mid-gale is the visible price that forecloses solitary hoarding. No coincidence; escalation is accumulative density of preserved voices reaching critical mass. Cost legible: “if the storm took me, it would at least take a town’s vocabulary.”</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the accumulation of bottled voices becoming communal memory; no explicit thesis stated. Final image of “Kin” jar offers a resonant, non-moral answer to generational fracture. Subtext in the fox’s silence and widow’s tear bypasses sentimentality. One near-echo: “penny, honestly offered” flirts with platitude but is saved by embodied jar economy.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>First-person lyric cadence taught early (“sand whispering like restless coins”) and held; perceptual signature filters every noun through sonic value. Diction stays inside coastal-vagrant lexicon; no filter-verb stacks. Compression (“I cork them with wax, label them in pencil”) propels without scaffold. One micro-shift: “lighthouse again” is brief convergence with widow’s voice, acceptable at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>High information density: one sentence often layers sound, metaphor, and plot (“letting them braid the night”). No mixed metaphors; vehicles stay maritime/acoustic. Rhythm accelerates into storm then quiets into dawn without drumbeat template. Minor loop: “jarred verses buy soup and a place to breathe” repeats buy/barter concept; does not touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise—sound archivist beneath dunes—feels inevitable yet unprecedented; fox as mute witness freshens familiar storm-arc. Transformation test fails if any element swapped: music box must be lighthouse keeper’s exact tune. Risk in lyric accumulative structure pays off by making the storm a crucible for communal memory rather than mere survival.</comment>
