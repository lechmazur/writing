<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The artist’s defiance is viscerally embodied in paint-stained hands and raw-throated poetry; the contradiction between grief-driven mischief and communal responsibility is dramatized in the open-air “trapdoor” rhymes. Interiority stays concrete—no abstract therapy-speak—and the final public stand is earned by nightly micro-choices that foreclose silence. The only cap is the Orientation debt applied at Q2, which caps Q1 at 8.3; the actual characterization exceeds that ceiling.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the elders’ single-story rule collapses under the refracted chorus, felt cost visible when torchlight fractures over the spire. Accumulative lens holds: each nightly poem adds a shard until meaning is irreversibly braided. Orientation is taught early through “towers of bone” and the mist-blade spire, so the deliberate disorientation serves closure; waiver applies, no cap triggered.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Bone towers and echo choreography constrain tactics—verses return weaponized—while the spire’s pale blade reappears in the fractured torchlight to charge the final image. Sensory selection is urgent: chalked faces against name-stealing mist, paint bleeding down ribs. Spatial tracking is clean across the nightly gatherings; no white-room syndrome. The canyon’s acoustic rule-set is taught by 25 % and evolves with every echo, passing the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—who controls the price of forgiveness—tightens when each new rhyme adds a witness, narrowing the elders’ option to impose a lone confession. Protagonist agency drives every escalation: clap-and-response sessions multiply counter-stories until the spire physically shivers. Cost is legible in the raw throat and the risk of becoming the next cracked back. One meaningful deepening suffices; no reversal overload.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without thesis statement: forgiveness becomes un-buyable once the canyon refracts culpability into plural voices. The final image—torchlight fracturing instead of resolving—offers a non-literal answer: meaning stays shard-sharp. No moralizing paragraph; the spire’s silence is the conceptual repricing. Counter-readings (is the chorus just new tyranny?) linger plausibly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>First-person collective “we” stays stable; no head-hopping. Diction is canyon-anchored—“bones,” “mist,” “chalked faces”—with syntax that mimics echo-delay: clauses bounce and return. Rhythm accelerates into breathless anaphora at the climax without losing legibility. Filter verbs are minimal and voice-motivated when used.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>High density achieved: one sentence often layers paint, confession, and civic threat. No paraphrase loops; each echo returns re-weighted. Metaphors (forge, prism, blade) interlock rather than clash. Occasional elevated register (“accounting of grief”) is earned by ritual frame, not register drift. Closure line is crisp, no artifact touch.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Freshest inflection: acoustic democracy weaponized through playground clapping games. The canyon-as-prism conceit is inevitable yet non-obvious; no template plot matches this. Risk—collective POV, lyric escalation—heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Specificity of chalked faces versus name-stealing mist is unforgettable.</comment>
