<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Interiority is lyrical, body-bound, and idiosyncratic (“wistfully pragmatic” is lived, not labeled). The hinge micro-choice—angling the gauge tooth to open the padlock—crystallizes a values hierarchy (father’s steadiness > fear of trespass). Yet the narrator’s emotional arc is more accumulative than decisively altered; the “gentling” is shared but not personally costly, so the closure attains Charged Poise rather than Earned Stasis. Still, the perceptual signature is strong and consistent under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the mesh of mirrors reweights the stairwell from fear-zone to play-zone, and the harbor’s discipline is repriced as communal resource. Causal chain holds—petal drop → padlock → mesh → light-spill—each step enabled by the gauge tooth and the oar-rhythm ethos. Orientation is anchored by line 4 (“fire escape gardener”), well inside the 120-word window. The ending’s conceptual cost (shared vulnerability) is legible in Theo’s release and Mrs Gallo’s hum; persistent constraint (rusted tooth) shapes tactics and image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The rooftop tar “keeping yesterday’s sun” and the mesh’s “glass breath” are tactile, POV-filtered details that charge the final image. The harbor is not picturesque backdrop; its moonlit discipline is imported to steady the stairwell, so environment actively supplies the resolution. Micro-settings—the padlock tongue, the transom crack—constrain angle and torque, integrating tool and body. Spatial choreography is clean: climb, kneel, anchor, pay-out; no impossible positions.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reclaim the stairwell from fear—tightens once when the mesh finally spills light and Theo walks unhanded. Agency is present but low-cost; the narrator risks trespass yet faces no repercussion, so escalation is accretive rather than irreversible. The oar-rhythm steadies each micro-move, a credible tactic under Accumulative lens. Cost is conceptual (shared exposure of hope) rather than personal, keeping pressure shy of the 8.8 band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through refracted light: inheritance as gentle instruction rather than legacy object. The gauge tooth and mesh together reprice “steadiness” from private canal craft to communal urban care. No character articulates a moral; instead, the final image of rose-thorns catching the new seam of night offers non-literal answer—protection and vulnerability co-exist. Ambiguity lingers: the building softens but the narrator’s own future remains unspoken, inviting reflection.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>First-person lyric remains stable, no head-hop. Syntax loosens under emotional crest—“I whisper thanks to the water”—yet diction stays within the gardener-tinker lexicon. Perceptual signature is selective: smells of tar, salt, roses noticed; elevator rattle ignored. No dialogue contamination; the one spoken line (“No saints…”) carries subtext and is voice-appropriate. Rhythm modulates: longer clauses for harbor hush, clipped fragments for lock-yield moment.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Strong read-aloud cadence with purposeful enjambment; information density high (“mesh rattles a little, a quivering hush made of glass breath”). Occasional stacked epithets (“luminous harbor by moonlight”) flirt with overwriting but pattern is taught early and sustains tone. No mixed metaphors; tar/sun and tooth/star stay physically coherent. Minor scaffold: “rhythm of oars in water” repeated thrice; trimmed once would sharpen. Closure image is crystalline and unaffected by artifact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Premise—illicit rooftop mirror-light irrigation of a tenement stairwell—feels fresh yet inevitable given canal-lock heritage. Transformation test fails: swap gardener for handy teen and story still runs, limiting top band. Risk lies in lyric accretive structure rather than plot surprise; the payoff is emotional credibility, not conceptual twist. Specificity of gauge-tooth as hinge and oar-rhythm as steadiness method keeps it from sliding into generic hope-parables.</comment>
