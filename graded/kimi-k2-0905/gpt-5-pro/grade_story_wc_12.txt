<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s thinning voice and Ruan’s looped hush create a credible, embodied tension; the final micro-choice—palette set down without pull—earns its cost through prior grammatical footwork. Interior contradiction is present but brief; the entity’s voice never fully dual-voices Mara in the same beat, so the apex of simultaneous impulse is asserted more than dramatized. Still, motivation, flaw, and relational shift hold cleanly under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the demon recognizes hunger as door, not throne—cost is the relinquishing of omnipotence. Causal linkage holds: each rhetorical loop narrows the entity’s options until grammar itself evicts possession. Orientation is swift; dimensional anchor and dusk chapel are anchored by word 40. No lens ambiguity; the final image reweights the rule-set with undeniable social cost—questions remain a commons.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The chapel’s basalt breath and loop-pedal rig constrain tactics: Ruan can layer silence only because the brass outlet is real; the palette’s single blue plane is the micro-setting that charges the final image. Sensory hierarchy is priest-painter specific: paint smell, pedal click, hush feedback. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly as Ruan steps closer and the blue bead crawls. Environment, body, and tool together foreclose the entity’s horizon.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prevent possession—signaled in line 1. Escalation is Accumulative/Textural: each loop adds density until grammar itself becomes the tightening. One meaningful deepening: “If you own everything, what will you ask tomorrow?”—this question forces the entity to confront infinite regress, collapsing its plane. Price is legible: the demon’s loss of a future-proof horizon.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges: ownership vs. commons, flat stasis vs. plural becoming. Subtext lives in pedal-hush and bruise-blue—silence and color carry the argument without sermon. Final image—lake-clear hush—reweights prior loops as communal listening. No moralizing; resonance is felt, not stated.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays welded to Ruan’s perceptual signature: “care that moved like a thumb over vellum.” Syntax mirrors loop logic—anaphora, chiasmus—without losing clarity. No head-hopping; Mara’s interior is inferred only through external cue (breath twice, uncoached). Voice remains distinct under peak stress.</comment>

<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence layers stakes or atmosphere. Figurative control is tight: “braided like river grip around a stone” fuses touch and motion. No loops, scaffold, or register drift. Minor elevation in diction is priest-appropriate; clarity never buckles.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Exorcism via rhetorical device and loop pedal is fresh; the palette-as-single-plane literalizes the demon’s ontological craving. Risk—lyric theological argument—pays off because grammar itself becomes weapon and wound. Synthesis feels inevitable: silence as decoration, questions as commons. No derivative echo; the piece commits fully to its premise.</comment>
