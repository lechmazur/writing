<comment>The investigator’s interiority is concrete—every chalk arrow and anemometer reading is a micro-choice that exposes a mind calibrating risk. The patch-as-compass moment crystallizes a hierarchy of values (truth vs. safety) with visible cost: the torn cloth foreshadows the human price of trusting equations. The final “steadier hand” is earned; the causality chain from wind survey to safety grid is clean, and the refusal to let the air decide again is an Earned Stasis that forecloses the old path. No label-speak, no safety-hedging; the flaw is only that we never see the investigator’s own pulse spike—cool detachment borders on affective flatline.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the grid now “holds” when the scheduled gust arrives, reweighting the premise that ports must bow to weather. Cost is legible in the salt-stained signature and the town’s still-fragile radios—silence has been replaced by vigilance, not noise. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each chalk arrow, soot V, and hinge-tapping crate layers density until the final image reconfigures meaning. No orientation debt; who/where/when are anchored by word 80 (“port is already holding its breath”).</comment>

<comment>The container labyrinth is not backdrop but ventilation chamber: its “narrow lungs” actively funnels gusts that buck the plane, so environment directly shapes the crash and the fix. Micro-setting—the salt-stiff patch, the scuffed bulkhead—constrains the investigator’s next move (trace the curve). The final image of fluttering notes that “settle” against the grid shows the setting has been rewritten by human geometry. Gate met: environment charges the closing image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Single dominant stake—prevent repetition of singular convergence—tightens when the investigator drafts an order that turns the maze into a “breathing grid,” trading scheduling purity for adaptive safety. The price is visible: the patch must return to a family still grieving, the town must accept slower throughput. Agency is renunciation rather than triumph; the investigator endures the bureaucratic slog as buffer against future wind. One meaningful deepening suffices; no reversal is needed under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the shift of convergence from fatal trap to safer habit; no authorial thesis states “humans must respect chaos.” The final image reweights “hazy precision” itself—precision is no longer absolute prediction but adaptive looseness. Subtext lives in the gulls’ gray commas and the radios’ clipped syllables: nature’s language is terse, human reply must become equally economical. No moralizing paragraph, no echo of prompt language, just the salt on the signature as quiet wisdom.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Perceptual signature is unmistakable: wind is tasted, pressure shadows “noted,” corrugated steel “breathes.” Syntax mirrors anemometer skips—short gusts of clauses, then elongated stream-of-survey lines. No head-hop, no register drift; diction stays within investigator’s tool-box lexicon. Patterned elision (“the town went silent without being told”) is taught early and paid off when silence becomes a metric of safety restored.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with the harbor: staccato noun clusters under pressure (“soot V, scorch, shallow V”) then longer exhalations when the grid is drafted. No mixed metaphors; every vehicle is meteorological (gulls as punctuation, containers as lungs). Information density high—one sentence can map wind, reveal character, foreshadow crash. Only hairline slip: “the kind a jet wash would carve” is slightly expository, but it is immediately grounded by investigator’s chalk.</comment>

<comment>Freshest synthesis: accident report as lyric poem, wind as culprit and chorus, shipping containers as可变 bronchi. The patch’s reprise transforms souvenir into safety dial—an object re-enlisted rather than fetishized. Risk is taken and paid off: the second-person imagined address to the dead engineer could feel gimmicky, but it tightens the ethical ledger. Specificity throughout (ribboned telltales, three golden propellers) makes the template unportable.</comment>
