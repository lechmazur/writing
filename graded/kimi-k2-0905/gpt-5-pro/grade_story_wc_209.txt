<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The artist’s interior contradiction—painting to “speak without harm” while resisting overt display—remains embodied and particular; the final renunciation of permission-asking is earned through nights of withheld color and the felt cost of “spaces where the wall itself could breathe.” Micro-choices (aligning postcards, angling the lantern) track a hierarchy of values without declarative self-analysis. No second character appears, so status/relationship bullets are N/A. The only bar to 9+ is that the restraint never faces an external test that could have forced a costlier mistake.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: the piece teaches its pattern early—postcards as refractive keys, paint withheld—and each seasonal shard adds density until the final “tender shadow” reweights the stake. Closure is a Charged Poise: the pavilion image reconfigures the premise from seeking knowledge to offering color without coercion. Cost is legible in the erased snow, the exhausted postcards, and the narrator’s readiness to paint “without asking for permission.” A hairline slip: the causal link between moon-angle and interior insight is lyric rather than strictly legible, keeping it shy of 9.5.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Environment (cathedral glass, cloister earth, amber pavilion) repeatedly constrains perception and tactics: the etched panes dictate where the lantern must stand; the pavilion’s geometry frames the final stance. Micro-setting objects—postcards, ladder, lantern—are handled on-page and their shifting states (curling edges, paint stains) alter later moves. Sensory economy is excellent: “white throats silvering the air” compresses scent, sight, and hush into one stroke. Meets 9+ gate for environment-as-constraint; capped at 8.8 only because winter-snow timeframe is more atmospheric than clock-driven.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—how to speak color without harm—tightens via seasonal accretion: each shard forfeits a brighter palette for “deep blues of quiet thinking.” The protagonist’s agency is the act of continual restraint; pressure peaks when the last postcard is spent and the choice becomes paint or silence. Cost is visible in the fading graphite paths and the self-imposed erasure of spectacle. No external antagonist is needed; coincidence is absent. Sufficient for 8.6, but lacks a single moment where restraint could have exploded into regret, keeping it from 8.8+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges as the ethics of aesthetic restraint: flowers teach “a language of shelter,” not display. The final image re-prices the concept—love is “a tender shadow,” a refusal to dominate sight. No moral is stated; the pavilion windows “swallow the day” reweights earlier cathedral refractions. Ambiguity is purposeful yet coherent. Meets 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>First-person lyric voice owns a distinct perceptual signature: “petals opening not outward but inward” is idiosyncratic and biased toward negative space. Syntax elongates in calm beats, fragments under lantern-light urgency, mirroring painterly gaze. No dialogue, so naturalism bullets N/A. Patterned elision (“the mathematics of opening”) is taught early and paid off in moonlit reckoning. Rhythm control is exemplary; no head-hopping or register drift. Minor hairline: occasional adjective clustering (“thin silver… dawning hush”) but always in service of tonal pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud ear is musical without algorithmic repetition; sentence openings vary from participial to noun-phrase to clause. Information density high: one line can layer time, pigment, and moral stance. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; no mixed metaphors. The only figurative strain—“snow leaked away like milk from a bowl”—is brief and image-consistent. Closure image (“first stars touched the water”) is crystal-clear and propulsive.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses muralist, cathedral, and nocturnal botany into a fresh synthesis; transformation test fails if any element is swapped. Risk-taking in lyric structure heightens coherence rather than gimmickry. The “tender shadow” as love is a non-obvious conceptual re-pricing. Minor proximity echo to Woolfian lyric compression, but voice remains singular.</comment>
