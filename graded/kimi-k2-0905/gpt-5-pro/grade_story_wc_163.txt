<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Interiority is lyrically embodied—e.g. “my racing maps”—but the narrator’s want (belonging) never collides with an opposing internal fear or flaw; the single micro-choice is the synchronized exhale, which is lovely yet costs nothing and changes nothing. Mara exists mainly as gentle chorus, so relationship-as-crucible is absent. Result: character is vivid but static; no contradictory impulse under pressure, hence no earned stasis or decisive change.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: pressure deepens through repeated shared breaths and plankton blooms rather than causal reversals. Closure is a Charged Poise—sunrise gold reveals dancers, re-weighting “belonging” with conceptual cost: the narrator now stays, city breathes back. Orientation is clear by line 5; no teleporting props. Minor slip: generator hiccup is instantly soothed by feather, so no option is foreclosed; hence not 8.8+.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Underwater dome, silt streets, anemone fountains are tactile and filtered through astrologer’s star-seeking bias; every sensory pick is purposeful. Micro-setting triumph: burnt feather dragged across glass becomes the only tool that rekindles plankton—an environment-body-tool fusion that directly charges the final image (sunbeam on dancers). Spatial choreography clean; no white-room syndrome.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“learn the rhythm of belonging”—is signaled early; pressure escalates accretively: doubt → luminous respite → generator falter → feather rescue → sunrise reveal. Yet the generator flicker is the sole tightening beat and it is reversed within four sentences, so options never narrow; cost is aesthetic (transient darkness) not tactical. No credible loss or trade-off is dramatized.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of belonging emerges through communal respiration imagery; final dancers with open hands toward lanterns reconfigure “belonging” as reciprocal, not possessive. Avoids moralizing, but the insight is gently stated by narrator (“simple secret”) rather than left purely in image. Shadowseam wonder motif returns charged at sunrise, earning resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</question><comment>Narrator’s perceptual signature is distinct—coastlines, constellations, drowned vowels—maintained across all observation. Syntax breathes with the scene: long clauses for lullaby ducts, fragment-like beats during plankton bloom. No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens from cosmic gaze to fingertip on wet valve. Dialogue minimal but voice-apt: “city is not dead, only patient.”</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Lyric density is high yet purposeful; only one paraphrase loop (“luminous respite” repeated in adjacent sentences). Metaphors stay coherent (plankton as held hand, vents schooling us). Final line cadence mirrors sunrise blade—crisp exit. Occasional elevated diction (“shadowseam wonder,” “conceptual repricing”) slightly overleaps POV lexicon but reads as ritualized voice, not register drift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fusion of landscape astrology with underwater ruin is fresh; firefly breathing ritual transposed to bioluminescent shrimp feels inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric accumulative structure pays off in sunrise image. Deduction for faint echo of “teaching the sea to welcome them” that edges toward sentiment; still, specificity of drowned boulevard constellations prevents generic feel.</comment>
