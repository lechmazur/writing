<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The horizon mapper’s interior contradiction—dream-drunk cartographer vs. pragmatic convoy skeptic—drives every beat; the final quiet nod from Kerr shows relational shift with cost. Micro-choices (tilting slate, unyoking dogs) embody values hierarchy under pressure. One slip: “restless pulse” summary borders diagnostic label, −0.2.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the council’s “slow exhale” reconfigures future options with felt cost of forsaken haste. Causal lens holds: moon-iron experiment → vote → new rhythm. Persistent constraint (lunar schedule) shapes next three nights. Cost crystallized in “return barren” clause.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Basalt nave, frost-smoke breath, magnetic viaduct hum are tactile and bias-filtered. Moonlit slate and sled nails constrain choices; lake ice micro-setting mirrors internal shift. Final image of widening horizon recharges opening “horizon mapper” anchor. Geo-physical rules stay consistent.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prove patience can replace speed—tightens when council votes only three nights; failure returns them to haste. Agency: protagonist risks reputation on lunar test. Price visible: “return barren” clause. One meaningful deepening suffices; no reversal required under lyric-causal design.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: patience as technology of survival. No thesis statement; final “tide tamed enough to pull us home” reweights premise. Subtext in Kerr’s nod and dog traces. Avoids tidy moral—rhythm, not virtue, wins.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lyric first-person voice owns perceptual signature: “wind combs the rim,” “aurora smudged like thumbprints.” Rhythm modulates—compressed clauses for transit, longer breaths for council. No dialogue to distort. Filter verbs minimal; free indirect style clean.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sentence variety propels; no scaffold loops. Figurative density is high but pattern-taught early (“magnetite bones”) and paid off at bridge crossing. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves via image. Minor register lift: “conceptual repricing” diction slightly above POV lexicon, −0.1.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fusion of lunar science + iron bridge + sled lore feels fresh yet inevitable. Transformation test fails if transplanted: moon-schedule logistics are inseparable. Risk taken: quiet revolution instead of uprising, rewarded by coherent closure. Specificity of “magnetic viaduct after rain” anchors originality.</comment>
