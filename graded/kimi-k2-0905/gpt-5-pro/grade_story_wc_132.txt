<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator’s shift from control-freak ledger-man to “circuitously sincere” listener is embodied in micro-choices—widening swales, letting moss stay, writing a “plan that was more like a prayer.” Interior contradiction is vivid: the itch under the glove of routine, the wince still coming when a gust hits. Cost is legible—loss of certainty, of customers, of father’s brace-and-nail gospel—yet the arc stays slightly interior; Theo’s pressure is present but diluted because he never physically threatens or competes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of leaf-landings, moss seams, and storm-blessed channels tightens until the final image reweights mastery into stewardship. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the narrator lifts the leaf, sees spore-passengers, and accepts open-ended transformation; cost is felt in the relinquishing of finish-line control. One causality wobble: gutters overflow and “the street flashed like a creek” but no on-stage consequence (lost stock, angry customer) is shown, softening the tightening. Otherwise every return to the trellis thickens texture and narrows the possible future to “let the leaf decide.”</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The mossy trellis functions as micro-setting: its damp rib-cage breathes only after channels are released, constraining future staking choices. Sensory hierarchy is botanist-poet—veins “mapping routes under the skin,” wet limestone scent, coffee-ring compass—yet always filtered through nursery-owner priorities. Weather is not backdrop but agent: storms arrive, gutters flash, gutters decide. Final image of leaf spinning onto boot and carrying spores is charged specificity that could not be swapped; environment literally rewrites the business plan.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</question><comment>Dominant stake—control vs. receptive stewardship—tightens through each storm and leaf migration. Agency is present: every act of letting-go (widening swale, sparing moss, shelving ledger) forfeits short-order profit and father’s legacy, visible cost. No external antagonist beyond weather; coincidence (gale, overflowing gutter) complicates rather than rescues. Escalation is textural—repetition of landing leaf accumulates unbearable proximity until surrender feels inevitable—yet one beat short of 9+ because no single moment forces a definitive public loss or customer confrontation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges as “life drifts by invitations instead of orders,” seeded in leaf-route sketches, paid off when spores colonize the narrator’s boot. No moral spoken; final prayer-plan keeps ambiguity alive. Subtext lives in gestures—customers’ knuckles soften under linden touch, Theo’s coffee-ring compass—showing conversion without sermon. Echo of father’s “brace and nail” vs. moss-stitched trellis offers plausible counter-reading: both holds may be necessary, leaving complexity intact.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>First-person botanist voice owns a perceptual signature: rain smells of wet limestone, veins are “routes under the skin,” ledger lines up like “seed flats in a pivoted sun.” Syntax is long-breathing, comma-riven, mirroring storm-surge thinking; final sentences shorten into acceptance. No dialogue chunks to test voice convergence; Theo’s brief spoken line fits apprentice shyness. Compression (“I wanted mastery, but the trellis taught me stewardship”) is earned, not shortcut, because causal trail of leaf and moss precedes it.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</question><comment>Lyric density stays purposeful: every figurative push serves botanic perception—moss “stitched seams the screws missed” marries craft and organism. No mixed-metaphor violations; vehicles stay vegetal or carpenter-true. Rhythm modulates: rolling anaphora in storm sequences, then staccato “I held the posts.” Minor scaffold: “I kept returning” twice in three sentences; could trim one. No loops or register drift; high information ratio—“drip line moved it” compresses hydrology and agency in four words.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Familiar eco-epiphany arc is refreshed through horticultural specificity: linden leaf as daily rune, moss as living suture, nursery as chapel. Risk taken—renunciation of control as commercial strategy—avoids granola cliché because financial cost (fewer customers) stays on the page. Synthesis of arboriculture + personal growth feels inevitable, not imported. Not quite 9 because emotional arc maps closely to standard “man learns humility from nature” template; particularities rescue but don’t fully transmute the trope.</comment>
