<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The living-statue POV delivers a consistent, stone-cold perceptual signature (“I thread my message along the cracks”) and several embodied micro-choices (waking statues, asking the bishop to open his hands). Internal contradiction is present but soft; the narrator’s motive to “welcome nuance into certainty” is declared more than dramatized, so the final renunciation feels slightly abstract rather than costly. Still, the voice remains singular and the actions track with the telepathic premise.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the ampoule’s release visibly reweights the city’s rule-set (“statues softened… plants remembered how to sway”). Causality is lyric-accumulative rather than tight because/therefore; the pattern is taught early and the final image carries undeniable conceptual cost. Orientation is delayed but functional—underwater statues, quaked plaza, and telepathic speaker are all legible by ~100 words—so the waiver applies. One meaningful tightening occurs when the bishop releases the ampoule, foreclosing the path of perpetual certainty.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The garden-as-body is vivid and selective: “glassy ferns,” “bronze ivy,” “fallen rooms” all filter through a sculptor’s eye. Spatial choreography is impressionistic yet coherent; distances collapse lyrically but never contradict. The environment actively constrains—cracks are literal channels for thought—so the 9+ gate is met. Minor drift: a few adjectives (“moon freckles”) flirt with prettiness, but they’re brief and payoff in the final reweighting.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—free the city from lethal certainty—signals early and tightens once: the ampoule’s release irreversibly softens statues. Agency is mostly interior threading, but the narrator’s decision to ask the bishop to open his hands is a visible beat that narrows options. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral: the city’s “certainties unbraided” is legible but not felt on the body. Sufficient for this accumulative design, though not razor-sharp.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: the danger of fixed beauty versus the mercy of permeability. Subtext lives in gesture—opening carved hands, drifting glass—never sermon. Final image reweights the premise without moralizing: “a room that remembers every voice” is a resonant, non-literal answer. One near-echo: the phrase “welcome nuance into a certainty” flirts with thesis-statement, but it’s buried mid-text and quickly subsumed by image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Voice is crystalline, stone-cold, and rhythmically controlled: “threading intent along their hairline cracks” is both literal and metaphorical without exposition. Syntax scales from long breathy clauses to short chiselled fragments, mirroring seismic pressure. No head-hopping; telepathic omniscience is rule-consistent. Diction stays inside sculptor/artisan lexicon; occasional Latinate blossoms (“digitalis,” “consecrating”) feel earned rather than showy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; most sentences carry double duty (image + conceptual tilt). No paraphrase loops or scaffold. Mixed-metaphor risk in “choir of rust” and “tide hears me think” but the logic holds within the lyric-accumulative mode. Filter verbs nearly zero; strong verbs (“thread,” “tug,” “soften”) drive motion. One micro-repeat: “after revealing the secret” opener and echo—acceptable as deliberate refrain.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fusing telepathic statuary with underwater pharmacology is a fresh angle on “sunken city” tropes. The foxglove-as-sedative twist rewrites catastrophe as misplaced care—an insight that feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk is high—lyric mosaic, no human dialogue—yet coherence remains. Small deduction for echo of ubiquitous “ruin-as-wisdom” template, but the specificity of sculptor-vs-garden lifts it above cliché.</comment>
