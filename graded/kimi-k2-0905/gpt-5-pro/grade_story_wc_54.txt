<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mara’s “curious” tag is shown through tactile micro-choices—testing railing cold, tuning valves, writing numbers on tile—each a visible micro-choice under pressure. Interiority stays concrete (“numbers feel like handholds”) and contradictions appear (hope vs. limits). The sextant shard literalizes her trait, charging the final beam-aiming beat; cost is felt when she accepts “how many lights she can afford.” No second character on page, so relational bullets waived; single-POV interiority remains specific and consistent.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the terminal’s gentle glow and whispering fountain reconfigure meaning with felt cost—she can “afford” only a few lights. Causal chain holds: sextant → skylight → sensor → pump; each step is traceable, no luck resolves. Orientation is anchored by word 50 (“abandoned spaceport passenger terminal”), well inside 120-word limit. Accumulated/Textural lens is taught early (“maze of intentions engraved”) and holds through final cadence shift from stale air to misted breath.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setting is not backdrop but toolkit: corroded valves, cistern of rainwater and confetti, sputtering solar array—each is handled, rerouted, and repurposed. Spatial choreography is clean; panels → cable → pump → basin track without drift. The sextant shard functions as micro-setting that constrains the final beam-aiming choice, satisfying 9+ gate. Sensory palette is selective (bone-cold metal, lemon-tar tape) and filtered through engineer’s gaze.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—resurrecting hope via functional creativity—tightens once: from dust-filled apathy to looping ribbon of water. Agency is continuous: every solder, tape wrap, and resistance calculation narrows options and spends daylight charge. Cost is visible: “she can afford to keep alive” only a few lights; failure remains live possibility. No external antagonist needed; internal constraint (limited wattage) supplies coherent pressure under Accumulative lens.</answer>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete particulars: hope = amperage × head × friction, not slogan. Final image of glowing terminal reframes earlier “maze of intentions” as living circuit. No overt thesis statement; the boy’s question and her answer (“learning to move again”) let theme resonate without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers—will buses ever come?—inviting reflection rather than closure-by-explanation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays close to Mara’s perceptual filter: verbs like “exhales,” “groan,” “sputter” animate structures the way she hears them. Syntax tightens under pressure—single-clause commands (“She reroutes… She threads…”) mimic valve-turn precision. No dialogue, so voice distinction bullet waived; interior diction stays within plausible intern range. Final “clicks like a star learning a new orbit” extends metaphor yet remains consistent with her sextant-tool mindset.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet breathable: “concertina of dust and confetti stars” carries three jobs—visual, tactile, and symbolic. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances pump-path or emotional gauge. Metaphors are coherent (thermal relays, tidelines) and avoid mixed-vehicle clutter. Read-aloud rhythm varies: long breath of opener, staccato beats during valve-work, quiet cadence at lantern close.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Freshest synthesis: post-carnival spaceport as engineering practicum for hope. Sextant shard repurposed as photovoltaic sight is non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Stakes stay human-scale—one fountain, one girl, one skylight—avoiding tidy utopian reboot. Risk taken in lyric engineering vocabulary pays off: “amperage and head” becomes emotional lexicon without gimmickry.</comment>
