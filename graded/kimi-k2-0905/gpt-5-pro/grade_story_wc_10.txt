<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The survivor’s vow to “translate silence into music” is embodied in every beat—tuning-fork taps, thermal coding, sleeve-sealed titles—so the inner contradiction (need sound / trapped silence) stays live. Micro-choices (threading forks into snow, softening code for a sobbing child) visibly cost time and body-heat, earning the final Earned Stasis. Sura’s silently expressive hands create authentic status shifts without dialogue. No stock interiority; each frost trace is a character-specific hieroglyph.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of frost-stave → heat-map → sleeve-seal tightens meaning once, then reweights at bell tower. Closure is Charged Poise: “my answer rising without volume” crystallizes options—soundless music as perpetual motion—while conceptual cost (endless winter, no true sound) is undeniable. Orientation anchored by line 3; transitions (ferry → conservatory → tower) are legible shards under same lens. No causality breaks; every escalation is density increase, not coincidence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Winterglass conservatory acts as micro-setting: frost panes become staves, thermal camera becomes instrument, constraining every creative act. Cold rules are consistent—breath patterns, frost growth, kelp coil as silent message. Spatial choreography clear across fern walk → bell tower descent. Final image of “constellations of breath on the panes” recharges skylight motif, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake: can silence be made into music without sound? Pressure escalates through each thermal map—child’s tear softens tempo, elder’s laugh accelerates rhythm—so stakes tighten aesthetically, not physically. No reversals needed under Accumulative lens; each frost trace is a deepening that narrows options toward purely visual/somatic music. Cost is legible: bodily warmth, time, and the perpetual absence of true sound.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from specific act of mapping body-heat to silent bells; no abstract sermon. Final image reweights “unshaken marvels” as the printed boot-print ovation—earth itself as audience—achieving Conceptual Repricing without moral. Silence-as-music refuses tidy comfort; ambiguity lingers in frozen bell that still cannot ring. Subtext in kelp coil: wordless acknowledgment across survivor cohort.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>First-person lyric voice owns a perceptual signature: every noun is filtered through post-sound physics—“rime,” “thermal,” “frost-lace”—syntax compresses under aurora light. No head-hopping; Sura’s silence is observed, not ventriloquized. Patterned elision (“the hush rolled in”) is taught early and paid off in final “answer rising without volume.” Rhythm modulates: long breathless sentences for aurora nights, staccato for fork-taps.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or stakes. Figurative language is patterned (frost = stave, heat = note) and never muddled. Opening line anchors voice and concept simultaneously. No scaffold, no filter-verb stacks; strong verbs (“threaded,” “sealed,” “sang”) drive propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>Premise—soundless world making music via body-heat—is non-obvious synthesis of climate dystopia + lyric science. Tuning-fork-in-snow, thermal-camera-as-score are fresh specificities that could not swap with generic props. Risk of lyric mosaic pays off: boot-print ovation reconfigures applause trope without sound. Transformation test passed: plot collapses if any element replaced.</comment>
