<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s loneliness-cure motive is concrete and threaded through every beat; her “desperately jocular” mask is shown, not told, and the ledger micro-choices track a visible cost. Interior contradiction is present but stays summary-level (“felt seen only by their needs”) rather than erupting in a single, embodied beat under pressure. The final renunciation—handing off the moon rock and accepting surrogate love—earns its place, yet the moment itself is lightly sketched, blunting the full cost punch required for 9+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the rock becomes a communal listening shrine, loneliness is re-priced as shared attention, and Mara’s own isolation remains uncured—cost is felt. Accumulative/textural lens holds: rumor density increases until the timetable-free queue forms; no causal cheats. Orientation is swift; ivy, station, flood, and jars anchor by line 5. One minor bobble: the “moment when the story changes” is declared rather than dramatized, but the image of fingerprints on the counter immediately reweights stakes, satisfying the CR beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Ivy, ticket counter, and corrugated roof are tactile, bias-filtered, and guide movement; the moon fragment’s “cup of her hand” micro-setting constrains the final hand-off. Sensory hierarchy obeys crisis: flour dust, kettle steam, and boot-slop sharpen when the queue catalyzes. Spatial choreography is clean across the camp-to-hills round trip. Environment is not merely painted; it supplies the rumor conduit and the counter altar that charge the closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—loneliness vs. logistics of attention—tightens when rumor converts the rock into a confession currency, narrowing Mara’s private cure to public conduit. Pressure escalates accumulatively: each traded story adds queue length and ledger mass, reweighting the cost of Mara’s own unread entry. No coincidence resolves; the final cost is her continued anonymity. A sharper visible forfeiture (burned page, surrendered ledger line) would push higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the reciprocity engine: attention is currency, loneliness a supply-chain failure. Subtext lives in gesture—fingerprints on the counter equal signatures on a contract no one verbalizes. The closing image of ivy slowly breathing on the rock re-prices the moon as communal satellite, not private talisman, avoiding any moral sermon. Complexity lingers: Mara’s own loneliness persists, proving the cure is systemic, not personal—a resonant conceptual shift.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays tight to Mara’s perceptual filter: “rumor roosted,” “anarchy remembering its manners”—diction and rhythm are hers. No head-hop; surveyor’s voice is reported, not interiorized. Compression (“politely, like anarchy remembering its manners”) is taught early and paid off in the final queue order. Under peak stress the syntax shortens without drum-beat monotony, maintaining propulsion while voice remains distinct.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Metaphors are dense but purposeful—each extends the rail/ivy logistics conceit; no mixed vehicles. Rhythm modulates from long freight-train sentences to platform-staccato when the queue forms. Zero paraphrase loops; every line advances story, character, or atmosphere. A single near-purple phrase—“whisper adjusting its coat”—is earned by prior pattern and does not obscure causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The disaster-relief logistician who treats loneliness as a supply-chain problem, cured by rumor-barter rather than therapy, feels genuinely new. Moon rock as social catalyst reconfigures familiar post-flood survival into attention economics without gimmickry. Risky lyric compression is taught early and holds coherence through the final conceptual re-pricing. Transformation test fails if Mara is swapped for generic aid worker—proof the premise is irreducibly specific.</comment>
