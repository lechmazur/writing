<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority is sensorially embodied and idiosyncratic—"taste of old oil and library dust anchors me"—and every micro-choice (counting breaths, bookmark between teeth) declares a hierarchy of values under pressure. The mentor’s absence is still a relationship that forces present stance; the self-to-past dynamic is treated as a crucible. No stock phrases; contradictions (shy yet proud flame) stay physically grounded. The only minus is a hair of safety-hedging: the narrator’s perfection in ritual could risk too immaculate calibration, but the audible stutter of generator and cracked bell keep flaw alive.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of thaw-drip/breath-count reweights the stake from solitary craft to communal listening. Closure is a Charged Poise—the three bells and the sign “heat is shared” reconfigure the moral rule-set with undeniable conceptual cost. Orientation anchored by line 5; drip serves as clock. No loops or teleporting props; bookmark, generator, and ice sheets each evolve causally and return in the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Environment (abandoned console, puddled floor, shy flame) directly constrains every tactical choice—oxygen valve, marver angle, when to speak aloud. Ice-applause at the end recharges the drip pattern that began the piece. Sensory hierarchy privileges temperature and sound over visual glamour, fitting glassblower’s craft. Micro-setting of mouth-holding bookmark exemplifies “tool-as-setting” that charges closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can curiosity survive inside a safe zone the narrator must literally blow into being—tightens once: from solitary refuge to shared invitation. The thaw-drip cadence is the external pressure that forces the turn to “heat is shared.” Cost is visible: relinquishing exclusivity of ruin, risking unknown strangers. Under accumulative lens the density shift (three bells, posted note) is sufficient; no further reversal needed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges via iterated images of enclosure (bell, dome, room, bookmark page) that flip from self-protection to hospitality without a moral sermon. Final note “ask what you cannot elsewhere” is a conceptual repricing that reweights prior hoarded heat. Ambiguity is preserved—outsiders may still break bells. Insight is earned through tactile particulars, not abstract plea. No echo of prompt language.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>First-person POV sustains a glassblower’s perceptual signature—attention to breath, viscosity, color inside flame—without ventriloquising absent mentor. Dramatic narration of mundane sweeping is voice-motivated compression taught early and paid off when generator “breathes.” Syntax mirrors molten turns: long sentences swell, then cut short on the count of sixteen. Zero head-hop; unreliability limited to hopeful guess about strangers, acknowledged as gamble.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Rhythm breathes with furnace cycle; sentence openings vary, paragraphs shorten as glass cools. Information density high—single sentence can layer tool, memory, and ethic: “I hold the cracked leather bookmark with my teeth as I work the marver.” One mixed-metor alert: “stubborn mirror” is briefly strained yet saved by immediate physical payoff (“reflects my face”). No loops or scaffold; even repetitions of “cue” are purposeful pattern. Read-aloud ear clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Premise—artist turns frozen nuclear control room into glass sanctuary for forbidden questions—is non-obvious and inseparable from character stakes. Transformation test fails if relocated to generic studio. Risk of lyric monologue is embraced yet grounded by drip-time and oxygen valve. Synthesis of craft manual, post-industrial ruin, and ethics of inquiry feels inevitable in hindsight. No familiar trope echoes; mentor’s ghost is functional object, not stock device.</comment>
