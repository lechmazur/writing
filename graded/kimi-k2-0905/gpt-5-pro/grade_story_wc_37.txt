<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The memory-keeper’s interiority is lush and embodied—fear “as thin and cutting as mica” anchors motive—but the arc is more witness than actor; the final surrender of memories feels inevitable rather than a hard choice that costs him a path. No contradictory impulse is staged in scene; the text sings, but the character never surprises himself.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the woven dawn is raised, the realm inhales, and the keeper is emptied—cost is felt in the image of sparks “stitching hearth to hearth.” Accumulative lens holds: pattern of song→mica→thread→sky taught early and tightened once; orientation anchors (who/where) arrive by line 8. One causality micro-gap: the storm-of-breach that cracked the pane is recounted, not dramatized, so the price of that failure is inferred rather than re-experienced.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is not backdrop but instrument: the greenhouse’s glass, sap, and lamps constrain every tactic—warmth bargained for, songs angled toward panes, dawn cloth draped over trees. The mica window reappears cracked yet luminous, charging the final image. Sensory hierarchy obeys the keeper’s alchemical priorities; no tourist catalog. Spatial choreography is immaculate across the single continuous scene.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“rekindle a dying realm”—is signaled in paragraph 3 and deepened once when the last village arrives with “fires gone to salt.” Pressure tightens accumulatively: each song loosens mica, each thread narrows the remaining night. Cost is visible on-page: the keeper’s palms shake, the greenhouse darkened in recalled failure, and finally he is “emptied.” No live option is foreclosed at the end, but the stance crystallizes in the raised cloth.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges as the cost of communal memory: remembrance is not free—it consumes the keeper’s self. Subtext lives in gesture—palms pressed to broken glass, salt remembering the sea—never sermonized. Final image of cracks as “seams for light” reweights earlier breakage into necessity. No tidy moral; ambiguity lingers in what remains forgotten.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>First-person voice is irreducibly specific: “I slice one open and the room fills with bicycle bells and a woman laughing beside sulfur.” Syntax mirrors alchemical process—long breathless clauses that distill into hard nouns (mica, salt, ash). No head-hopping; psychic distance contracts under stress. Patterned elision (“winter kitchens within winter”) is taught early and paid off in the final dawn-unknotting.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Rhythm modulates from liquid orchard sentences to clipped loom-work—“lattice by lattice”—mirroring tension. Figurative density is high but each vehicle advances stakes (sap brightening, fruits exhaling cold sugar). One micro-loop: “I am emptied and full” is immediate rephrase, but the paradox is earned as conceptual cost. No scaffold or register drift; opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Premise fuses alchemy, lyric memoir, and communal ritual into a coherent mythic engine; not a trope checklist but a singular vision. The woven-dawn payoff could only emerge from this keeper, this greenhouse, this song-net. Risk—entire plot advanced through sung lullabies—heightens coherence rather than gimmickry. Freshness survives the transformation test: swap names and the arc collapses.</comment>
