<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The queen’s interior contradiction—yearning to undo her own sovereignty yet still speaking in “softly commanding” velvet—is dramatized in scene, not told. Her final renunciation lands with palpable cost as metal meets stone and starlight pools into a mirror; the circlet drop is earned by the hawk-fire memory revealed minutes earlier. Mapmaker serves as pressure conduit, never stealing focus; their exchange sharpens her choice rather than explains it. Voice stays singular, tactile, and consistent under lyric duress.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the circlet surrender converts bleeding starlight into a “patient mirror,” reweighting her rule and the world’s wound. Causal chain holds—mirror crack → dreams → cobalt/ember lung ritual → circlet release—each beat narrowing options. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 4 and are repeatedly refreshed; no penalty. Final image exhales “a breath that would not cost a body,” undeniable social/ontological cost made legible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Settings function as micro-antagonists: cloud-cranberry path, basalt ribs, and starlight sheen each force tactical adjustments. Cobalt grotto door dissolves into her “own nights,” a concrete reconfiguration that charges closure. Ember grotto’s slow cool under palm-pressed basalt directly enables the inter-cave wind birth—environment shapes outcome. Selective sensory economy (taste of rust, weight of filigree) never stalls momentum; texture propels rather than decorates.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—stop the bleeding sky she caused—tightens once: circlet must fall for starlight to clot. Escalation is accumulative/lyric: density of starlight, fire, and ash images accrues until renunciation becomes the only breath left. Visible price: cut palms, metal on stone, and the permanent political vacuum implied by uncrowned queen. No coincidence; every intensification stems from her earlier hawk-fire marriage.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from pattern—sky wound mirrored in personal wound—without overt statement. Final image of wind “that would not cost a body” offers a resonant, non-literal answer: sovereignty itself was the puncture. Ambiguity is meaningful: she may have stitched the sky or merely confessed, but the cost is undeniable. No moralizing, only crystallized stance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Perceptual signature sustains lyric compression: “corridors sighed like veils,” “ember grotto coughed sparks.” Syntax flexes with pressure—fragments appear at the circlet drop, then lengthen as wind steadies. No filter-verb stacks; metaphors are internally coherent (lungs, mirrors, lace). Dialogue is sparse but voice-differentiated: queen commands with velvet, mapmaker counts breaths—distinct idiom without ventriloquism.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>High information density: every sentence advances image, pressure, or mythic logic. No synonym loops or template cadence; figurative language is patterned early and paid off (“lacy menace” echoed in lace-throat dream). Clause variation and paragraph-cut test passed—removing any paragraph would break the ritual sequence. Micro-slip: “bleeding starlight” repeated four times; slight rhythmic redundancy keeps this from 9.0+.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fusion of monarchic self-undoing with sky-wound cosmology feels non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Ritual use of paired grottos as lungs and mirror-door grown from exhaled childhood fireflies is a fresh inflection not seen in standard fantasy. Emotional specificity—hawk treaty burned at wedding—grounds the myth. Risky lyric elliptical structure is taught early and lands cleanly; boldness heightens rather than obscures.</comment>
