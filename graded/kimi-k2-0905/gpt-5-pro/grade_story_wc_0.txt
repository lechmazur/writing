<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority is rich, concrete, and POV-bound: “hands still tasting of salt and metal,” “sky is made of ripped plastic.” The neutron-star lens gives consistent perceptual bias; micro-choices (chalk-marks, tape, half-light reopening) enact the “strip needless drama” motive with visible trade-offs. Flaw: the botanist’s late entrance is only sketched; we get no contrasting voice or status shift, so relationship-as-crucible is asserted, not dramatized. Still, the final renunciation of heroics for slope-tending is earned and costly.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the greenhouse tuned to “half light and half hours” reweights all prior beats under the “slope not cliff” rule; cost is the forfeiture of full restoration and of heroic narrative. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of dust, tape, and slow decay—taught by line 8 and held without lapse. Orientation is anchored by word 40 (“storm-damaged greenhouse”). No causal break; even the butterfly-wing map is prepared by “lepidopteran air.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Greenhouse micro-setting is protagonist’s instrument: every cracked pane, silt-white bench, and stone-weighted notebook sheet constrains the triage choices. Butterfly-wing dust is a recurring object whose bronze refusals guide which frames to replace; final image of dust lifting through taped cracks recharges the map metaphor. Spatial choreography is immaculate—river outside, trays numbered, eastern panes flagged. Environment directly shapes the “gradual change” tactics; without these specifics the slope strategy collapses.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—save the greenhouse without drama—tightens once: the decision to reopen at half-capacity forever forecloses full restoration. Pressure accumulates through each salvaged notebook page and taped crack; cost is visible in the half-light schedule and in the composting of dead orchids. No reversal, but the deepening is decisive under Accumulative lens. The “slope” principle turns decay into a partner, narrowing later options to patient increments only.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: decay as pedagogy, patience as scientific method. Butterfly dust reprises as both forensic data and cosmic script, linking neutron-star spin-down to greenhouse triage. Final image of humble star refuses triumphal recovery, reweighting heroism itself. No moralizing; the theme is lived, not told.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Voice is irreducibly specific: scientific register braided with salt-taste lyricism—“riverbeds left in the air,” “closed wild arithmetic.” Syntax mirrors the POV’s data habits: clauses stack like spectra, then cut to terse reports. No head-hop; psychic distance tightens under pressure (“I tape the worst cracks…”). Dialogue-free design is chosen and coherent; prose itself carries subtext and rhythm.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm alternates between long, neutron-catalogue clauses and abrupt horticultural commands, echoing the slope/cliff tension. No scaffold or synonym loops; each line adds new information or sensorial tilt. Metaphors stay physically consistent—star decay ↔ orchid rot—no mixed vehicles. Minor over-adjectival moment (“faint bronze that refuses to be scrubbed”) is paid off by its later functional use as wind-map.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Premise—astrophysicist rebuilding greenhouse via stellar patience—feels inevitable, not gimmicky. Butterfly-wing dust as forensic ink is a fresh, non-obvious instrument. Risk of quiet, anti-heroic ending is taken and lands; no familiar recovery arc is followed. Specificity of “half light and half hours” could not survive name/place swap, satisfying transformation test.</comment>
