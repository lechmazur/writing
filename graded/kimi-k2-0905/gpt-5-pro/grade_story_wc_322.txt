<comment>Mara’s contradictory impulses—using geometry to hide from love while secretly yearning for connection—are dramatized in every beat: the careful metronome breath, the whispered knot, the final step along the curve. Her embodied shame and longing collide on the page, not in summary, and the renunciation of her old defensive rule-set is paid for by the public admission “geometry never protected her.”</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each threaded line thickens the pattern until the floor’s “atlas of paths” reweights the premise, offering Mara a visible, felt cost—the curve that lets her approach without impact. Closure is a Charged Poise: two strangers walk beside each other in an “agreed equation,” foreclosing the solitary path her gallery once enforced.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The gallery itself—mirrors that “discipline dreams into sentences,” stairs that ascend and descend at once—functions as both arena and tool, constraining every micro-choice. The sinew thread’s tacky resin and the floor’s “skin remembering touch” provide tactile specificity that charges the final image of re-approach.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Pressure escalates by density and pattern-break: each threaded line tightens the optical rules until the arena forces strangers to rehearse “the grammar of regard.” The cost is legible when Mara herself must step onto the floor she built and face the stranger wearing her “exile’s smile,” trading control for vulnerability.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: rational enchantment mutates into emotional risk, proven by the curve that lets love approach without collision. The final image re-prices the premise—math is no kinder than people, but attention can be—delivering resonance through the frost-pattern floor that “composes itself” from shared breath.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The lyric third-person voice carries a perceptual signature attuned to angles, resin, and echo; syntax warps like the exhibits (“angles conversed with shadows”). No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks; compression under pressure is taught early and paid off in the whispered knot that “erupts knowing.”</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Rhythm modulates from long, hypnotic sentences to the staccato of “step, pause, shake hands, let go,” mirroring the arena’s instructions. One mixed metaphor—“whispers erupt knowing”—is earned by the surreal frame; no loops or scaffold, high density, and the final line lands clean.</comment>

<grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The optical-love test is fresh: a gallery that argues gently until it listens back. The premise is fully inhabited—every illusion serves the emotional proof that attention can be geometric yet tender. Risky lyric structure stays legible under the Accumulative lens, and the frost-pattern payoff feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
