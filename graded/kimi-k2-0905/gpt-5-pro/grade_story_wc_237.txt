<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is lush and embodied; the scholar’s trembling hand, sugar-pebble offering, and wrist-scar count manifest contradictory impulses under ritual pressure. Micro-choices (whispering kite names, pressing sugar) directly tilt the lattice and cost is visible when scars warm into “tiny harbors.” Voice stays individual, though Elder Nam functions more as oracle than second pressure source. Just shy of 9 because the hinge realization—“bridges not cures”—is slightly over-articulated versus sensed.

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each sensory layer (steam film, frost, hinge rune) thickens until the final image reweights the premise—stories become portable, scars become shoreline. Closure lands as Charged Poise: bronze tea islands reflect new buoyancy; cost is felt in the held-breath ache and the quill that “wants to carry.” No orientation drift; anchors arrive by line 5. Persistent constraint—the held breath—shapes every tactical pause.

<comment>Floating rock platform and stormleaf lattice act as micro-setting that physically constrains inscription: tilt shifts with wind, crystallization blocks or releases the rune. Sensory selection obeys POV bias—tea surface is “thin porcelain horizon,” scars are “five heartbeats flat.” Weather is not backdrop but active pressure front that postpones its argument. Final image reuses platform motion to embody new weight/buoyancy balance.

<comment>Dominant stake—transform scars into stories—tightens when frost chokes first rune, forcing sugar offering and superstition revisit. Each rune stroke is a visible trade-off: hesitation crystallizes lattice; grandmother memory loosens it; hinge question opens door at cost of breath. No external antagonist; pressure is weather + internal fear of traps. Price is legible in silver ache and scars warming to harbors.

<comment>Theme emerges from concrete returns: kites, sugar, scars, harbors—each re-weighted without moralizing. Subtext carried in gesture (tap-twice-once mercy) and object silence (tea listening). Final image of bronze tea islands offers conceptual re-pricing: stories are not cure but coastline. No thesis stated; ambiguity lingers about future storms.

<comment>First-person perceptual signature is consistent: “saturated hush that tasted like rain,” “narrow kiss that would not splutter.” Syntax mirrors breath control—long clauses held, then release. Elder Nam’s dialogue is concise, ritual, distinct from narrator’s lyric idiom. No head-hopping; psychic distance contracts under breath constraint and expands at hinge door.

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>High density: each sentence layers action, image, and stakes without scaffold. Metaphors are coherent—tea as cliff-hearer, lattice as frost stress—and stay within physical logic. Rhythm varies: fragments under breath-hold, longer release at thunder. Minor loop “held breath / breath” repeated but does not touch closure; otherwise zero paraphrase churn.

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Storm-responsive tea ceremony and rune-inscription-on-steam are fresh syntheses; not a trope checklist. Specificity of sugar pebble, kite-names, and wrist-count creates irreplaceable ritual. Risk taken in lyric accumulative structure pays off in hinge door image. Slight deduction for echo of “scars as maps/stories” motif familiar in trauma-lit, though crystallization mechanic refreshes it.
