<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The artist’s turn from furnace-roar to “listening between” is fully embodied; every beat of the trek through frost and kiln is a micro-choice that re-prices his hands’ relation to heat. The final decision to cast a glass “river of rest” is earned by the kiln’s low hum and the mentor’s off-stage authority, with the ledger strip as tangible cost. Internal contradiction is alive in the same breath that wants both quiet and luminosity. No safety-hedging: he carries literal ash of the crime into the new making.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a crisp Resonant Reconfiguration: the kiln re-ignites and the glass piece re-weights the arson from warning to invitation. Causal lens holds throughout—because the fire happened, therefore the canyon is entered, therefore the kiln speaks back—ending in a Charged Poise where the cost is the artist’s acceptance of smugglers possibly tracing the route. The ledger-frost alignment beat (p.4) is the visible hinge that teaches the pattern. No orientation debt: who/where/when anchored by line 10.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The frost’s “quiet cartography” and the kiln’s “throat clogged with fused sand” are tactile, choice-guiding specifics, not postcard garnish. Environment literally gates entry: frost etch → hidden door → kiln, each constraining footfall timing. Small-object pressure: the brittle ledger strip’s bolt-pattern is a literal key. Final image of “stars cooled above like unlit kilns” recycles the setting into conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—artistic survival after murder attempt—tightens when the kiln offers a second furnace that could also kill. One meaningful deepening: the discovery that the mentor once worked here turns the smugglers’ hideout into a clandestine atelier, narrowing the artist’s moral options. Visible price: the scorched ledger is traded for a new glass map, forfeiting anonymity. Escalation is steady under Causal lens; no coincidence resolves the threat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as “testament = what fire writes twice”: the artist finishes the mentor’s interrupted score rather than expose the smugglers. Subtext is carried by silence—ledger margins, kiln throat, frost pauses—never lectured. Final image re-prices ash from evidence to medium, achieving Conceptual Repricing without moralizing. Complexity is kept: the crossing route still serves fugitives, including possibly the artist.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Lyrical first-person sustains a glass-blower’s perceptual signature—heat timings, negative space, “cooling” as positive state—without drifting into poetry-slam. Syntax swells and contracts like breath: long sentence for valley exhale, fragment for frost vein. No head-hop; distance stays shallow and sensorial. Register stays artisanal; “furnaces once roared like small suns” is the most elevated phrase and is earned by craft pride.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm alternates between valley-long exhales and crystalline fragments that mimic cooling cracks. No scaffold loops or synonym churn; each metaphor extends the glass/heat lexicon. One mixed-metor risk—“clusters of blackened crates leaned like folded wings”—but image stays physically coherent. Information density high: one sentence often layers geography backstory and emotional temperature.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: smugglers’ charcoal tunnel repurposed as clandestine glass studio turns crime logistics into sacred art forge. Risk of lyric mosaic is embraced early and paid off by the frost → ledger → glass score continuity. Specificity of pearled-sand inscription and bolt-pattern ledger feels discovered, not invented for prompt. Conceptual integrity: refuses to hand villains to police, keeping focus on artistic continuance.</comment>
