<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The tester’s “credibly curious” nature is dramatized through tactile micro-choices—threading sensors into hemp, switching to whisper-alert, lowering leather mufflers—each action embodying the listening creed; the internal contradiction (duty to test vs. refusal to blast) is kept alive in scene, and the final renunciation costs him official credit, felt in the rope’s “unstartled sway.”</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>A single causal arc—glue dries → wind signs → switch to standby—lands a Decisive Change with conceptual cost: the city’s safety is re-priced through silence, not sirens; the lens is causal throughout, no teleporting props, and the zero-hour tension tightens options until the final image reconfigures the premise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The bell rope functions as micro-setting: its fray, tension, and final “clean, unstartled sway” constrain every tactical choice; wind direction, rime dust, and pressure ticks are filtered through the POV’s instruments, guiding the mute switch that resolves the stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>One dominant stake—mountain wind vs. city protocol—tightens once: the downdraft forecast forces the switch to standby, foreclosing the decibel test with visible professional cost; escalation is coherent, no coincidence, and the price is on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the silent test: listening as civic duty; no moralizing—meaning crystallizes in the final image of the bell rope’s quiet sway, reweighting “zero hour” from spectacle to attention; the solstice hush becomes the earned ethical stance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>First-person voice carries a precise, instrument-laden diction that never slips; perceptual signature is obsessed with micro-tensions, wind grains, and sensor hums; rhythm tightens under pressure—“the storm split with the dignity of a river finding two beds”—and closure keeps the lyric cadence without expositional dump.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Varied sentence lengths mirror wind gusts; no scaffold loops, no mixed metaphors; “pale veins waiting for a pulse” is the single ornate image, paid off by the rope’s later pulse-free stillness; high density, zero clarity drag.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Storm-siren tester who cancels the test to *listen* is fresh; the bell rope as weather antenna and ethical witness reconfigures a familiar mountain-top setting; risk—quiet climax in lieu of blare—pays off with felt cost, making silence the heroic act.</comment>
