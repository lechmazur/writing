<comment>The indexer’s quiet, methodical resolve is credibly particularized; the refusal to let “rage propel the index” embodies a hierarchy of values under pressure. Interior contradiction is present but thin—no moment shows him tempted by revenge, so the renunciation feels preemptive rather than earned in-scene. The micro-choice to leave the chalk arrow pointing “toward beginnings” crystallizes his stance, yet the cost is more symbolic than viscerally felt.</comment>

<comment>Causal chain holds: blackout → quiet → detectable print defect → ledger reordering → proof. Orientation is swift and atmospheric; only the harbor-judge link is told-not-shown, a minor causality wrinkle. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the re-ordering of ledgers and the arrow reweight the library’s future meaning; the cost is the indexer’s acceptance that truth will stay submerged until someone else follows the arrow.</comment>

<comment>The drowned library is rendered through salt-furred spines, algae veins, domed avenues—selective, tactile, choice-guiding details. The brass stamp’s serrated crescent is micro-setting at its best: a grain-level flaw that decides authenticity. Spatial choreography is clean; the headlamp thread, shutter-battering drone, and chalk arrow all track. The environment’s damp silence literally enables the acoustic detection of forgery, so setting constrains tactics and charges the final image.</comment>

<grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—restore truth without becoming the revenge he disavows—is signaled early and tightened when the smooth-crescent forgeries point to the family-linked judge. One meaningful deepening: the indexer re-orders ledgers by image rather than alphabet, narrowing options to moral, not clerical, logic. Cost is present but muted: the personal vindication stays shelved, the public exposure deferred—an intellectual rather than visceral price.</comment>

<comment>Truth versus complicity emerges through concrete particulars: salt crescents, kelp-eyed stamps, the arrow that reclaims the room for thought. No explicit moralizing; the final image of queued pages speaks for itself. The theme accepts complexity—justice is indexed, not delivered—and invites reflection on how civic memory survives systemic lies. A slight over-cleanness in the indexer’s emotional victory keeps it from top band.</comment>

<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>First-person diction is scholarly, oceanic, quietly obsessive: “brine tick like a slow metronome,” “thread of milk over spines.” Syntax lengthens under contemplation, then shortens when stamping proof—rhythmic control mirrors attention. No filter-verb fat; perception is salt-scored brass and paper grit. Voice never drifts into generic thriller austerity; it stays the indexer’s lucid, aquatic murmur.</comment>

<grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet limber: one sentence can anchor time, body, and tool (“I inked the stamp… counting grains embedded by age”). Figurative layering occasionally risks purple (“algae stars”) but pattern is taught early and remains legible. No loops or scaffold; each clause advances knowledge or texture. A single mixed metaphor—“dappled resolve flowing over stone”—barely grazes closure, so artifact penalty is minor.</comment>

<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Forgery-detection via microscopic stamp-wear is a fresh procedural angle; coupling it with drowned-archivist quietude feels inevitable in hindsight. The kelp-frond motif evolves from civic seal to surveillance eye—an organic symbol that accretes rather than decorates. Risk is taken in staging an almost motionless mystery, trusting stillness to carry stakes; the gamble pays off through sensory precision and conceptual reweighting. Not quite revelatory, but memorable and un-gimmicked.</comment>
