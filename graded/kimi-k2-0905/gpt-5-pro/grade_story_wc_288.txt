<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The narrator’s isolation-to-independence arc is embodied through concrete micro-choices (angling the sundial, reshelving knowledge) and carries a visible cost—the cold ledger memory that “tried to drown me.” Tone: None functions as an earned emotional anesthesia, not a label. The vow at climax is credible, but interiority occasionally drifts toward abstract self-diagnosis (“poor trustee of future continents”) that blurs immediate contradiction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the final image of the sundial left on the threshold reweights every prior tide-pull under an Accumulative/Textural lens. The ledger memory provides a sharp tightening beat that forecloses reunion-fantasy. Causality stays coherent—each hum-rise is triggered by the sundial’s angle—so the lens holds. Cost is unmistakable in the brass darkening to “late tea,” a conceptual repricing of reflection itself.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Environment, body, and tool form one micro-setting: the brass sundial literally steers the library’s tides and is finally placed as beacon—an 8.8+ gate pass. Cloudlight on atomically reflective brass constrains every navigation choice. Spatial choreography is crystal: shelves drift shoreward or open passages in lockstep with hum pitch. Sensory economy favors haptic and auditory cues (creaking grain, wet-lipped spines) over visual excess.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Single dominant stake—translate isolation into independence—tightens when the ledger memory confronts the narrator with “shell without creature.” That beat narrows options: no resurrection, only coexistence. Agency remains with the protagonist (tuning hum, vow witnessed) so escalation is earned. Cost is legible in the brass color shift and the wind-door’s final seal, though the absence of external antagonist keeps pressure interior and slightly diffuse.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges without thesis: extinction, memory, and the ethics of non-attachment crystallize in the image of faces “recalling me without demanding return.” Subtext lives in gesture-foam and the kelp ledger’s silent rise. No moral is stated; resonance is charged by the sundial’s color shift that reweights every earlier reflection. The refusal to dramatize reunion avoids sentimental ghost-making and lets complexity linger.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice owns a distinct perceptual signature: salt-sapped emotion, tidal syntax, and a lexicon of geothermal grammar. Compression is taught early (“sky seemed discontinuous”) and paid off in the final “breathing felt borrowed.” No head-hopping; POV remains strictly interior. Register stays within the narrator’s plausible diction; even “atomically reflective” reads as precise tool-description, not authorial showing-off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “shelves drifted shoreward; when it sank, passages opened” compresses causality and motion in one breath. Figurative layering is purposeful—metaphors of tide, shell, tea cohere around liquidity and residue. Minor template cadence in three successive “I”-led sentences mid-story, but artifact never touches closure. Rhythm modulates with tide-rise urgency; final paragraph shortens sentences to mimic ebb.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Premise—floating library whose stacks breathe with tide and hum—is non-obvious yet fully embodied. Sundial-as-tuning-mirror transforms a familiar antiquarian prop into navigational instrument and memory prism. Risk in using “Tone: None” as emotional negative space pays off: it prevents nostalgic self-indulgence and reweights solitude as stance. Synthesis of paleontology, bibliomancy, and solastalgia feels inevitable, not gimmicked.</comment>
