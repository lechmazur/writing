<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The protagonist’s contradictory impulses—yearning for frontier yet fencing it—are dramatized through embodied micro-choices: clenching the gear, whistling the forest’s alloyed winds, finally biting the gear like a broken key. Interiority stays concrete, never drifts into label-speak; the “wild frontier” is felt as mouth-blood. The final renunciation (chewing the gate-tooth) forecloses return with visible cost under the Accumulative lens, satisfying the 9+ quick test. Only the faintest gestalt poverty in the masked figures keeps it shy of 9.0.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the mirror shows the frontier as self-imposed cage; chewing the gear reweights the entire quest from search to self-consumption, cost legible in the oil-taste on tongue. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each metallic tree timbre layers until the chord bridge forms, tightening knowledge rather than causal plot. Orientation is taught by deliberate disorientation that pays off when the tower’s throat lifts the narrator. No telegraphing or amnesia; every sleep-jump is a patterned beat that accrues toward the final tonal chord.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The mechanical rainforest is not backdrop but antagonist: its “coinlight” and “turbine bones” constrain movement, force spiral paths, and supply the tower’s caliper slot. Sensory hierarchy obeys POV—sound is primary, vision oily—so setting guides choice (cannot walk straight, must listen). The small gear micro-setting charges the final image when bitten. Spatial choreography remains clean across translocations; geography is remembered by timbre, never lost.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—rediscover the wild frontier—tightens when the mirror reveals the frontier is self-fenced. Escalation is textural: each new alloy wind adds timbral density, narrowing the method to sonic proof. Cost is visible: the gear drawn from his own gate becomes literal tooth-break. One meaningful intensification suffices under Accumulative lens; no reversal overload.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</question><comment>Theme emerges from the inverse relation between openness and enclosure: the more he listens, the more the forest compresses into self. Subtext lives in sound—metallic leaves clatter like distant trains—never explained. Final image (chewing the sunrise-seed) offers non-literal answer: frontier is inside the mouth that names it. No sermon, only tasted iron.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</question><comment>First-person lyric voice sustains perceptual signature: every metaphor is filtered through mechanical-aural obsession (“fern cogs unfurl like clockwork tongues”). Rhythm modulates with pressure—short clause bursts under canopy, long harmonic ropes at tower. No head-hop; elision of travel is taught early and paid off. Diction stays within plausible philosopher-poet lexicon without register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</question><comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; no template cadence. Figurative density is high but patterned—each metal tree gets its own timbre—so never obscures causality. Information density is excellent: “currants of sound braid beneath the canopy” does three jobs (taste, motion, sound). Minor scaffold: “open to and fro” is near-paraphrase, but it sits in a low-pressure beat and does not touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><question>9.3</question><comment>Premise fuses cyber-myth with sonic ontology—machined rainforest that remembers footfalls—yet grounds it in sensory particulars. Synthesis feels inevitable: the gear is both mechanical and seed, sunrise and rust. Risk of tower-as-vending-machine is averted by demanding sonic proof rather than simple insertion. Voice, concept, and closure cohere into a singular stance; no close echoes.</comment>
