<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The diver’s contradictory urges—ascend vs. stay, panic vs. surrender—are rendered in embodied micro-choices (stilling the fins, letting the sea “adopt” the body). The mother-memory operates as a living spur, not backstory filler, and the final renunciation (turning down O₂ to keep the bridge unbroken) carries an unflinching, on-page cost. Interiority avoids diagnostic labels; instead, hush and salt braid thought. Only the slightest hedge keeps this from 9+: the vial’s later handling is more symbol than fresh choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Accumulative/lyric lens: the narrative layers sensory “particles” of hush until they collapse into a Conceptual Repricing—the vial’s broadcast reframes radios city-wide. The closure unit lands when the protagonist taxes his own breath to keep that fragile bridge intact; cost is visible in the literal O₂ dial turn. Orientation is taught early via the metallic syllables pinging through blue, so the later dissolved coordinates feel earned, not disorienting. No causal cheats—every turn grows from either the net snare or the override of instinct.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The temple is not backdrop but pressure mechanism: silver air-pockets stroke the helmet, coral steps force slow motion, netting snarls agency. Micro-setting (the transmitter grill, the anemone-mouth altar) directly shapes the climax—only that grill can “read” the perfume aloud. Sensory hierarchy obeys crisis: counts drop, gauges shout, vision narrows to filament and shell. Final image of winter-sun-tasting water re-weights the entire city’s atmosphere, proving environment-to-concept success.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—deliver memory to the surface—tightens when the net turns the beacon inward, forcing a choice: break free and lose the vial, or stay still and pay in breath. The single meaningful tightening (stop kicking, ascend later) forecloses the immediate-escape option and visibly prices the O₂ reserve. No coincidence; pressure is coherent under the Accumulative lens. Cost could be slightly sharper if we felt one numeric tick of remaining minutes, but the hush-bridge trade-off remains legible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme—memory as transmissible, breathable medium—emerges through the vial’s translation into radio bloom; no character sermonizes. The hush motif accrues rather than repeats: from metallic pings to sleeping-animal silence to perfume frequency, each return reweights meaning. The city’s unpictured pause is implied, not asserted, letting the reader finish the conceptual arc. Final winter-sun taste offers a non-moral, sensory answer: grief can attenuate, but only if someone pays a breath-tax to keep the channel open.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>First-person lyric voice sustains a perceptual signature built on liquid consonants and oceanic syntax—long sentences that swell, break, settle. Compression (“a heartbeat turned to numbers”) is taught early and paid off when numbers become hush. No head-hopping; lexicon stays diver-bound (“fins,” “gauges,” “comm”). Rhythm modulates with panic—short clauses when cords bite, then elongates during stillness. Distinctive without ornament overload; the dive-comms jargon integrates as natural idiom.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Sentence variety and information density are high; most lines fuse sensory, emotional, and conceptual work. Occasional metaphor stacks (“choir guarding a candle”) flirt with overwriting but pattern holds and serves cadence. No loops or scaffolding; pronouns and props track cleanly. A single mixed image—“hawk tightening claws on its own legs”—momentarily violates underwater physics, but the intent is self-harm analogy, not literal fauna. Ear-test reads aloud with propulsive musicality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Familiar trope—drowned temple, sirenesque hush—gets remixed through radio perfumery: memory atomized into transmittable scent-frequency. The vial’s reprise at climax feels inevitable yet non-obvious, a conceptual repricing that retroactively charges the mother’s fog jars. Specific detail (barnacle-gilded net, scalloped pillars) prevents postcard genericism. Risk—lyric accumulative structure in a rescue-frame—pays off by letting silence, not gunshot, end the story. Transformation test fails if relocated to land; salt and circuitry are inextricable.</comment>
