<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interior contradiction is vivid—spy’s need to “fix what’s broken” collides with the knowledge that the burn erased his tether; the coil-from-pillbox micro-choice embodies that split. Embodied emotion is sustained: thumb on fern engraving, jaw scars, heartbeat counted against thaw. Final renunciation—accepting he must go where Mina cannot—carries visible cost under the causal lens. Voice stays particular, never drifts into label-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the protagonist finishes soldering the radio, foreclosing reunion with Mina; cost is legible in “you will go where she cannot.” Causal chain holds: pillbox cipher → snow writing → stranger’s vouchsafe → coil transplant → radio speaks. Orientation is anchored by word 80 (“zephyr bluff in mist”). No lens ambiguity; causality drives every beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Bluff, wind-scoured snow, and the pillbox as micro-setting constrain every move: the snow is the parchment, the wind the eraser, the hut’s missing coil the final gate. Weather is not backdrop but medium—wind smooths codes, cliff wind “stitches skin.” Spatial choreography is clean: kneel, write, rise, path, hut, solder. Environment directly shapes the climax—without the snow surface the cipher fails—meeting 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can unused courage still answer when called—tightens when the stranger reveals the tether is severed; option space narrows to solitary repair. One meaningful escalation: apology line scraped in snow converts covert gesture into irreversible commitment. Cost is felt: “burn that marked you erased your tether.” Pressure stays causal under lens; no coincidence resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the recursive “fixing what’s broken” arc: spy repairs radio yet must accept the unfixable relational break. Final image—radio speaking through static—reweights the premise: courage is not reunion but transmission into void. Subtext in stranger’s bruise-smile and pillbox heartbeat carries the emotional aftereffect. No moralizing; resonance is purely imagistic.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>First-person perceptual signature is consistent: silver hush, careful hand, small clock tapping—idiosyncratic, never generic. Syntax lengthens under lyric pressure yet stays controlled; no head-hopping. Compression (“lighter without his coat”) is taught early and paid off. Dialogue line “you always were prudently daring” carries subtext of shared history without exposition dump.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence runs. Figurative language is selective—wind as careful hand, smile like a bruise—never clutters high-pressure beats. Information density is high: aspirin + coil reveal in one breath. Minor loop: “codes in accumulated snow” phrase repeated; does not obscure causality or closure, so −0.2 only.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: cold-war spy tropes filtered through eco-poetic cipher of fern-vein radio repair. Nursery-rhyme dead-drop and snow-writing feel inevitable yet new. Risk in lyric compression heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Transformation test fails if pillbox fern or snow cipher removed—story collapses.</comment>
