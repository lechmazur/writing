<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The trainer’s grief for Mara and his refusal to trust again are embodied in the micro-choice of steadying the capsule with the meteorite—an action that shows both risk and cost. The contradictory impulse to refuse yet help Ezra plays in scene, not summary. The final willingness to keep the “ledger of safe returns” crystallizes earned endurance with visible cost. Minor slip: the interior tag “I wanted to refuse” edges toward label-speak before the attic “asked me otherwise.”</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the pink ticket stub + six bars reweights trust and song, the meteorite’s gravity still in the capsule, cost felt. Causal chain holds: because Ezra brings the melody, therefore the trainer risks Thimble; because Thimble returns, the ledger re-opens. One tight transition (storm → night → return) is legible. No orientation debt; attic, skylight, and pigeons are anchored by line 3. Lens: Causal throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The attic’s cedar drawers, dust spirals, and blooming-withering smell constrain every decision—capsule packing, bird selection, even memory retrieval. The meteorite chip functions as micro-setting/tool that literally steadies the scale and metaphorically steadies the trainer; its cold red fleck reappears inside the returned capsule, charging the final image. Spatial choreography is flawless: narrow stairs, cedar drawers, skylight well, window release. Sensory hierarchy obeys POV—bookpaste scent rises only when rain prompts confession.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve lost songs vs. self-preservation—tightens once: the trainer’s refusal softens when the melody overlaps Mara’s intervals, forcing the launch. Cost is visible: trust reopened, shoebox shards exposed, meteorite now airborne. No reversal, but one meaningful deepening suffices at this length. Agency sits in the capsule knot and the ledger vow afterward.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from sustained image pattern: paper trails as both songlines and snares—ledger pages, onionskin, ticket stub—each a fragile map of trust. The final “ledger of safe returns” reweights the premise: archives can be habitats, not only traps. No explicit moralizing; the ticket stub + six bars are the non-literal answer. Subtext in Ezra’s “practiced fear” and the trainer’s silent handing-over of the frame carries the emotional argument.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical first-person interiority sustains a distinct perceptual signature: “the attic breathes in a tone I can only name blooming withering.” Syntax mirrors bird-flight: long accumulative clauses, then abrupt release “a dark seed thrown into sky.” No head-hopping; POV stays tightly bound to trainer’s body and memory. Compression in “numbers were finding him” teaches the reader the anti-digital stakes without exposition.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Rhythmic control is acute: paragraph lengths visually mimic wingbeats—short for launch, long for vigil, short for landing. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances knowledge or image. Figurative density spikes only at the climactic release and is paid off by the return scuff. Minor register lift in “arithmetic of maps” fits the POV’s bookish lexicon.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The courier-pigeon attic archive is a fresh synthesis of retro-tech and grief ritual; the meteorite as counterweight is an unforeseen yet inevitable tool. Risk in lyric ellipse is rewarded: the vanished Mara remains a negative space whose outline is traced by melody and meteorite. Transformation test fails if swapped to email or drones—the tactile paper and bird anatomy are essential. The pink ticket stub reprise feels both surprising and pre-inscribed.</comment>
