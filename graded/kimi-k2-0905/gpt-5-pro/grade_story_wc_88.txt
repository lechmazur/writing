<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The narrator’s contradiction—“clean slate seeker with a dirty past”—is dramatized in embodied micro-choices: cupping guilt-lit water, steering by a scuffed baseball’s spin, confessing the arson while watching the lake bruise brightness. Interiority stays concrete and character-specific; no therapy-speak intrudes. The final stance—ribs “practicing hinges”—is a credible renunciation that forecloses absolution yet accepts cost. Only the brother thread is named, not staged, so status dynamics remain off-page; this caps the score at 8.7.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the fountain spray reweights civic indifference with undeniable social cost when strangers twitch toward empathy. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each ripple-pattern reconfigures meaning rather than causal plot. Orientation is taught by deliberate disorientation (negative-space coordinates, labyrinth tunnels) that pays off in the final cartographic ripple; no penalty applied. The vial’s “nervous bird” pulse is the visible price image; lens and cost cohere.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The bioluminescent lake is not backdrop but hydraulic conscience: its halos print fingerprints the narrator can’t scrub, its algae choir heats ribs, its vial constrains later urban tactics. Spatial choreography is clean—skiff-to-skiff mid-lake, eddies matching ball seams—bodies track without drift. Micro-setting (the baseball’s spin as compass) charges the exit map. One 9+ gate met: environment constrains tactical choice and charges the fountain finale.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“kindle empathy where none remains”—tightens when confession becomes literal currency; the lake’s receipt system forecloses lying without paying story. One meaningful deepening suffices under Accumulative lens: each luminous ripple increases density of moral cost until fountain release. Agency is renunciation rather than victory; price is visibly felt. No secondary reversal required; score reflects single but powerful reweighting.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from negative space—newspaper gaps, lake margins, rib hinges—never sermonized. The final image of child-drawn ripples reconfigures “delicately robust” civic repair without moral tag. Subtext operates in gesture (cupping guilt-light, ribs opening/shutting). No thematic echo penalty; no tidy binaries imposed.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>First-person voice carries a jaded-perceptual signature: “ink thin as the lake’s blue veins,” “humming matrix of stone-bred patience.” Syntax waxes lyrical yet stays legible; patterned elision (“do not trust headlines, but the gaps”) is taught early and paid off in ripple-reading. No head-hopping; distance stable. Dialogue minimal but distinct when present (sentinel woman’s terse trade). Rhythmic control heightens pressure without purple drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Prose density is high—each sentence layers image, metaphor, and forward motion: “oars feathered rings of light, margins around sentences I could almost read.” No synonym loops or template cadence detected; metaphors stay internally coherent. One mixed image (“jaded wonder climbing my throat like smoke that forgot whether to warn or warm”) is allowed under lyric license. Final third clean; artifact-free, sustaining 9+ eligibility.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The erased-memory/procedure trope is refreshed by coupling it to bioluminescent empathy-banking; the baseball-map signed by a time-traveler becomes a moral compass rather than gimmick. Negative-space navigation via newspapers inverts familiar noir clue-finding into civic repair. Conceptual risk—urban fountain as empathy dispersal—pays off without gimmickry. Specificity (“lake keeps receipts longer than courts”) makes the synthesis feel inevitable.</comment>
