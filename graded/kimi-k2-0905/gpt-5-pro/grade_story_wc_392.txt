<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The narrator’s “fortified vulnerability” is lived-in: every beat of lantern-lit noticing, stopwatch timing, and glove-on-hinge grit shows a mind trained to measure yet haunted by inherited light. The choice to unclip the earpiece and phone the union/journalist crystallizes a value hierarchy we have watched form in real time; the cost—career suicide—is legible in the sudden silence that falls after the director’s voice hits the ballast. Interior contradiction pulses throughout (“I stay watchfully calm” while memories braid tighter), satisfying the 9+ test, yet the great-grandmother’s line about “password that trains could not read” drifts toward inherited wisdom rather than freshly embodied pressure, preventing the final 0.2.</comment>

<comment>Causal chain is ironclad: because the retrofit control module was sealed remotely, the grate stayed shut; therefore three men died; therefore the investigator discovers corrosion + nepotism; therefore she cuts the director’s feed and files the unerasable report. Closure lands as Decisive Change with felt cost—her stepping into “my own signal” beneath moving trains—earned by every prior measurement and micro-choice. The lantern’s final placement at the junction box reprises the Underground-Railroad promise, reweighting the meaning of “tunnels can lead somewhere other than work” without breaking the because-therefore lens.</comment>

<comment>The cracked steel rib, tide-line of silt, and fingernail-deep gouges in the paint are not backdrop but evidence; each tactile detail constrains the investigator’s next crawl or photograph. Spatial choreography is flawless—wheel-scratches, hinge-grit, and hidden walkway angles are tracked while the stopwatch ticks. The lantern itself serves as micro-setting: its shifting circle on the wall literally reveals the secret egress, fusing object and environment into one choice-forcing surface.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—truth vs. career survival—tightens when the corroded module tagged “last week” is discovered; options collapse from “report maybe” to “report now” as the nepotism watermark surfaces. The 23-heartbeat flood window plus 9-second lung sprint dramatizes cost in lungs and seconds, making the preventable death visceral. Escalation is agency-driven: each empirical observation (torque on stripped bolt, wire unclipped, calls made) widens the gap between the city’s tidy narrative and the investigator’s unerasable version.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: inherited moral technology (lantern) collides with modern bureaucratic murder; the ending reconfigures “underground railroad” from historical rescue to present-day whistle-blowing. The final image—lantern flame beside junction box while trains pass overhead—offers a charged, non-literal answer: light still reroutes systems, but at the price of riding the same rails that kill. No moral is declared; the silence after the director is cut supplies the repricing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Perceptual signature is razor-sharp: “rusted echo like a coin spinning in a dry cup,” “brown mistakes painted in silt,” “wire falls to the ballast” all filter through an investigator who thinks in evidence and timecode. Syntax tightens under pressure—fragments like “Twenty-three heartbeats” mirror the stopwatch. No head-hop; psychic distance stays inside the investigator’s calibrated lens while external behavior (calm gait, steady voice) contradicts the interior braid of memory and duty.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>High-density lines carry triple duty: “tide line of silt that paints the mistakes in brown” shows cause, atmosphere, and moral indictment in one stroke. Rhythm breathes—long sentences for crawl-space scrutiny, staccato for flood countdown. Only micro-slips: “stubborn heartbeat” on the mantel edges toward inherited-wisdom shorthand, and “iron, mud, and old promises” leans list-like, but these do not obstruct the closure image or causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Fusing OSHA-style forensic procedural with Underground-Railroad mythos is fresh; the lantern as evidentiary tool rather than symbol transforms the trope. Specificity—corrosion bloom, service tag, brother-in-law watermark—grounds the concept in municipal corruption rather than abstract evil. Risk is real: ending on an un-filed report plus phone calls to union/journalist could feel tidy, but the cost (career, safety, ancestral pressure) stays visible beneath rolling trains.</comment>
