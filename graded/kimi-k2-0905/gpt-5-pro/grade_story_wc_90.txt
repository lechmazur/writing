<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The pacifist oath is embodied in the refusal to let the warhead pry the lock; every micro-choice (threading filament, pricking thumb, breathing the door open) externalizes the creed. Interior contradiction pulses in the admission of past bruises given and received, and the final bargain—to hold what cannot be healed—costs the narrator the illusion of personal absolution. The child’s weight on the cot strap literalizes stakes; the voice never drifts into self-congratulation. One hairline slip: “ghostly resolve” is abstract label-speak amid otherwise visceral embodiment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the breathing door stays open only while gentleness is practiced, a conceptual price legible in the final image. Causal chain holds—tear map → shadow work → stitch → yielded reality—each beat narrows options under pacifist constraint. Orientation is taught by line 3 (“recycled spaceship drifted among glinting scraps”) and anchors hold. No plot amnesia; the warhead’s earlier argument pays off when the narrator refuses impact and pays with patience instead.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The ship’s patchwork hull and sutured pipes physically constrain how the lock can be approached—no blast, only needle and thread. Micro-setting rule: the maintenance shaft becomes reachable only because joy lessens gravitational weight, turning ship geometry into tactical terrain. Kwan yin’s tear refracts starlight into coordinates, fusing sacred object and astrogation tool; its glassy fragility charges the final seam. Every described surface (museum glass, funerary scaffolds, waste-reclamation ring) is handled or pressed during the breach, so setting never sits inert.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—open the dimension without violence—tightens when the door puckers like scar tissue, resisting tenderness. One meaningful reversal: the narrator momentarily sees why the warhead argued, feels the seduction of force, then renounces it, foreclosing that path forever. Cost is visible: blood drop, forgiven memories left threaded in the plates, perpetual obligation to “keep doing the work.” Pressure escalates under pacifist lens; no coincidence resolves the lock.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the paradox that healing a torn cosmos requires first stitching one’s own ruptures; the final breathing room is literal and metaphorical. Subtext operates in gesture—threading filament through pipes equals suturing self—and in silence: the sleeping child is future witness, never spoken to. No moralizing line declares “gentleness is strength”; instead the pacifist’s bleeding thumb and trembling seam argue it. The photographs losing their salt in the distance reweights grief into admission price, a Conceptual Repricing that lands without exposition.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>First-person lyric texture sustains ghostly resolve through compressed syntax and spiritual diction (“roomness itself,” “catalog of caretakers”). Perceptual signature is devotional-materialist: sacred glass pressed to microetchings, laughter used as navigational correction. Rhythm modulates—long breathy sentences during drift, clipped fragments while stitching under pressure—without ever breaking pacifist quiet. No head-hop; interior access stays strictly bounded to narrator’s sensory and moral horizon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Line-level density is high: “reality yield like skin begging to be stitched closed again” fuses tactile and metaphysical in one stroke. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances either seam progress or emotional reckoning. Figurative language is disciplined—mixed metaphors appear only when narrator’s own logic frays (“door puckered like scar tissue”) and serve the moment’s strain. One near-overwrite: “lung that had forgotten air” skirts cliché, but the next clause grounds it in pressure gradient dialogue.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fusion of pacifist space opera with shadow-work mysticism feels inevitable yet unseen before; the stitch-as-FTL-drive is fresh without gimmickry. Trope transformation: the lone guardian trope becomes caretaker of both child and wounded dimension, complicating heroism. Risk—renouncing violence in a genre that usually climaxes in explosion—pays off narratively and thematically. Specificity of materials (museum glass, farm equipment, drowned temple dome) prevents abstraction and roots the cosmos in salvageable memory.</comment>
