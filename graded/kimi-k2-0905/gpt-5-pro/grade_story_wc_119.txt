<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Mei’s interiority is lyrically specific—“nudging what was already leaning,” “ledger inside your ribs”—and her orchestrator role is embodied through the micro-dot placement; the final renunciation of the booklet under the tea tin shows cost. Yet the arriving townsfolk remain sketches whose contradictory impulses are asserted rather than dramatized, so relationship pressure stays abstract.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The mosaic pattern is taught by the third shard, the closure is a clear Charged Poise—the beam re-keys the island’s shared secret into song—and the cost is legible in the extinguished wick and Mei’s surrender of the booklet. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens; each seeded fortune is a dot whose gathered light forces the communal stance crystallization.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The lighthouse lens, tea steam, and punctured fortunes act as micro-settings that constrain how the message can be revealed; the beam’s swing and the sea’s metronome provide tactile choreography. Weather and architecture are filtered through Mei’s orchestrator eye, charging the final image of the beam carrying the new key across black water.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The dominant stake—will the island admit its open secret—tightens when each punctured fortune enlarges through the Fresnel lens, foreclosing denial. Agency is collective rather than single-decision, but the visible price (constable’s empty palms, teacher’s swollen ledger, ferryman’s wind-burned shame) makes the cost legible on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the accretion of dots into legible community guilt and mercy; no character spells out a moral. The final image of steam as staff lines offers a resonant, non-literal answer: shared music replaces silence, reweighting the earlier “minor chord” without sermon.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The lyric third-person hovers close to Mei’s perceptual signature—“glass cathedral built for dots of light”—and sustains rhythmic control through patterned elision. No head-hopping occurs; the collective chorus is rendered through external gesture and image, keeping focalization clean.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and syntactic shape, propelling the accumulative design; figurative language is selective, never dense enough to stall momentum. Occasional poetic compression (“steam rose like staff lines”) is earned by the musical motif and lands cleanly at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The fortune-cookie oracle who weaponizes micro-dot spycraft to transpose a fishing village’s open secret into communal song is a fresh synthesis; the concept commits fully without retreat. Risky lyric compression is taught early and pays off in the final beam-carrying cadence, making the innovation feel inevitable rather than gimmicky.</comment>
