<comment>The twin-self is dramatized through embodied choices—pressing the card, speaking names aloud, accepting the automaton’s bargain—so interiority stays concrete. The final renunciation (leaving the ship with pockets of seeds) costs the forever-drift and is earned by the mirrored double stepping out; the contradiction between “trapped” and “freedom” is held in the body, not abstracted. Micro-choices (hand-steadied grammar, winding the barker) reveal value hierarchy under pressure. Voice specificity wobbles once: “diagnostic label-speak” sneaks in with “unkindled solace,” a coined abstraction that momentarily blurs embodied emotion.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the door within fog widens, crystallizing that the price for keeping the names is perpetual drift—trapped freedom—paid on the page (“We left the ship… unmoored yet guided”). Causal chain holds: emerald card → hinge consent → twin externalized → garden activation → departure with seeds. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are taught by line 3 and hold. Memory-as-clock tightens once (“as memories alter” sign flip) and narrows options without forcing causal gymnastics.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The rusted tilt-a-whirl planters, salt-lit mirror shards, and diesel-sugar air constrain every tactical move—climbing, seed gathering, foothold choices. The emerald card functions as micro-setting/tool that literally unlocks hinge and later recharges the final image in pocketed seeds. Spatial choreography is flawless: gangplank → funhouse slope → ballroom deck → porthole → fog door; no impossible positions. Sensory hierarchy skews tactile-rust, never tourist-catalog.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—recover forgotten names or lose self—signals in paragraph 3 and tightens when the automaton demands the twin be brought forth, foreclosing half-self access. Cost is visible: perpetual drift traded for naming, seeds pocketed, ship left “unmoored.” Agency remains split between selves but still forces the final leave-taking. No off-stage rescue; luck complicates (mirror twin externalized) without solving.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the concrete equation of naming = survival; no thesis sermonizes. Final image of drifting ship loaded with spoken names reweights earlier motifs (swatch, mirrors, garden) into conceptual cost: remembrance demands exile. Subtext lives in gesture—twin’s salt-lit laugh is the self’s earliest erased identity, not explained. Complexity holds: the bargain is necessary yet ruinous, avoiding tidy moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>First-person voice carries a consistent lyric-metallic diction—“rust sang a quiet metronome,” “salt and sawdust exhale”—that stays within a memory-hoarder’s lexicon. Psychic distance modulates once, pulling back for the barker’s rhyme without head-hop. Rhythm accelerates under mirror-slide pressure, then exhales at seed-pocket close. No filter-verb stacks; syntax stays sinuous yet clear.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Density is high: one sentence often layers metaphor, sensory data, and causal nudge—“We walked together, two freedoms tied, a trapped freedom that moved because we leaned.” No paraphrase loops or synonym churn. Mixed metaphors stay coherent within maritime-carnival logic. Final third is artifact-free, allowing 9-band proximity; earlier “unkindled solace” is the single abstract hiccup.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Forgotten-names-as-seeds sown on a derelict ride-garden is a fresh synthesis of memory-trove and carnival-gothic. The chimera-twin is not trope replication but internalized doppelgänger externalized by ship logic. Risk—lyric compression, mirrored parliament—pays off when closure reweights drift as map. Specificity makes the concept feel inevitable: any other setting would collapse the bargain.</comment>
