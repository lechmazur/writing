<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The broker’s caution, embodied handling of the vial, and final decision to open it show a credible arc from restraint to exposure; the tremor and “door swing behind my cheekbones” make grief bodily. Interior contradiction is present but stays largely abstract (“I had come to understand…”) rather than enacted in mid-scene beats. No secondary character pressures him, so status dynamics are N/A; Dr. Vale acts as facilitator, not opposing force. The choice to let the two scents meet costs him the buffered distance he clung to—earned stasis achieved—but motivation could be sharpened if aromatic caution visibly complicated an earlier tactical move.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: because the violet is timed to release at dusk, therefore the ultraviolet lantern is staged, therefore the memory-smoke is exposed, therefore the broker must decide. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—the vial’s oils re-weighted by UV inscription, grief priced as irreversible. Anchors clear by line 4; greenhouse geography tight. UV mechanics are set up early and paid off when glyphs flare; no late rule dumps. Cost is visible: broker loses aromatic shield, weeps on-page. One minor ellipsis: the curator’s shaking hand is mentioned only after the weeping, making the shared impact slightly retroactive rather than simultaneous.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The greenhouse glass ribs, humming fake suns, and frost-dust on extinct petals create an immediate, tactile micro-cosmos. “Crystal shadows” and “quiet birds” reappear to charge the final image, satisfying 9+ gate. Tool-as-setting: the UV lantern’s bruise-purple glow literally rewrites visible scent, constraining the climax. Spatial choreography is clean—vial on table, mask offered, smoke curling—no impossible moves.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can the broker remain aromatically insulated?—is signaled early (“I had come to understand why some smells trigger tears”). Escalation is accumulative/textural: each sensory layer (dust, UV hum, violet seam, smoke) tightens the noose of memory. The decisive tightening occurs when residual oils under UV force recognition, foreclosing the option of eternal caution. Cost is felt: the weeping is involuntary, the shield abandoned; could edge higher if earlier beats showed aromatic caution blocking a concrete opportunity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges as the price of sensory fidelity: to keep love’s trace is to keep grief’s trigger. Subtext operates through object handling—closed vial, trembling restraint, final uncapping—rather than exposition. The ending reframes “lanterns” from light to memory vessels without moralizing. Final line (“the greenhouse remembered how to be quiet”) offers quiet, charged poise; ambiguity lingers on whether quiet equals healing or extinction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</question><grade>Lyrical first-person maintains perceptual signature: narrator notices “grain of heat,” “sleeping lips” of petals, “cemetery of stars.” Syntax grows tighter under pressure—fragments (“I grieve”) replace longer rumination. No head-hopping; Dr. Vale’s interior is only inferred through gesture. Filter verbs minimal; metaphorical layering consistent and taught early (“lanterns that throw more than light”).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</question><comment>Rhythm alternates between lush cadence and stark fragments, mirroring inhalation/exhalation. High information density: one sentence can deliver occupation, tool function, and emotional cue (“tower lamp with fins for ultraviolet revealing, the ribs humming”). Figurative language is dense but patterned, avoiding mixed metaphors; “crystal shadows” returns to give closure coherence. Minor loop risk: “sealed like sleeping lips” + “sealed petals” + “sealed the plant” risks echo, but repetition feels thematic rather than accidental. No scaffold sentences; pronouns clean.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Fusing scent-extinction with grief-curation feels fresh; the engineered violet that weeps technicians is a sharply specific invention. Lantern-broker as occupation is particularized through UV tool and client philosophy, not just label. Conceptual integrity: follows olfactory science-fiction to its emotional end without flinching. One fresh intensification—UV making memory oils visible—reweights the premise in hindsight. Risk distinction +0.3 for trusting a quiet, sensory ending in a high-concept frame.</comment>
