<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The repairer’s interior contradiction—yearning to anchor ephemera while releasing Lina—drives every micro-choice; the leaf-loop calibrates both camera and grief, making the final “forgiveness” feel earned. Embodied emotion (“luminous ache in my ribs”) keeps interiority concrete. Cost is visible: letting go of Lina’s literal voice is the price of restoring time. Voice stays singular; no second character on page, so relationship bullets waived.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the governor seats, time steadies, but the narrator’s renunciation of Lina’s physical presence is the felt cost. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—leaf cadence reweights stakes rather than causal reversals. Orientation anchored by line 3; no drift. One meaningful tightening: leaf-loop reseats governor, foreclosing spinning chaos. Cost legible in final “quiet” that spreads through bolts.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Lunar dome, rail shivers, and floating governor are tactile and constrain tactics: the loose governor literally prevents capture. Micro-setting triumphs—leaf recording substitutes for Earth gravity, becoming the tool that reseats time. Viewport image of Earth as “candle drowned in its own glass” charges closure with cosmic loneliness. Spatial coherence maintained; no impossible positions.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“harness the ephemeral before it slips past the sky”—is signaled early and tightens when spinning hand threatens comet capture. Escalation under Accumulative lens: moon-quake threads, dust plumes, and leaf cadence deepen density until governor seats. Protagonist’s micro-choices (loop leaf, breathe, tap) narrow options; cost is forfeiting Lina’s live voice. No coincidence; pressure coherent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme—holding requires listening, not grip—emerges from leaf surrender and governor reseating; no explicit thesis. Subtext in “escape velocity” redefined as leaving fear, not people. Final image of “escape velocity from fear” reweights Lina’s departure without moralizing. Luminous ache motif recurs only when it reconfigures meaning at end.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>First-person perceptual signature is distilled: “quiet that tastes like luminous ache,” “silver sips of movement.” Syntax mirrors lunar stillness—long breathy clauses that suddenly click like the governor. No head-hopping; psychic distance stable. Compression (“I breathe once, tap the frame”) taught early and pays off in final slowed heartbeat.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Rhythm modulates from tremulous fragments to decisive clicks; no template cadence. Metaphors stay coherent—clock hand as orbital drift, dust as “tiny ghosts rehearsing departure.” High density: each sentence advances atmosphere or action. Minor scaffold: “luminous ache” repeated thrice; does not touch closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Premise—lunar clockworker using a falling-leaf metronome—feels inevitable yet fresh. Synthesis of horology, grief, and orbital mechanics is specific; swap any part and the story collapses. Risk in lyric accumulation pays off: final “escape velocity from fear” reconfigures both physics and emotion. No derivative echoes.</comment>
