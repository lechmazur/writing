<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is rich and sensorily anchored (“keys clinked like cool birds nesting”), but the narrator’s emotional contradiction—vigilance vs complicity—stays verbal rather than forcing a micro-choice that costs him on-page. The final “I was also a hinge” lands as earned renunciation, yet the pivot from loyal sentinel to co-conspirator could have carried a sharper, visible price (e.g. a guard’s challenge he must betray). Still, the perceptual signature is consistent, flaws complicit with poetic duty, and the occupation-specific metal lore keeps him singular.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a perfect Charged Poise: the fort’s lanterns relight while the narrator inventories locks, reconfiguring power without a shot fired. Causal chain holds—blackout → sundial code → archive seam → bronze bridge → wheel wakes → city re-lit—each because/therefore link tightening options. Cost is legible in the bronze quill sacrificed and the perpetual risk now sleeping inside the walls. Lens stays causal and coherent to the final hinge image.</comment>

<comment>“Luminous fort” and twilight blackout are immediate, sensory, and motive—mirrors, ramparts, and the half-painted sundial constrain patrol routes and smuggle angles. Micro-setting inside the cradle of sparks (ribs, gears, dust) tangibly shapes the bridging act. Environmental detail is filtered through metal-minded POV, never touristic. Final image of new shadows on the sundial recharges the setting as reclaimed commons.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“silent revolution that would light bread ovens”—is signaled early and tightened when the wheel’s one missing bridge forces the sacrifice of the bronze quill. Protagonist’s agency drives every beat: inventory ruse, seam press, bridge improvisation. Price is visible—the quill gone, the fort’s loyalty compromised—yet escalation plateaus after the lanterns revive; no further obstacle raises the personal cost to the sentinel. Sufficient for length, but a final guard confrontation could have pushed higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme of “permission over toppling” emerges through images of doors, hinges, and lanterns rather than thesis. The cradle of sparks reweights from secret vault to communal birth-canal; light as polite guest reframes revolution as courtesy, not conquest. Final “city turned quietly on that hinge” offers non-literal answer: access is the revolution. Avoids moralizing; ambiguity lingers about what the magistrates will do next.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>First-person lock-poet voice is unmistakable: “metal stuttered,” “verbs for turning,” “light tasted the room first.” Syntax grows more fluid under pressure, mirroring the wheel’s wake-up. No head-hopping; diction stays within a clerk-metallist lexicon. Purposeful compression—“I stroked the archive door, told it to rest”—reads as tenderness, not ornament.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Rhythm modulates from hush to whirr without drumbeat; sentences vary in length and hinge on tactile verbs. Information density high: one sentence can paint blackout, betray occupation, and foreshadow code. Figurative layer is thick yet coherent—no mixed metaphors. Minor scaffold: “light…warm in the cheeks” approaches cliché, but fits the domesticating-light motif and does not touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Familiar revolution tropes are inverted: blackout not as apocalypse but invitation; sundial as cipher; quill holder repurposed as conductive tooth. Synthesis feels organic and specific to this fort’s mirror-tech world. Risk of lyric obscurity is embraced yet clarity holds. Final image of quiet hinge-turn is fresh and inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
