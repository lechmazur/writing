<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The spinner’s endurance and final renunciation—sending the bead rather than herself—carries visible cost: she remains alone, tethered to the glowing frame night after night. Interiority stays concrete, filtered through loom-taught attention and amber-warmed skin; no diagnostic self-talk. The choice to stay and wait is earned by her mother-taught discipline and the orchard’s fragility, foreclosing escape with stoic ache. Sister’s return validates the sacrifice, proving the living orchard was the necessary anchor.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the square keeps its low glow, the orchard still sighs, yet the sister stands there—distance reweighted, cost paid in seasons of waiting. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: silence layers, edges hum, bead warms; the final breath-out footfall reconfigures meaning without causal reversal. Persistent constraint—the orchard would die if she left—shapes the renunciation and charges the final image. Cost is legible in the lantern oil and patience poured into the patient dark.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The orchard-bamboo grove is never backdrop: fruitless branches drop the single pale leaf into her hands, a causal omen; the loom’s frame and bead are micro-settings that constrain every move. Sensory hierarchy is spinner-biased—air as thread, silence as wool—guiding the jigsaw placement and breath-weaving. Spatial choreography is clean: edges nest, bead slides across the threshold, distance stacked like silent layers. Final image recharges the same moon-stippled blanket and whispering bamboo, now fermenting warmth and bees.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes—impossible distance vs. living orchard—tighten once: the latent sacrifice knots, forcing the choice to send only the bead. Escalation is accretive: silence layers, amber warms, frame glows; the sister’s absence is reweighted rather than reversed. Protagonist agency is the renunciation that keeps the grove alive; cost is seasons of lantern oil and thinning flesh. No coincidence; the jigsaw edges and raveling silence are tools she trained for years.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: distance is silence stacked between loved names; sacrifice is not disappearance but staying fertile for return. Subtext lives in gesture—looping hair, sliding bead, breathing orchard—never thesis. Final image of fermenting warmth reconfigures sacrifice from loss to cultivation, recharging every prior mention of vanished fruit and snapped rope. No moral is stated; the orchard’s new bees are the argument.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyric-accumulative voice is hypnotic, spinner-specific: “threads the living could no longer hear,” “soft knives that parted hush from hush.” Syntax mirrors loom rhythm—parallel clauses, half-spun pauses—without drumbeat monotony. Compression taught early (“raveling silence,” “stoically sparkling”) pays off at closure when the same diction reweights distance. No dialogue, so no voice leakage; unreliability never claimed, certainty never overstated.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is lean yet textured: every sentence layers image, sound, or tactile heat while advancing the weave. Metaphors are internally coherent—silence as wool, distance as stacked cloth—no mixed vehicles. No loops or synonym churn; “raveling silence” recurs with accretive meaning, not repetition fatigue. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes without scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: jigsaw edges as portal, silence as weave, orchard as living telegram—none feels gimmicky because grounded in spinner’s craft. Conceptual risk—renunciation instead of heroic crossing—pays off when sister steps through the glow, proving the grove had to stay alive. Familiar tropes (magic object, distant sibling) are rethreaded through loom logic and accretive hush. Final reconfiguration feels inevitable yet non-obvious.</comment>
