<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction is vivid—fear of erasure vs need for clarity—and the final micro-choice (one plain stitch) costs the narrator the ornate past. Coachman’s quiet authority pressures without stealing agency. Emotional embodiment is strong (“hands that trembled, yet the stitch held like bone”). Minor: coachman’s own stakes stay off-page, so relationship crucible is one-sided.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a crisp Earned Stasis: the single-thread vow is spoken, the shawl’s weight drops, and the ferry moves—cost is the forfeiture of all prior overwritten layers. Causal chain holds: swollen ford → waiting → coachman’s loosening gesture → narrator’s decisive stitch → crossing. No orientation debt; fog and river are anchored by word 40. Lens is situational-pressure; ambiguity resolved into crystallized stance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fog, river, toll-house gutters, and the horse’s steaming hide are filtered through the narrator’s guilt-soaked attention; every bead of condensation mirrors the palimpsest layers. The yarn needle becomes micro-setting that finally constrains choice. Spatial choreography is immaculate—bench, brake, ferry chain, opposite bank—bodies and objects track clean. Environment directly withholds passage until internal revision occurs.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can the narrator reduce tangle to one true line—tightens when the coachman lifts a single stitch, proving erasure is possible yet loss-laden. Pressure escalates through weather and waiting, not external antagonist; the ford’s refusal mirrors the narrator’s. One meaningful deepening: acceptance of “shape of waiting” converts delay into tactic. Cost is the visible shedding of embroidered history; option space narrows to the unadorned present tense.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as “truth shrinks before it can carry us.” Subtext lives in gesture: lifting one stitch > any speech. Palimpsest moves from metaphor to material weight, then to discarded cloak—image reconfigures meaning without moralizing. Final whistle and silent gutters offer resonant non-verbal answer; complexity distilled, not explained.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>First-person voice is saturated with maritime and textile lexicon—spindrift, shale, harbor moon—yet stays interior-consistent. Syntax lengthens and contracts like breath, mirroring tide and needlework. No dialogue tags needed; coachman’s idiom is spare, nautical, distinct from narrator’s anxious embroidery of thought. Compression (“we listened”) and elision are taught early and paid off in the final hush.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry triple duty: “rain stitched the eaves” shows weather, sound, and metaphoric sewing in five words. No scaffold or synonym loops; each image is non-recyclable. Figurative density is high but patterned—textile and water vehicles interweave without clashing. Read-aloud rhythm accelerates across the ferry slide, then lands on the spare whistle—cadence mirrors arc.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Ferry-chain palimpsest is fresh synthesis: river as eraser and archive. Coachman archetype flipped—midwife of clarity, not plot driver. Risk taken in lyric stasis over event, yet pressure holds. Could edge higher if coachman’s own backstory left a sharper artifact, but piece already feels singular.</comment>
