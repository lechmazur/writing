<question>1</question>
<grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>The coach’s interiority is rich and specific—his ability to “hear unspoken words” is shown, not told, and guides micro-choices like “I chose not to argue.” His motivation stays coherent: protect the grotto and the kids’ quiet refuge. Yet the climactic stand is collective and symbolic; the personal cost to him is implied rather than embodied, so the final renunciation feels slightly under-weighted.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the councilwoman’s hesitation outside the grotto reweights the stakes with undeniable conceptual cost—“second thoughts spread like fungi.” The lens is Accumulative/Textural—patterned window displays tighten the civic mood until stance crystallizes. Causality stays intact: each display beats adds social pressure without a causal speech. The only drag is a mild orientation debt: “cobalt library in mist” arrives before we know it is a library, but the image later pays off, so the waiver applies.</comment>

<comment>The magnetic grotto is not mere scenery—it actively shapes play (compasses stagger) and supplies the closure image. Windows function as micro-settings that constrain tactics: they must be cleaned, lit, and read. Sensory selection is urgent—mist, hum, twitch of filings—mirroring the hush the town slips into. One minor spatial blur: the exact route from street to grotto is sketched once, but never tested under pressure, so the cap stays below 8.8.</comment>

<grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—save the grotto from bulldozers—is signaled early and tightened through the display campaign. One meaningful escalation: the councilwoman’s public hesitation outside the grotto sign forecloses the “inevitable” vote. Cost is conceptual rather than corporeal—loss of civic memory—but it is felt. A second, more visceral price (a shopkeeper’s lost profit, a child’s disappointment) would have pushed this into 8+ territory.</comment>

<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: quiet refusal as civic duty. The refrains—“cradle,” “pause,” “second thoughts”—accumulate texture rather than message. Final image of the pawn held in silence offers conceptual repricing: resistance can be gentleness. No overt moralizing; the only near-echo is the phrase “plant forests of second thoughts,” which is saved by its metaphoric specificity.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>First-person voice is consistent, with a perceptual signature of listening inward—“the metallic clink of ambition.” Syntax modulates: longer, breath-held sentences in misty openings; clipped fragments during blitz games. No dialogue to test idiom, but interior diction stays within coach lexicon. One lyrical compression—“the street listens hardest”—is taught by prior pattern and pays off.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and musical—“iron filings flirt,” “blue threads for lines of sight.” No loops or scaffold; each sentence twins image with stake. One mixed metaphor: “forests of second thoughts” (spreads like fungi earlier) is minor. Final line attains Charged Poise through rhythm and monosyllabic landing: “We will cradle the town until it chooses itself.”</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The synthesis—chess zugzwang as civic protest, magnetic grotto as childhood sanctuary—is non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Risk is quiet rather than flashy, fitting the “amplified quiet” tone. No close echoes of famous scenes; the window-display rebellion feels freshly minted. The conceptual pivot from winning to “not having to move first” reweights chess strategy into life philosophy.</comment>
