<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The therapist’s “softly adaptive” premise is dramatized: every micro-choice—asking permission, letting the bowl breathe, inviting Felix to map memory onto sound—tilts the present. Interiority stays concrete (“cautious exuberance tucked like a heartbeat”) and contradicts itself under pressure—hope against fear of forcing the child. The curl hand-off crystallizes a status shift: Lena yields custodial control, the therapist accepts custodial risk, Felix witnesses adults trading guardianship of his silence. Cost is felt: the therapist’s earlier hedged hope is replaced by audible responsibility when Felix sings “mama” and the eclipse ends—an earned reopening that could still fail.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure thickens through repeating sonic motifs—hush, tap, bowl hum, vowel—each layer tightening attention rather than causal plot. Orientation anchored by word 60 (“beneath the hush of dreaming roots”). Closure is Charged Poise: the final shared breath under totality reconfigures the silence; no guarantee of permanent voice, but the option of song is now materially shared and irreversible. Visible cost: the therapist’s earlier hedged stance is replaced by audible responsibility; the curl, once inert, is now sonically married to the first syllable—an on-page re-pricing of memory.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Juniper roots, crushed sage, and shifting eclipse light are not backdrop but instruments: shadows lacework the shawl that lets Felix feel hidden enough to tap. The bowl’s metal temperature, the curl’s nap against rim, the noon cricket restart—all constrain timing and timbre; environment dictates when sound is safe. Micro-setting (curl-as-moon beside vibrating rim) charges the final image; remove any sensory detail and the permission structure collapses. Spatial choreography stays clean: uphill town/noon crowd vs. low-root trio, bowl passed hand-to-hand, heel-tap on dust—all tracked without drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: can silence be reopened without force? Pressure escalates by sonic density: whisper-to-tap-to-vowel, each increment narrowing the possibility of retreat. The eclipse acts as situational crucible—external clock that forbids stalling; either the voice enters the dark or the moment expires. Cost is audible: once Felix sings “mama,” the silence can no longer be claimed as inevitable; the failure option is now live and shared.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>“Ordinary magic” emerges not as slogan but as method: attention shaped like tone, breath, rhythm until they link. The eclipse reframes silence as communal instrument rather than deficit; totality’s blue victorian-photo gloom literalizes the moment when absence becomes medium. No moral is stated; the final image—Lena pressing sounded curl to her lips—reweights memory from loss to resonance. Subtext operates in gesture: thumbnail tapping ground is the child testing whether earth will betray sound; bowl’s answer is permission.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>First-person therapeutic voice maintains perceptual signature: “I travel light and listen heavy,” “water finding a cup.” Syntax grows shorter under coronal hush—final paragraph fragments mirror eclipse breath. No head-hop; therapist’s inference of Lena’s dream is tagged as whisper overheard. Register stays within plausible music-therapist lexicon without drifting into academic or new-age syrup.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>High information density: single sentences perform setting, metaphor, and emotional cue—“the ridge smelled of crushed sage and dust, and the town was waiting for the coming solar eclipse like a long, held note.” No paraphrase loops; each repetition (bowl sings / tap answers) accrues new consequence. Metaphors stay coherent—lacework shadows, shawl of darkness—without mixed vehicle crash. Rhythm breathes with eclipse tempo: longer sentences pre-totality, fragment post-release. Minor filter verbs crop up (“I felt”) but always paired with embodied sensation, not abstraction.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Music-therapy-during-eclipse is fresh synthesis; trope of voiceless child is redeemed by sonic rather than psychological rescue. Ordinary magic premise is made specific: no spell, just attention metallurgy. Risk taken: climax occurs in collective hush rather than shouted breakthrough; coherence holds. Could swap therapist and setting with minor edits, but the curl-to-bowl-to-eclipse acoustic triangulation feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
