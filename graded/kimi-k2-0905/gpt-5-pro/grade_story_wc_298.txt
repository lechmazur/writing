<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The narrator’s “reckless idealist” contradiction is embodied in the kneeling-to-soothe-roots beat and the final pledge to share breath; the brother’s traded future anchors motive, but the Keeper’s pressure is filtered through lyric summary rather than a visible status shift, so the relationship crucible never fully ignites. Interiority is vivid, yet the moment of accepting scars is slightly abstract, keeping the cost one step from the body.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the re-grafted laugh inside the cooled card is an undeniable reweighting of the premise, paid for by the narrator’s pledge to “share breath” and return as watchman—cost is legible in the final image. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of inlaying meaning tightens through each shard until the orchard becomes a loom. Orientation is taught early by the soot-stitched map; no caps triggered.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The burned tarot card functions as micro-setting that constrains every choice: its residual heat decides when roots loosen, when the eye blinks, when the graft takes. Catacomb orchard is viscerally tracked—roots lift, pears exhale dust—yet detail never stalls momentum. Spatial choreography is clean: map → grove → corridor return, bodies and lantern positions remain traceable.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“patch holes in the soul”—is signaled in paragraph three and tightens when the narrator must accept scars to re-graft the brother’s path; the price (shared breath, perpetual return) is legible on the final line. One meaningful deepening suffices under Accumulative lens: each inscription of meaning increases density until the orchard’s fever breaks. No reversals needed; coincidence absent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the concrete bargain of destinies and the narrator’s refusal to let hunger devour names; the closing image of the orchard-as-loom reweights the entire market premise without moralizing. Subtext resides in the eye-blink of the card—gratitude and warning—never explained aloud. Complexity is honored: the market is not evil, only hungry, and the narrator’s mending accepts permanent scars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>First-person voice carries a distinct perceptual signature—tarry syllables, pears trembling with forgiving—without drifting into purple. Syntax modulates: longer incantatory lines for lullaby, clipped fragments under lantern dusk. No dialogue clutter; the two spoken exchanges are terse, subtext-laden. Filter verbs are voice-motivated and consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm breathes with scene temperature—propulsive during root-snare, hushed during graft. Figurative layering is dense but patterned: every metaphor is a form of stitching, inlay, or weaving, so coherence holds. One mixed image—“laugh stumble like a foal”—slightly jars amid bone-wood lexicon, but it occurs mid-text, not at closure, so artifact penalty is minor.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The “destiny market” trope is retooled into a living orchard that breathes through skulls; the burned tarot card as both receipt and graft-scion feels inevitable yet unforeseen. Risk is high—lyric mosaic in under 800 words—but pattern is taught early and closure remains legible. Specificity of the family lullaby and the soot-map anchors the concept in lived detail, preventing allegorical drift.</comment>
