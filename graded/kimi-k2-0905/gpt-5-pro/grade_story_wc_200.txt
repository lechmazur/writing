<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The collector’s interior contradiction—modestly fearless, practiced at stillness—drives every micro-choice; the bargain to confess first enacts that trait with visible cost. Emotions stay embodied in tooth-on-gut-string and the colt-clumsy laugh, avoiding label-speak. The arc lands in earned stasis: he departs carrying a companionable ache that forecloses the old guilt-loop. No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible waived.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the laugh steps into shared oxygen, reweighting guilt into liveable ache—cost is the unveiled memory of the refused rescue. Causal chain holds: detune → seams open → confession → laugh approaches → new gait agreed. Orientation anchored by word 60 (“echo gorge… throat of stone”). No lens ambiguity; pattern of sour-note-as-key taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Gorge, harp, and tooth function as micro-settings that actively constrain tactics: the flat rock dictates placement, the misaligned intervals force the search method, the tooth-plectrum literally opens the final sonic seam. Sensory hierarchy obeys POV—sound first, then milk-in-tea light—mirroring internal shift. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly; no floating bodies. Environment charges the final image: “echo inside my ribs like fresh rafters.”</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—secure the laugh-as-medicine—signalled in paragraph 5. One meaningful tightening: the protagonist must surrender his worst memory before the laugh will approach, narrowing options from pursuit to mutual exposure. Cost is legible in the on-page confession and the widow’s cruel-kind rope image. Pressure escalates under causal lens because each detune deepens spectral exposure and personal risk.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly: laughter can coexist with sorrow when both are witnessed, not consumed. Subtext lives in gesture—wet-hand clap, scarf-against-windburn—avoiding thematic statement. Final image of the laugh as “small river under my tongue” offers non-literal repricing of healing. No moralizing or echo phrases.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>First-person voice carries a consistent perceptual signature: synesthetic metaphors (“sour resonance opened another seam”) and sonic bias. Rhythm modulates—long breathless sentences during pursuit, short clauses at the reveal—mirroring emotional cadence. No head-hopping; knowledge stays bound to collector. Non-standard grammar (“spectral confessions… gleaming as they bruised”) is voice-motivated and legible.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentence openings avoid template cadence. Figurative density is high but patterned—misaligned music as portal—taught early and paid off, so no overwrite penalty. Zero paraphrase loops; each image advances stakes or atmosphere. Strong verbs (“plucked,” “bit,” “limped”) replace modifiers. Closure line is crisp, recharging the river image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Premise of harvesting a laugh from drowned ghosts via detuned harp is fresh; execution grounds it in tactile detail (tooth plectrum, wet-hand clap). Transformation test fails if names change—crocodile tooth and misaligned harp are irreplaceable. Risky lyric escalation pays off in resonant closure without gimmickry. Specificity of “laugh that survives by doubting kindness” feels singular, not archetypal.</comment>
