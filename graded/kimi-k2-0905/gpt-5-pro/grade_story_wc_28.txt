<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The narrator’s contradiction—gentle yet steel-armored, merciful yet complicit in deception—lives in every micro-choice: pressing the tessera to earth, renaming the guard’s grief, offering water while risking death. Each action re-calibrates the stakes under the “aberrant mercy” premise, and the final earned stasis (lowering the rifle) is paid for by the visible cost of exposing his own fragility. No stock phrases; interiority is sensuous, embodied, and specific to this voice. Only hairline slip: “arms of steel” borders label-speak, but the image is immediately re-embodied through tactile use.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Situational lens holds: pressure crystallizes when the patrol arrives and the protagonist’s only weapon is the tessera-plus-story. Closure is a Charged Poise: the leader lowers the rifle, the plaza tastes of rain, mercy breathes—cost is the protagonist’s exposure and the leader’s self-recognition. Orientation is taught by line 3 (“ancient plaza beneath a shattered sky”) and paid off when the intact past is re-seen through the tessera. No causality breaks; the mosaic stepping stone’s cracked syllables motivate the renaming tactic that resolves the standoff.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The tessera functions as micro-setting: its blue twilight edge literally cuts the protagonist’s palm, its dust-back holds denied names, and its glass face projects the intact plaza. Shattered sky / peeled fruit rind, warm-cold ash wind, and the guard’s fig theft create selective, POV-filtered sensory hierarchy. Spatial choreography is clean: protagonist kneels, tessera touches stone, patrol forms a semicircle, leader’s visor lifts. Final image—tessera warming like a bell—recharges every prior environmental cue.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—mercy must survive in a city that outlawed it—tightens when the patrol arrives; the single meaningful deepening is the guard-leader’s recognition of his own mother’s fig story, which forecloses lethal force. Protagonist’s agency is the renaming act; cost is the shared vulnerability that makes the plaza “taste like rain.” No reversals needed; situational pressure suffices. One hairline slip: the decree’s carved cedar is mentioned once and never re-embodied, leaving the law’s physicality abstract.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the particular: a blue shard becomes a bell, cracks become a map, and mercy becomes a door—no moralizing. The final image reweights the premise that “law has no hands” by showing hands that cradle. Subtext lives in gesture: the guard stealing figs while telling of his mother’s death turns grief into recipe, a quiet indictment of survival-by-numbing. Complexity is honored: the protagonist’s mercy is aberrant, possibly lethal next time, yet the story lets it breathe.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>First-person lyric voice is sustained with patterned elision (“warm coldness,” “ash and wind”) taught early and paid off in the final “soft armored rooms.” Perceptual signature is consistent: the narrator notices pressure points, cracked syllables, and light trapped in glass—never expository omniscience. Syntax modulates from incantatory long sentences to the staccato of patrol boots, mirroring rising threat. No head-hopping; the guard’s interior is accessed only through visor glint and mouth shaping summer.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally; no template cadence or synonym loops. Information density is high—each sentence advances image, stake, or tactic (“Its glassy face kept the last light of prayers, but its back held the dust of names denied their bodies”). One mixed-metaphor risk—“sky is a peeled fruit, its rind hanging in cracked auroras”—is justified by the lyric register and re-weighted at closure. Minor scaffold: “I came… I came…” repetition at open could be trimmed but does not obscure causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of retrocognitive mosaic-reader and merciful radical feels inevitable yet fresh; no template plot matches this premise. The tessera-as-door, renaming-as-armor, and “warm coldness” as tone are non-obvious inflections that grow from inside the world. Risk—lyric compression that could obscure stakes—is rewarded when the final image crystallizes meaning without exposition. The story commits fully to its lyric-situational hybrid and never retreats to safety.</comment>
