<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The narrator’s cautious hope is embodied in micro-choices (chart-greased fingers, subsonic patch) and costs him sleep, social safety, and institutional protection; the final “we have learned to breathe together” crystallizes earned endurance. Interior contradiction—yearning to heal while knowing tricksters return—stays active in scene. The only bar to 9+ is that the provost’s abrupt conversion is seen from outside; we get no interior evidence of cost to him, so the relational crucible feels partial.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the scaffolded subsonic turns the station from mirror-of-hate to communal diaphragm, cost felt in the narrator’s greasy folded charts and the provost’s grinning nod. Causal chain holds: charts → gate timing → subsonic under hymn → barricades loosen. Orientation is swift: midnight booth, city breath, stakes named by line 3. One causal jump—provost’s pulse slowing without dramatized interiority—keeps this just under 9+ perfection.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Antenna tower as “spine,” coffee that “tastes like pennies,” and the turntable grease on star-maps make the studio a body-sized cavity that determines tactics—milk-crate labyrinth placement, couch-damper tuning. Environment literally shapes the wave-form attack; the final image of morning sliding up the metal tower recharges every prior metallic taste. Micro-setting (charts, solder smell) constrains the mix-down; no 9 only because off-stage quad vigils are sketched more generically.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—keep the airwaves from becoming a hate-mirror—tightens when donors, police, and patriots close in. Mid-story escalation: narrator risks license loss and arrest to deploy subsonics; the breakers trip, tower shakes, option space narrows. Cost is visceral: “coffee that tastes like pennies,” headphones “pressing crowns,” the scaffold left humming because “healing is slower than harm.” Slight deduction for off-stage administrative threat delivered by proxy; pressure would sharpen if provost confronted earlier.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges as listening-as-resistance: attention can be engineered into a counter-rhythm that makes even cynics notice their own pulse. No moral is declared; the final image of folded greasy charts silently reweights every prior riddle. Subtext lives in gesture—handing the provost soft headphones instead of arguing. The provost’s wordless exit enacts the theme: bridges, not guns. Ambiguity remains: tricksters will return, so the ethic is ongoing praxis, not victory.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>First-person voice carries a technician-poet signature: “tricksters wearing vacuum for boots,” “clock salts the hour.” Syntax lengthens under wonder, compresses under siege—“We throw the breakers back”—mimicking wave-form attack. No head-hopping; even the provost’s reaction is filtered through observable physiology. The diction stays within a student-engineer’s lexicon while reaching for cosmic scale; rhythmic control justifies occasional flourish.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Sentences multi-task: “I aim the scaffold at frequencies where their laughter turns brittle” advances plot, embodies metaphor, and sets up sonic payoff. Figurative density is high but patterned—sound metaphors braid through every beat—so never drifts into purple. One paraphrase loop—“power plays multiply like mold… dank and inevitable, soft at first then choking”—is forgiven because the image escalates. Final line “keeping bridges singing even during storms” lands with cadence-earned closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Combines campus-radio realism with cosmic-trickster myth in a way that feels inevitable: ionospheric scatter becomes folklore highway. The subsonic counter-mirror is a fresh tactical twist on the “occupy the airwaves” trope. Specific engineering detail—gate valve timing, milk-crate acoustics—grounds the fantastical. Risky second-person invitation to “notice your own breath” pays off when listeners call crying; innovation heightens stakes without breaking causality.</comment>
