<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is lush, embodied (“rope cools its grief into my ear”), motives cohere, and the final shared planting is a credible micro-choice that costs time/social risk. The “infinitely patient” trait is shown, not told, in the slow listening. Minor: the fisherman’s shift from skeptical to co-protector is sketched more than dramatized, slight thinning of relational crucible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: because the dock will be destroyed, therefore they must decode→preserve→plant; splice-extraction and council threat tighten options. Closure is Earned Stasis: they have not saved the dock yet, but the rope-language is now duplicated in the fisherman’s hands—cost is the undeclared future loss and the tar-stained thumb. One micro-turn (tar bead → sprig) lands at 75 %, satisfying escalation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Golden dock, snow, fog, hemp fibres, tar bead—each is tactile, specific, and filters through the collector’s instrumented perception. The fulgurite glass and rope jointly function as micro-setting that constrains the only possible “reading” method. Final image of wool-wrapped sprig is charged by prior salt/sand cues. No orientation drift; anchors clear by line 30.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—save the rope-knowledge—signalled early; pressure escalates when council deadline is spoken, narrowing time. Agency: collector’s coaxing and fisherman’s acceptance foreclose the path of passive loss; price is undeclared dock demolition still looming. One meaningful tightening (tar bead reveals seed) suffices for 700-word scale.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme—memory as living, germinating syntax—emerges from knots-to-seed trajectory without explicit thesis. Subtext in whistle-through-glass, grandmother’s ghost-hum, and shared kneeling reweights “patience” as mutual civic resistance. Final image of “living sentence to plant” offers non-literal answer: language must root or die. No moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>First-person lyric voice sustains oceanic hush through sibilants, tidal syntax, and technical lexicon (“fulgurite,” “clove hitch”) that stays within collector’s ken. No head-hopping; fisherman’s interior surfaced only through gesture and reported speech. Rhythm modulates: longer clauses for listening, staccato when council threat intrudes. Distinct perceptual signature holds.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>High density: one sentence often does three jobs—e.g.,“snow rests…like sifted flour, gold beneath, white above” anchors palette, metaphor, and temperature. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors; figurative language is spare, patterned, and paid off (“listening bone” returns). Verbs are strong (“coax,” “lever,” “cradle”). Closure line is clean, propulsive, echoing “living sentence.”</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise—rope-as-manuscript, lightning-glass as stylus—is fresh yet inevitable. Knot grammar and seed swap invert usual archive: text is biodegradable, garden is library. Risk in lyrical exposition is justified because pattern is taught early and closure re-weights same grammar. Specificity of tar-spliced pea sprig prevents trope drift.</comment>
