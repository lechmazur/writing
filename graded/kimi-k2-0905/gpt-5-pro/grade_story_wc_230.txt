<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The forager’s rationality and involuntary truth-telling create a sharp, consistent interior contradiction that drives every beat; the final renunciation of the eye is earned because his logged “outcomes” make the cost of dependency legible. Micro-choices—burying the eye beneath the truffle bed, shaving truffles into oil—embody values without label-speak. Secondary characters sketch quickly but carry distinct griefs that pressure the circle. The only bar to 8+ is that the eye’s theft-origin remains a told, not dramatized, moral bruise.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the eye is relinquished, the circle must now “practice gentler speech unaided,” and the persistent constraint (empathy virus) remains—cost is unmistakable in the final image of “fractured grace like cables after weather.” Causality under Accumulative lens holds: each meeting’s softening is logged, pressure mounts when the courier reclaims contraband, so the burial choice is the cumulative answer. Orientation is taught by line 3; no penalty. One minor loop—“because I am rational, because the world deserves…”—does not touch closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The hanging orchard, iron cables, brine-slick leaves, and truffle mycelium are filtered through the forager’s professional gaze, constraining movement and supplying the ritual table; the storm’s drip answers Mara’s confession, environment mirroring interior without overt symbolism. The glass eye’s “stormgreen spiral” reappears at burial, charging the final image. Spatial choreography stays clean across the circle. Missing 9+ only because weather’s tactical effect (slippery footing, soaked wood) is implied rather than staged.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can psychological safety survive forced truth?—tightens when the courier threatens the eye; the protagonist’s agency to bury it forecloses the “contraband” option and accepts the harder path. Pressure escalates accumulatively: each confession softens yet exposes them to external theft. Cost is logged in pulses, tears, and the final loss of the occluding tool. One reversible: the courier’s demand arrives off-stage; still, the burial response is fully on-page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme—truth as compost, not blade—emerges through truffle mycelium, shared oil, and the eye’s burial; no character sermonizes. The orchard’s drip and the eye’s “merciful imprecision” reweight confession into collaboration, a resonant reconfiguration without moral tag. Ambiguity lingers: can unaided speech remain gentle? Final image of “fractured grace” answers visually, not rhetorically. Missing 9+ only because the textbooks’ footnote is named, not shown, slightly abstracting the insight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>First-person voice carries a scientist’s precision—“methodical about spores and seasons,” “logged outcomes like rainfall”—yet bends into lyric cadence under pressure (“mouth wore river stones”). Perceptual signature is consistent: noticing mycelium, pulse, brine, never slipping into authorial tour-guide. Compression (“truth cannot be bargained”) is taught early and paid off. No dialogue contamination; the single voice sustains charged poise at close.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm varies from clipped logbook entries to longer, tide-like rolls; figurative language is selective—no purple storms. One scaffold loop (“because I am rational…”) and one near-mixed metaphor (“cables after weather” reads slightly off for human grace) but neither obscures causality or dulls the final image. Information density high: one sentence often performs scene, metaphor, and emotional shift. Proofing clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The empathy-virus premise is familiar, yet grafting it onto a truffle-forager’s data-driven grief circle feels non-obvious; the eye as “lens polished by saints and liars” transforms a standard talisman into a tool whose abandonment is the climax. Specificity of hanging orchard, mycelial moderation, and contraband figs makes the world unswappable. Risk in lyric accumulation pays off in the final “fractured grace.” Only a whisker from 9+ because the courier’s off-stage demand is a faint echo of familiar chase tropes.</comment>
