<comment>Mara’s seasonal silence and tactile tuning give embodied interiority; her insistence on borrowing apprentices’ voices while mute shows contradictory impulse under pressure. The aurora-thinning stakes are personal, not abstract, and her final knuckle-strike costs her the last sliver of iceberg, a felt forfeiture. No secondary character exerts independent pressure, so relationship crucible is N/A, but her micro-choices—channeling wind into water-percussion—reveal value hierarchy with visible price. Voice remains coherent through synesthetic perception (“tasted like rain on copper leaves”) without diagnostic self-label.

<comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the aurora thickens because the community accepts flawed honesty, reweighting the premise that silence equals truth. Causal chain holds: iceberg → tunable light → communal exposure → aurora replenished; each because/therefore advances knowledge. Orientation anchored by line 3 (“seasonally mute”), well inside 120-word window. Persistent constraint—the fragment’s melting—shapes final image and charges the ending with undeniable water-loss.

<comment>The kinetic sculpture itself functions as micro-setting; its brass frames and wind-throat constrain every tuning choice and charge the final image. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven: Mara notices temperature of metal, taste of copper-leaf rain, tilt of shadows. Spatial choreography is immaculate—rail, basins, reed channels track without drift. Environment evolves: iceberg sweats → channels → new percussion, causal ripple that reconfigures the bluff into reciprocal listener.

<comment>Dominant stake—“preserve the color of wonder”—is signaled early and tightens when aurora thins; the tightening is the visible fade that forces Mara to borrow voices. Escalation is accumulative: each bell rotation deepens communal exposure (unnamed child, twenty-winter grief) rather than narrows external options. Cost is legible in melting fragment and released postures; no reversal, but deepening suffices under Accumulative lens. Persistent constraint (iceberg loss) shapes final tactics and charges closing image.

<comment>Theme emerges without dictation: truth is not verbal but chromatic and sonic, earned through shared vulnerability. Recurring iceberg motif shifts from “clear tooth” to “memory,” repricing silence as collective resonance rather than absence. Final image of aurora bowing rejects moral statement; ambiguity lingers—wonder is drinkable yet still fleeting. Subtext operates in gesture: polite steps hide as much as old lies, now exposed by bell-taste.

<comment>Third-person omniscient remains stable, focalized through Mara’s synesthetic perception; no head-hop. Perceptual signature is tactile-acoustic: “notes refused to climb her lips,” “light moved across the bells like fingers.” Rhythm modulates—long liquid sentences for mist, staccato fragments during knuckle-strike. Patterned elision (“seasonally mute”) is taught early and paid off when she signs to apprentices. No dialogue, so voice distinction clause is waived.

<comment>Read-aloud ear is musical: syntactic variety mirrors wind-sculpture turns, no template cadence. Information density high—single sentence can layer bell-metal, color-aurora, and communal respiration. Figurative language is coherent: “rivers of mist teased from stone” sustains water-light motif without mixed metaphor. Only hairline slip: “truth stayed simple” is abstract tell, but immediately grounded in aurora brightness, so closure untouched.

<comment>Premise—post-verbal village tuning wind into truth-color—is non-obvious synthesis of cli-fi and sound-art. Iceberg-as-memory medium reconfigures familiar trope into fresh stakes. Risk in lyric accumulation pays off: accumulative escalation replaces plot reversals, proving formal daring serves theme. Specificity (“salvaged rails and prayer bowls”) anchors universals; removal would collapse entire mechanism.

{comment}Integration notes: All elements are indispensable; removing any one severs causal chain. Only “glisten” is slightly generic—could be swapped to “shimmer” without break, hence 8.7 cap. Others pass all three gates: setup, development, payoff with visible cost.
