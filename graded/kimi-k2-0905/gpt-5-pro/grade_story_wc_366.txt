<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid (“shape of silence a room makes”), but the keeper and Board are off-stage; contradictions stay internal, never tested in live status play, so relationship-as-crucible remains theoretical. The final custodial act is consistent with the reticent observer trait, yet the cost is more conceptual than corporeal, nudging the score below 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the sealed jar reconfigures the keeper’s legacy under undeniable conceptual cost—archival death vs. living breath. Causality holds under Accumulative/Textural lens: every letter, stone, and drop of oil accrues until the final image reweights the stake. The orientation anchor (who/where) is taught by sentence 3; no debt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The lantern room glass, brass rungs, and green shard function as micro-setting that constrains the final act—oil must be poured inside the jar, sea glass locked under the rung. Weather and automation rumors press inward, guiding the silence the narrator chooses to protect. Spatial choreography is immaculate; bodies never float.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserving undocumented intimacy from museum death—is signaled early and tightens once: automation threatens, narrator answers by bottling the letters. The escalation is a single deepening rather than because/therefore chain, sufficient for lyric-accumulative design. Price is conceptual but legible; physical risk absent keeps score sub-9.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the particular act of sealing sea glass with chart-candle wax: memory must stay embodied, not archived. No moralizing line articulates this; the final whisper “protect this” is stance crystallization, not thesis. Ambiguity lingers—automation still wins—yet ache is undeniable, fulfilling CR.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Perceptual signature is acute—“the panes would remember heat”—and diction stays within a skipper’s idiom. Compression (“the room listened while I did the slow work”) is patterned early and pays off in the final glow. No head-hopping; psychic distance modulates cleanly from exterior report to interior lyricism.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm breathes with scene tempo; no template cadence or synonym loops. Figurative language is sparse and precise—“lung with a held breath”—never congesting urgency. Opening and final lines are image-propelled; no scaffold sentences. Zero artifacts in closure beat allows 9+.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The premise—anonymous letters ferried by a supply skipper to resist lighthouse automation—feels fresh, yet the “haunted lantern room” trope is familiar. Specificity of wax type, stacking code, and green glass transforms the trope into lived ritual. Risk is quiet, not bold; hence stays below 9.0.</comment>
