<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interiority is dense, idiosyncratic, and embodied—every beat is filtered through the coachman’s salt-cracked perception. The contradictory pull between mourning and cultivation is held in-scene, not summarized. Micro-choices (where to crush coral, which tongue to speak) visibly fork the planting, and the final offer of a pod to the veteran clinches an earned renunciation with cost. No diagnostic label-speak; all emotion is visceral gear-shift and pollen.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens declared and maintained: each bird-call translation adds density until the soil grammar crystallizes. Closure is a Charged Poise—the veteran’s tear and the gull’s comic approval lock the submerged concord into the living shore without exposition. Cost is legible in the scent that “fells him to quiet tears” and in the jetty’s new load of roots. Pattern taught early (bird=map, pod=word) and paid off in final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Setting is micro-specific: coral dust between knuckles, lantern-weed fenders, guano ink on rail. Every environmental detail is tactile and choice-constraining—alkaline patch determines pod placement, shade dictates mangrove grip. Twilight narrows visual field to sound and scent, mirroring interior narrowing. The reef’s absent body persists as powdered grammar, charging the final image with its conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“let a garden reclaim a battlefield”—is signaled in paragraph four and tightened each time a pod is planted where bullets fell. One meaningful deepening: the veteran’s arrival converts abstract peace into lived memory, forcing the coachman to relinquish sole authorship of the garden. Cost is the surrender of linguistic control (he hands over a pod stamped with the regiment cipher). Pressure stays coherent under Accumulative lens; no reversal needed, only accretion of signatures.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from pattern: dead language → living root, fallen reef → sprout grammar. No thesis stated; the final image of “wings and oars sharing a pace” reweights all prior bird-call translations into a single cadence of peace. Subtext is carried in scent and husk-breath, not assertion. Moral ambiguity remains—garden feeds on powdered bone, peace is fertilized by war’s residue—inviting complex aftertaste.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Voice is unmistakable: port-argot, Etrusian smoke, brine-soaked syntax. Rhythm modulates from long tide-swell sentences to hard-punch fragments (“Plant it where you bled”). Perceptual signature is consistent—attention always angles sideways to “listen sideways.” No head-hopping; distance stays interior yet coastal. Experimental elision (“narrow vastness”) is taught early and paid off in final corridor of ocean inside seed.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Line-level craft is dense yet propulsive; most sentences carry double duty (image + action). Occasional metaphor stack in bloom passages (“wheels sainted with pollen,” “scent walks”) risks purple, but pattern is taught and serves accrual. Zero paraphrase loops, zero template cadence. Opening and closing lines act as hinge and lock, recharging “narrow vastness” from first to last breath.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Premise—coachman translating bird-calls into peace garden on dead reef—is fresh, non-obvious, and thematically integrated. Tropes (post-war healing, garden as redemption) are inverted through linguistic archaeology and salt grammar. Risk of lyric density is embraced and paid off. Specificity of dead tongues and guano ink makes the frame inseparable from this story; swap plants or place and logic collapses.</comment>
