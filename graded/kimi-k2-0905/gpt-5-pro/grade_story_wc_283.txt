<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The hourglass turner’s quietly inspired trait and cataloging obsession are vivid, embodied, and drive every micro-choice; the interior contradiction between fatalism and agency is alive in scene. No second on-page character, so relationship crucible is N/A. Final renunciation of surrender carries visible cost—“we knew because we listened”—earned by prior pattern work. Interiority stays concrete, never drifts into label-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the prophecy reweights from sentence to shared thread under Accumulative lens. Causality holds: catalog buttons → spiral → echo release → rain road opens, each beat because/therefore. Orientation anchored by line 3; no drift. Cost is legible in the final image of corked echo and heavier-brighter warehouse.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Warehouse, buttons, hourglasses, and cliff path are tactile, selective, and bias-filtered; they constrain every tactical move. Canyon echo jar reappears with shifted charge at closure, satisfying 9+ gate. No weather clichés; honeyed light and sand-silence are POV-colored. Spatial choreography clean across collective march up rain road.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“prophecy vs. possibility”—is signaled early and tightens when spiral+echo reweights options. One meaningful deepening suffices; no reversal overload. Agency is collective but protagonist initiates; cost visible in relinquished surrender and opened seam. Pressure coherent under Accumulative lens; coincidence complicates, does not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from cataloging act and collective stitch: futures are woven, not surrendered. No final moralizing; last image of corked intention preserves ambiguity. Subtext in button names and withheld sentence inside prophecy. Emotional aftereffect lingers through rain-road and shared cord without sentimentality.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>First-person voice carries distinct perceptual signature: time breathes in jars, sandglass throats, “unearthed silence that listens back.” Rhythm modulates with pressure; lyric compression taught early and paid off. No dialogue, so dialogue bullets N/A. No head-hopping; POV distance stable. Syntax mirrors obsession: paratactic catalog beats build to collective release.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentences multi-task; no paraphrase loops or scaffold. Metaphors stay coherent within sand/cloth/time weave. One mixed image—“sand is a choir”—but fits accumulative pattern. No filter-verb stacks; strong verbs propel. Read-aloud rhythm rises to bell ring then quietens, mirroring arc.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Hourglass warehouse, button cartography, and canyon echo jar synthesize into fresh mythic logic without genre cliché. Transformation test fails if elements swapped: button-spiral mapping and echo-release mechanics are irreplaceable. Risk in lyric collective arc pays off; no gimmickry. Specificity of “moons of cloth” and “rain road” anchors universals.</comment>
