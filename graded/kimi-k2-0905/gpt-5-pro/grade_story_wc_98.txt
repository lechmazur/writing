<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The lone “reality checker” is a vivid narrative consciousness, but every action is reported in lyrical summary rather than dramatized micro-choice; we never see a moment where contradiction or visible cost forces a forked decision. Interiority is poetic but generically weighted (“luminous doubt keeps me lit”) rather than specifically embodied. The final “audit complete” beat is declarative, not a tested renunciation; therefore the required Earned Stasis/Charged Poise cost is asserted, not experienced. The villagers remain a collective chorus, so no status crucible or secondary pressure applies.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: images layer (shells→seed→sapling) and cadence deepens toward a Charged Poise closure. Orientation is taught early (“ancient ridge in bloom” by line 1) so no penalty. Causality is impressionistic—seed is planted because “the island counts us,” a myth-logic rather than a because/therefore chain—but the pattern is consistent and pays off in the final vegetal burst. The conceptual cost (next season may still “waver”) is legible in the closing “we have chosen what to keep breathing,” satisfying the RR requirement.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Micro-setting (seed, bowl of saltwater, stone hollow) repeatedly constrains and enables the ritual action; the hollow literally accepts/rejects bodies, charging the climax. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-tilted (“silence that tastes of pandan”). Spatial choreography is clean—“circle around me, not touching”—with no impossible positions. Weather (monsoon) is causally synced to the rite, not decorative. No 9+ because the reef’s “distant knitting” click stretches physical credibility without prior rule cue.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The dominant stake—save cultural memory before monsoon—signals early and tightens via the ticking storm. One meaningful deepening occurs when the reef-treaty fragment is spoken aloud, reweighting failure cost. Agency is partly externalized (island “tests” bodies), blurring protagonist-driven escalation; price is conceptual rather than viscerally felt. Still, the monsoon’s arrival coincides with the sapling burst, giving visible consequence to the ritual success.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: memory as negotiated fiction, reality as communal consent. No final moral is stated; the closing “reality is our most careful fiction” reweights prior images without sermon. Recurrent motif of “interpreted dreams” shifts from method to covenant, satisfying integration. Subtext in gestures (elders form circle but do not touch) carries more weight than any declarative sentence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>First-person voice retains a consistent perceptual signature—mathematical yet incantatory (“quietly mathematical,” “ink-veins”). Syntax mirrors island cadence: long breathable lines that swell like tides, then fragment under monsoon pressure. No head-hopping; lyric compression is taught early (“empirically whimsical way”) and paid off. Register stays within the narrator’s plausible lexicon; only minor over-alliteration (“pandan…practical”) nudges below 9.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm is musical, with purposeful anaphora and clause-variation; no template cadence drags. Metaphors are dense but coherent under accumulative design; mixed vehicle “library walking” is momentary, not closure-touched. High information density—each sentence layers task, object, myth. Minor scaffold: “I do not promise certainty, only luminous doubt” is restated thrice in variant forms; loop is thematic but still noticeable. No artifact obscures causality or dulls the final vegetal image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The “island reality checker” profession is freshly conceived and drives every beat; removal would collapse premise. Synthesis of scientific diction with shell-divination feels inevitable, not grafted. Risky lyric structure is held to a coherent accumulative arc, paying off in the reef-treaty moment. Specificity (“woven lanterns and crumbs” tribute) prevents generic folkloric pastiche.</comment>
