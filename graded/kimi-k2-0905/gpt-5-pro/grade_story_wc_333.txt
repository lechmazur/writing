<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Locksmith’s interiority stays sensory and embodied; the decision to taste the curl crystallizes a value hierarchy without lapsing into label-speak. Scholar’s motivation is legible through micro-gestures (trembling hands, ribbon-care) and the final taking of the “small glowing idea.” Cost is visible: the door inhales the past and the scholar steps into a future whose danger is felt but not spelled out. Only the “phantom limb” line teeters on diagnostic shorthand, preventing the final 0.1.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the corridor opens inward, the scholar crosses, and the locksmith keeps the empty box—cost made legible in one image. Causal chain holds: ribbon→scent→tumblers→door, all triggered by star-breath that was promised and arrives. Lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern of hush, dust, moth-wing light intensifies until the final bright exhalation reconfigures meaning. No orientation ambiguity; who/where/when anchored by “hill where three roads crossed” inside 120 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Blackthorn valley, crickets-as-clerks, and the moon-welded hinges are not scenery but instruments that must be read before the lock will turn. Micro-setting triumph: the freestanding door’s grain, keyhole pupil, and dust-moth wings constrain the locksmith’s tools to breath and hair. Starlight re-anchors spatial relations at the climax, making the final step across the threshold a navigable move rather than a symbolic leap. Only the “reed song” coda drifts toward postcard, but it is outside the closure beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—permission to love without rehearsing danger—is signaled early and tightened when the door’s inhale makes refusal impossible. Escalation is textural: each sensory layer (scent of hair, sound of tumblers, star-breath) raises the emotional tariff until the corridor demands passage. Scholar’s agency is the trembling step across; cost is the sister’s death re-realized in the taste of salt and spring. Price is felt, not declared, satisfying the on-page cost test.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the inverse of the expected heist: instead of stealing secrets, the locksmith releases an unspoken kindness, making mercy the contraband. The hair-ribbon returns as a covenant token, its bruised-blue color reweighted from keepsake to key. Final image of the empty box re-prices the premise—some containers exist only for exit. No moralizing; the bells “learning a slower hour” let the reader feel the new temporal contract without exposition.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric sustains a hush-register that never breaks into expositional shout. Locksmith’s perceptual signature—“a keyring that made no sound”—teaches the reader to listen for breath instead of metal. Syntax lengthens and contracts with the valley’s inhalation, mirroring the door’s decision moment. Single POV maintained; no head-hopping even when scholar’s childhood voice is quoted, because it is filtered through the locksmith’s ear at the grain.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Prose density is extreme yet every image pulls double duty: “dust like moth wings” is simultaneously visual, tactile, and foreshadows the door’s fragility. No synonym loops; each metaphor extends the last without contradiction. Rhythm modulates from long breathless clauses to the final short sentence that lets the valley settle. Only one scaffold trace—“impossible familiarity” could be shaved, but it occurs pre-closure and does not dull the final image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fantasy premise—moon-welded door that eats silence—is made new by treating empathy as the locked cargo. Tropes of the mystical locksmith and the dying-sister token are inverted: the lock wants to open, the hair is the key, the sister’s weakness becomes the mechanism’s strength. Risk of preciousness is neutralized by the locksmith tasting the curl, a visceral move that grounds the metaphysics in salt and spring. Synthesis feels inevitable yet non-obvious, satisfying the transformation test.</comment>
