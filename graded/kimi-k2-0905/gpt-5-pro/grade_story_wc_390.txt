<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction is strong—engineer’s “logic braided with ache” collides in the vault hum—and the final renunciation costs him the Collector’s possible alliance. Still, no bodily detail under peak vibration (only “dust of decades”) keeps embodiment slightly abstract; that caps the 8-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—Collector skiff retreats, key cools to “temperature of trust,” cost felt in the relinquished sale. Causal lens holds throughout; only miniature lapse is sunset clock never visibly pushes tactics, but that is minor.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Drift-ice marina, whale-bone lock, brass key against sternum—each object is tactile and steers choice. “Floe-kiss-pilings” sonic sets up later resonance; final image of key cooling to trust temperature re-weights the object, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—protect Lens-Heart—tightens when Collector demands proof; protagonist’s agency in humming the crystal forecloses negotiation and exposes shared grief. Cost (emotional exposure) is visible, but escalation is single-turn, not multiply braided.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme of absolution-through-vibration emerges from concrete vault act, never sermonized. Final line’s “temperature of trust” re-prices earlier brass heartbeat, turning metal into emotional currency—subtle, earned, non-moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise: “drift-ice marina rang with brittle chimes” teaches sonic motif early; perceptual diction (“salt sweat and limestone singing”) stays inside engineer’s sensorium. Rhythm modulates—long breath for descent, clipped beats for skiff arrival—without syntactic loops.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>High metaphor density but each image advances texture: “sun… burnished the ice like vellum” prepares for later sonic “navigation.” No mixed metaphors, no scaffold; only minor filter verb (“I felt”) could be trimmed, not abundant enough to penalize.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Fusion of maritime gothic with acoustic metaphysics feels fresh; sonic absolution trope is re-cast as literal tuning ritual. Risk in lyric compression is rewarded because closure resonance remains legible.</comment>
