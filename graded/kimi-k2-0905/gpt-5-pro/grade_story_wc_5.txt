<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The alchemist’s interiority is concrete—her charred gloves, the sewing-needle map, the wrist-scar—yet the brother Fen is only a name, so the emotional cost is filtered through lyric memory rather than live relationship. Micro-choices (kneeling until knees “forgot complaint,” freezing her lashes to the raven’s clack) dramatize patience and risk, but the climactic map-reading is summarized, not enacted, softening the felt price. Still, her flaw—believing pulse can outwit white noise—drives every beat and forecloses retreat, earning the eastern march.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the plate prints a pale braid of three pulses that reweights the orchard silence into a road. Causality holds: each beat—etching the plate, bleeding starlight, flash-paper flares—literally maps Fen’s heartbeat onto paper, making the final image inevitable. Cost is visible: the last wax seal and the tripod left behind stand as forfeiture. Orientation is anchored by line 3; no disorientation penalty applies.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The withered orchard is not backdrop but instrument: bark creaks, apples thud, frost forms on lashes—sounds become the metronome for pulse-mapping. Micro-setting migrates to the copper plate itself, its grooves a winter riverbed that dictates direction. Spatial choreography is exact: tripod of broom handles, ice blocks, paper roll—each placement alters what can be read. The final image of warmth printed onto bark satisfies the 9+ gate by charging the exit scene.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—find Fen before white noise erases him—is signaled early and tightened when the plate warms and lines “lean toward the eastern rim.” Escalation is accumulative/textural: each flare adds a pulse-track, density increases, options narrow to that single smooth ridge of snow. Price is paid in real time: starlight spent, wax sealed, tripod abandoned. Agency remains hers; coincidence never intervenes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the equation of heartbeat = map = road: memory is only useful once translated into sacrifice. Subtext lives in silence—raven clack, frost lash, cradlebeat—so the final line “a road she could finally call home” redefines home as motion, not place. No moral is stated; the orchard’s apparent resurrection is left ambiguous, satisfying complexity. The copper plate’s reprise reweights earlier harvest songs into navigation, achieving resonance.</answer>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Voice is lyric-accumulative, rhythmic without drumbeat: “snow had stilled every sound” sets cadence, then “moving stillness that carried more memory than wind” teaches the pattern. Perceptual signature is alchemist-sensory—she tastes cold copper, hears bark knuckles, sees starlight as milk. Compression (“flash-paper alchemist,” “safekept starlight”) is taught early and paid off at closure. No head-hopping; distance stays close-third throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and syntax, propulsion rising as starlight bleeds and flares strobe. Figurative language is disciplined: “copper resembled a winter riverbed” is exact, not ornamental. No loops or synonym churn; each noun is specific (hoarfrost, broom-handle tripod, beeswax coin). Information density is high—every placement of rusty hoops or wire teeth doubles as ritual and cartography. Closure line breathes without scaffolding.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</comment>
<comment>Premise—cartography of pulse via flash-paper and etched heirloom—feels inevitable yet wholly fresh. Tropes (lost sibling, aurora north) are re-forged through alchemist procedure and sonic orchard. Risk of lyric Stillness as tone pays off when silence literally prints the map. Specificity of starlight sealed in wax and the sewing-needle meridians creates an irreplaceable ritual. Transformation test fails if Fen, plate, or crater are swapped—integration is total.</comment>
