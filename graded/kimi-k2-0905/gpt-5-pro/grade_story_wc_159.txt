<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The caretaker’s contradictory impulses—methodical duty vs. the ache of foxglove regret—pulse in every micro-choice; her refusal to seal the crack, though it costs her perfect order, is earned by the teacher’s earlier warning and the on-page tremor that follows Aristea’s blooming.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the open crack, the unfurled name, the orchids ringing under wind—cost is felt in the permanent imperfection she elects to keep. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds; the hairline deduction is for a 1–2 sentence orientation lag before “opal library above clouds” anchors us.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The cracked bamboo is environment-as-tool: its exact split determines which frequencies reach her, directly shaping the final decision to leave it open; the orchids’ dew and the mezzanine window likewise constrain tactics and charge the closing image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>A single cadence shift—choosing fracture over repair—tightens the stake from “preserve all names” to “preserve even broken ones,” with the price of eternal static in the chime; causality under Accumulative lens is coherent, though pressure plateaus rather than spikes twice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The theme that memory survives only through imperfection emerges organically from the cracked tube’s altered song; the final orchid flushing like firelight reweights the motif without moralizing, though the foxglove regret could have bitten one sentence sharper.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical compression (“harp-bright and salt-tender”) is pattern-taught early and paid off; the caretaker’s perceptual signature—cataloging syllables as if shelving dew—remains distinct and distance-controlled under peak stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Almost every sentence layers two jobs (image + motion: “she wound the cracked chime once more, ready to collect what the world had lost”), with only one paraphrase loop (“names… not letters… but the breath behind them”) slightly dulling the blade.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The glass-orchid library that eats breath-prints, the cracked bamboo as wounded flute-map, and the inversion that brokenness enables reception—all synthesize into a fresh emotional engine; the concept commits fully without retreat.</comment>
