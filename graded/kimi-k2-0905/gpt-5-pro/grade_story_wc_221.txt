<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The lone narrator’s interiority is rich and embodied—her refusal to evacuate, her tactile use of the compass rose, her temporal double-vision all crystallize a coherent, flawed self. The final choice to re-aim the lens at bedrock and sign with her mother’s name is earned by the family science ethic seeded early. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene, so the micro-turn feels lightly rather than fiercely motivated, keeping this just below 9.0.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the dome’s “song” reweights the shutdown from failure to migration path, and the cost is the narrator’s permanent exile, felt in the cooling paper. Causal chain holds—sketch smear → vector → bedrock frequency → pattern sent—each because/therefore link tightening options. The orientation anchor arrives by word 60; no debt applied. One minor loop: “echoed silence” is repeated verbatim; does not touches the final image, so −0.1 only.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The time-stained deck, visor grid, and mineral valley are not backdrop but instruments that constrain every tactical move—power reroute must aim at bedrock, coat must tighten to steady hand. The compass rose applique functions as micro-setting: its flashing star times breath and finally dims as closure cost. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true—physicist notices indices, gradients, frequency matches. No slips touch closure; environment charges the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prove the drift is a path, not failure—signals in paragraph 4 and tightens when the smear becomes a vector, foreclosing the board’s “shutdown” verdict. Agency is intellectual but decisive: rerouting lens, signing mother’s name, accepting pariah status; price is irreversible isolation, legible in cooling paper. Escalation is Accumulative/Textural: density of overlays, ink drag, bedrock hum reweight stakes without causal reversals. One tightening suffices; cost is felt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from contested norths—magnetic vs. endurance vs. maternal honesty—without ever naming “theme.” The final image of warmth above the valley reweights “true north” as migratory fidelity to change, not stasis. No moralizing; silence itself is repriced as promise, not void. Complexity lingers: the city may still die, the narrator is still alone, yet the song points onward—ambiguity earned, not evaded.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>First-person lyric voice sustains a physicist’s compressed diction—“temporal gradients,” “frequency matched our temporal drag”—without losing sensory body. Rhythmic control heightens under pressure: clipped sentences when power rerouted, then elongated cadence for valley hum. No head-hopping; perceptual signature remains consistent. Minor register drift—“liturgy” feels slightly ecclesiastical for the speaker’s lexicon—keeps this from 9.0.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sentences do triple duty: “ink bled slowly, like it had to fight the same drag that tugged at our clocks” advances image, stakes, and theme simultaneously. No loops, scaffold, or synonym churn; figurative logic stays physically coherent. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image that recharges “song” and “warmth.” High density with natural rhythm; closure beat untouched by any artifact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The “temporal observation deck as migratory compass” is a fresh synthesis of hard-SF and pastoral myth; the family sky-sketch custom migrates into data analysis, transforming genealogy into instrumentation. Risk—lyric compression of time, silence as character—pays off by making the shutdown a living instrument rather than a ruin. Specificity: gilded applique applied by mother becomes telemetry antenna. Feels inevitable in hindsight, not gimmicky.</comment>
