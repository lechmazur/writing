<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The protagonist’s contradictory identity—arsonist’s daughter turned firefighter—generates immediate, embodied tension; every graft she makes is a micro-choice that costs her both apology and knife-steady resolve. The boy’s arrival applies external pressure, forcing her to articulate the hierarchy of values (mercy over fire), and the final relinquishing of the coin shows endurance with visible cost. Interiority stays concrete, tied to tactile fire-craft; no diagnostic speak. Motivations scale cleanly: the emotional after-image of patricidal heat drives each new willow splice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: each graft and coin-swing thickens the pattern of repair until the breeze-activated chorus reweights the meaning of “scars can sing.” Orientation is swift—lagoon, dunes, charred trunks all named by word 50; no penalty. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the coin left singing in trees crystallizes the stance of unyielding compassion and imprints an audible, conceptual cost—she forever forfeits her private metronome. Causality holds; every splice is because/therefore motivated by the need to coax sound from wound.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Obsidian lagoon, volcanic sand, salt-streaked coin, and charred trunks are all specific, sensuous tools that constrain grafting technique and tune the final sonic image. Micro-setting (the scored bark cleft) functions as operating table and sound-box; environment is handled in lived, tactile ways. Weather is literal pressure—wind that the coin must find—so setting actively guides choice. No postcard catalogue; each detail is filtered through fire-trained attention to airflow and cambium life.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The dominant stake—prove scars can sing—tightens as each successful graft narrows the risk of silence; the boy’s burn scar personalizes the test. One meaningful escalation: the coin’s first whisper from a charred trunk proves the method, shifting her from private ritual to communal instruction. Cost is paid in relinquishing the coin and in the perpetual vigilance the singing trunks will require. Agency is continuous; every splice is an on-page decision that could fail.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of sonic forgiveness emerges from the concrete grafts and metallic wind-notes; no character sermonizes the moral. Subtext resides in the red thread’s color of both violence and suture, and in the coin of an unknown monarch—legacy of arbitrary power now repurposed for mercy. The final image of “kept promise” lagoon reframes black glass as mirror of ongoing accountability rather than closure. Complexity is preserved: fire’s voice is not denied, only answered.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>First-person voice carries a disciplined, lyrical compression that mirrors firefighter breath-control; perceptual signature is heat-scarred, water-cool. Figurative risk is high yet pattern-taught early (“heat like handwriting”) and paid off in final tide-song. No head-hopping; boy’s interior is responsibly limited to relaxed forearm. Syntax modulates from long, tide-like clauses to terse splice commands, aligning with hazard rhythm.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm is musical without algorithmic repetition; sentence openings vary, paragraphs breathe. Information density strong—one sentence often layers tool, memory, and moral calculus (“sand was ballast, memory, and polish”). Two minor metaphor muddles (“private sky” / “bass string sleeping”) but never at climax. No scaffold loops; coin, sand, thread reappear with changed function rather than synonym churn.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Fusing arson legacy with musical grafting is fresh; trope of healing fire scars is inverted into acoustic horticulture. Specificity—volcanic black sand as both polish and glare reducer—grounds novelty. Risk of lyric overwriting is embraced but controlled by on-site procedure detail. Conceptual through-line (sound from scar) makes ending feel inevitable yet non-obvious.</comment>
