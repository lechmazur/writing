<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The archivist’s calm is more stated than dramatized; the tremble Ole notices is the single embodied crack, not a sustained contradiction under pressure. Interiority is lyrical but diffuse—more cosmic than character-specific—so micro-choices feel lightly authored rather than wrestled. Still, the final lighter case and the town’s bow supply a visible cost and earned stasis, keeping the arc coherent.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Charged Poise: the wing-span installation holds the town under quiet pressure, the map-case is now empty, and the narrator’s promise to “return tomorrow” foregrounds ongoing care; cost is felt in the collective hush and the literal weight lost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout: each pinned photograph adds density until the corridor becomes a single membrane of shared memory. Causality is lyric rather than event-driven, but the final image reweights all prior fragments with undeniable communal stakes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lavender scent steadies heartbeat, rebar harp strings, smokestack as spine—every detail is sensory, selective, and filtered through the archivist’s curatorial eye. The factory ruins and lavender field act as micro-setting that literally supports the catwalk of memories; removal would collapse the spatial logic of the installation. Weather (storm, returning sun) is not backdrop but tension wire that forces extra clothespins and communal lean, charging the final wing image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—“an exhibition of remembrance that could breathe on its own”—tightens through each added arc of photographs; the corridor physically narrows options until the only path is to stand inside the collective wing. No external antagonist is needed: the pressure is the town’s fear that memory will crush them, met by the archivist’s insistence on shared authorship. Cost is visible in Ole’s bow and Marta’s shaded eyes, but the escalation is more textured accumulation than decisive reversal, keeping it just below top band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: communal grief transformed into a living architecture that can shelter rather than wound. Subtext lives in gesture—Ole’s single nod, children braiding air—never in commentary. The final image of a town seeing itself through windows rather than mirrors offers a resonant, non-moral answer to the central question of how to carry pain.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The voice is a sustained lyric drone, syntactically repetitive (“then we…then we…”) that teaches its incantatory pattern early and pays off in the communal percussion of footsteps. Perceptual signature is archivist-specific: photographs “brittle as moth wings,” lines “like catgut harp strings,” grief’s dislike of “sudden brightness.” No head-hopping; the plural “we” stays a collective lens, not individual interiorities. Register remains poet-curator throughout, modulating only in the children’s metaphors that rename the spiral.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Lines are dense—“faces bloomed in grayscale,” “paper gears spun in cardboard presses”—but each image advances either memory-corridor texture or communal pressure. Rhythm is deliberate incantation; occasional stacked metaphors (“river, rib cage, street where lamps never burn out”) are justified as children’s improvised naming. No synonym loops or scaffold; every paragraph either adds a photograph, a body, or a weather threat. Closure line “the masterpiece is not the pictures but the space we made to linger together inside them” is clean, propulsive, conceptually re-pricing.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The memory-installation-as-wing is a fresh synthesis of community art therapy, industrial decay, and botanical reclamation. Risk is taken in the lyric collective “we” and the refusal of singular heroics; the town itself becomes protagonist. Specificity of machinists pinning memories to rebar keeps the concept grounded. The final image of a half-folded wing holding citizens under its span feels inevitable yet non-obvious in hindsight.</comment>
