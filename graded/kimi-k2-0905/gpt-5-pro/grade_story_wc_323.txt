<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The instructor’s drive to “navigate by starlight” is embodied in every beat: the chain-link ritual, the petition risk, the final ascent. Contradictory impulses—safety of trench expansion vs. the blind urge upward—are held in tense, simultaneous breath. The father’s anchor both moors and launches him; the ring’s zero-shape becomes a horizon scale. Closure crystallizes this hierarchy of values: the city’s hum recedes, the sky reclaims, cost is the solitude of light.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal chain is clean: alien arrival → dome ethic → edge geometry → petition → ascent. Each because/therefore tightens options; the council’s sigh is the last external brake before the final ascent. Closure is a Decisive Change: they physically rise, horizon re-weighted by the ring’s live ellipse. Cost is legible: the city’s farewell hum is a sonic amputation—future isolation audible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Benthic pressure is not backdrop but actuator: cracked dome patched to scumble, anchor ring warming under projector, tidal sky of kelp-shadow latitudes. Every sensory note is filtered through instructor POV—professional, tactile, devotional. The chain link’s evolving temperature and weight constrain micro-timing of the ascent. Final image: starlight filaments sift through salt-stung glass—environmental mirror of the instructor’s internal perforated wonder.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—orient without surface trust—tightens once: council permission as narrow sigh. Escalation is driven by instructor agency: petition draft, ring-scale lesson, route calculation; no coin-flip rescue. Visible price: dome crack becomes literal corridor window—habitation safety traded for skyward slot. Pressure narrows to a single moon-tide minute; failure equals “snapped brittle threads.”</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from specific inversion: beneath = cathedral, anchor = zero = horizon, edge = instrument. No moral sermon; resonance is imagistic reweighting of loss as orientation. Final image re-prices the premise: starlight is no longer above but ahead, reachable only by leaving the breathing city. Ambiguity—are they exiles or pioneers—is earned, not tacked on.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lyrical compression—“domes condense like tears along their ribs”—maintains instructor’s devotional precision without purple drift. Perceptual signature is consistent: light is grain, kelp, filaments; mathematics is storm-remembered. Syntax flexes with pressure: short clauses during ascent mirror heartbeat. No head-hop; collective “we” stays anchored in instructor’s consciousness.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops, zero scaffold; each sentence twins sensory payload with causal push—“projector hum, chain link rings softly when it warms.” Metaphors stay within aquatic physics: refractions knife, plankton pixels, tidal sky. Rhythm accelerates into ascent without syntactic monotony. Final line cadence—solitary star / answering star—mirrors ring’s zero, closing sonic bracket.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>Synthesis of submarine survival manual with mystic star-chart is fresh; edge geometry as navigable seam feels inevitable post-alien. Risk—lyric density in compressed word count—heightens awe without obscuring causality. Specificity anchors universality: methane-vent fisher Inea, cuttlefish-bone craft, monorail terminus crack. Transformation test fails if relocated to land; salt pressure is non-transferable.</comment>
