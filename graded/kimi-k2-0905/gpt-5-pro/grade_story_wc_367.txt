<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The narrator’s custodial identity, storm-baiting laughter, and lineage-taught craft are vivid and embodied; contradictory impulses (joy vs. dread) run together in the same beats. Micro-choices—cooling the wick, scratching runes—reveal hierarchy of values under pressure. The final act of re-wrapping the wick shows earned endurance with cost: “glass also needs tenderness.” Interiority stays concrete, though occasional lyric height drifts toward label-speak (“shadowed elation”), slightly blunting peak immediacy.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Drives under Accumulative/Textural lens: lyrical repetitions, beam/laughter/storm pattern grows density until the gyre’s pivot reweights stakes. Closure lands as Earned Stasis—lighthouse stands, narrator reaffirms custodial craft—cost felt in “older and lighter” log entry and the wick’s tenderness. Causality intact: laugh → gyre hooks → beam braids storm into beneficent rain. Orientation anchored by word 30; no lens drift. One scaffold loop (“the beam maps the gyre, and the gyre maps…”) grazes closure but does not obscure image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Selective, POV-filtered coastal detail: salt-fog, groaning docks, pollen from vanished forests—each mirrored in narrator’s body and tool. Lighthouse interior is micro-setting whose convex lens and hairline fractures constrain every tactical move. Spatial choreography holds as narrator climbs, cools, rewraps wick while gyre threads harbor. Final image of pollen on future orchard ground charges setting with conceptual cost, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake: town survival vs. annihilating gyre, signaled in headline “the sea edits… with foam.” Tightening occurs when accidental laugh pivots gyre landfall, foreclosing offshore death model and raising personal culpability. Agency: narrator steers light via rune-scratched wick, trades terror for beneficent irrigation; visible price is exhaustion and custodial loneliness felt in final log line. Cost is legible, though escalation leans on lyrical accumulation more than successive reversals.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme: stewardship, laughter as communal covenant, and art’s power to re-script natural catastrophe emerge through prismatic beam and pollen without overt statement. Motif of obsolete newsprint shadows evolves from saved obituary grain to final “headline” the sea rewrites, reweighting meaning at closure. Subtext in gull-echoed laughter and the drone’s nowhere coordinates invites reflection on invisible authorship. Avoids moralizing; final orchard promise stays implicit.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is salt-tinged, thunder-bell cadence: consonant clusters, helical syntax, tidal rhythm that surges and recedes with emotional pressure. Diction stays within coastal custodian lexicon while reaching for luminous metaphor; no filter-verb clutter. Compression taught early (“laughter was the oil, storms the gears”) pays off in closure’s braided light. No head-hopping; first-person POV holds steady with psychic distance tightening under glass-hum choir.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High information density: single sentences fuse sensory, emotional, and world data (“lamp… burns from a glass lantern wick whose secrets my grandmother smuggled in stories”). Metaphors are wild yet internally coherent—storm as reader, gyre as waltzing cathedral—never collapsing into mixed logic. Minor paraphrase loop in harbor-braid repetition costs −0.2; otherwise rhythm breathes with scene urgency. Read-aload ear shows deliberate variance in sentence length and stress aligned with beam rotation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Premise fuses climate-fantasy with bibliophilic elegy: obsolete print culture transmuted into photonic ritual feels inevitable in hindsight. Transformation test fails if custodian, wick, and pollen-core storm are swapped—specificity is high. Risk in lyric elision and storm-personification fully commits without safety-hedging; coherence sustained. Familiar lighthouse trope inverted into refractive loom that rewrites weather, not merely warns—fresh inflection charges closure.</comment>
