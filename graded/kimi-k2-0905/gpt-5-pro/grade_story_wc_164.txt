<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>The protagonist’s vocation and interior logic are vivid, but interiority drifts into lyrical abstraction that blurs micro-choice; the promise to “keep the cave safe” lands as gentle epiphany rather than renunciation with cost. Emotional embodiment is strong in early beats (“my hands carried a disk…”) yet flattens in the final third into ambient narration. Still, the voice stays character-specific and the occupation drives every action, satisfying the 9- gate for contradiction-in-scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the cave’s new “half visible, half song” compromise reweights the premise, felt cost is legible in the narrator’s smudged fingers and shadowed smile. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of seed/glass/cave glow accumulates meaning until the final cadence shift. Orientation anchors within 120 words; no ambiguity at closure. One soft spot: the bird’s late arrival introduces an off-page rule tweak, but the cave’s sigh immediately reclaims agency, so causality holds.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The geode-cave is tactile, sonic, and mutable—“crystal ribs,” “glittering ribs,” “cheerful gloom”—and directly shapes tactics: the cave eats paths, forcing seed-mapping and soot-glyphs. Sensory hierarchy skews to light and texture, justified by the narrator’s glass tool. Spatial choreography is clean; no white-room. Environment constrains the final image: the ledge where glass rests becomes the cave’s “wink,” charging closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—preserve tender stories without erasing travelers—tightens once: the cave’s vanishing paths must be re-mapped without trampling them. Escalation is Accumulative: each seed-thread adds density until the compromise ribbon blossoms, foreclosing pure preservation or pure access. Cost is visible in narrator’s smudged fingers and the bird’s negotiated future labor. No reversal, but single deepening is sufficient for 600-word scope.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through concrete paradox—absence as kindness—without sermon. Final image of “absence can hum you home” offers Conceptual Repricing that reweights earlier vanished paths. Subtext stays in gesture: the miner & dancer exist only as negative corridors, yet their chord is felt. No final-paragraph thesis statement; resonance is built from particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Perceptual signature is unmistakable: maritime verb hoard (“recollectionist,” “newsprint foam”), synesthetic shifts (“light grins sadly”), and rhythmic anaphora taught early. No head-hopping; POV distance stable. Compression (“cobweb math,” “cheerful as a bruise”) is patterned and paid off at closure. Voice modulates under pressure: shorter clauses during corridor collapse, then lyrical elongation at ribbon birth.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>High information density: single sentences handle atmosphere, tool action, and emotional transliteration. No paraphrase loops; metaphor vehicles stay internally consistent (foam/tide/glass). One minor scaffold: “the cave listened…sighed like a bell after rain” followed immediately by “cheerful gloom, it said without a mouth” — slight echo but cadence justifies the bell/mouth pairing. Closure image crystal-clear.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Premise—sentient geode that digests footpaths—feels fresh yet inevitable. Synthesis of oceanic and lithic imagery creates new mythic logic. Risk in lyric accumulation pays off: the reader accepts “seed-born thread” as travel instruction because pattern is taught early. Final ribbon of glow is a non-obvious but earned compromise. No derivative echo of famous cave stories.</comment>
