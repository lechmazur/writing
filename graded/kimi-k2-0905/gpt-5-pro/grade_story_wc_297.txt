<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The narrator’s “root-bound” state is viscerally embodied—ankles braided, heart pinned—while the girl’s quartz-laden arrival forces a mutual scar-reading that crystallizes their shared covenant. Interior contradiction is palpable: hunger to move versus physical tethering, terror versus yes-saying. The final “step into the shared wind” is earned by the accumulating tactile micro-choices that loosen the roots; cost is felt as ribs ring like a bell. Voice remains singular, never drifting into diagnostic abstraction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the covenant slides into alignment, ribs ring, and the glade rewrites its own blueprint—undeniable conceptual cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout; each image layer (maze-veins, scar-sparks, quartz clicks) intensifies until the crosswind reweights possibility. Orientation is taught early (“cobalt glade at dusk”) and pays off in the final lung-opening. No causality breaks; the eclipse cheating time is the inciting condition, not a late convenience.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The glade is no postcard: its grass-paths wake only when the clipping is traced, making setting an active agent that reconfigures choice. Micro-setting—the maze-raised welts on skin—literally maps the route to the center, charging the final image. Cobalt dusk is filtered through a visionary bias that notices sap-memory over sight, grounding otherworldly events in sensory specificity. Spatial choreography is immaculate; bodies never float or teleport.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will the covenant be completed or remain eclipsed—tightens when the maze-topiary welts converge and bells ring in the marrow. One meaningful deepening: scars link, knowledge doubles, and the crosswind offers a single life-path, foreclosing infinite futures. Agency is collective yet visceral: pressing joined scars into air opens the lung-room; cost is the audible bell-in-bones. No coincidence resolves; the early-arrived future merely frames the pressure that protagonists must answer.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the eclipse of promises: covenants hidden in time, not broken, demand completion through wounded flesh rather than speech. The final image—covenant shining from within after night yields—restructures the entire color palette (cobalt, quartz, scar-bloom) into a non-literal answer about commitment transcending chronology. No moralizing; the meaning is felt as ribs become bell, glade becomes lung. Ambiguity lingers: which life will bloom in the crosswind is left open, but the cost of choosing is undeniable.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is a sustained lyric cadence—compression, elision, internal rhyme—taught in the first sentence and held to the last without opacity. Perceptual signature is visionary-botanic: “sap that remembers centuries,” “quartz the color of storm milk”; no head-hopping. Syntax mirrors entanglement—long braids of clauses that tighten into single verbs (“we step into the shared wind without taking a step”). Non-standard grammar (“the vows breathe under their own eclipse”) is consistent, motivated, and legible.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies from propulsive anaphora to hushed single-beat fragments; no template cadence. Metaphors are precise—maze-veins, scar-doors, bell-in-marrow—never mixed or contradictory. Information density is high: one sentence often layers time, body, and covenant (“I press the maze into my wrist…”). Only micro-loop is the echo of “root-bound / braided / pinned,” but it works as incantatory recurrence, not scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The future arriving early as a cobalt hush, a garden that solved people, and scars as readable door-keys constitute a fresh synthesis of climate-fantasy and mythic botanic. Risk is high—lyric ellipsis, shared voice figure, eclipse as literal timeline cheat—yet coherence never frays. The intersection of dreams materializes as a lung-room where unlived evenings ferry futures back to tide: an image that feels both ancient and newly coined. Without these exact elements the story collapses; their specificity is inseparable from emotional charge.</comment>
