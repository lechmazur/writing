<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mira’s contradictory drives—molecular precision vs. human repair—are embodied in every micro-choice (pocketing the chrysalis as metronome, muddy fingers anchoring filaments). The brother’s arrival is credibly reluctant, their shared teeter on the bridge a lived embodiment of altered status. Interiority stays concrete and sensorially braided; the final renunciation of the chrysalis costs her the talisman she clung to, earned by prior causality. No stock epiphanies—just a stance crystallized in tensile notes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the polymer bridge flexes under their combined weight, reweighting separation into connection while the chrysalis sinks—undeniable conceptual cost. Causal lens holds throughout: because she traced foam, therefore she designs zip/unzip polymers; because she invites, he hesitates then steps—tightening options. The empty-shell image persists as constraint that shaped tactics. Cost legible in the final muted C of wind and heron flight—no exposition needed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The braided ravine is not backdrop but active constraint: forked channels dictate filament placement, foam patterns teach polymer design, alder roots serve as anchors. Micro-setting—the chrysalis tied to her wrist—literally guides her timing. Environment charges the final image as the released shell spins away, reweighting grief. Spatial choreography is immaculate; distances and water hiss track across every step.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—translate separation into connection—tightens when the filament bridge will fail unless both step. One meaningful escalation: the text-message thumbs-up cracks open possibility, narrowing options to shared physical test. Price is visibly paid: muddy graphite fingers, slipping foot, startled heron—stakes made visceral. No coincidence; pressure coheres under causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from braiding motifs: rivers, polymers, sibling chords—no moralizing. The chrysalis reprises as both grief-metronome and released shell, reweighting meaning without statement. Final image of loosened grief breathing back into human chorus offers resonant non-literal answer. Subtext in silence and wrist-touch carries apology louder than dialogue.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature—Mira’s symphonic ear—colors every notice: streams “remember a song,” wind offers “muted C.” Syntax swells and breathes like score, mirroring filament tension. No head-hop; brother’s voice distinct in terse text icon vs. her sensorial cadence. Compression taught early (“zipper of departure”) stays legible at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; sentences avoid template cadence despite lyrical density. Information density high—each line does double duty (e.g., “froth along split channels” conveys both setting and polymer insight). Zero paraphrase loops; no mixed metaphors. Final line “loosened grief… rejoin the human chorus” lands clean, propelling closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: polymer science + riparian morphology + sibling repair, made inevitable through foam-pattern insight. Chrysalis as metronome then released shell transforms familiar grief object into non-literal reconfiguration. Risk of underwater adhesive bridge pays off without gimmickry. Specificity—from hydrogen bonds to heron flight—anchors universals in particulars unmatched by template.</comment>
