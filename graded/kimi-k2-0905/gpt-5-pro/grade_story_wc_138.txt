<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The immortal’s boredom and search for post-goodbye meaning give interior motive, but his decisive act—shifting the curse to Mara—reads as convenience rather than earned growth; contradictions are stated (“bored yet patient”) yet not dramatized under pressure. Mara’s courier façade offers secondary pressure, but her secrecy is asserted, never tested, so the relationship crucible remains theoretical.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Closure lands cleanly: curse transfer frees the immortal, spatial corridor appears, cost is felt. Causal chain (coils → fragment speaks → geometry bends → Mara accepts curse) holds. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive within 120 words; no ambiguity at end. Lens: Causal, coherent.</comment>

<comment>“Prismatic escondite,” copper coils, and magnetic auroras create a vivid, sensory-filtered pocket world that actively warps during spatial mutiny, constraining the climax. Solar storm threads color and time pressure without checklist excess. Spatial choreography stays clean as angles curve and floor “steps away.”</comment>

<grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“discover what happens after goodbye”—is signaled early; tightening occurs when geometry bends and fragment jumps to Mara, narrowing options. Cost (curse exile) is visible. Agency is present but protagonist engineers transfer rather than facing irreversible self-loss; hence mid-band.</comment>

<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>First-person immortal voice owns a lush, elliptical diction (“lances of light,” “ledger of days”) distinct from courier Mara’s crisper intrusion. Syntax swells and contracts with auroral tension; no head-hop. Patterned elision is taught early (“hushed thunder”) and paid off in final hush.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentences layer image and causality. Occasional metaphor stacks (“tooth in dream,” “cliff spoken aloud”) risk purple but stay legible. Minor scaffold: “hush carried thunder” echoed thrice; filter verbs light. No clarity break at closure.</comment>

<grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Immortal curse-transfer as spatial-mutiny catalyst feels fresh; magnetic aurora linguistics twist familiar sci-fantasy tropes. Concept commits fully without late rule patch. Specific diction and polar micro-setting prevent generic swap-out, though “bored immortal” archetype is recognizable.</comment>

<comment>Setup: pocketed early; Development: fragment steers coil calibration and geometry warp; Payoff: jump to Mara enables immortal’s release. Two beats plus causal pressure and closure linkage; irreplaceable.</comment>
