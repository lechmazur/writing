<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The narrator’s interior contradiction—wanting to record yet using a film-less camera—anchors every beat; the micro-choice to “click” empty shutters dramatizes renunciation with visible cost. The advisor’s quiet charisma is palpable in gesture rather than label, her tap on the camera serving as concrete pressure. The ending’s Earned Stasis (carrying home the empty camera) forecloses the path of tangible memory, paid for by the ache in the narrator’s tingling fingers. Flaw: one moment of diagnostic self-awareness (“joyful sorrow”) just before closure; still, the body-as-shore image rescues immediacy.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the empty camera click reweights the entire premise—absence now “contains the whole harbor breathing.” Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens; each signed phrase thickens silence until the bay literally retunes. Orientation is taught lyrically within 120 words; disorientation serves the payoff. Persistent constraint: the camera’s hollowness shapes every tactic and the final image with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The harbor is not backdrop but instrument: chalked constellations on pier planks constrain footfall, and mapped silences cancel gull cries, directly enabling the regatta halt. The camera-body dyad functions as micro-setting, its cracked leather “desert map” guiding the narrator’s renunciation. Moonlight as metronome supplies coherent temporal pressure. Gate met: environment constrains tactics and charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“translate silence into music”—is signaled early and tightens when the police launch approaches; the deckhand’s spontaneous signing narrows options from protest to shared hymn. Escalation is textural: each signed phrase adds density until boats slow, a visible price paid in social risk. No coincidence; curiosity alone halts hulls. Cost is legible in the narrator’s emptied shutter and the harbor’s retuned hush.</question>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges entirely through image: silence as score, moon as metronome, absence as container. No moralizing—final line leaves the “blank squared eye” to hold memory, a Conceptual Repricing that reweights every prior click. Subtext lives in gesture: the police captain’s softening face says more than policy. Joyful sorrow is earned, not labeled, when gulls wing vowels at dawn.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>First-person lyric voice sustains a salt-stung perceptual signature—tides “hum arithmetic,” knuckles “knock like masts.” Rhythmic control mirrors breath under moonlight; no filter-verb stacks. Elision is taught early (“empty back is a door”) and paid off in final click. No head-hopping; whispered and signed registers remain distinct without convergence under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>High information density: one sentence can stage, sense, and symbol (“chalk the pier with soft constellations, mapping quiet pockets where footsteps cancel”). Metaphors stay coherent within maritime acoustics; no mixed vehicles. Sentence rhythm accelerates toward the regatta halt, then lengthens into the hush. One paraphrase loop—“joyful sorrow” named then felt—dulls momentarily but does not touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise—non-violent silence symphony staged via sign language and empty camera—feels inevitable yet unexampled. Risk of preciousness averted by dockhand grit: dishwashers, widowers, salt-slick knuckles. The retuned harbor as living instrument is a fresh inflection that could not swap settings without collapse. Transformation test passed: plot and emotional arc disintegrate if transposed to, say, a prairie.</comment>
