<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The lantern-maker’s grief-need is vivid and embodied (“dress in ache”), but interiority drifts toward poetic label-stack (“luminous torment”) that blurs contradicting impulses. Micro-choices (polish gem, fold crane) map motive to action and earn the closing reconciliation. Shadow-return lands as earned stasis with visible cost—relinquishing the cranes and accepting residual brightness. Still, the lyric register edges into performed self-diagnosis, keeping the score sub-9.</comment>

<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each polished gem and folded crane thickens the emotional density until the basilica release reconfigures weight/buoyancy. Closure—the shadow nesting back—pays conceptual cost (grief not erased, re-balanced) and is cued from the first line. Orientation is taught by image, waived; no causal break. Pattern holds cleanly to the humming panes final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Floating tea garden, glass basilica, and lantern tools are concretely handled—steam poured into hull-cups, cranes threaded with kite-string—so setting constrains tactics. Selective sensory hierarchy (scent of rain on iron) mirrors emotional stakes. Spatial choreography stays intact across the spiral ascent. Environment charges the final image: vibrating panes = crystallized cost.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: transmute blinding grief into liftable weight. Escalation accrues through lantern-load of stones and cranes; each act forecloses time/stamina. Final tightening: releasing the cranes costs the treasured paper memories, paid on page. Agency remains interior but causal under Accumulative lens; no reversal, yet options narrow to accept/decline final surrender of cranes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as the price of carrying light without burning: grief origami becomes literal ballast. No sermon; final image of shadow nesting reweights brightness as bearable load. Subtext in silence—cranes vanish into color, no Lio apparition—honors absence. Conceptual repricing achieved: reader re-sees earlier “luminous torment” as necessary equilibrium.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>First-person voice sustains a jeweler’s tactile diction: “grind opals thin as petals,” “crease each wing with fingertip still tingling.” Rhythm modulates—long breathless clauses vs. clipped “A thousand will be required”—mirroring fatigue. No head-hop; lyric compression is taught early and paid off. Perceptual signature unique: notices steam, odor of iron, string vibration—never generic.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</question>
<comment>High information density: single sentences deliver setting, action, emotion (“I polish, polish, until a gleam opens…”). Metaphors stay coherent (lanterns as oars) and are not over-packed in peak beats. Micro-loop spotted—“polish, polish” intentional, patterned. Final third clean; no clarity loss. Could trim occasional adjectival stacks but none obscure closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses sky-floating monastery, dream-capture stained glass, and origami grief-ballast—specific synthesis not template. Risk of preciousness offset by grounded tool-work and calloused hands. Transformation test fails if setting renamed, indicating genuine novelty. One fresh inflection: shadow as detachable ballast rather than moral absence.</comment>
