<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The narrator’s contradictory impulses—yearning to understand the father yet resisting premature crossing—are rendered through embodied micro-choices (holding the logbook to the light, breathing until pulse steadies). The final renunciation of closing the cedar frame earns its cost because the prior beats have made “necessary distance” a lived constraint. Interiority stays concrete, never drifts into label-speak. Cap enforced: closure choice is earned, but the single-POV reflection mode keeps relational crucible off-stage, so 9+ gate not cleared.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of light-through-holes aligning wood grain to runway threshold crystallizes into Charged Poise with undeniable cost—“the distance steps into me.” Orientation anchored by 120 words; transitions within the drifting terrace are legible. No causality breaks; logbook, cedar frame, and fog-day rule all persist as constraints. Closure lands on-page with felt reconfiguration; persistent price (frame left open) shapes final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prism terrace, cedar frame, and logbook act as micro-settings that physically constrain choice: the frame is “nothing to close, everything to cross,” the desk’s wood grain becomes the runway. Sensory hierarchy obeys POV—pilot’s eye for wind, dew, glide-slope imagery. Spatial choreography is clean; body, book, and light track continuously. Environment directly charges the final image, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“why some thresholds feel sacred”—tightens once: the narrator must decide whether to cross the cedar frame. Fog-day rule and logbook codes foreclose early crossing; stepping back leaves the frame open, paying visible cost. Escalation is textural: light alignment, grain runway, then the Mouth of Return revelation. Sufficient for 600-word scope; cost is legible on final line.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from concrete particulars: necessary distance is first corn aisle, then glide-slope, finally the unclosed frame. Final image reweights earlier material without moralizing—“doors worth crossing should never pretend to guard.” Sacredness reframed as attention stretched across measurable space. No thematic echo violation; no platitudes. Resonant reconfiguration satisfies 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>First-person voice carries a pilot’s perceptual signature: wind, visibility, grain as runway, “airport of the desk.” Rhythm modulates from fractured hush to steady pulse, mirroring decision pressure. Patterned elision (“featherly determined”) is taught early and paid off. No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens exactly at threshold beat. Distinct syntax and diction remain stable under stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings avoid template cadence. Figurative language is selective, never clogs high-pressure beats. Information density high: “light passes through the margin holes and lands on the wood grain, aligning winds to rings” does triple duty. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold. Minor filter verbs (“I begin analyzing”) do not dull immediacy. Closure image remains crystal.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Father-as-airspace-designer and sacred-threshold interrogation synthesize into fresh angle on absence/return. Risky lyric compression taught by 25% and paid off. Specificity of pilot weather code + carpentry grain map feels irreplaceable. Transformation test: swap out aviation or wood lore and the emotional calculus collapses. Bold structural choice heightens meaning without gimmickry.</comment>
