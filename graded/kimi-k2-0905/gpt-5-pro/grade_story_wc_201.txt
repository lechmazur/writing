<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The survivor’s embodied trauma—breath “low double tap,” wrists trying “to twist apart”—is viscerally particular; the proprioceptive upgrade turns every joint into a lie-detector, forcing micro-choices (looped strap not tightened) that externalize mercy’s equation. Interiority stays sensorial, never diagnostic; the renunciation of the strap at the boundary tree costs the only tool he owns, earning stasis. No second character on stage, so relationship bullets N/A.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of UV-lit re-entries (forest→pool→return) tightens via sensory density, not causal reversals. Closure is Charged Poise—strap left as boundary condition, “ordinary dark” ahead—conceptual cost legible: the equation stays unsolved, the forest keeps the proof. Orientation anchored by line 3 (“ultraviolet forest”), no lens ambiguity; one shard with seamless time flow.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>UV pollen that “drinks…light” and pewter that “remembers fingerprints” are idiosyncratic, body-scaled details; the forest’s maze literally re-orders footsteps, constraining the recursive path that solves the mercy theorem. Spatial choreography is immaculate—reed corridor → white clearing → still pool → border tree—each pivoting the strap’s meaning. Micro-setting (mask strap) doubles as tool and moral slide-rule, charging final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake: can he derive mercy without re-becoming instrument? Escalation is textural—each corridor layers sensory bruise until pool offers mirror-still “equation solved,” tightening the cost of leaving the strap behind. No antagonist needed; UV penance itself applies pressure. Final renunciation forecloses return, price paid on page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from recursive footfall: mercy = approach curve, asymptote of un-reached harm. Subtext resides in pewter’s memory and the refusal to tighten the strap—an equation weighted by injury yet relinquished. No moralizing; final image of “ordinary dark” re-prices premise, leaving reader with conceptual after-cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>First-person lyric voice carries scientist’s lexicon (“proprioceptively,” “boundary condition”) yet sensory—syntax stretches like tendons under stress (“count backward, heel by toe”). No dialogue, so bullets skipped; perceptual signature consistent, no head-hop. Compression taught early (“echolocation map”) and paid off at still-pool reflection.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density: single sentences weld metal memory, corridor math, and bodily spasm. Metaphors never mixed; “bruised humming” stays acoustic-physical. One scaffold trace: “I count backward” echoed twice in 30 words (−0.2); otherwise zero loops. Final line cadence drops into survivable cadence, no artifact near closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: torture survivor × biomechanical upgrade × recursive forest maze = original conceit. UV penance as algorithmic purgatory flips usual trauma-therapy arc into math quest. Risk of abstraction countered by bone-level sensorium. Transformation test passes—story collapses without strap-rule and joint-angle prayer.</comment>
