<question>1</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The registrar’s interior contradiction—fear of exposure vs need for transparency—remains stated in lyric summary rather than dramatised in a single moment of micro-choice; the shared silence with Rell registers as parallel confession rather than crucible that alters relationship state. The final “we learned” abstracts the cost, muting embodied emotion. Still, the occupation-specific duties and ledger guilt ground the motive and the lens-owning beat shows clear hierarchy of values.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the public projection of doodle-truths reweights the museum’s moral rule-set with undeniable social cost, felt in Rell’s surrendered pass and the narrator’s logged confession. Causal chain holds—lens examination → pattern recognition → public exposure → mutual admission—though escalation is lyric-accumulative rather than sharp. Orientation is lyric-delayed but ultimately functional; lens pattern taught by 25% mark. Cost legible in “I logged my confession” and the resonant hush that now includes spectators.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The crystal forecourt’s rain-hum functions as micro-setting: wet tiles dictate silent footfall, lamp halos determine where the frame can be hung, rain-pooled negatives literally host the projected truth. Object-as-setting (lens + gauze) constrains the final tactic; weather governs the hush that replaces speech. Specificity is selective—no museum catalogue yet every rain bead earns its place. Spatial choreography clean; bodies track around frame and columns without drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</question><comment>Dominant stake—transparency vs protective silence—tightens once: the narrator’s decision to move from private watching to public showing narrows future options irreversibly. Pressure is situational/accumulative: each decoded doodle adds moral weight until the frame becomes inevitable. Cost visible in the hush that now includes strangers and in Rell’s tracing of replica seam. No artificial reversals; coincidence only complicates reputation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: mercy-through-forgery vs mercy-through-exposure, never sermonised. The violin doodle’s ache and the lens-ghosts embody the moral bind; final image of strangers watching their own sketches reweights prior material without statement. Subtext operates in gesture—palms open, pass barcode-down. No thematic echo sentences; complexity accepted. Resonant ambiguity lingers: rain still blurs glass, memory still fogs.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>First-person lyric voice maintains consistent perceptual signature: rain as bowls, confetti as salt, history as sharp stone. Syntax grows breathless under pressure—“I carried the tickets, the lens, and a portable frame”—mirrors hurried resolve. Compressed diction taught early; payoff in final projected clauses. No head-hop; interior access strictly bound to registrar. Dialogue absent by design; silence voiced through syntax.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>High figurative density risks purple drift but each vehicle advances mood or theme: rain-beads as connecting dots, lamp-halos as forgetting. No mixed metaphors; physical logic intact. Rhythm clusters in threes echo museum catalog order, pattern justified. Scaffold almost absent—one paraphrase loop (“after words become unnecessary” repeated) mildly dulls; otherwise propulsion clean. Final line cadence earns rest.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: lens-as-forensic-tool + concert-doodle crowdsourced evidence + silent public exhibition converts lyric collage into moral reckoning. Risk of wordless climax pays off; conventional confrontation would feel noisy. Premise not derivative; museum-forgery-for-mercy angle newly inflected through bureaucratic night registrar. Specific detail (barcode down, salt of paper snow) inimitable. Transformation test fails if relocated—requires museum tile acoustics.</comment>
