<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The sculptor’s interiority is sensorially textured and motive-coherent; yet the only decisive micro-choice—strumming the wires after the hedgehog’s nod—carries no visible cost, keeping the arc shy of a full renunciation or transformation. Internal contradiction is lyrically implied but not dramatized in a single painful beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Charged Poise: the quiet phrase is offered to river, hedgehog, grove, and the world re-weights itself; the cost is the perpetual return, the vow of listening that forecloses louder triumphs. Lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern is taught by the first paragraph’s echo of “create music in a silent world” and re-energized in the final line without causal ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The porcelain insulator, copper leaves, and hair-thin wires function as micro-setting; their tactile handling constrains every tuning gesture and re-appears in the final image, mending air like fabric. Spatial anchors (fern roots, river ankle-lean) are clear by line 8; no orientation penalty.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—permission to keep listening—tightens once when the hedgehog’s nod authorizes continuance; escalation is quiet but legible under Accumulative lens. The price is perpetual return without applause, a path foreclosed to grander crescendos; cost is felt but could be sharper on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges as listening as creative act; subtext lives in hush, wire-cooled thumb, river-lean. The final image reweights silence from absence to collaborative substance, avoiding moralizing. Complexity is honored: no tidy binaries between noise and quiet, creation and witness.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>First-person lyric voice owns a distinctive perceptual signature—sap, patient wood, porcelain ear—maintaining rhythmic control and patterned elision (“verbs for noisy places”). No dialogue; no head-hop. Syntax flexes with breath-length phrases that mirror musical phrasing, taught early and paid off in final cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is compressed, high-density; metaphors stay consistent (organ of small gray pipes, grammar for trees). One scaffold pair: “silence is not the absence of sound but of listening” restates immediately prior image—minor loop. Otherwise zero paraphrase churn, no mixed vehicles; closure beat is uncluttered.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Premise—tree-song sculptor tuning a grove with salvaged wire—feels fresh yet inevitable; city ruins backstory is synthesized rather than grafted. Risk of quiet accumulative arc is taken and paid off. Specificity of “siskin alder” and “porcelain insulator” prevents generic transfer; transformation test passed.</comment>
