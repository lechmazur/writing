<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>The narrator’s “forgiving skeptic” duality is alive in every tactile beat—bone-setting clinic memory vs. readiness to credit a fox-guided changeling—but the father’s off-stage grief (the emotional fulcrum) is only reported, so the highest-stakes relationship never becomes a crucible that visibly alters the narrator’s hierarchy of values. The final apology is narrated as intent, not dramatized choice, so the cost is felt second-hand.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Causal chain is lean and legible: reed-body → hedge map → tooth-key → garden stair → living boy; each step is triggered by a concrete micro-action (Mara presses tooth, hedge exhales, root-steps appear). Closure lands with Earned Stasis: the narrator carries the boy out and concedes past error to the father—cost is the public admission of fallibility—while the lens (Causal) holds throughout. One minor lapse: the fox-leg cure doubles as climactic hinge yet the injury is introduced only seconds before it is solved, so the constraint is fresher than the emotional price.</comment>

<comment>The secret garden is not backdrop but actor: sap-constellations physically redirect the pair, root-stairs literally lift them into the changeling chamber, and the pear-tree moth stitching narrows perceptual focus to the found objects. Micro-setting (the narrator’s palm, the fox’s paw) doubles as surgical theatre where literal mending reweights metaphysical doubt. Final image—“I carried him up through the hinge”—makes the garden’s architecture the visible cost of re-entry, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—can the narrator repair more than bones, i.e., a community rupture wrought by his own skepticism—tightens once: the fox’s limp forces an immediate test of “listening correctly,” and success re-opens the garden’s return path. The price is legible (public apology, relinquishing expert authority), but because the fox injury appears in-scene rather than being foreshadowed, the escalation feels slightly engineered rather than inevitable.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as “doubt and wonder share the same hinge”; the crescent tooth migrates from forensic evidence to key to returned fragment, reweighting the idea of truth as something that must be physically re-inserted to close the wound. No meta-statement declares the moral; the final image of the father kissing the tooth lets the object speak. The only flirtation with Echo comes in “I have learned to forgive the map and the myth,” but it is saved by its placement mid-story and the immediate physical follow-through.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>First-person voice is bone-setter precise: verbs like “hum,” “rift,” “click,” and anatomical nouns create a perceptual signature that is clinical yet porous to wonder. Rhythm modulates—long, breath-held sentences in the hedge descent, staccato releases at the joint’s “soft yes.” Compression (“a cleft in certainty”) is taught early and paid off at the hinge stair, so lyric elision never blurs causality. Dialogue is minimal but Mara’s diction (“planting nails like seeds”) carries distinct child barter-idiom.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry triple duty (image + motion + metaphor) without crowding: “the ground tipped, a hinge remembering its promise” fuses physical action, emotional turn, and world rule in twelve words. No paraphrase loops or filter-verb stacks; only two near-adjacencies (“listened correctly / listened” and “garden listened / fox’s ear”) are forgivable given the echoic motif. Metaphor vehicles stay internally consistent—bones, stars, botany—so figurative logic never snaps.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The folkloric “substitute body” and “changeling garden” are refreshed through osteological specificity: a bonesetter’s calipers replace the priest’s bell, and the reed effigy must fail the wrist-weight test, not the baptismal test. The fox-as-gatekeeper limp is a fresh inflection that ties animal, child, and adult repairs into one gesture. Risk is taken—lyric causal fantasy in under 800 words—yet clarity and stakes remain intact, meriting the +0.3 innovation bump.</comment>
