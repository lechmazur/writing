<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The protagonist’s liminal survivor-guilt is embodied through the tingling bolt and crutches; the bellhop’s mute servitude nicely mirrors the fortress ethos. Yet both characters remain allegorical ciphers: we get no contradictory impulse inside the bellhop, no moment where aiding the narrator could cost him personally. The final renunciation is credible, but the cost is borne mostly by abstract “choir” others rather than dramatized relationships on stage.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the half-turn keeps the hinge ready, reconfiguring silence from absolute to conditional. The causal chain is present—bolt refusal → potential future sound—but the “because” linking this act to any tangible risk to the inhabitants is inferred rather than demonstrated; stakes lean on metaphor (“storms upon everyone”) instead of on-page jeopardy. Pattern is Accumulative/Textural; pressure deepens through imagery recurrence rather than option-narrowing turns.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fortress, staircase discoloration, and frost-rimmed engine room are tactile, lived-in, and filter through POV priorities (“I turned the bolt between aching fingers”). Micro-setting (the off-color banister patch) actively governs movement and memory, meeting the 9+ gate. A few atmospheric phrases flirt with purple but stay purposeful; spatial choreography is flawless.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Central stake—complicity in silence versus ethical witness—is announced early and tightened only once: the bolt installation/refusal. That act is solitary, cost is potential not felt, and no secondary resource (time, allies, bodily risk) is forfeited on-page; escalation therefore registers as a single conceptual pivot rather than mounting pressure. Agency is present but low-band; the “arithmetic of gates” stays theoretical.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of silence versus testimony emerges organically through the machine, choir, and the bolt’s rosary-like handling; no explicit sermon. The final image of wind “breathing in” reweights earlier hush as provisional, achieving resonance without tidy moral. Subtext in the bellhop’s finger-to-throat gesture is elegant; occasional phrases (“arithmetic of gates”) edge toward abstraction, slightly diluting specificity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>First-person lyric voice sustains a consistent perceptual signature—“nerve regeneration burned like starlight”—and modulates cadence to match awe and dread. Filter verbs are minimal, diction stays within an evocative but credible lexicon. Patterned elision (“he signed”) is taught early and paid off; no head-hopping. Dialogue is absent by design; narrative rhythm substitutes for character speech, handled deftly.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Sentence music is varied and propulsive; only two adjacent metaphors slightly over-layer (“velvet fear,” “fallen stars”) but clarity survives. Density is high: each sentence advances image or motive. No loops, no synonym churn, no register drift into academic diction. Opening and closing lines anchor and recharge motif cleanly. Minor risk of overwriting in “seraphically mundane” but context justifies coinage.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The conceit of weaponized silence literalized as shutter-engine and mute choir feels fresh; piano-bolt-as-key is an inventive reuse of mundane hardware. Tropes (survivor guilt, fortress refuge) are re-cast through sensory specificity and ethical hinge. One faint echo of “fortress under snow” recalls countless gothic citadels, but angle of acoustic control differentiates it. Conceptual follow-through (refusal keeps hinge) shows daring without gimmickry.</comment>
