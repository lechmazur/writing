<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The philosopher’s quiet, tactile micro-choices (sniffing salt, tracing mesh, refusing sardines) embody a believable contradiction between ascetic serenity and covert social engineering; the widow’s grief-anchored dexterity is equally specific. Both characters’ motives tighten into the shared, costly act of re-knotting nets to spare turtles while sparing villagers’ pride—an earned renunciation that forecloses blame. Interiority stays concrete (“tentative brightness of someone knotting two thoughts”) and avoids label-speak. Only Li remains slightly generic, muting the crucible effect and keeping the score just below the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the new “moon-loop” stitch reweights the entire village’s moral ledger, with the cost felt in elders’ “subtle ache” and the philosopher’s unpaid pouch—undeniable on-page price. Causal chain holds: whistle summons fireflies → reveals widow → triggers joint mending → loosens future nets; each because/therefore link narrows options from accusation to collaborative restraint. Orientation is swift: parapet, post-rain, night, and stakes (“confession before dawn”) all appear within 60 words. No lens ambiguity; pattern holds to the final nail where the whisk dries beneath “living commas” of fireflies.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Sweating stones, slug cursive, and the whisk-as-anemone are sensuous yet purposive: the wet parapet enables the whistle’s echo slide and the firefly lanterning that guides the descent. The bamboo whisk recurs as micro-setting, constraining the philosopher’s gestures and charging the final image when hung “to dry, its bristles remembering… constellations.” Spatial choreography across bastion, sluice, and courtyard is clean. Only the estuary’s geography stays vaguely sketched, preventing full 9+ entry.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—village hunger versus turtle survival—tightens when the philosopher reframes “thief” into shared pattern, forcing Li and elders to trade blame for complicity. Mid-story whistle act escalates by exposing the widow’s clandestine mercy, converting a single cut net into systemic by-catch. The final moon-loop invention materially loosens under pressure, demonstrating visible trade-off: smaller harvest, moral credit. Cost is legible, but escalation is single-arc; no second reversal keeps it shy of 8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through mesh and water imagery: justice must include release mechanisms or it drowns the innocent. Subtext resides in gestures—widow’s lifted palm, philosopher’s refusal of payment—rather than exposition. The closing image of fireflies as “living commas” offers a non-literal, ethically open punctuation to the village’s sentence, reweighting prior motifs without moralizing. Complexity is honored: hunger remains real, turtles still at risk, only the knot has learned generosity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person hovers at a lyric middle distance that matches the philosopher’s perceptual bias: every sound becomes haptic (“drop made a sound like a soft bead slid along string”). Syntax elongates then compresses—“whistle leapt… slid… scraped from a chrysalis”—mirroring the give-tighten rhythm of the new net knot. No head-hopping; even widow’s interior arrives through observable cue (“face a creekbed of careful grief”). Register stays consistent; compressed diction under pressure remains legible and musical.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “season’s sweetness clinging… like fleeting syrup” performs atmosphere without stalling beat. Mixed metaphors are controlled—foam constellations, wooden anemone, living commas—each re-enters to charge closure. One paraphrase loop (“whistled again… pulses tapping the stone”) repeats sense but serves cadence teaching, so only a hairline deduction. No filter-verb stacks or scaffold; strong verbs (“kissing puddles,” “threaded between”) drive momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fusing net-mending philosophy with eco-ethical parable feels fresh; the “release-knot” solution is both concrete and symbolically resonant. Whistle-as-summons and firefly lanterning transform familiar parapet-after-rain imagery into a living navigation system. Risk resides in lyric compression and moral ambiguity, yet closure remains lucid. Slight echo of “teaching the village” tropes keeps it just under 9.5.</comment>
