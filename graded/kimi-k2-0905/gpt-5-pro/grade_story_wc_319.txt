<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The narrator’s interiority is concrete (“safe, useless pieces”) and the final refusal to step through the window costs the guardian his return, but the epiphany “love sometimes means not crossing” arrives as a declared summary rather than an embodied contradiction; still, the stance shift is legible and paid for on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the comma-ice inside the pendant reweights the boundary of light into a legible seam of hesitations, and the shared refusal to cross the window carries unmistakable relational cost under the Accumulative lens; every beat adds texture that culminates in this charged poise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The frozen garden is not backdrop but tactical: the rime-covered bench is where they “practice the plain bravery of letting minutes pass,” making weather a coerced room that later stops shivering; the pendant’s crystal eye and the comma-sliver are micro-settings that literally reconfigure vision and hence choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Pressure tightens through accretion: each frost-map drawn on tongues raises the cost of certainty until the final refusal to cross crystallizes the stake—friendship with uncertainty—into an irreversible stance; the escalation is felt rather than plotted, coherent under the Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges without moralizing: the wrong answers that saved lives, the cultists frozen by proof, the comma that asks only to continue—each particular reweights the abstract idea that uncertainty is shelter; the final image of the ajar veil offers a resonant, non-literal answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Voice sustains a lyric, frost-bitten register (“letters cut from hoarfrost”) that remains consistent; patterned compression (“interiorizing exteriors”) is taught early and paid off when frost is pulled inside and takes a chair; no head-hopping, no register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense but purposeful; occasional metaphor crowding (“glittering needles that drew maps on our tongues”) never loops or contradicts physical logic; final image remains clear, no artifact touches closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The half-cat, half-catalog guardian, the library of wrong answers, and the comma-shaped key synthesize familiar tropes into an inevitable, fresh logic; risk-taking (lyric accretion instead of causal turns) heightens meaning without obscuring closure.</comment>
