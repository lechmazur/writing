<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The narrator’s interiority is vivid, embodied, and specific—“wrist still wore the faint ladder of scars where a tourniquet had bit,” “learning tasted like salt on a glass.” Contradictory impulses—performing versus surviving, recording versus forgetting—co-exist in scene, culminating in the earned renunciation of comfortable scripts when the red cord is coiled and set aside. The Custodian functions as secondary pressure, her benevolent ruthlessness pruning flourishes with clipped breaths, forcing micro-choices that visibly cost the narrator’s performative impulse. Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the narrator accepts perpetual migratory duty, foreclosing personal stasis; cost is legible in the nod that is both sentence and pardon.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the final nod reweights authority from spectacle to small-gesture stewardship under the Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality holds: each walking-spelled word accumulates voices into a braid the narrator can touch, shifting agency from passive witness to active archivist. Orientation anchors by line 4 (“old whispering gallery,” “interregnum”). Cost is visible in the coiling of the red cord and theCustodian’s palm-map of calluses—“HOME” spelled in scar-tissue—making renunciation palpable. No late-rule changes; pattern taught early; lens stable to last breath.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The whispering gallery is not backdrop but instrument: concentric tiles become an alphabet, the dome a lantern that holds words like fire. Micro-setting—the chessboard’s pawn-less squares—constrains the narrator’s choice to use pebbles as counters, directly shaping archival method. Sensory hierarchy obeys crisis: iodine-smoke breath, sleeve-ribbon texture, salt-taste of learning. Spatial choreography is clean; the cord’s removal and pebble placement track without drift. Final image charges the dome as lantern, reweighting absent voices into usable light.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—keep the city from forgetting—signaled early. Pressure tightens when the Custodian demands unbinding from performative scripts; the walking-spelling mechanic forces literal step-by-step relinquishment of former safety drills. Each letter walked adds a voice, narrowing options to continued migration or total erasure. Cost is visible in the coiled cord and the nod that both permits and sentences. Agency remains with narrator; no coincidences; escalation is accumulative density of voices rather than causal reversals.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from pattern, not assertion: small gestures versus grand speeches, migration versus monument. Subtext resides in silence—the laugh hidden in a coat for years—returning reweighted at closure. No final-paragraph moralizing; the nod is gesture itself. Luminous absence is repriced from loss to portable archive; the conceptual cost is the perpetual exile of “teach it to migrate.”</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Voice is compressed, lyric, consistent: “The city had no ruler, only echoes” sets cadence immediately. Syntax mirrors mental state—long breathless accumulations under dome, clipped fragments under Custodian’s gaze. Perceptual signature is crisis-actor precise: “drills inside me broke like cheap toys.” No head-hopping; POV modesty perfect—narrator cannot access Custodian’s interior. Experimental elision (“walk BEGIN”) is pattern-taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Sentence music is deliberate yet natural; paragraph breaks sync with breath. Figurative language is sparse, precise: “absence could phosphoresce,” “nomadic penumbra.” No synonym loops; each noun is specific—“veined marble,” “sleeping vein.” Register stays within narrator’s lexicon. Minor scaffold risk in repeated “benevolently ruthless” but functions as refrain, not loop. Closure line is clean, rhythmic, unadorned.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Fresh angle: archive built by foot-walking spelling in a post-crisis interregnum. Chessboard as census of vanished pawns transforms familiar object. “Luminous absence” conceptually repriced from metaphor to civic practice. Risk—lyric accumulative structure—paid off in coherent closure. Transformation test fails if names/places swapped: the whispering gallery’s acoustic physics is essential. Synthesis feels inevitable, not gimmicky.</comment>
