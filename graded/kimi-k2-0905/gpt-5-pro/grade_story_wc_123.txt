<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The storm-recorder’s interiority is relentlessly concrete—every metaphor is a tool for mapping wind, fences, silence. Contradictory impulses (curiosity vs wary self-protection) play out in micro-choices: accepting the pigeon, deciding to “stand where wind shifts,” writing raindrops aloud. The final renunciation—keeping the report unowned—has been pre-paid by the tube, the hair, the woman’s rain-oath; cost is visible in the promise to an empty bench. Voice never slips into diagnostic labels; perception stays biased, professional, and physically grounded.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: options (go alone / go with ally / stay silent) are reconfigured in the final breath of the courtyard; cost is the invisible thread now tied to the narrator’s wrist. Causality is accumulative/ textural: each image (tube, hair, gray coat) adds density until the quiet decision to “lean into given lines” becomes inevitable. Orientation is anchored within 120 words by body, fountain, pigeon row, dusk; no spatial drift. No lens ambiguity—pattern is taught early and paid off in the final image of undecided blue.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The courtyard itself functions as a micro-setting that constrains choice: the fountain’s mumble and the balustrade’s pigeon-row dictate stealth, listening, lateral movement. Weather is not backdrop but instrument—rain’s taste on the tube, sky “practicing undecided” mirrors narrator’s refusal to claim truth. Rusted footbridge and red-ringed map are evoked through sensory relic (salt crust, kinked hair) rather than exposition, charging the final river-walk. Spatial choreography is flawless: follower enters with open hands, pigeon weight transfers to palm, woman exits into deepening evening—every body-position is trackable.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—ownership vs unownership of weather-truth—is signaled in paragraph one and tightened by each object: tube demands “bring it unowned,” hair curls like fence wire. Escalation is textural: each new layer (follower’s appearance, pigeon’s arrival, woman’s brother inside ring) increases the price of staying unaligned. The meaningful turn is the narrator’s micro-choice to fasten the tube back to the bird—an act that forecloses the option to keep the evidence. Cost is legible: comfort is sacrificed in the promise to “count raindrops aloud” within earshot of armed guards.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges solely through particulars: the ethics of unownership is lived in gestures (returning the tube, promising the bench) rather than asserted. Subtext operates in silence—follower’s open hands, pigeon’s blink—never translated into moral. Final image of “undecided blue” reweights every prior mention of sky, rain, and fences without stating a thesis. The reader is left to calculate the civic cost of listening without claiming—an ambiguity that feels earned, not evasive.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is unmistakable: wind is read by “sideways drift,” silence has “manners,” sky practices indecision. Syntax mirrors meteorological patience—long accretive clauses that suddenly shear into short forecasts (“I would go once more”). No filter-verb stacks; every perception is tactile (salt crust, velvet motor). Dialogue—in the single spoken exchange—is laconic, regionally neutral, and carries subtext about selling weather; voice convergence at closure reads intentional rather than slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Metaphors are sparse, precise, and mutually reinforcing: folded paper boats / folded map / folded hair form a lattice that never contradicts physical logic. Rhythm modulates with pressure—contemplative iambs accelerate into spondaic injunction “bring rain truth.” No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances either stakes or texture. Copy-clean: no tense drift, no pronoun ambiguity, no mixed vehicles; “quiet signature” remains metaphorical yet physically tied to fence wire.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The storm-recorder who measures moods of gutters and refuses to own data is a fresh vocational angle on surveillance/writing. Lateral movement as both meteorological and ethical method is non-obvious yet inevitable once taught. Risk—renouncing ownership while still entering the perimeter—heightens stakes without gimmickry. Familiar tropes (quarantine, carrier pigeon) are re-annealed through sensory specificity: salt crust, kinked hair, undecided blue.</comment>
