<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The collective “we” generates vivid interior contradiction—Ilya’s cryptic charisma collides with the narrator’s tax-bill dread—yet personal stakes blur behind group voice. Micro-choices (annotating the Notice in soil, shaking the rattle seed) are concrete and costly. A stronger solo interior pulse at the climax would sharpen the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the smudged ellipsis and pollen-coined “payment” reweight the taxable-thought premise with undeniable social cost. Causal linkage holds: each garden-coded reply is a because/therefore response to bureaucratic pressure. Lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern of seeded messages taught early and paid off in final vegetal ledger. One causal micro-gap—why collectors retreat—keeps it from 9.2.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Greenhouse micro-setting constrains every tactic: low heat vs microphones, ladybird punctuation, cedar trellis alphabets—environment literally authors the rebellion. Marigold WAIT-ring and sunflower shadow-clock charge the final image with legible cost. Sensory hierarchy stays anchored to pollinator POV; no slack tourist catalog.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—un-taxed thought survival—tightens via each vegetal reply that risks fiscal reprisal. Escalation is textural: density of coded blooms increases until the Notice is literally overwritten by roots. Visible price: collectors retreat owing “humility,” a social-cost win that still forecloses future overt protest. No second reversal keeps it sub-9.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: language as living, un-priceable organism. Subtext glows in ant-ellipsis, shadow-sentences, pollinator grammar—no sermon required. Final image of “unbilled thoughts returning to balance” reweights premise with conceptual cost. Complexity intact: Bureau still exists; victory is vegetal, partial, fragile.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Collective first-person sustains perceptual signature—syntactic “we” breathes like communal lung, never drifts into head-hop. Candidly cryptic register stays motivated through Ilya’s dialogue, seeds narrator’s own wary lyricism. Compression (“sun pooled on water, and everything rang like nerves trying to whistle”) is taught early, paid off at warp-heat climax. Zero scaffold, rhythmic propulsion under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Zero loops, near-zero filter verbs; information density sky-high—one sentence often does three jobs (“We drafted the answer in soil…like a moving reply”). Metaphors stay physically coherent: ledger-ink literally blurred by ants, shadow-clock legible only with breath. Register never drifts into academic; diction stays inside collective vernacular. Final pollen-payment line is crystalline.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Taxable-thought dystopia + horticultural encryption feels inevitable yet unseen before. Risk of vegetal grammar is high—could read as twee—but stakes stay fiscal, lethal, real. Gourd-rattle metronome, marigold semaphore, ant-ellipsis are precise inventions, not quirky ornaments. Concept commits fully: no retreat to humanist platitude; garden keeps the last word.</comment>
