<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The heiress’s contradictory impulses—protecting the paper’s integrity while fearing dynastic shame—are dramatized in the nib placement and technician confrontation; her renunciation of the donor-brightened sky costs her the easy coronation, earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Causal chain holds: journalist call → ascent → proof by contradiction → log surrender → drafted confession; the shutter-eyed closure image reweights the stake with visible cost—newsroom will drink “pen and contrition.” Orientation anchored by 120 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Observatory’s humming floor, calibration lamp bleed, and cursor-fuse make the setting an active antagonist; the rosewood nib micro-setting physically blocks deletion, charging the final image. Spatial choreography remains clean across catwalk and mirror.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—print truth or live under a lie—tightens when the histogram’s “top hat” flatness confronts her; the technician’s cursor-fuse moment forces a public choice that forecloses donor appeasement, price legible in the dawn “pocketful of coins” sky.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of inherited guilt versus public truth emerges through the nib’s ink-blood lineage and the orbits of regret widening after each surrender; the final reconfiguration—confession printed beneath a quieter sky—avoids moralizing, resonates in image alone.</comment>

<question>6</question><<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>First-person voice sustains a journalist-poet diction—“sky were a hollow cello,” “histogram wears a top hat”—without purple drift; perceptual signature filters every object through newsprint metaphors, modulating under pressure yet never head-hops.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary from percussive spondees to airy caesuras, mirroring dome echoes; no scaffold loops, mixed metaphors, or filter-verb stacks. High density—“inked thunder,” “bleach real color as surely as gossip bleaches kindness”—advances both atmosphere and argument.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Fusing astronomical data fraud with dynastic newspaper legacy through proof-by-contradiction is fresh; the nib-as-quill-of-accountability transforms a heirloom into a scalpel, making ethical astronomy feel inevitable yet newly observed.</comment>
