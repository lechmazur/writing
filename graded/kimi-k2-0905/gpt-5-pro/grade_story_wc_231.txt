<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The keeper’s contradictory trust in absence over presence is dramatized in every beat: he fondles the flower, adjusts the light to speak in silences, and accepts perpetual marginality. Interiority is embodied (“felt like snow on a bruise”) and complicates action; the final quiet vigil is an earned renunciation with visible cost. Minor flaw: the label “Old Partial” is told once rather than shown through gesture, but this is negligible against the sustained interior contradiction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the keeper’s lamps signals re-weight his own exile and the lovers’ separation in one image. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout—gaps, salt outlines, flower, light-pauses accumulate until the final deck-side echo. Causality is interior but legible: because the keeper trusts absence, he can read the silenced name and elect to keep sending absence outward. Cost is unmistakable: “I returned…feeling like a witness who lives in the margins.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The opal dock, mist, and lighthouse lens are not backdrop; they actively filter what can be known—pages erased, beams that fail to shine. Micro-setting inside the oilskin and the salt jar charge the final image. Spatial choreography is flawless: the body’s fall, the slid boutonniere, the liner’s deck all track cleanly. Weather governs perception—bells through fog—mirroring the keeper’s narrowed emotional field.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</question><comment>Dominant stake—decode the stranger’s gesture—tightens when each gap reveals the name Mira and the keeper must choose to transmit or bury it. Agency is attention and renunciation rather than overt confrontation; the cost is his crystallized solitude. Escalation is pattern-deepening: each night’s lamp-pause sharpens the message and narrows his own options. One meaningful turn suffices under the Accumulative lens and it lands with felt price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: messages travel farther through absence than presence, and witness itself is a form of exile. The Edelweiss reprise on the deck reweights the flower from clue to communion without exposition. No moralizing—final line “for the carrier as much as the receiver” is an image-rich Conceptual Repricing. Ambiguity lingers: is the keeper’s vigil ennobling or self-imprisoning? The story refuses to choose, deepening resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>First-person voice owns a salt-creak lexicon (“opal,” “lung,” “ferry ticket for a mountain”) that is both poetic and vocation-grounded. Syntax lengthens and breathes like surf—long sentences for lyric drift, clipped fragments under shock. No head-hop; perceptual signature remains anchored to the keeper’s bias for what is missing. Dialogue is absent by design, so voice must carry all texture and does so without monotony.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Metaphors are disciplined: “lighthouse breathe its tired white lung” is fresh yet physically exact. No loops or synonym churn; each sentence layers job—image, motion, interior. Rhythm modulates: fog-thick paragraphs yield to single-sentence strobe of the signal code. One minor scaffold: “the harbor learns the living by the gestures they do not finish” is abstract summary amid otherwise concrete chain, but it is brief and thematically pivotal, not obscuring.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The keeper-as-middleman-of-absence is a fresh angle on lighthouse tales; transmission via missed flashes rather than visible beams inverts the trope elegantly. Specificity grounds novelty—salt outline of a vanished letter, three-long/two-short code carved in death throes. Risky lyric compression is taught early and pays off in the deck reprise, so it reads inevitable, not gimmicky. Nothing feels stitched to prompt; all elements grow from the central paradox of visibility-through-invisibility.</comment>
