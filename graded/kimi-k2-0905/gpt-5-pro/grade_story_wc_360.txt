<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The operator’s interiority is concrete—his “lucid turbulence” eyes, the metallic kiss after each trait-return—yet the apprentice’s motives stay abstract (“to understand the mathematics of emotion”). The borrowed-laugh swap lands as a sharp micro-choice, but the returned tenderness from a widow is told, not dramatized, muting the cost. Still, the mutual trait-lending creates a credible relational crucible that alters both stances by the final sheet-drying beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: star vanishings supply cadence, ink proofs supply density. Closure is a Charged Poise—the halo fragment left on press, the shared breath after a star winks out—cost is felt in the shoulder-drop and cleaner breath. The “third grammar” line supplies the decisive reconfiguration, not just metaphor but a printed artifact that reweights prior pronoun slippage. One scaffold: “We kept printing, because the stars were not staying” repeats the same cause twice; else clean.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Topaz panes, citrus-ink smell, and the halo fragment’s tide-coolness act as micro-setting that constrains action: the fragment literally steadies the chase and later steadies the apprentice’s palm. Star intervals serve as a live clock, tightening the room’s hush. Spatial choreography holds across roller-lever-cleanup moves; no floating props. Final image of the proof “hung like a small constellation” reuses the stellar motif to reweight the setting itself as earned stasis.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake: can empathy be transposed without permanent self-loss? Pressure escalates through each trait-loan that leaves “a scratch on him” and empties the apprentice’s laugh. Mid-text, the star gaps tighten from languid to “held breath,” forcing the final print run. Cost is visible: the operator’s shoulder drop, the apprentice’s cleaner but shaken breathing—options narrow to one last shared proof before the next star vanishes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the accruing pronoun slippage and star-extinguishing cadence rather than thesis statements. Final “third grammar” sheet reweights prior ambiguity from gimmick to shared instrument, achieving Conceptual Repricing without moralizing. Subtext in the halo fragment’s journey—cathedral roof → washer → lens → hinge—carries the tacit question of whether sacred or secular tools can hold mortal emotion. Only minor echo: “lucid turbulence” is named twice; still, the after-image lingers as earned resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>First-person plural sustains a collective yet intimate perceptual signature: “we proofed phrases that bent sympathy into coordinate axes.” Syntax tilts toward equation-fragments under pressure (“a breath like an equation settling to balance”). No head-hopping; the apprentice’s nervous laugh is felt as absence when worn by the operator. Compressed diction in the final lever-drop—“our senses sheared”—mirrors the print’s decisive impression without losing legibility.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Rhythm breathes with press cycles: long ink-metaphors contract to short star-gaps. Mixed metaphors are controlled—“column beaded by the rain” keeps metal & water in plausible workshop proximity. One paraphrase loop: “we kept printing, because the stars were not staying” restates the same cause. Else high density: one sentence can carry citrus scent, old promises, tympan creak, and swallowed truth without congestion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: letterpress mechanics + stellar extinction as emotional calipers. “Transposed empathy” is not soft sci-fi but a lived craft process—inked pronouns as reagent, star interval as stopwatch. Risk in the “third grammar” could slide into gimmick, yet the piece commits fully, letting the final sheet literalize the concept. Specificity of chase, tympan, and citrus solvents keeps the metaphor tethered to tactile work.</comment>
