<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The sensory-map-maker’s interiority is vivid and embodied—veins “like frozen rivers,” “thermal bloom of longing”—but the final broadcast choice arrives more as lyrical inevitability than a crucible that visibly costs her; the fossil’s hum is felt, yet her personal stake beyond vocation stays static, capping the score just below 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>A single, continuous scene under an Accumulative/Textural lens; orientation anchors (who/where/when) land within 40 words. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the chord fed into hibernation loops reweights the unknown from mute data to living invitation; cost is the irreversible exposure of her private map to the sleeping collective, felt when she “threads the chord” and sits alone on the cold step.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The coastal cave system is not backdrop but instrument: buoyancy in mineral pool eases joints, narrowing elbow forces supine passage, plankton glow becomes navigational tool; the elm fossil acts as micro-setting that charges the final alignment beat. Spatial choreography is flawless—no impossible positions, no white-room drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—translate the unknown into a voice the sleepers can dream—tightens once: discovery of the wall-fossil triggers the decisive act of extraction/broadcast. Cost is legible (loss of privacy, risk of mis-reception), but the external world offers no immediate pushback, keeping escalation just shy of the 8.8 gate.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: data becomes lullaby, measurement becomes care. The fossil’s reprise reweights “transitional object” from personal talisman to civilizational bridge; no moralizing, only the final image of lone listener counting breaths while the unknown sings back.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>First-person voice carries a scientist-poet diction—“microfaunal tremors,” “dripping language of intervals”—consistent with vocation and solitude. Rhythm modulates: long breathy sentences in floating chamber, clipped telemetry diction during upload. No head-hop, no filter-verb stack; perceptual signature stays distinct under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Sentences perform double duty—e.g., “I float on a mineral pool to ease my joints, letting the salt cradle me while the recorder blinks” advances action, conveys body, sets tool state. Zero paraphrase loops, zero mixed metaphor; only one near-purple stretch (“slow aurora of wonder”) forgiven by lyric mode taught early.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>The hibernating-earth premise is familiar, but the synthesis—sensory cartographer, fossil-as-calibration weight, dream-loop broadcast—feels inevitable and new. Risky lyric compression holds; no derivative echo of famous scenes. The concept commits fully: data as lullaby, map as love-letter.</comment>
