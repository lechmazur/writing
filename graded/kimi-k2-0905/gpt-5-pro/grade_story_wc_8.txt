<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara’s “emotionally rational” stance is shown through her throat-heating then cooling with numbers, a terse embodiment of the trait under pressure. The internal contradiction—feeling steers but does not blind—drives every micro-choice from tracing ivy to persuading Tomas, and the final resolve to publish costs her anonymity. Secondary pressure from Tomas is crisp: his worry about blistering the town forces her to justify the breach, altering their status. The ledger haul is earned, but the backstory capsule (“hired in whispers, despised in pamphlets”) is floated without on-page corroboration, muting the depth of her exile.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the timetable is reclaimed, the town’s mythic fire is replaced by the detour report, and the cost is the west-stair fear returning—visible in Tomas’s facing of the shaft. Causal chain holds: letter vine → brick seam → ledger haul → public reading, each because/therefore step tightening options. Orientation is secured by line 5 (who, where, when); the “green hush” teaches the ivy motif early. No meaningful cost is felt by Mara herself—she exits intact—so the reconfiguration is conceptual, not personal, capping the score below 9.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The station clock swallowed in ivy and the oilskin bundles hauled into lamplight are tactile, choice-guiding objects; the whistle’s cracked note literalizes the call to witness. Spatial choreography is clean: platform → shaft → bench, bodies track without drift. Weather is kept implicit, narrowing focus to the tactile crunch of ivy and paper. The western stair as “mouth finally uncorked” recharges the setting with conceptual cost, satisfying the 9+ gate for environment charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—rescuing truth from the pit—signals in paragraph 1 and tightens when Tomas warns “you will blister the town.” One meaningful turn: Tomas shifts from guardian of the lie to co-witness, narrowing Mara’s options from solo digger to communal reckoning. Cost is legible but displaced onto the town (fear of the west stair) rather than Mara; her personal stakes plateau. Escalation is coherent under Causal lens, yet the absence of a price paid by the protagonist keeps it sub-8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: noble lies as civic anesthesia versus living ivy as persistent memory. The illuminated letter’s golden strokes catching moonlight reprice the premise—archival beauty complicit in erasure. No explicit moral is stated; the final image of the reopened page leaves ambiguity between mercy and memory. Subtext in Tomas’s loose-screw laugh carries his capitulation without exposition, sustaining complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person lyric compression stays close to Mara’s perceptual filter: “she whispers” links painter’s A to arch, a historian’s synaptic leap. Syntax tightens under pressure—“breath chalking the air”—without filter-verb drag. Ivy as living margin is a recurring metaphor taught early and paid off in the final line, rhythmically satisfying. Dialogue is minimal but carries subtext: Tomas’s “we will not burn for this” fuses repair and confession.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density: “gilded initial pried from a shuttered abbey library” packs tool, theft, and institutional decay in nine words. No scaffold loops; each sentence advances map or motive. Metaphor chain (ivy / lapis vines / living margin) stays coherent, avoiding mixed logic. Minor register lift in “conceptual repricing” is earned by closure, not intrusive.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The union-head erasure via fake-fire myth offers fresh civic noir; the historian-as-ivy parallels feel inevitable in hindsight. Risk in choosing a quiet ledger reading over fiery confrontation is fully taken and pays off in conceptual cost. Specificity of the timetable-as-calendar repurposes bureaucratic detritus into memorial, avoiding generic reconciliation tropes. Transformation test passes: swap ivy for any plant and the knot-to-A cipher collapses.</comment>
