<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The caretaker’s interior contradiction—meticulous “gently systematic” records against terminal recklessness—charges every micro-choice; the six-month deadline converts diary wire and root into stakes-laden sacraments. Interiority is concrete, body-bound (“lungs whistled like reed flutes”), never label-speak; renunciation of legacy for interspecies pact is causally earned and paid with felt breath-cost on the final line.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>A lyrical-causal track: every beat is because/therefore rooted in caretaker agency (spiral growth → door opens). Orientation is secured by 80-word mark; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—ritual stance crystallizes with conceptual cost: “one species at a time, unafraid.” Wire, diary, pillar converge in earned image that forecloses retreat; no slip or cap applies.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Pillar-oak orchard functions as micro-setting that actively narrows options: tug canopy north → shale yields; weather-mark seeds constrain final epistemology. Sensory hierarchy stays caretaker-biased (sap, tide, iron); no exposition dump. Environment is handled, mapped, rewired—never postcard—so final image of copper twinkling under oaks is charged rather than decorative.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—interspecies pact before death—is signaled in line 3 and tightened when copper circuits translate pulse into consent; visible price is each lung-flute breath. One meaningful escalation: chamber opens only after spiral root-training, foreclosing isolation option. Cost is felt surf-beat under feet; no coincidence relieves pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of respectful translation across kingdoms emerges from concrete orchard labor, not thesis; copper, diary, seeds accrete meaning until final “ceremony of listening” reweights prior images. No moralizing; ambiguity persists—consent is curiosity. Resonance lingers as conceptual cost: human ambition remodeled into attention.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>First-person voice owns a scientific-mystic idiolect (“architectural secrets,” “electric grammar”) sustained under mortal pressure; perceptual signature is caretaker-precise (noticing root pressure, tide script). No head-hop; rhythm compresses at climax (“tremor quicken along forearm”) then exhales into calm final cadence. Elision (“three centuries ago”) is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm alternates long lung-image sentences with clipped tool beats; figurative density peaks only at sanctioned lyric heights (“granite whales”). Information dual-loads: wire=conductor+stitch. Minor loop risk in “remodel” repetition is offset by verb shift (“I remodel” vs “we would remodel”) showing scale leap; no artifact obscures closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fusion of terminal-illness orchard-gothic with interspecies diplomacy feels non-obvious yet inevitable; living stone pillars born, not carved, rewire eco-science into myth. Risky second-person address to stars is earned by prior solitude. Transformation test: swap caretaker motive → story collapses. Specificity of weather-runed seeds is unforgettable; no derivative echo.</comment>
