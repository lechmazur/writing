<comment>The hedge-maze designer’s obsession with mapping time is vivid, embodied in tactile choices (handling shard, unfolding photos). The internal contradiction—wanting to trap time yet fearing entrapment—acts simultaneously in the “quaking reverie” beat. The final renunciation of the photographs’ ghosts carries visible cost: the images blank to snow, foreclosing nostalgic anchoring. Flaw: the retrocognitive trait is stated more than dramatized; we’re told “trapped” rather than shown a specific memory that endangers him.</comment>

<comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: each bridge-crossing layers temporal echoes until the halo-dust reweights the garden’s rule-set. The closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the shard’s dissolution into cambium retunes the maze from endless repetition to a single, tender echo—“once.” Cost is legible in the blank photographs and the steadying breath that concedes timelessness. No orientation debt; the “day that refused to name itself” is an intentional disorientation that pays off in the final image of unnumbered time.</comment>

<comment>The living bridge garden is not backdrop but pressure engine: roots thick as torsos force bodily negotiation, cambium plate demands the shard’s surrender. Micro-setting exceeds décor—negative curvature of paths dictates impossible turns, constraining tactics. Sensory hierarchy skews to sap, breath, root-groan, matching the designer’s vocation. Final image: gill-circle in bark charges the “texture of time” with organic, breathable cost.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—touch duration without breaking—tightens when each footfall multiplies past crossings, raising the cost of collapse. The meaningful turn arrives when the narrator asks the shard to “teach me and to leave me,” trading nostalgic tether for lived pattern. Escalation is textural: photographs shed detail, bridges stop doubling, breath steadies—options narrow to one present crossing. Price is visible in blanked photos and the dust that “hummed,” not just asserted.</comment>

<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from particulars: time as breathable sap, not clockwork. Final image reweights earlier motifs—photographs cleared to furrows for “new knowing” reframes loss as loam. Avoids overt thesis; the garden’s “lung of green shadow” is the non-literal answer. One minor echo: “texture of time” drifts toward label; salvaged by embodiment in bark-gill.</comment>

<grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Lyric compressions (“tiny planets” of breath) are patterned early and paid off in the steadying inhale. Syntax mirrors mind: long, root-embedded clauses snake like hedges, then fracture at shard-release. No head-hopping; perceptual signature stays rooted in designer’s vocational lens (“sap, and pulse”). Tense stable; fragmental punctuation serves breath-based rhythm without obscuring causality.</comment>

<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>High-density lines (“bronze body eaten by moss, the circle split and swallowed”) do triple work: image, stakes, time-eaten. Rhythm accelerates across “quaking reverie” paragraph, then exhales into single-clause final walk-out. One mixed metaphor—“ink dropped into water, black ripples across years”—slight blur, but resolved within accumulative lens. Zero loops or scaffold; paragraph cuts all change knowledge or charge.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fused concepts—living maze, retrocognitive trap, halo shard—produce a singular vision of time as photosynthetic tissue. Risky negative-space geometry is grounded in sensory consequence: paths multiply like coral underfoot. Fresh inflection: the maze ends by refusing endlessness, achieving closure through surrender rather than mastery. Could not swap garden or shard without imploding logic and image.</comment>
