<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Hale’s quiet obsession with “sideways time” is embodied in every micro-choice—tuning heaters, anchoring the nexus, easing the lever back—so the final renunciation feels earned. Sera’s single line about gentleness crystallizes a relationship under pressure without overt exposition. Only the brief “ruptured balloon” backstory drifts toward label-speak, slightly blunting interior contradiction at the hinge beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The closure is a Charged Poise: Hale eases the lever and lets the birds unspool their borrowed minutes—cost is the foreclosed proof he craved. Causality holds: each tweak of the lattice and lever tightens options until he chooses restraint. The sideways-time premise is taught early and paid off in the final image of the nexus thinning into ordinary night.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The station, roost, and catwalk are viscerally lived-in—snow plotting magnetic chevrons across the grating, Hale’s grease-smeared nails, the lattice humming under his palms. The gliders’ four-eyed silver throats and tendon-softening light function as micro-setting that directly constrains Hale’s choices. Environment, tool, and body converge to charge the final image when Hale leaves a mechanically warm heat pack as thanks.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>One dominant stake—prove sideways time—tightens through each lever click until Hale renounces final verification; the price is the unspent proof itself. No reversals are needed; pressure accrues as the nexus could derange the flock, forcing his gentler hand. The cost is legible in the lattice’s quieting and the birds’ resettled dreams.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges sideways: knowledge pursued gently outweighs knowledge seized. The gliders’ dream-lit minutes reframed as ethical dawn invite reflection without moralizing. Sera’s final sentence reweights the premise—method matters more than verification—achieving conceptual repricing without abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person close stays locked to Hale’s perceptual signature—rivet-tuned diction, embered breath, long-vowel station hum. No head-hops; Sera’s interior is inferred only through fogged guard and single spoken line, preserving distance. Rhythmic control heightens at climax—fragments like “eased the lever back a breath” match the hush he chooses.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sentences vary from fluid orchestral rolls to clipped turbine beats; no template cadence. Metaphors stay coherent—magnetic hush, angular river—anchored in physics of the scene. Only minor scaffold: “sideways” appears three times in 30 lines; still propels rather than loops.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The sideways-time premise is freshened by holographic bird-dream transcription and an ethical pivot toward restraint. Risky lyric structure pays off: time slippage shown via hatchling eye opening to tomorrow, then lending it back. Specificity of “four-eyed silver-throated gliders” and magnetic snow chevrons makes the concept inseparable from this ice-bound station.</comment>
