<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The curator’s “listen-first” identity is embodied in every micro-choice (calling for coffee, refusing to force the lock). The final renunciation—opening the mailbox only when the community voices converge—pays off the trait with visible social cost (time, risk of fines). Interiority is concrete (“sandstorm calm” as practiced breath), not label-speak. Missing a hair more contradiction under pressure to hit 8.8.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: because the curator listens, neighbors supply memories → locket yields half-moon key → mailbox opens → communal cost paid. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the bundles of unmailed letters rewire neighbor guilt into mutual aid, with the inspector’s lowered cutters as visible cost. One orientation waiver: courtyard anchors arrive by word 80, pattern taught early and pays off. No meaningful tightening beat is missing, but the drone beat feels slightly ornamental rather than causal.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The courtyard, mailbox cluster, and locket function as micro-setting that directly constrains action (who can approach, how the lock is tried). Sensory detail is selective (dust like hush, spoons clinking enamel) and filtered through the curator’s thrifter eye. The “vibrant courtyard at dawn” reappears at closure, re-weighted from anxious waiting to shared release, satisfying the 9+ gate. Light cap for one slightly generic “developer’s banner” tag.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“prove listening heals”—tightens when the inspector’s bolt-cutter countdown threatens failure. Curator’s agency is to stall, gather stories, and risk fines; the letters inside foreclose isolation and launch the mutual-aid ledger. Cost is legible: inspector’s half-lowered cutters, neighbors’ cracked voices, Maria’s spent savings. Escalation is single but sufficient; drone beat is complication, not resolution.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the tiled memories: withheld words corrode community; returned words repair it. Subtext lives in objects—origami cranes, florist ribbon, half-moon sliver—rather than exposition. Final image of “dawn benches ready” offers Charged Poise: the cost is the ongoing openness to future intrusion. Avoids sermonizing; one tiny twitch of “proving” in the last paragraph keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>First-person curator voice is sustained, perceptual signature sharp (“I read stains like handwriting”). Lyric compression is pattern-taught (“sandstorm calm” repeats with new weight). No head-hopping; inspector’s interior is only inferred through gesture. Dialogue is sparse but natural (“we would open nothing alone”). Rhythm mirrors listening stance—long cadences for gathering, staccato for the click of the lock—earning the 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>High information density: one sentence often does three jobs (anchor, sensory, metaphor). No loops or scaffold; metaphor vehicles stay coherent (“dust swirled like hush” anchors both setting and theme). One mixed metaphor “grainy rattle like wind inside a thimble” is hairline but doesn’t touch closure. Final line is crisp and propulsive, recharging “dawn benches” motif.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: thrift-store curator as community therapist, lock-picking via storytelling rather than force. Locket-half-moon key is a non-obvious mechanical twist that feels inevitable once Maria’s origami habit is mentioned. Risk in lyric mosaic pays off under 800 words without disorientation. Slight deduction for familiar “developer drone” intrusion trope.</comment>
