<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The lone custodian’s vocation is dramatized through tactile micro-choices—warming the river stone, pausing the reel, inlaying stone into bark—each exposing a hierarchy of values (witness over rescue, catalog over purge). Interior contradiction flickers when the shadow leans in: simultaneous fear of being consumed and longing to confer shape, embodied in the held breath and steady palms. The renunciation—binding the shadow into a flowering book—pays the cost of eternal custodianship, foreclosing any exit for either party. This earned stasis is specific to this watcher and this dusk; no stock “grief librarian” archetype could swap in without breaking the circuit.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the act of grafting stone into living shelf re-weights the library’s rule-set—shadows can become spines, grief can be shelved as bloom. Cost is legible in the final image: the keeper’s palms still warm, the western window now hosting a book that can never be checked out, custody forever billed. Causality holds: each prior beat—catalog chime, reel comparison, stone warming—feeds directly into this irreversible inscription. The lens is Accumulative/Textural; density of pollen, letters, and warmth accrues until the cadence shifts into root and bark.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The blooming library is no postcard: its ozone breath and thunder drafts constrain action—shelves quiver when a shadow leans, petals close at dusk, cloud floor tilts under emotional weight. The river stone’s micro-setting works as tool and tether; its mica glints become the only surface on which a nameless ache can read itself. Spatial choreography is clean: western window, returns desk, aisle traced by deliberate steps, all track without drift. Final image charges the setting itself—the window now hosts a rooted book—so environment literally flowers from choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—how to keep unreturned dreams from being eaten—signals early and tightens when the catalog chimes “luminous regret.” Mid-story deepening occurs at the hospital-window reel: the same hand trembling decades later makes the custodian realize the shadow could be anyone’s unwitnessed dusk, narrowing his options to absorption rather than expulsion. The price is felt on-page: the library tilts, pollen of letters released, and the keeper’s palms accept permanent warmth as the cost of binding. Agency remains with the custodian; coincidence is absent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: witness is a form of preservation more durable than rescue. Subtext resides in gesture—stone laid beside projected stone, shadow bowing, films brightening “as if moths decided to become lanterns.” Final image offers non-literal answer: hope is not a flame but a shelf that flowers when watered by attention, even in winter. There is no moral; the reader is left holding the gentle weight, the warmth teaching how to stay.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is a sustained lyric drone—compressed, elided, patterned—taught in the first sentence and held to the last: “I shelve them among books that bloom” signals the synesthetic catalog the reader must accept. Perceptual signature is custodial-bibliotonic: noticing spines budding flowers, smelling paper mingle ozone, weighing stone against departure. No head-hopping; unreliability resides in modest uncertainty (“some say shadows only mimic”) rather than knowledge withholding. Rhythm modulates: longer breathless clauses while screening reels, then short declaratives at inscription—syntax itself shelved and rooted.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Figurative layering is dense but purposeful; mixed metaphors (pollen of letters, day loosens buckle) remain internally coherent within the library’s vegetal-mechanical logic. No scaffold loops; each sentence advances image or stakes. One template cadence appears—“gathers glints… gathers dusk… gathers courage”—but it is pattern-taught and paid off as the shadow reconstitutes. Closure beat is uncluttered, ensuring the final splice of thread into cataloged dream lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise fuses cloud-bound botanical library with grief-archive; neither trope is recognizable in prior short fiction at this granularity. The innovation lies in treating witness as a cataloging protocol—stone, reel, shelf—rather than sentimental rescue. Risk of lyric saturation is embraced and metabolized into voice rather than obscuring stakes. Transformation test: swap stone for locket or library for museum and the entire epistemic of “names grown, not spoken” collapses; the synthesis is inseparable from its particulars.</comment>
