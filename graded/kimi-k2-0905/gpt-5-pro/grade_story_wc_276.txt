<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>The fisher’s calm resolve and self-imposed silence distinguish him, but he remains a mythic functionary rather than a person; the girl and vanished mother are never on-stage, so the promised emotional payoff is secondhand. Interiority is poetic but generic—any “cool-headed” hero could swap in without altering beats. No contradictory impulse ever threatens his composure, so pressure never pierce the archetype. Closure is serene but cost is off-loaded onto the unseen child; Earned Stasis registers, yet the lack of visible personal price keeps it below 7.0.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens is declared early (“patterns break themselves”) and held: each lyrical repetition thickens the sonic texture until the final sealing of hush. Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the jar of hush is lifted, the sky re-stitches, and the fisher drifts onward—cost is conceptual (garden rifled, constellations appeased) rather than personal, but it is undeniably legible. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are deliberately dream-scaped; the waiver is earned because the payoff reuses the same celestial/garden imagery to reconfigure meaning. One minor causality wobble: the promise to the girl is introduced after the inciting pattern break, so stakes feel retro-fitted rather than propulsive.</comment>

<comment>Sound-wave garden and star-milk furrows are sensory, specific, and consistently reinforced; the rail spike serves as micro-setting that literally pins a wave to the skiff, constraining the final extraction. Spatial logic stays intact—skiff, spike, net, jar all track cleanly. The garden’s “tidal flags” and “pockets where echoes pooled” evolve with action instead of decorating it. Atmosphere alone almost charges the closure image; the 0.2 gap to 8.3 is because the environment does not push back physically—the garden yields once prodded, never endangering the fisher.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—“return the echo to finish the lullaby”—is clear, but escalation is purely atmospheric: each stanza intensifies lyric density rather than narrowing options. The garden never resists beyond shivering; the goddess-echo tests with familiar voices but these are shrugged off by voicing silence, so no tactic is forfeited. Price is paid by the cosmos (patterns re-stitch) rather than the protagonist, softening felt cost. One meaningful tightening occurs when the spike pins the wave, yet the beat is more tableau than irreversible turn.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Theme—“to carry emotion home without taming its teeth”—emerges through the mute transliteration process rather than assertion, earning its resonance. The feral lullaby motif returns re-weighted: first as sky-song, finally as sealed hush that will cradle the child’s dream, fulfilling the promise without moralizing. Silence as creative medium is non-literal and memorable. The insight feels earned because the fisher has enacted rather than declared it; only the girl’s off-page grief keeps it from 8.5+.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Voice is unmistakable: compressed syntax (“skiff zigzag between standing notes”), coinages (“moonwater”), and percussive cadence mimic wave-crests. Perceptual signature is sustained—everything is heard/felt as vibration; no filtration dulls immediacy. Register never drifts; diction stays inside the fisher’s weathered, seafaring lexicon. The risk of lyric monotony is averted by micro-variations in sentence length and the final softening cadence as the skiff glides homeward.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.5</grade>
<comment>Metaphor density verges on purple (“star milk into the furrows”; “cradle with claws”) yet pattern is taught early and held, so −0.3 for density, not −0.7. A few template cadences (“He transliterates emotions…”) recur without fresh pressure, −0.2. Mixed metaphors (“wore his bones like windchimes”) briefly confuse physical logic but recover within the line. Otherwise syntax is varied, information-dense, and propulsive; closure line is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses fishing, lullaby, and cosmic astrology into an organic whole that feels inevitable in hindsight. The “sound wave garden” and “voicing silence” are fresh, non-obvious mechanics that grow from character need rather than gimmick. Risk is high—lyric abstraction could have collapsed into nonsense—yet coherence is maintained. Transformation test passes: swap out any component (spike, constellations, transliteration) and the story fractures.</comment>
