<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is sensorially rich (“salt on my tongue,” “wind takes the ink like a tutor”), motives stay taut, and the final micro-choice—bracing the beam inside the widened second—pays the cost of refusal. The sister-backstory loop is brief, anchored, and tilts present stance. No contradictory impulses are shown in-scene; the anger stays coil-steady rather than splitting under pressure, so the 9+ gate fails by a whisker.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: “I confirm the rule” reweights the entire premise with the felt cost of survivable splinters. The causal chain—drone maps attention → ink gate opens → tracker enters widened second → braces beam → carries rule back—is clean, and the lens (Causal) holds. Persistent constraint: every future crisis will demand communal breath-holding or lethal haste. Orientation is taught by line 3 (“wind-carved encampment”), waiving any anchor debt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Environment is never backdrop: wind literally carves tent bones and bends pathways to “listening,” the ink cools the tracker’s palm at threshold, the drone’s wire sings in gusts—each constrains tactics and recharges the final image. No micro-setting object rivals the ink-slab itself, which passes the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography stays crisp across the threshold crossing.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“discover why time slows in crisis”—tightens when the ink gate opens and options narrow to enter or retreat. The reversal inside the widened second (brace beam, survive splinters) pays the on-page price. Pressure escalates under Causal lens because each new sensor reading forecloses denial. No secondary stake dilutes the drive.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</question><comment>Theme emerges as: collective attention can carve sheltering time, but only at mortal cost. No moralizing line; the rule is confirmed, not preached. The hummingbird footage and ink-lattice supply specific particulars that forbid abstraction. Resonant reconfiguration is felt when splinters “find their places in the dust like seeds,” reweighting trauma into tool.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>First-person voice is irreducibly specific: “I am the albino tracker they summoned, pale as chalk,” syntax coils like flint, perceptual signature filters every grain of drift. Rhythm modulates from lull-hush to micro-counting drone beats without losing immediacy. No head-hop; lyric compression is pattern-taught early and paid off at threshold crossing.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lines are dense but breathe: “wind unspools its long hush,” “clock coughing sand.” One paraphrase loop—“the world widened around each heartbeat / the clock coughing sand”—drops it 0.1. Metaphors stay internally coherent; no mixed vehicles. Peak beat at ink-crossing keeps propulsion without figurative muddle. Clean proofing, no scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: hard-SF time-dilation explained via phenomenology of shared terror, not tech jargon. Ink-as-metronome and wind-as-carver feel inevitable in hindsight. Risk—lyric portal fantasy inside 700-word SF—heightens stakes without obscuring rule-set. Not quite 9.5 only because drone + ink could echo prior climate-SF poems, albeit transformed.</comment>
