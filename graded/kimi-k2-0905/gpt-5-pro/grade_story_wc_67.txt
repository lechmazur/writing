<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The protagonist’s interiority is gorgeously particular—charcoal as listening, lies hiding at the jaw-line—and every micro-choice (folding the drawing, feeding the flame, dusting ash into the mask) is tethered to the rule that nothing leaves. The emotional cost is unmistakable: the refusal to let Soren keep the portrait burns a path. Missing 0.1 to 0.2 only because Soren’s own contradictory impulses are implied rather than shown in scene; we get the scatterer’s reading of him, not his body betraying two urges at once.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each added strip of drawing, each creak of the rocker, thickens the mood until the burn becomes the inevitable compression. The closure is a textbook Charged Poise—the ash inside the cracks reweights the mask forever, and the gallery’s rule is paid in full on the page. Causal glue is present but subordinate; the piece earns its resonance through density, not plot reversals.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The vanishing-point gallery is evoked mostly through micro-setting—the rocking chair’s cadence, the brass bowl, the shifting texture of charcoal under fingertip—each object constraining the ritual and charging the final image. Air tastes of slate, the mask holds “tiny sunsets,” and these sensory shards accumulate rather than decorate. One hairline slip: the spatial relation between chair, bowl, and scatterer is slightly floaty; a half-sentence anchor would have nudged this to 9.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—can the scatterer hold and then release the emotion without collapse—is signaled early and tightened by each strip of paper that approaches the bowl. The burn is the single decisive intensification; it forecloses the option of preservation and makes the impermanence rule visceral. Cost is legible in the flinch-nod Soren gives and in the gray that “will not heal yet.” Enough to enter high band, though a second micro-cost would have lifted it into 9+.</comment>

<comment>The mirage of safety is never named in thesis-speak; it is enacted when both men kneel to share the hallucination that ash can be shelter. The final image—gray settled in porcelain cuts—reprises the mother’s “elegant breakages” and reweights every prior reference to shattered things. Theme emerges from the ritual, not exposition, and lingers as an ache rather than a lesson.</comment>

<comment>First-person voice owns a hypnotic cadence: powder / black / listen / hush—each verb chosen for tactile mouth-feel. The diction never drifts into academic loft; even “conceptual” notions like “incomplete information” are grounded in the scratch of charcoal. One micro-template appears (“I…then I…”) but it is pattern-taught and paid off in the burn sequence, so no deduction. The perceptual signature is unmistakable: this narrator hears what is omitted and shades what is feared.</comment>

<comment>Line-level craft is dense yet breathable; every sentence advances image or ritual. No loops, no synonym churn, no mixed metaphors—vehicles stay consistent (ash = weather, mask = vein-glass). The only friction is an occasional elevated latinate noun (“renunciation,” “impermanence”) that feels one register notch above the scatterer’s tactile idiom; minor, but keeps this from 9+ territory.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The premise—portraits must be burned and ash scattered inside the wound-object—is non-obvious and fully committed to; the story never flinches from its own ritual logic. The porcelain mask repurposed as reliquary feels inevitable in hindsight yet fresh at first encounter. Risk is taken with lyric repetition and a quiet ending, but coherence and cost remain legible. Transformative specificity lifts this well above “art therapy” cliché.</comment>
