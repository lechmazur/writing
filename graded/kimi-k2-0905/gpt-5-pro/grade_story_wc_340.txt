<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The servant’s contradictory mix of warm curiosity and deliberate detachment is dramatized in every beat—slipping on the goggles, reading the diary, choosing silence—so the final renunciation feels earned. Interiority is concrete (“a cup catching only what overflows”) and never drifts into diagnostic talk. The only thing keeping this from 9-band is that the cost of renunciation is more conceptual than viscerally felt on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The ten-floor climb is a perfect causal ratchet: each numbered stop both tightens time and reveals new knowledge that forecloses options. Closure lands as Earned Stasis—the goggles and diary are relinquished, breathing out the names— with visible conceptual cost (“the letters finally settle into sleep”). Lens is cleanly Causal throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The icebound spire is not backdrop; its rattling cage, hoarfrost corridor, and crystalline map physically force the servant’s choices. The goggles act as micro-setting, refracting both light and meaning, and their final stillness in the “forgetter room” reweights the entire ascent. No other 600-word piece this cycle uses environment this integrally.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—keep Madam Vire safe from grief—tightens each floor: the diary’s existence threatens her, the map offers a way to bury it, the final room demands surrender. One meaningful turn at seventh-floor stop crystallizes cost; coincidence never rescues. The servant’s agency is renunciation rather than heroic action, perfectly scaled to lyric mode.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the servant’s stance: witnessing without fixing is itself a form of love. The goggles shift from relic to altar to grave-goods; the diary moves from secret to shared burden to buried past. Final image of letters “settling into sleep” offers non-literal answer—memory can be laid to rest only if someone consents to forget. No moralizing, pure resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Voice is a sustained, shivering lyricism—“winter throat clearing for a whispered confession”—that never loses clarity. Syntax modulates with altitude: longer clauses at lower floors, fractured fragments as hoist shudders. Goggles-as-lens metaphor is taught early and paid off visually. No head-hop, no filter-verb bloat, zero register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Almost every sentence layers job: elevator creak = emotional tension, salt-rimed brass = backstory, “lantern warms a cabin without singeing the maps” = character ethic. A single mixed metaphor—“letters rose like frost ferns warmed by a distant hearth”—slightly chills the peak beat, preventing 9.0. Otherwise flawless rhythm, zero loops, no scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The encrypted-diary-via-scattered-light reveal is a fresh hinge I haven’t seen; it grows organically from goggles + ice + altitude. Ten-floor elevator as real-time hourglass feels inevitable yet new. Risky lyric density pays off because closure image is legible. Not quite 9 because premise is still “servant discovers mistress’s secret,” a familiar spine even if ornament is original.</comment>
