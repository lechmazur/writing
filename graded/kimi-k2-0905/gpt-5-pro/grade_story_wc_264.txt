<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The guard’s renunciation of sleep and selfhood is embodied in the palm-on-clock moment; the contradictory impulse—cling to lone humanity vs dissolve into quantum guard-duty—plays out in scene. Interiority is concrete (“midnight freezes further inside his veins”) rather than diagnostic. The cost is visible (perpetual wakefulness, diffusion of self), but the interior contradiction could sharpen earlier to intensify the final sacrifice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the frozen clock and scattered embers reweight the world’s depleted logic. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each image thickens the same stake of salvaged futurity—and the final image makes the cost undeniable (“a small moon he can neither spend nor forgive”). Orientation is taught early by lyric dislocation, waived at close.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The glowing dune, skeletal train, and chess clock are tactile, specific, and return charged. Micro-setting works: the railman’s circle scratched in luminescent sand becomes the portal, constraining the charm. The algae-fed bloom is more postcard than pressure-source; a mid-scene sensory twist that threatened the seeds would have pushed higher.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—rescue possible futures—signals in line 1 and tightens when the archive demands sleep as payment. Agency remains diffused across quantum selves, but the palm-on-clock beat visibly forecloses rest, meeting the price test under Accumulative lens. One meaningful deepening suffices; earlier visible losses (matches, stamina) could sharpen escalation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from iterated spark/corner imagery migrating from threat to promise. Final image of unpaid moon reframes prior ashes as seedbed without moralizing. Subtext in silence—train that must forget its dead—creates lingering irony. Avoids thematic echo; the lullaby stays fractured, not explanatory.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lyric third-person hovers at consistent psychic distance; diction stays inside guard’s railman lexicon (“sleepers,” “switching yard”). Rhythmic reverb—“occasionally everywhere,” “corners answer with light”—is pattern-taught early and paid off. Filter verbs minimal; syntax mirrors quantum diffusion without head-hop.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High information density: one sentence often sets scene, mood, and physics (“dune’s glow brushing his boots with pollen colored like drowned stars”). Occasional modifier stacks (“fractured lullaby,” “divergent archive”) flirt with purple but serve voice. No loops or scaffold; metaphors stay coherent. Final third clean, allowing 9-band reach.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fusing quantum rail lore with dying-earth salvage yields a singular angle; “railman’s circle” as occult tech feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk in lyric montage heightens coherence rather than gimmick. Small deduction for faint echo of “last” tropes (last forest, last train), but transformation through algae-star ash and sleeper-seeds keeps freshness.</comment>
