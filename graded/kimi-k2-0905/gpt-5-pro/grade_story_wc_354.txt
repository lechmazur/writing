<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The exile-tutor’s “thoughtfully precise” trait is embodied in every micro-choice—handing the stone, placing the king, tipping it as libation—so the final renunciation feels earned. Interior contradiction is present but subtle; a sharper moment of private doubt mid-scene would have pushed this to 9+. The student’s stillness-as-reply forces a visible shift in status, satisfying the relationship crucible. Cost is legible: the tipped king forecloses return to the city’s speed-trusting past.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the tipped king and rising needle reconfigure the covenant with undeniable conceptual cost—“keepers until morning” lands as both honor and sentence. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens: each chess move correlates with magnetic/avian signals, tightening the silence until the field “considers us again.” Orientation is taught by line 3; no penalty. No artifact obscures the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The magnetic rail, basalt stone, and aurora-constrained board function as micro-setting that literally guides piece placement; removing any one breaks the tactic chain. Cold iron’s hum, snowmotes on wool, and the guard’s lantern create a sensory hierarchy filtered through the tutor’s risk-calculating ear. Spatial choreography is immaculate: bodies, pieces, compass needle track cleanly across the parapet. Weather and metal jointly decide the final quiet widening that recharges the covenant.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“mend the eclipsed covenant before the registry seals names”—is signaled early and tightens with every chess-correlated bird-flight. The queen’s arrival on the back rank followed by the king’s libation constitutes a meaningful deepening that forecloses the option of speed-trusting shortcuts. Cost is visible: the tutor’s voluntary abdication of the board certifies exile’s humility. Pressure is coherent under Accumulative lens; one decisive intensification suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the tutor’s argument: beauty is discovered in the difficult, paid for through silence, patience, and the tipped king. No moral is stated; the final image of “keepers until morning” reweights the premise without sermon. Subtext lives in gesture—the stone’s transfer, the knight held to aurora—never in exposition. The covenant’s revival carries conceptual cost, inviting reflection on listening as civic resistance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>First-person voice is textured, rhythmic, and character-specific: “velvet throat,” “board inhaled,” “catalogues of wind.” Compression (“words had become tariffs”) is taught early and paid off at closure. No head-hopping; perceptual signature remains the exile’s risk-calculating ear. Dialogue is absent by design; silence itself becomes the spoken idiom, a bold choice that heightens coherence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm modulates from long, breath-filled lines to the staccato of “the rail sang, the needle rose,” mirroring the widening quiet. Figurative language is dense yet purposeful; no mixed metaphors dull the final libation. Information density is high—each pawn lantern, ivy catalogue, or compass twitch does double duty. A single paraphrase loop (“catalogues: small catalogues…”) is too minor to touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The fusion of geomagnetic chess, avian migration, and civic covenant is fresh yet inevitable in hindsight. Risk—using silence as dialogue, chess as geomancy—heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Specificity anchors novelty: basalt dent, iron nib kissing plate, “keepers until morning.” The synthesis feels singular; swap any detail and the tactic chain collapses.</comment>
