<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The potter’s calm, tactile interiority is credibly idiosyncratic—clay under nails, “slow enough to hear clay explaining itself.” Choices (mending trough, brushing the queen’s crown) flow from this calm curiosity and trigger visible environmental feedback, so agency stays embodied. However, the arc is observational; the decisive “bow” and departure feel lightly motivated—no contradiction or visible cost inside the narrator, only a conceptual thrum. A stronger interior squeeze or palpable renunciation would push this to 8.5+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each tender micro-repair adds a strand of kindness-density until the oasis itself answers; closure is a Charged Poise (“a pulse I felt in ankle, wrist, and teeth”) that reweights earlier braids with conceptual cost. Orientation is swift (who/where by line 4), pattern taught early, transitions legible even across braided time. One causality bob: the lantern glass “tugs wrists” but never alters immediate tactics—small, non-closure, so −0.2. Still, the final accord lands with undeniable felt cost, satisfying the lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Desert oasis, collapsed hives, scorched windbreaks: every sensory pick is filtered through a potter’s haptic bias—clay, kiln-smoke, “iron-true” lantern frame. The micro-setting (faded lantern glass) literally refracts braided timelines and thus constrains the final choice; this is the 9+ gate passed. Spatial choreography is immaculate; no impossible positions. One minor over-indulgence: “braids… like freshwater hair” slightly repeats the already-visible braid image, keeping it shy of 9.2.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes are abstract but legible: learn the ligament that lets a place resist erasure. Pressure deepens via environmental micro-reactions to kindness (leaf uncurls, moth lands), tightening the accretive pattern rather than narrowing external options; cost is conceptual—accepting responsibility to pass the knowledge on. No antagonist or reversal, but under Accumulative lens that is acceptable. Could use one sharper moment where kindness almost fails, to raise felt price and reach 8.8.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: persistent, gentle repairs—unseen, unrewarded—form a temporal glue stronger than fire or war. The oasis-as-organism trope is refreshed by phototropic kindness as an ecological rule, not moral slogan. Final image of “light turning kindly toward me” elegantly re-prices prior braids without sermon. A hairline notch down for leaning on the word “kindness” itself twice in exposition; subtext almost does the job alone.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is potter-patient, compressed, rhythmic: “questions nested under my ribcage,” “sharp gentleness given to light.” Syntax mirrors tactile slowness—no filter-verb clutter, no head-hop. Perceptual signature holds under pressure; even the braided visions stay inside the lantern-mediated focalizer. A single cadence hiccup: “the hush so complete that the memory of bees seemed louder than wind” edges toward aphorism, but the overall control and ear variance earn 9.0.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</question>
<comment>High density, low scaffold: sentences multitask (sense + metaphor + push). No synonym loops; only two adjacent “braid” mentions, but spaced enough. Metaphors obey internal physics (glass threads, glaze curing). One mixed image: “chimney smoke flattens” is excellent, yet “freshwater hair” slightly muddles salt/land context—minor, non-closure. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with scene tempo. Clean copy: pronouns, tense, punctuation flawless.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The phototropic-oasis concept fused with braided stewardship timelines is genuinely fresh; it reframes climate hope without utopia. Risk—lyric mosaic, no conventional plot—pays off because pattern is taught early and closure re-weights meaning. Specificity (tiny queen crown, sparrow-heart cup) prevents abstraction. Transformation test fails if potter & lantern removed, confirming integration. Minor echo of “kindness as sunlight” trope keeps it from 9.5.</comment>
