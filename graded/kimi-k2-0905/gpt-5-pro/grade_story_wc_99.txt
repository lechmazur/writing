<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>The bonsai tutor’s interior contradiction—patience laced with guilt—is embodied in micro-choices (snip the branch, open the compass, speak the apology). Emotions stay concrete; the “slow-spoken” trait shapes gesture, not label. Flaw (guilt) drives every beat; renunciation at the blue pool costs him the chance to unsay the silence. No stock abstraction, no safety-hedging—character remains individual, though the late arrival of Mara as off-page motivator slightly dilates relational crucible pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Accumulative/lyric lens: cadence shift from garden ritual to tidal release. Closure lands as Charged Poise—the blue bloom reweights prior guilt without tidy absolution, compass needle resting inward. Cost is the visible cerulean stain on tools and self. Orientation anchored early (islet, after severance); pattern taught by 25 % via lace instructions.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Micro-setting triumph: juniper, compass, and tidal pool function as handled geography that constrains every snip and apology. Weathered rock and rinsed air evolve with the beat; black-stone pool becomes final altar. Specificity anchors rather than decorates. Tool-states (open compass, indigo bowl) are tracked cleanly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—release the unsaid apology—tightens once: from withheld syllables to blue diffusion. Escalation is accumulative: each berry crushed, each needle shift, increases emotional density rather than causal reversals. Visible price: the stain that cannot be unstained. Agency remains decision/renunciation rather than confrontation, fitting lyric design.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from color-as-apology motif: regret can be tended, not excised. Final blue bloom offers non-literal reprice—silence now pigmented, hence acknowledged. No moralizing line; wisdom stays implicit in the indigo migration from berry to branch to breath. Resists tidy comfort, keeps moral ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>First-person lyric voice sustains perceptual signature: narrator notices through gardener’s bias—growth rings, root hearing, leaf shift. Syntax slows to match “slow-spoken,” then breathes with tide. No head-hopping; unreliability is subtle (compass mistrusts north). Control of psychic distance under pressure: compression at berry-crush without register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>High density: one sentence often layers action, image, and metaphor (“I crushed indigo berries and let their blue bleed into a bowl of rain, watched the stain widen and forgive”). Rhythm varies; paragraph cuts carry emotional charge. No scaffold loops, no template cadence. Mixed metaphors are rare and functional (“compass listens like a clam”). Closure beat is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: bonsai pruning as apology ritual, lace pattern as instruction manual, compass that forsakes north for inward. Risky lyric structure paid off by coherent blue reconfiguration. Specificity of “cerulean regret” feels inevitable, not ornamental. Not a bolt-on conceit; every detail grows from gardener worldview.</comment>
