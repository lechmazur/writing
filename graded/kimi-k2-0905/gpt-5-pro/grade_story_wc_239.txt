<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The witness-narrator’s interiority is lyrically specific (“words were the smallest gears I trusted”) and the micro-choice to read the dictionary aloud to the chorus visibly alters the field, earning a conceptual renunciation. Yet the self-description “wanderingly exact” is asserted twice without being tested in a contradictory beat, so the trait remains decorative rather than a flaw that costs. No second on-page character means relationship/status bullets are waived; the single-POV arc is coherent but the absence of a tangible setback keeps the score below 8.0.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the library’s spiral slows and the illusion folds into the communal definition, cost felt in the narrator’s outward breath that becomes the door. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each circle tightens the braid of revisions until meaning dew condenses on the dictionary page. Orientation is taught early (“the ancient temple library lost in time”) so the waiver applies; causality is internal and coherent. A hairline slip: “history eased around the dais” is slightly abstract, keeping the score shy of 9.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The library-as-body metaphor (shelves curve like ribs, world inhales through me) constrains movement and literally steers the arbitration; the dictionary tool changes state from closed wing to shared lens, charging the final image. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven: drafts, dust constellations, ink warming under fingertip. Spatial choreography is clean—three circles tracked without drift. Environment directly enables the conceptual payoff, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—unravel illusions before they harden—stays legible; pressure escalates via the chorus tightening its braid, forcing the narrator to cede declarative authority. Agency is present (pacing, reading aloud) but the cost is conceptual rather than visceral; no tangible resource is lost. One meaningful deepening occurs at circle three when the dictionary page is communalized, narrowing options from private meaning to shared definition. Sufficient for 8.0, but lacks a persistent constraint that would push higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: play (ludere) reframes illusion from threat to collaboration, achieving Conceptual Repricing without moralizing. The final sentence (“We unify by agreeing to be seen through one another”) is earned by the spiral walk and chorus flattening. No thesis statement intrudes; meaning arises through image and action. Ambiguity lingers—who is the “we”?—but that complexity is welcomed, not confusing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>First-person voice sustains a perceptual signature of bibliophilic synesthesia: pages “flutter,” ink “warms,” definitions “smile.” Rhythmic control mirrors the spiral—long clauses for inhale, fragments for step-count. No dialogue to judge; free indirect style is clean. Purposeful elision (“no outside”) is taught early and paid off when the breath becomes door. Voice stays coherent under pressure without head-hop.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops or synonym churn; each sentence advances image, motion, or concept. Metaphors are internally coherent (dust → constellations → lens) and never mixed. Syntax varies from hieratic cadence to whispered brevity, matching the resounding hush. Opening and final lines anchor and resolve with imagistic precision, satisfying the read-aloud ear test.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The spiral-arbitration premise is non-obvious and inseparable from execution: movement literally manufactures consensus. Transformation test fails if relocated to a committee room—setting and method are fused. Risky lyric compression (“library listened back”) pays off by making the final image uncanny yet legible. Fresh inflection: democracy as kinesthetic geometry rather than verbal debate.</comment>
