<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The folklorist’s interiority is vivid—her bodily memory of cider, woodsmoke, mother’s hands—but the only on-page choice is stepping into the mushroom ring; the “wrong name” debt is inherited, not freshly enacted, so the cost feels pre-paid rather than earned in-scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the right name surfaces, the greenhouse exhales, the coat of light is worn—an earned reconfiguration under an Accumulative/Textural lens; the missing-star mapping is the single tightening that reweights memory’s absence, and cost is legible in the final taste of cider.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The sunken greenhouse constrains every move: broken panes dictate star-maps, silt geometry forbids careless fin strokes, the mushroom circle literally gates the past; the setting is not backdrop but the mechanism that retrieves memory and charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Pressure escalates through pattern deepening—each retrieved fragment (cider, smoke, mother’s hands) narrows the protagonist’s stance until stepping into the ring is the only remaining option; the cost is the swallowed bitterness of the first apple, paid on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as the price of naming: giving the wrong name once mortgages a lifetime; the final coat of light reweights earlier bargains without moralizing, letting the taste of cider carry the conceptual invoice.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is oceanic-literate, compressed, and rhythmically tidal—“consonants snap like fish,” “barnacle tenors”—maintaining perceptual signature even under peak pressure; no head-hop, no filter-verb fog, every elision taught by the opening silt-memory contract.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Line-level craft is dense yet buoyant—information dual-loads (e.g., “apples that have learned to sway like anemones” fuses botany with marine drift); zero paraphrase loops, no mixed metaphors, and the final “spores settle like first snow” crystallizes without cliché.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The premise—diver-folklorist recovering memory from a drowned orchard via star-gap cartography—feels inevitable yet uncatalogued; risk lies in treating a fairy ring as a legitimate epistemic instrument, and the story commits fully, turning mushroom spores into mnemonic currency.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Setup: profession named early; Development: “hands-on” verified by touching the ring; Closure: the coat of light is worn—three gates met, with causal pressure in the middle beat.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Setup: antique ladder circle; Development: touched, trembles, releases pollen; Closure: spores settle as final snow, reweighting the debt—irreplaceable gateway.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Setup: “decades later” stated; Development: adult body remembers child bargain; Closure: wrong name unwound—timeframe shapes stakes but could swap to “years” with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.4</grade>
<comment>Setup: “chronically curious” declared; Development: tests the ring anyway; no visible cost tied to curiosity itself—trait enables but does not tax.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Setup: “detect” named; Development: maps missing stars; Closure: constellations yield the right name—two beats drive the turn.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Setup: method named; Development: studies gaps; Closure: gaps rhyme with portholes—mechanics constrain tactics across beats.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Setup: greenhouse described; Development: silt geometry limits fin strokes; Closure: structure exhales relief—setting actively gates memory retrieval.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade>
<comment>Setup: “when habits break” quoted; Development: pattern listens as name is corrected; Closure: old mispronunciation released—timeframe tightens the ritual moment.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Setup: “recover stolen memories” declared; Development: fragments spool; Closure: coat of light restores cider taste—desire drives every beat.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Setup: “crisp nostalgia” in quiet interval; Development: peppermint sting keeps present tense; Closure: first-snow spores modulate to quiet ache—tone shifts with pressure.</comment>
