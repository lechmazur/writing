<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Mara’s interior contradiction—reclusive yet compelled to safeguard unspoken memory—remains lyrically present but thinly dramatized; only one micro-choice (cupping the box, sealing it) visibly alters tactics. The promise to “carry weight, not translate” crystallizes endurance with cost, yet the prior beats stay weighted on atmospheric perception rather than pressured decision.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the ellipse of breath/dust re-threads the covenant, the box now a portable heart whose weight forecloses return home. Accumulative lens holds: each elemental image (hive, pane, ghost-veil) accretes until the final hush reweights meaning with undeniable conceptual cost—“the hives clicked yes.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Black-sand bee-grave, pollen-furred seams, clover-tasting air—each sensory layer is filtered through Mara’s “listening” bias and finally charges the closing image. Micro-setting (the box as portable shrine) directly shapes her circular choreography; no orientation debt.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Single dominant stake—preserve unspoken weight—tightens when Mara realizes speech once cracked the vow; her renunciation of language enacts the retied covenant. Cost is legible: she bears exile-with-box, wind agreeing via slackened heat-shimmer, tactics permanently narrowed to carrying, not telling.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme of listening-as-sweetness emerges wordlessly: covenant shifts from honey production to tending pause/shadow. Final image answers the core question—how to keep memory alive—by fusing silence, glass-hued light, and collaborative breath into a portable, wordless liturgy.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person hover remains tightly fused to Mara’s perceptual bias—synesthesia of scent, pressure, temperature—without head-hop. Compressed lyric cadence is taught in line one and paid off in the closing ellipse; no register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>High figurative density risks purple overload (“mute eloquence of labor ended yet still resonant”), yet rhythm breathes in tandem with escalating hush. No loops, clear propulsion, clauses carry double duty; metaphors stay internally consistent (glass/pollen/veil).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Beekeeping-as-monastic-listening feels fresh; stained-glass reliquary for unspoken words offers non-obvious synthesis. Risky lyric compression succeeds because pattern is taught early and closure recharges it with social cost—new covenant visible in ghost-veils lifted to her.</comment>
