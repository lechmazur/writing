<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Interiority is rich and embodied; the narrator’s contradictory impulses (calm vs. cut thumb) collide in-scene. The final choice to walk the fracture is earned by prior micro-choices and costs the illusion of neutrality. Minor slip: “diagnostic” self-labeling in “calmly intuitive” drifts toward therapy-speak, capped at 8.8.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: shard → mirrors → globe → envoy promises → joint walk. Closure is a Charged Poise: the lantern beam stitches pans while the narrator steps into slush—cost is the forfeiture of detached safety. Persistent constraint: the shard shard still in pocket reminds humility will keep shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>“Lighthouse orchard,” “ice floes scraping like arguments,” and the velvet runner in the mirror-shop anchor every beat. The globe-as-tool and lantern beam function as micro-settings that constrain final action. Spatial choreography is flawless—bodies, crates, boots, floe edges track cleanly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prevent floe-war flare—tightens when the shard demands a lived act, not pose. Escalation: shard cuts thumb → globe flares only after promises cost sleds & fish cellars. Price is on-page: narrator must leave gallery and wade slush at dawn. One hairline slip: envoys’ ridicule “tinder” is tell-adjacent.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme—empathy as practised bridge, not spectacle—emerges through ferry-rope & bee-stove images re-projected by the globe. No moralizing; the orchard receives the bow, re-weighting neutrality as cultivated balance. Final lantern seam re-prices the premise: peace is a walk, not a verdict.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>First-person voice carries a frost-rimed lyric cadence that modulates under pressure: short clauses during thumb-cut, lengthening rope & stove visions. Distinct perceptual signature—sap on gloves, tart patience of trees—never leaks. Compression like “weighted breath” is pattern-taught and paid off in envoy silence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Rhythm breathes with scene tempo; no loops or scaffold. Metaphors integrate physics (“ice took a slow step”) without contradiction. Information density high: one sentence can place, act, and tilt stakes. Minor register lift: “conceptual repricing” is evaluator language, not narrator’s—keeps below 9.0.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Arctic peace-orchard + empathy-activated shard + mirror vocational futures feels unprecedented yet inevitable. The globe’s hum as “tuned long-wave set” particularizes the magic. Risk—lyric accretion instead of battle scene—heightens stakes without gimmick. If the ferry/bee visions had been generic archetypes, freshness would dip; they are instead idiosyncratic lived drafts.</comment>
