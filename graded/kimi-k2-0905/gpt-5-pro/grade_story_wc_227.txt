<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>The alchemist’s contradictory impulses—clutching mask vs. stylus, doubting yet diving—are enacted in scene, not summarized. His micro-choice to liquefy the charm (memento of identity) into the engine’s crack dramatizes the “kintsugi” self-repair and pays the story’s only tangible cost. Interiority stays concrete, sensorily anchored to limefat, vitriol, salt-phantom. The final Earned Stasis (engine breathes, he exhales) is credible because every prior beat has forced him to wager identity against function.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the molten charm becomes the golden seam that lets the wheel turn—cost is the lost talisman itself. The lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern (statue pockmarks → gear ratios) is taught by 25 % and reweights meaning at the end. One orientation wobble—late naming of the “stormwheel” could have come sooner—but the acid-sea logic holds without retro-patching. The final image (warm plate against forehead) crystallizes the before/after: broken self re-accepted, workshop adrift but alive.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>The gears-and-cogs workshop, the acid sea, and the neutralizing vat together form a micro-setting that literally constrains every move: the alchemist must work underwater, hold breath, grease gloves. The statue’s pockmarks evolve from erosion scars to a readable star-map that calibrates the engine—environment directly supplies the solution. Sensory triage (burning rain, lukewarm vat, limefat) is filtered through urgency; no cataloguing. Spatial choreography stays clean: dip-rise-scribble-dive cycle is trackable.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—conjure meaning before the acid dissolves craft—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens when the seals fail, forcing underwater work. The single meaningful deepening occurs when the charm is sacrificed: the price (loss of teacher’s token) is visible and irreversible, reweighting the stake from “save workshop” to “accept broken self.” Agency remains with the alchemist; no coincidences. Escalation is modest but sufficient for 700-word scale; the final breath is felt cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme of meaning-as-repair emerges through the kintsugi motif without explicit sermon: gold alloy literally holds the cracked engine and the cracked self. Subtext resides in silence—the absent teacher’s laugh echoing in the charm’s warmth—rather than exposition. Final image offers Charged Poise: workshop drifts under an unseen current, mercy unspoken. No tidy moral; ambiguity lingers in the acid sea still waiting.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric-accretive, taught early by patterned elision (“between breaths held underwater”) and paid off in the final exhale. Syntax mirrors alchemical process: long combustive sentences under vat, crisp inventory lines above. Perceptual signature—acid as memory, pockmarks as constellations—remains character-bound. No head-hopping; distance stays tight to uncertain alchemist. Non-standard punctuation (lack of quotes around “narrate”) reads as voice-motivated and legible.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with scene: underwater clauses lengthen, surface sentences shorten. Figurative density is high but patterned (gears, stars, scars) and pays off in final alloy vein—no mixed metaphors. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or ratio. Occasional elevated diction (“kintsugi intentions,” “conceptual repricing”) is justified by alchemist’s vocation. Clean copy; no typos or pronoun drift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: acid-sea steampunk meets kintsugi philosophy, welded by statue-as-star-chart. Premise is non-obvious yet internally coherent. Risk in lyric elision succeeds because closure image (warm plate, drifting current) reconfigures stakes without explaining them. Transformation test fails—story collapses if charm, statue, or vat removed. No derivative echoes.</comment>
