<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction is vivid—“wearing failure like a map I had misread” vs. the resolve to harvest insight—yet the single on-page choice (playing the flute to listen, not cross) is micro, not path-altering; cost is felt but scaled to lyric mode, satisfying Earned Stasis.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the loom settles, markers curve toward listeners, stance reconfigured with conceptual cost—“I will carry driftwood… where the listening begins.” Accumulative/Textural lens holds; pattern taught early via canyon hush ↔ loom braid; no causality break.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Canyon walls, dried-river shale, driftwood markers, and the flute-as-micro-setting constrain every move; the final image of dew-lit driftwood arrows reweights the stake. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven, never touristic; spatial choreography remains exact.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—harvest insight from failure—tightens when the corridor offers a twin valley judgment; the protagonist’s shift from crossing to listening forecloses the old guardian path. Pressure escalates via pattern intensification (hush → loom → shared breath) with visible cost: relinquishing ownership of the seam.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the loom image: failure not as wound to close but as edge to share. No moralizing; final reconfiguration—“teaching edges to share”—reweights prior guardianship without abstraction. Ambiguity lingers credibly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is crystalline—“avalanchingly quiet,” “corridor the color of rain”—syntax mirrors breath-based music; no head-hop, no register drift. Lyric compression is pattern-taught and paid off in the final braid.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with flute phrases; sentences vary from fragment threads to long loom-like braids. No scaffold, no mixed metaphors. Information density high—each line advances memory, setting, or stake. Minor elevation in “thunder-echo range” repeats but serves cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Transforms portal fantasy trope into post-failure listening ritual; driftwood compass and gilded reed flute feel invented, not borrowed. Risky lyric accumulative structure commits fully and pays off. Specificity anchors universals—“valley offers a corridor the color of rain.”</comment>
