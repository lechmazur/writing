<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The locksmith’s interiority is concrete—his vow, periphery habit, and cellar-of-reason metaphor remain consistent and embodied. Micro-choices (chalking daisy-angles, filing gears to echo-count) reveal values under pressure. Yet the arc is more absorption than change: no contradictory impulse or visible flaw is tested; the stance at exit is the stance at entry, so the “earned change” bar is only partly met.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/lyric lens: echo-density grows into a pattern that reweights time itself; closure lands as Charged Poise—tuned timer breathes, winter-humility jar labeled. Orientation anchors by line 4 (who, where, when). Causality is present though soft: because the cave tallies whispers, therefore the locksmith harvests them to rebuild the escapement; the stakes tighten when the cave’s indifferent tutelage forces him to pay with patience and calibrated silence. Cost is legible in the final image—“wounded season” watermark inside the mechanism—so the closure is intact.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Marble cavern is not backdrop but instrument: its fossilized light and drip-intervals physically constrain how time is re-measured. The timer’s gear-train is literally cut to the cave’s echo-lengths; setting and tool merge into one micro-environment that dictates the final beat. Spatial choreography stays clean—angles are chalked, chime placed, echoes routed—no floating props. Sensory hierarchy obeys POV: cool air, stalled click, copper cup stroked by bone reed all serve the goal of harvesting pauses.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restoring wonder-time—signals early. Escalation is the deepening density of harvested echoes; each return bruises or refines the gear teeth, narrowing options until only cave-tempo remains. Protagonist agency is continuous (adjusting balance wheel, filing gears), but the cost is largely opportunity—no credible loss of tool, stamina, or social credit appears on-page, so the tightening stays conceptual rather than visceral. Still, the final image reweights the premise: civic tick now carries winter-humility, foreclosing ordinary seconds forever.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete particulars: doors that refuse curiosity, cellar of reason, watermark of wounded season—never abstractly named. The reconfiguration is conceptual: time is repriced as echo-forged humility rather than mechanical precision, resonating without moralizing. Ambiguity is purposeful—reader must decide whether storing wonder is preservation or avoidance—yet the emotional after-effect is concrete. No final-paragraph thesis is offered; the jar’s label is the only quiet verdict.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>First-person lyric voice maintains a consistent perceptual signature—edges, peripheries, fossils, shy grazing echoes. Syntax lengthens and compresses with task: filing metal is clipped, drip-counting stretches, final cadence settles into ceremonial hush. Diction stays within locksmith lexicon yet lifts to cave-myth register (“marble breath,” “signed treaty”) without register drift. No head-hop, no filter-verb clog; compression during high-attention beats is purposeful.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm alternates long breath-units with hammer-beat fragments; no template cadence detected. Figurative language is dense—fossilized light, cave water scent, bird-that-imitates-chains—but each image advances either setting-tool fusion or stakes (echo = time = gear). Mixed metaphors are avoided; vehicles stay physically coherent. Minor scaffold: “angle of incidence, angle of retreat” is immediate paraphrase—drops the score a hair. No artifact touches the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: locksmith as time-thief who picks cave-echoes instead of locks, harvesting silence to rebuild a timer—trope inversion feels inevitable in hindsight. Conceptual risk—using marble acoustics as literal clock-escapement—pays off without gimmickry; world logic stays internally consistent. Specificity (“daisy of chalk marks,” “reed of bone”) prevents abstraction. The story could not swap setting or occupation without collapse; the cavern is the machine.</comment>
