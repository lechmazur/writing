<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interiority is rich and embodied; the mortician’s contradictory calm/grief is dramatized through micro-choices (warming emerald against own palm, threading color from spark). Mother’s remembered voice supplies credible pressure without slipping into label-speak. Renunciation—letting the spark go—carries visible cost in the final image, fully earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the emerald’s glimmer at mother’s throat crystallizes the threshold rule and forecloses reunion. Causal chain holds—each step from meltwater wash to mirror angle is because/therefore linked. Cost is palpable in the narrator’s relinquishing touch; no omniscient leap.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Skyborne grotto functions as micro-setting: aurora light supplies the literal power source for the emerald and dictates the hush-timing. Spatial choreography is flawless—stalactite beads, gull shadows, arch aperture all track without drift. Final image re-weights the grotto itself as threshold keeper.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“can I keep a last spark for recognition”—tightens once: spark captured, then released into braid. Escalation is situational pressure under hush-rule; narrator’s agency is the choice to let go, not force resurrection. Visible cost is the severing of tactile contact; no coincidence muddies the turn.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from return vs. release: the mirror is held, yet the living must walk away. Emerald’s glow re-priced from promise to lantern-for-others, a conceptual shift that answers the mother’s request without moralizing. Resonance lingers in comb-threaded spark, not abstract dictum.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</question><grade>Lyric first-person sustains a mortician’s hush-register—“luminous and unbreathing,” “radiant hush”—without purple drift. Syntax elongates then contracts to mimic breath-control under aurora. No head-hop; perceptual signature is consistent: light on stone, scent of clay, braid as clock.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High information density: one sentence often layers sensory, emotional and world-rule data. Zero loops; no mixed metaphors. Rhythm breathes—long cadence for aurora descent, clipped brush-stroke for final color. Closure line “lucidly watchful” echoes opening without scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Beautician-mortician in airborne aurora-grotto is fresh synthesis; concept commits fully to its physics of hush-light. Emerald-as-memory-condenser is re-wired from fantasy trope to elegiac tool. Risk of lyric stasis is offset by causal use-pattern taught early and paid off in final image.</comment>
