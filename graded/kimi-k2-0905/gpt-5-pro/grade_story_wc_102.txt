<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is lush, embodied, and contradicted in real time (“bellows pull open the small room of light” vs. “breath not taken once the door closed”). The micro-choice to widen the diaphragm literally admits the woman and reconfigures the chest-arch love-store—an earned, visible cost. Flaw: slight over-articulation of the healing thesis in the final paragraph; the kettle-of-steam image already showed it.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the storehouse of unused love is re-defined as the ribcage itself, and the key is to spend breath in “attentive kindness.” The before/after is legible—same arches, new circuit—and the cost is the perpetual spend of breath, not a one-time fix. Lens is Accumulative/Textural: cadence of breathing exposures intensifies until the final image reweights the premise. No causality breaks; orientation anchored by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The viaduct’s cracked-mortar trumpet-weeds, the friend’s slow-comet whisk, and the camera-bellows stitched to ribs all constrain tactics and charge the final “tender rooms” image. Fog acts as aperture-diffuser, literally governing how long the pinhole stays open. Micro-setting (rib-bellows) doubles as body-in-setting, passing the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“find where unused love is stored”—tightens when breathing choices physically widen the aperture to let the woman cross; each inhale forecloses the option to keep love sealed. Cost is legible: every future breath must now be spent as oil for the lamps. One meaningful deepening suffices; no external coincidence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the gesture itself: love is not a reservoir but a respiratory spend. The kettle steam condensing into wildflower-seed code is the non-literal answer, re-pricing attention as the only renewable oil. No final moral is stated; the image of “two quiet lungs” carries the conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Perceptual signature is consistent camera-obscura syntax: light corridors, salted emulsion, nebula-pressed paper. Rhythm modulates with inhale/exhale lengths; no head-hop. Compression (“pilgrim of sparks”) is taught early and paid off in the whisk comet. Dialogue minimal but voice-specific: “let your lungs act as ocean” carries subtextual permission.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>High information density: one sentence handles tool, breath, and metaphysics (“Through a length of clear tubing, my breath opens the aperture, then closes it like a tide”). No loops or scaffold; metaphor chain (lantern-bellows-tide-ocean) stays coherent. Minor near-repeat of “breathe” stem in final paragraph keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: camera-obscura + respiratory love-circuit. The spare comet-whisk spark choreography under a blooming viaduct feels inevitable yet unphotocopied. Risk in lyric elision pays off—closure still legible. Only half-step from full astonishment because the monk aphorism flirts with ready-made wisdom.</comment>
