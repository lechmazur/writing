<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The therapist’s calm micro-choices (using the vinyl shard as pick, dialing twice) embody “decisively kind” under lethal pressure. Ruth and Lena’s reparation is credible because the shard’s shared guilt is palpable. Interiority stays concrete—orange rind, kettle hum—never drifting into therapy-speak. The only flaw: the sister fight backstory is summarized, not dramatized, slightly muting motivational depth.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the gauze-wrapped shard pressed to muted strings reweights “broken things singing” with undeniable cost. Causal chain—bloodwork → rooftop → call → reunion → mute chord—holds without ellipsis gaps. Time, place, and cast are anchored by line 3; no orientation debt. The mute chord is the decisive physical act that makes the goodbye legible and final.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Rooftop fog, oxygen whisper, vinyl crescent—every sensory note is filtered through the therapist’s musician senses and steers choice (shard = pick). The shard’s black glint against sky charges the final mute chord. Spatial choreography is flawless: elevator heave, rail fog, bed wheels track continuously. Weather is not backdrop but the radiant haven that permits the flawless goodbye.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—deliver a flawless goodbye—tightens when bloodwork collapses time to “maybe a day.” mid-story escalation is the phone call that risks Lena’s refusal; the rooftop becomes the last stage. Cost is visible: the muted chord literally silences future music, the shard’s edge is softened under gauze. Agency resides in the therapist’s decisions to phone, to pick with the shard, to mute the strings.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: broken artifacts can be played, kindness is a practice not a mood. The vinyl shard’s transformation from weapon to pick to mute-tool reconfigures forgiveness as something sharp made useful. Final image of “broken things singing” offers conceptual repricing of mortality. No moralizing, only resonant particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>First-person voice carries a musician’s perceptual signature—strings, frets, resonance—without ever naming chords. Compression (“decisively kind is not a mood but a practice”) is taught early and paid off in the double-dial. Syntax breathes with scene: short staccato sentences during elevator ascent, longer legato lines during hymn. No head-hop; interior access stays strictly with therapist.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm alternates between propulsive anaphora (“I sing… I sing…”) and quiet reflective fragments, mirroring pulse and rest. Figurative language is sparse, precise: “sunlight blazing like a promise we can touch.” Zero paraphrase loops; each image advances story or atmosphere. No scaffold, no mixed metaphors, no register drift—prose is lean yet lyric.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Premise—hospice music therapist uses broken vinyl as pick to reunite sisters—feels fresh and inescapably specific. Risk of sentimentality is avoided by grounding every hymn in mundane objects (kettle, zipper, freezer). The mute chord as “flawless goodbye” is a non-obvious, inevitable invention. While hospice rooftop scenes exist, the shard-pick and olfactory hope twist the trope into new resonance.</comment>
