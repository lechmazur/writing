<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist’s underachieving-mage identity is concrete in the renunciation of his assistive-charm harness; his micro-choice to speak “salt, bread, thanks” instead of spells embodies contradictory impulses. Interiority stays particular (“I felt small, uncredentialed”) and the final stance of “waiting until the brilliant dimness brightened” is earned by prior causal beats. The absence of a second on-page character keeps relationship crucible idle, and the “brilliant dimness” epiphany edges close to diagnostic label-speak, preventing a higher band.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the keystone is returned, the city’s grip loosens, and the lingering luminance remains “unpossessed yet shared,” a conceptual cost that reweights the premise. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density mounts through recurring mist, silence, and light images until the final cadence shift. Orientation is anchored by line 7; no penalty. The only slack is a single soft causal link—why the garden trembles exactly when the stone is lifted—but the lyrical pattern teaches the reader to accept impossibility, so the lens stays intact.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The icebound spire and hanging garden are vividly selective—“ice scaled the granite,” “moonmilk saturated into stone”—and the micro-setting of the keystone pedestal constrains the final choice. Spatial choreography is clean: mist staircase, doorless landing, pavilion lean. Sensory hierarchy reflects the mage’s poetic bias; no tourism catalog. The environment does not merely mirror mood; the keystone’s temperature literally directs his slowing perception, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“find the sacred in the simple”—is signaled early and tightens when the protagonist must choose between engineered muse and unaided attention. The unstrapping beat is the visible cost that forecloses the easier path. Escalation is textural: each recurrence of mist/silence deepens the stakes until the final “handmade silence” crystallizes the new stance. No reversal or external antagonist is needed; the pressure is internal and coherent under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically from renouncing automation and embracing unmarketable attention; no final-paragraph moralizing. The keystone’s “accommodates impossibilities” is dramatized, not asserted. The ending image of “writing with absence” reweights prior material without slogan. One abstraction—“the city loosened its grip”—slips toward convenience, keeping it shy of 9.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>First-person POV remains stable; perceptual signature is distinct—“boots kiss vapor,” “light that remembered light.” Rhythm modulates with pressure: short clauses under stress, longer cadences in reflection. Filter verbs are minimal and voice-motivated. No dialogue to test, yet the prose carries subtext through indirection. The final flute-note wind is a perfect off-center image that recharges the motif.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Sentences do multiple jobs: “I set it back, because not everything precious needs relocating” compresses choice, theme, and cost. No loops or synonym churn; figurative language is sparse and coherent. One mixed metaphor—“architect’s patience” applied to a spire—barely grazes clarity. Opening and final lines are propulsive and earned. High density without clutter satisfies the 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The fusion of automated-creativity dystopia with mist-walking mysticism feels fresh and inevitable. The keystone’s refusal to grant power yet “enfold absence” flips the standard artifact trope. Specificity—“chipped bowl catching rain”—anchors universals. Risky lyric structure pays off in closure. Slight deduction for echoing familiar fantasy ascent tropes, but the conceptual reweighting is non-obvious.</comment>
