<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The narrator’s quietly rebellious trait is embodied in the consent to coherence and the drumming that keeps Jonah present; the cost—her own outline blurring—feels earned. Interiority is vivid (“metallic and sweet, like a bitten coin swirled in honeyed tea”) and motives stay consistent to love and refusal to let grief win. micro-choices (tapping yes with knuckles) crystallize values under pressure. The risk of permanent fusion is acknowledged, satisfying the “visible cost” test for 9+; only the slight abstractness of “auroral sorrow” keeps it just below the top band.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the final image of carrying “auroral sorrow like a lantern” reweights the stake and confirms the cost of shared dream coherence. Causal chain holds: drumming → garden response → memory overlap → consent → blurred outline; each step tightens options. Orientation is taught early via sensory anchors (“clinic lake,” “security drones drifted like drowsy moths”) so disorientation serves the dream-logic rather than confusing. The lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds throughout; pattern of sound → bloom → memory is legible at exit.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Sound-wave garden is not backdrop but instrument: hedges emit frequencies, lagoon surface answers percussion, rails throb warnings—environment actively constrains tactics. Sensory palette is balanced (metallic taste, shivering petals, luminous threads) and filtered through POV’s emotional bias. Spatial choreography is clean: walkway above lagoon, benches, bridge planks—body positions track. The auric lagoon returns reweighted at closure, meeting the 9+ gate; only minor wish for one more tactile garden interaction keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“let histories touch without flinching”—is signaled early and tightens when deeper coherence is offered; protagonist agency drives the escalation (consent via knuckles). Visible price (blur, possible permanent fusion) is legible on page. One meaningful deepening suffices for 600-word scope; no external antagonist needed. Could edge higher if the rail warning had forced an immediate tactical sacrifice rather than suspended risk, but cost is still felt.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme of love as shared rhythm emerges through concrete events—drumming, lagoon brightening, memory collision—never abstract assertion. Final lantern image reweights prior material without moralizing. Subtext in silence (grief steadied for an hour) carries more weight than dialogue. Minor sentimental shimmer in “dream deserved oxygen more than fear” is earned by preceding embodied cost, keeping it shy of 9.0.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>First-person lyric voice is distinct: syntax elongates then compresses (“I became the dock and the boat and the tide”) mirroring wave logic. Patterned elision (“auroral sorrow”) is taught early and paid off. No dialogue to distort; interior diction stays within plausible lexicon of bereaved lover. Perceptual signature—sound-as-bloom, starlight-as-thread—remains character-specific and coherent under stress. One hairline wobble: “conceptual integrity” phrase feels slightly above narrator’s pay grade, not enough to breach 9.0.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet breathable; mixed metaphors (“aurora drowned in a basin”) stay physically coherent. Rhythm varies from tidal sweep to single-word percussion (“Consent, I said”). Near-loop “drumming on everything” is motif, not artifact. One scaffold phrase—“quietly rebellious even against grief”—could compress, but it lands early and frames motive. No clarity loss at closure; final lantern image is crisp.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: memory-transfer via sonic garden replaces familiar VR/VR-trope, grounded in sensory particularity. Risk—possible permanent dissolution into garden chord—heightens stakes without gimmick. Transformation test fails if names/places swapped; detail is inseparable from conceptual frame. Bold lyric structure taught early and paid off. Minor echo of “lantern” trope is transformed by “auroral sorrow” modifier, justifying high-band reward.</comment>
