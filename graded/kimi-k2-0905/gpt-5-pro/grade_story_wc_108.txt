<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>The narrator’s contradictory impulses—panic-level phobia versus stunt-trained muscle memory—are dramatized in every beat (hands shake / body still moves). The final refusal to pull Kellan up is credibly mined from that split, so the renunciation carries cost. Interiority stays concrete, avoiding therapy-speak, and the micro-choice to thread the projector before the confrontation shows values in action. One minor slip: “I am firmly adaptive” is self-label mid-crisis; a dramatized beat of coral-like rebuilding would have sealed the trait on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Causal linkage holds: because the cast-plus-shell decodes the hiding place, the narrator gains the film; because the film is already looping overhead, Kellan’s swagger becomes impotent; therefore the floor-trap decision feels inevitable. Closure lands as Charged Poise—projector still whirring, narrator’s voice steadying—so options re-weight without exposition. Orientation anchors (rusted library, first hour after discovery) arrive before 120 words; deliberate starlit disorientation later pays off when constellations become the screen. The only hairline flaw: the ledger’s “purchased silence” is mentioned once and never visualized, so the social cost is slightly conceptual rather than felt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Environment is not postcard backdrop: warped book spines, iron smell, and rotten floorboards directly shape tactic—where to step, where to hide the microfilm. The seashell doubles as micro-setting cupped in the palm, its spiral guiding cipher alignment. Skylight constellations evolve from ambiance to projection surface, charging the final image. Weathered specificity (“rusted library under stars”) is irreplicable; swap setting and the trap-door beat collapses.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—own the truth of one’s bruised body—tightens exactly once when the microfilm sprays evidence across the ceiling, foreclosing the option to remain Jax. Escalation is causal under lens: each decryption step narrows tactical space until only the confrontation remains. Kellan’s lunge pays the visible price (rotten boards give way), satisfying the cost requirement. No second reversal, but at 700 words one meaningful tightening is sufficient.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</question>
<comment>Theme emerges without sermon: authorship of pain, the moral weight of borrowed skin. The microfilm flicker on the ceiling re-prices the premise—bruises now have authorial credit—achieving Conceptual Repricing. Subtext in Kellan’s silence after seeing the cast is louder than any monologue. Final line “my voice steadied like a rig” offers quiet, non-moral answer: ownership stabilizes identity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>First-person voice owns a stunt-performer’s perceptual signature: spatial exits, impact angles, sideways water entry physics. Diction stays within lexicon—no academic register drift—even during lyric bursts. Rhythmic compression under panic (“breath keeps arguing with itself”) is purposeful and paid off. No head-hopping; POV distance stable.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</question>
<comment>Sentence variety and information density high; metaphors (“air salted and still”) are precise, not stacked. No template cadence or synonym loops. One mixed vehicle—“certainty keeps the rest of me moving like a rehearsal mark”—but contained inside one beat and does not obscure causality. Final third is clean, allowing 9+ eligibility.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: stunt-double doppelgänger noir with a child’s cast as cipher key; seashell-as-lens-flare feels inevitable in hindsight. Risky star-screen projection elevates stakes without gimmickry. If you swap the shell or cast, the decoding vanishes—irreplaceable core. Minor one-idea proximity to Hollywood exposé tales prevents the last 0.1.</comment>
