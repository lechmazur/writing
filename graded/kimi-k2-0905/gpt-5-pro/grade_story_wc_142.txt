<comment>The narrator’s “dual allegiance” is dramatized in the micro-choice of handing the stone chip to both Yano and Miri; the embodied tension between guild order and council dignity is palpable. Interiority stays concrete—“the cold that built us”—rather than abstract labels. The final act of tucking the chip under the tongue turns memory into a bodily cost, earning the pivot. Voice remains singular, no head-hop, and the flaw—slightly over-eloquent diction under peak stress—is hairline.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the slowed drums and rerouted glitter current visibly reconfigure the city’s economic flow while the narrator tastes silt wisdom—legible conceptual cost. Causal chain holds: shrimp-mouth socket → path blooms → financiers deflected → clinics flooded. Lens is Accumulative/Textural; the tightening is the single cadence shift from spectacle to quiet anchoring. No orientation debt; anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 4.</comment>

<comment>The raft-city is filtered through the narrator’s carnival-route POV—confetti, tide charts, diesel-and-jasmine wind—so environment constrains every tactical repaint. Micro-setting object, the foundation stone chip, literally locks into mural sockets to redirect foot traffic; its pocked surface is mapped like the city itself. Spatial choreography is flawless: rope bridges → mast climb → dock argument track cleanly. One hairline slip: “perpetual carnival” could use one more sensory bite (sound of calliope?) to hit 9.0.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—keep the city’s soul while surviving privatization—is signaled in line 2. Escalation is the single tightening: the parade route pivot that starves the glossy pier and feeds the clinics. Cost is visible—guild chief complains finale is “shrinking,” councilor fears for families—so trade-off is felt. Agency is narrator’s paint-and-chip choreography; no coincidence resolves. Slight dockside argument feels more negotiation than pressure, keeping it just under 8.8.</comment>

<comment>Theme emerges obliquely: survival through coded shared memory rather than overt protest. The stone chip’s return under the tongue reweights it from souvenir to covenant—Conceptual Repricing without moralizing. “Hopeful desperation” stays particular—citrus over rust—never drifts into abstract gentrification essay. Final image of diesel-and-jasmine wind offers quiet, non-literal answer: compromise smells of industry and bloom.</comment>

<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is distinctively carnival-insider: “routes were confetti, tide charts, and whispered apologies braided together.” Perceptual signature notices swirl-into-song flow and glitter eddies. Syntax flexes from long braid-sentences to staccato drum commands without losing control. No dialogue, so no convergence issue; diction stays within narrator’s plausible lexicon except one moment of “conceptual repricing” register trespass, forgiven at once.</comment>

<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: every line advances route, cash, or soul. Metaphors are coherent—confetti routes, shrimp-mouth socket—no mixed vehicles. Rhythm modulates from fireworks-folded-into-cinders compression to low-hum diesel-jasmine cadence. Only micro-loop: “rerouted the main glitter current around Old Clinic Row” repeats “route” notion already implicit; single −0.1, still 8.9.</comment>

<comment>Fresh synthesis: graffiti-as-infrastructure-code on a floating carnival city is non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Stone chip as physical key turns urban metaphor tactile. Risk—slowing the finale to save the soul—pays off narratively and thematically. No derivative premise; raft-city gentrification story feels singular, not template.</comment>
