<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The narrator’s interiority is vivid—arrowhead rubbing, pun on “sedimentality,” tasting river stain—yet the metamorphosis from spy to “vow” is more declared than dramatized; we see the flint become tongue, but the emotional cost of abandoning Marko lingers off-page. Still, the self-mockery and lyrical perceptual signature keep the voice individual and flawed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each lyrical shard thickens the subterranean texture until the final “phone clicked as if satisfied” reweights the stake—the city might remember without breaking. Causality is loose but coherent; the arrowhead’s hum, pollen orbit, and pun orbit accumulate into a Charged Poise that forecloses the old investigative stance with felt cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The garden’s brick ribs, dangling roots, and “spores…in rings” are sensuously particular and constrain tactics—pollen orbits only after the willow-spark ritual, making the micro-setting an actor. Frost, soil, and cordless-phone static cohere into an inhospitable yet breathable bubble that the final image recharges.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—can laughter re-stitch the city’s trauma?—tightens when the cryptid demands the pun; the arrowhead’s transformation from tool to tongue is the visible price, narrowing options from research to performative jest. Escalation is incremental-accumulative rather than causal-reversal, but the final pun crystallizes an irrevocable stance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through the pun-as-stitch: humor as insurgent healing against unspoken grief. The final non-literal answer—“keep the arrowhead dry, because it is a tongue now”—reweights earlier bitterness without moralizing, letting the cosmic joke confront cosmic bruise.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>First-person voice maintains a cold-lyric compression—“winter had stitched silence into every footstep”—that modulates into self-mocking puns under stress. Perceptual signature is consistent and idiosyncratic; no head-hopping or register drift. The phone’s static translations feel like weather apologizing, keeping external voice distinct from interior riffing.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>High information density: “roots dangled from brick ribs” does world, body, and metaphor in five words. Rhythm breathes with paragraph white space; no loops, synonyms, or mixed metaphors. The final “phone clicked as if satisfied to hang up the storm” lands clean, propelling closure without figurative clutter.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: grief-herbalist-cryptid-call-in radio show; the pun-as-portal feels inevitable yet un-telegraphed. Risk in lyric ellipsis pays off—no exposition dump on “harmony untamed,” yet the reader grasps the rule by ritual demonstration. Could edge higher if Marko’s off-page fate echoed more concretely.</comment>
