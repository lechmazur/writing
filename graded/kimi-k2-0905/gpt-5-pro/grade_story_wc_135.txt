<comment>The archivist’s reactively visionary trait is shown through tactile micro-choices—fitting the valve, pacing the dais steps—so interiority stays embodied rather than diagnostic. The “staggered intervals” method externalizes his hierarchy of values: listening over proclaiming, pausing over prescribing. A credible renunciation occurs when he refuses to blow the trumpet himself, letting the boy lift it; this costs him the heroic role and seals his identity as listener. Secondary pressure is thin—only the boy and father appear—so the crucible never widens, but the single-point focus is coherent.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the mended valve releases not a note but “a permission,” reweighting silence from treachery to communal breath; cost is the city’s continuing vulnerability to storms. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of “salt and rumor” fragments accretes until the final cadence shift. Orientation is anchored by word 40 (“ivory harbor after rain”); no penalty. One scaffold loop—“we step, we pause, we step”—is pattern-taught and pays off, so exempt from artifact cap.</comment>

<comment>The trumpet valve functions as micro-setting: its threaded stem and salt-speckled mouth constrain the final gesture—no blast, only breath. Wet marble quies “like dry bones waking” mirrors the city’s re-animation without overt symbolism. Weather (rain, spray) actively guides choice: the boy skids on slick dais steps, delaying the trumpet lift and tightening the pause that becomes permission. Sensory hierarchy favors sound-touch over sight, matching the archivist’s ear-oriented vocation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: can silence be transmuted from punishment to communal breath? Pressure tightens when the valve is fitted: the option of a triumphant note is foreclosed, replacing it with the risk of continued silence. Cost is felt: the city remains exposed to future storms, tactics unchanged except for the new practice of listening. Agency resides in renunciation—refusing to sound the note—so escalation is internal but legible under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the valve’s transformation: absence as instrument, not void. No moralizing final paragraph; the last image—“light takes”—is open, luminous, earned. Subtext is carried through gesture: the boy’s lifted trumpet replaces proclamation with invitation. The ledger title is the only near-echo of thematic label, but it is framed as the archivist’s private act, not authorial nudge, so tolerated.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>First-person voice is ocean-archivist specific: brine-laced ledgers, “ropes sneeze,” perceptual signature of salt and rumor. Rhythm clusters and pauses enact the staggered-interval method on the sentence level. No dialogue, so voice convergence risk is zero. Compression like “navigated absences” is taught early and repaid at closure, satisfying lyric-pattern contract.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>High information density: single sentences layer sensory, historical, and emotional data—“valve smells of metal, kelp, and time.” One mixed metaphor—“echoes answer in ten thousand knuckles”—is fleeting and functional, not muddled. No filter-verb stacks or paraphrase loops; scaffolding is minimal. Opening and closing lines are image-anchored and propulsive.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Premise flips exile trope: return is not triumphal but auditory repair. Trumpet valve as silence-enabler is non-obvious and inevitable in hindsight. Risk taken in lyric accumulative structure pays off through taught pattern. Specificity of “ivory harbor” and “brine-laced ledgers” prevents anywhere/anytime drift.</comment>
