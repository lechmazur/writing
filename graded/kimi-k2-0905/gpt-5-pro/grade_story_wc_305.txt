<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The caretaker’s interior contradiction—using the same hairpin that memorializes arson to coax new growth—grounds every beat; the final micro-choice of pinning the tender cane without piercing it embodies forgiveness-as-praxis with visible cost. Emotional degradation under stress is absent (no trembling hands, shortened breath), keeping embodiment slightly short of 9-band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: the scalloped basins, hairpin, and vine cycles accrue meaning until the closing image reweights “contentment” from quest to daily practice; orientation is anchored by word 60 (“umbral grotto”), and the final Charged Poise shows felt cost—soil under nails, hairpin now holding living tissue. One tightening only, but it is decisive.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The grotto’s west-opening umbra and fog-to-water mechanics constrain every horticultural decision; the antique hairpin serves as micro-setting/tool that literally shapes the clay rims and finally the cane-tie, charging the closure image. Sensory economy is high—always filtered through vine-tending priorities.</comment>

<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—can contentment be cultivated after unforgivable harm—tightens once: forgiveness must be practiced in “smaller cuts and grafts,” foreclosing the easier option of perpetual blame. Cost is legible on-page: the hairpin’s point is dulled by soil, the mother’s act remains un-rectified, and the narrator’s hands bear perpetual dirt.</comment>
<question>5</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from recurrent scalpel-and-tendril imagery: mercy is not absolution but iterative pruning that risks fresh wounds. The final image—starlit water bowls holding sky—reconfigures the opening “vineyard hush” into a living echo chamber, offering non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question>
<grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>First-person voice carries distinct perceptual signature: meteorological metaphors (“storms pile like wool”), vine-labor diction (“spare because they are brave”), and rhythmic anaphora (“prune to bud, bud to bloom…”) taught early and held to last line. No head-hop; psychic distance clean; lyric compression always legible.</comment>
<question>7</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>High information density—single sentences toggle between tool-use, weather, and philosophy without scaffold. Two minor template cadences (“I…then I…”) in mid-section and one mixed metaphor (“clouds lean like sheep”) keep it from 9-band; neither touches closure.</comment>
<question>8</question>
<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Fog-irrigated alpine vineyard and hairpin-as-pruning-tool feel fresh; cycle-of-rebirth concept is familiar but re-inflected through horticultural precision and insurance-arson backstory. Risk is moderate—lyric accumulative structure rather than twist—but coherence justifies the choice.</comment>
