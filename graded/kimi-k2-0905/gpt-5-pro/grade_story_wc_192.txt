<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Keeper’s motives—“burn bridges carefully,” “teach suffocating to breathe”—drive every beat; the interior contradiction between caretaker and arsonist is alive in the gift of the ring. Micro-choices (handing over ring, counting breaths) embody hierarchy of values. The visitor’s tremor and eventual un-clasped hand show credible, embodied change. Cost is visible: Keeper remains alone in ash, lanterns held for strangers.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the visitor leaves breathing, Keeper stays to “mark the safe embers with stars.” The lens is Accumulative/Textural: each image (ash, ring, salt-dust) accretes until the final reconfiguration. Cost is unmistakable—“the loaded emptiness stayed, but now it carried a pulse I did not have to supply alone.” Transitions are legible; mosaic shards are taught early and resolve under one atmospheric pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>“Ashen charcoal sanctuary” is immediate, tactile, and biased through Keeper’s ruin-school lens; dust is “fine salt,” walls “lean in,” enforcing claustrophobia. The ring-as-throat and starlight-as-lantern constrain tactics: sound must travel downward, breath must be invited. Spatial choreography is clean: visitor steps across a threshold that is no longer there. Final image reweights the setting as moveable—“a room that moves with you.”</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</question><comment>Dominant stake: can the visitor learn to breathe without knives? Pressure tightens once—staying for four counts—felt as drowning. Escalation is textural: each failed breath clouds the ash until the tremor loosens a “beginning.” Keeper’s agency is to withhold rescue and offer ritual; visitor’s is to stay and risk the stay. Cost is the visitor’s scarred neck exposed, Keeper’s perpetual solitude.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges breath-by-breath: care is not softness but measured blaze. Subtext lives in gesture—ring pressed into palm, footprints kept like notes. No moral is stated; instead the final image of “safe embers marked with stars” reweights bridges from destruction to guidance. Ambiguity is meaningful: we do not know if the visitor will keep breathing, only that the method is portable.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>First-person voice is irreducibly specific: “I am the tender shadow keeper, sworn to thresholds…” Syntax mirrors surf-forgotten-sea cadence; diction stays inside Keeper’s mystic-teacher lexicon. No dialogue means free-indirect compression is clean. Rhythm swells and recedes with breath counts; no filter-verb stacks. Perceptual signature—ash as chalkboard, starlight as lantern—remains disciplined and charged.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Lyric density is high yet every sentence advances aura or stakes; no scaffolding or synonym loops. Metaphors are coherent—ash/blackboard, ring/ladle-well—and stay within physical logic. Read-aloud rhythm varies: long tide-sentences collapse into staccato breath counts. Only hairline slip: “loaded emptiness” edges toward oxymoron cliché, but is saved by later pulse qualification.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Premise—ruin-as-school for the asphyxiated—is fresh synthesis of caretaker/arsonist archetype. Risk of doorless sanctuary is fully committed; ash that “understands footsteps” is unforgettable. Specificity makes metaphysical premise concrete: ring as throat, breath as shy animal. Final reconfiguration feels inevitable yet un-guessable. No close echoes; voice owns its own myth.</comment>
