<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The narrator’s interiority is concrete—choices like tilting the triangle to “spill a current” show embodied motive. The renunciation of monument-building for accompaniment is earned, yet the internal contradiction (esoteric realist vs. caretaker) stays announced rather than dramatized in a single beat, keeping it shy of 9.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the collapsed frames return to soil but the memory—and the wind’s literacy—remains charged. Causal chain is light (Accumulative/Textural lens) yet coherent; the moth-wing glass reweights the premise at the end with visible cost. One micro-turn—the monarch’s pause at the broken circle—tightens the cadence without a second reversal, sufficient for this length.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The grotto’s altitude and wind currents materially shape the apparatus and the butterfly’s glide path; “clouds like sleeping herds” is filtered through a builder’s need to read air. Micro-setting—the reed triangle’s shadow pointing south—constrains orientation for the insect highway, charging the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will the last monarch read the signal—tightens once when the insect hovers, then again when it departs; the narrator forfeits permanence to accompany disappearance. Cost is legible: structures dismantled, twine left “like lines in a palm,” a tangible loss of control. Agency is attention rather than rescue, foreclosing monumentality.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the tension between permanence and transience; the refusal to build a lasting monument is the story’s quiet argument. Subtext lives in gesture—knotting, tilting, collapsing—rather than exposition. Final image of wind remembering us reweights the premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice carries a liturgical cadence that mirrors the “grammar of winds”; diction stays within an esoteric-realist lexicon. Rhythmic control heightens at the butterfly’s arrival—short clauses mimic wingbeats. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is consistent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Figurative language is dense yet patterned early (“clouds moved like sleeping herds”) so the payoff at the monarch’s flame-like departure feels earned. One scaffold echo: “blushing stillness” repeats without new charge, a hairline slip. Otherwise high density, no mixed metaphors, strong clause variety.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The conceit—build what the air can read—reverses the usual human-butterfly rescue narrative into an act of receptive accompaniment. Specificity of seed-sack literacy and moth-wing ledger roots the cosmic in the overlooked. Risk in form (lyric accumulation) sharpens stakes without losing clarity.</comment>
