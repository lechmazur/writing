<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The navigator’s contradictory impulse—clinging to a relic while guiding others away from their own ruins—stays live in every beat; the censer-foot choice to counterweight the dish crystallizes identity and costs him bodily (hands, shoulders, sleep). Interiority is sensorily anchored (“press the censer foot into my palm until the skin remembers”). The final earned stasis—head against bronze, patched by dawn—pays the accumulation without softening flaws.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the dish holds steady, Rowan’s feet hit shells, and the network of absence becomes passable—cost is felt in the navigator’s exhausted slump. Causal chain intact: failed hydraulics → censer counterweight → bearing sent → convoy arrives. One minor orientation lag: “the river ran inland” is never spatially anchored, but the lyric pattern teaches disorientation that closure repurposes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Starlit signal station, rusted tramline, drowned orchard, and the bronze relic itself as micro-setting each force tactical invention (rope to tide-wheel, pebble markers). Sensory hierarchy obeys crisis: ozone static, salt-taste, shell-crunch underfoot. Final image—head resting on censer foot—lets the object’s inherited smoke and curve re-weight the moment.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Domestic stake: can the navigator’s patched tech and body still bridge loss for others? Escalation is accumulative/textural—each midnight call thickens static until moon-thin glass allows a bearing; the dish’s refusal to swivel forces the censer gamble that forecloses rest. Cost is visible: shoulders aching, skin bruised by bronze, final collapse. No reversal, but deepening suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Reverse migration as theme emerges through concrete orchestration: walkers retrace erased roads, stars become holes to line up, the sea gives back a road shaped by hunger. No thesis states; instead, the censer foot’s smoke-memory and the whispering-back water reprice migration as return-to-ruin that can still nourish. Final salt-tasting solace is earned, not asserted.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical first-person maintains perceptual signature throughout: patched maps, metal throat, starlit bone. Syntax tightens under crank-load—“I thread…lash…lean”—then loosens into lullaby bursts. No head-hop; Rowan’s voice arrives filtered through delay and static, keeping psychic distance clean. Patterned elision (“night-sips”, “scab of stars”) taught early and paid off in shell-crunch arrival.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies from long breath units to staccato bursts mimicking signal code. Figurative density is high but purposeful: “metal throat that swallowed its own echo” teaches the dish-as-body motif that recurs. No scaffold loops; each sentence advances image or pressure. Minor register lift—“conceptual repricing”, “accumulative/textural”—is evaluator language, not story flaw.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Freshest synthesis: celestial navigation by obsolete telecom junk and ancestral altar trash. Reverse migration literalized as walkers following a frozen dish counter-weighted by ritual bronze. Risk is high—lyric mosaic, no antagonist—but coherence holds. Specificity of “salt-burned voice”, “rain trapped in curtains” prevents generic collapse.</comment>
