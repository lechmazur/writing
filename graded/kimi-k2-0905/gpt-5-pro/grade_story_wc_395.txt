<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Pursuit of deleted Lia files drives every beat; identity under pressure stays concrete—the final renunciation leaves palpable cost in the closing image. Only flaw: brief therapy-speak tag “sensed absence” used twice near climax without fresh embodiment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens cleanly accumulates 1103/17/patch echoes to the final letting-go; the Conceptual Repricing in the last line (“for one night that feels like mercy”) pays off with societal/ethical cost without cliché. Closure unit intact, no orientation debt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Cold archive corridors and pocketed fabric patch locate action and metaphor; no grand world-build, but enough object/body choreography to let choices breathe. Patch overlay on rack-map supplies the micro-setting constraint that final image re-weights.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stake—uncover deletion conspiracy—tightens through numeric breadcrumbs; protagonist actively breaches security and accepts complicity in the final quiet cover-up. Cost visible in last line’s “lie is heavier now” magnetized to consequence.</question>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of managed forgetting vs personal haunting emerges from archival imagery; subtext stays in gestures (drawer-slide, badge tremble). Final public-number flash shows system-wide persistence of memory without sermon, leaving charged ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>First-person archivist voice owns a consistent corporate-analogue register; perceptual signature (“anaerobic layers,” “dry rain”) specific and stable. No dialogue, so no register drift; all metaphor remains narrator-bound.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varied, info-dense; occasional adjective clusters (“banked cinders of public grief”) verge on overwriting yet pay off in pattern. No loops or mixed metaphors; closure cadence tight, breath-controlled.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Social-network deletion as industrial gothic is non-obvious; breadcrumb numbers, anaerobic archive, and quiet refusal synthesis feel inevitable in hindsight. Risk in muted ending pays off, making absence a form of persistence rather than gimmick.</comment>
