<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The proprietor’s interiority is vivid (“puzzles like weather systems,” “solve and unsolved hum in a single wire”) and his motive to protect wonder is dramatized through planting the seed and designing the Seed room; the final quiet vigil with visible cost earns the arc. Minor slip: the reunion belief in Mae is asserted more than tested, so the emotional peak feels 0.2 soft.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each gift layers density until the corpse-flower rumor becomes a practical bulldozer shield; closure is the Charged Poise of the sprout and the widened town breath, cost legible in the ongoing vigil. Transitions (storm → mail → room → brook nights) are taught early and cohere; no orientation debt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Lantern-gold on wet stones, mossed postbox, scent vials in rafters—selective sensory detail is braided through action and constrains tactics (where the seed is planted, how the room is built). Brook and storm-born silence return in the final image, re-weighted from menace to guardianship, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—protect the brook from condos—tightens via seed-gifts → community nights → odor rumor; protagonist agency drives each orthogonal tactic. Escalation is accumulative, not causal-reversal, but the final sprout visibly forecloses developer ease; cost (time, secrecy, Mae’s exile) is felt.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme—“innovation defended by patient play rather than protest”—emerges through seed, scent, and communal lung-room; no moralizing, final image of the town widening says it wordlessly. Spiral and corpse-flower motifs accumulate meaning without late harvesting, reconfiguring value of stench and silence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>First-person voice owns a puzzle-designer’s perceptual signature: orthogonal, wired, scent-oriented; diction stays within that lexicon. Rhythm modulates from storm-hush cadence to lung-breath chorus without syntactic monotony; purposeful elisions (“we made a room-sized lung”) are taught and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</question>
<comment>High density—every sentence layers scent, sound, or symbol; no paraphrase loops or mixed metaphors. Minor scaffold: “orthogonal approaches” is repeated three times; clipped 0.1 for template cadence that does not touch closure.</comment>

<grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: escape-room aesthetics weaponized as eco-defense via corpse-flower stench; activist narrative delivered through play-based mail-art. Risk (lyric ellipsis, accumulative structure) heightens rather than obscures stakes; specifics (river grit, lantern-gold) make the concept inseparable from this place and voice.</comment>
