<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The narrator’s motive—coaxing rather than burning light—threads every beat and crystallizes in the final gifting of fused gears. Interiority is sensorially anchored (“old ache,” “cautious mouths”) and collides with micro-choices: rebuilding the orrery, deciding to teach transit as kindness. Contradictory impulses (sentimental hoarding vs. risk of sharing) stay active in-scene; the smile at “numbers becoming weather” shows embodied emotion without label-speak. Cost is visible: the inherited vow is literally handed off, foreclosing sole guardianship.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as a Charged Poise: the paired gears placed in starlike moss reconfigure inheritance from repetition to transmission, felt cost legible in “wide enough to plant trust.” Lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of floral light, gears, sonar pings layers until cadence shifts at orrery song; “heartbeat tempo” hush satisfies RR. Orientation anchors who/where/when by line 4 (“I tended the nebula garden…”) and stays spatially trackable. Persistent price—ancestral vow now shared—shapes tactics and final image with no soft reset.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The nebula garden’s vapor terraces and moth-whales are not backdrop; their very porosity demands the sonar workaround and enables tempered-light harvest, directly shaping the climax. Micro-setting—the twin gears—function as mobile “stars” whose re-orbited dust petals physically deliver the softened daylight. Sensory hierarchy filters through caretaker bias: what “petals remember” and how “shadows choose to sleep” determine transit paths. Final image of gears cradled in starlike moss charges the closing beat, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—how to transmit light without scorch—is signaled early and tightens when the stranger’s burned gear foreshadows failure. Agency: the narrator’s choice to mesh both gears into a new orbit is a single decisive escalation that rewrites garden protocol; failure risk is palpable. Cost is dramatized: relinquishing exclusive lineage caretaking, audible in gears’ “low arithmetic” song. Under Accumulative lens, pattern intensifies from solo tending to shared constellation, narrowing future options to collaborative transit only.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme—inheritance as transmission rather than repetition—emerges through fused gears and diffused starlight, never sermonized. Subtextual weight lands in silence: stranger’s “expression fractures into rain” conveys generational grief more than dialogue could. Final image of gears wrapped in moss offers non-literal answer: continuity can be soft, biodegradable, not cyclical burn-and-flee. Complexity is honored; both traditions (escape vs. tending) coexist in the same sky, no moral forced.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>First-person voice owns a consistent lexicon of floral astronomy (“star-silt,” “hush-spindle”) that stays within caretaker ken. Rhythm modulates: elongated sentences mirror nebular drift; short pulses (“pings return”) mimic sonar. Perceptual signature—grief as pollen to be saved—colors every observation without drifting into poetic self-parody. Dialogue minimal, but stranger’s lullaby-at-crater line carries idiom distinct from narrator’s botanic diction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Sentence variety and textured specificity (“domes of slow lightning,” “dust petals… drinkable day”) yield high density without purple overload. No mixed metaphors; stacked figuratives serve nebula logic. Occasional alliterative closeness (“soft applause across the quiet sigh”) is pattern-taught early and earns payoff at closure. Filter verbs minimal; strong verbs (“coax,” “braided,” “refract”) propel motion. Zero paraphrase loops or template cadence detected.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fusing Victorian orrery mechanics with bioluminescent deep-space horticulture is a fresh synthesis that feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk—using “approximates infinity” as both tech spec and emotional aperture—pays off in the final diffraction image. Conceptual integrity sustains: every nebula-botanic term obeys internal physics. The piece avoids both eco-parable cliché and solarpunk gadgetry; its emotional stakes hinge on caretaker vulnerability rather than spectacle.</comment>
