<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The chef’s memory-taste gift is embodied in the synaptic-soup moment with Kye; the trade of a private rain-memory for the seed shows a costly hierarchy of values. Interiority stays specific and sensorial, not diagnostic. The renunciation of shouting for “a table and enough bowls” is a credible, scaled endurance that forecloses violent rebellion. Voice stays singular, though the teenager’s speech could carry a smidge more idiom to distinguish them.</question>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the seed’s first leaf lets the chef literally taste rebuilt libraries and un-rung bells—an undeniable social cost paid in one image. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout; each sensory layer (rusted glass, planetary light, soup spoons) tightens the stake of cultural remembrance. Causality is lyric rather than plot-sequential, but the pattern is taught early and repaid at the end. No orientation debt; who-where-when anchors by line 3.</question>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The greenhouse’s broken panes act as a prism that literally steers starlight onto the seedbed—environment constraining the climax. Micro-setting inside the chef’s mouth (tasting thunder, coins, chlorine) is repeatedly leveraged to alter tactics. Spatial choreography is clean: shears pass from chef to Kye, lantern height shifts, soil disturbance tracked. Weather is cosmic yet tactile, never decorative.</question>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—recover authentic taste/memory before the alignment ends—tightens once: the seed must be planted before midnight or remain inert. Agency is the act of watering with wish-laden fountain water; the price is the permanent loss of the grandmother rain-memory. No reversals, but the single deepening is meaningful and felt. Escalation is accumulative: each sensory spoonful reweights what the Quiet Diet has erased.</question>

<comment>Theme emerges only through particulars: soup salt = grief acid, burnt sugar = courage. No character states the thesis; Kye’s tearful “arranging is how I will refuse him” is an in-scene discovery, not a slogan. The final image of bowls laid in a circle answers the thematic question of how to rebel without war. Ambiguity remains—who will come to eat?—but the reconfiguration of meaning is undeniable.</question>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>First-person texture is consistent: the chef’s perceptual signature is gustatory (“hinges cried like old gulls,” “soil smelled like opened books in rain”). Syntax accretes like reduction sauce—long breathy clauses that tighten into short commands (“We would keep pruning”). No head-hopping; Kye’s interior is accessed only through gesture and dialogue indirection. Register stays within a self-taught chef-poet’s lexicon.</question>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Rhythm modulates from languid opening sentences to staccato pruning verbs, mirroring the beat. No synonym loops; “light threaded / braided / chords” repeats deliberately to teach the planetary pattern. Metaphors stay coherent: starlight as broth, silence as seasoning. One paraphrase hiccup: “the world is built on unlikely recipes that work once” slightly abstracts the prior concrete claim, but it does not touch the closure beat.</question>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The memory-tasting chef cooking synaptic soup during an astral alignment to grow a counter-amnesia plant is a fresh synthesis that could not swap names/places and survive. Risk is high—lyric accumulation instead of plot reversals—but coherence is maintained. Specificity (“composted diaries,” “municipal chlorine”) keeps the concept grounded. The final re-pricing of silence as cultivatable seed feels both surprising and inevitable.</question>
