<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and character-specific; the arsonist’s analytical bent feels lived-in and drives every micro-choice. The moral ambiguity remains credible because the narrator’s guilt and rationalization coil together in real time. However, the emotional cost of reunion is slightly under-dramatized—Mira’s first line of dialogue lands as thematic summary rather than embodied relief, softening the final renunciation’s sting.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Causal linkage holds: each art-piece clue is both trail and test, so the archive arrival feels earned. Closure lands as Charged Poise—the jar of drowned matches reweights the premise with undeniable conceptual cost. One slight wobble: the “breathing archive” metaphor is introduced late and could have been seeded earlier to tighten orientation; still, the final image reconfigures stakes cleanly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Environment is never backdrop; the bullet-pocked museum and salt-flat ribcage actively narrow movement options. The tapestry fragment functions as micro-setting—its threads literally unlock the stone doorway, so setting constrains the final choice. Sensory economy is ruthless: one smell of charred notebook paper carries more weight than a paragraph of skyline. This specificity charges the closing image without ornamental excess.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</question><comment>Dominant stake—rescue the promise—remains legible throughout; each clue tightens the noose of pursuit. Escalation is accumulative: every art object subtracts safe territory until only the whale-bone arch remains. Visible price is present (burned library, crossed-out eyes), but the final beat could have let us feel one more tangible loss (a reel dropped in salt water, a cut hand) to push into the 8+ band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges as “memory is flammable yet archivable only if someone tends the burn.” The vandalized portrait re-prices this idea at closure: erasure becomes a shutter, not a loss. No moral sermon intrudes; the jar of soaked matches offers a wordless ethical ledger. The tenderness is volcanic because it survives its own destruction—an insight earned, not asserted.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is a controlled pyre: compressed syntax (“smoke graphs its own arguments”) yet never obscures causality. Perceptual signature is razor-sharp—the narrator notices angles of broken wings before faces. No head-hop, no register drift; even the single line of dialogue carries the same analytical heat. The final image drowns the matches in mid-sentence, a rhythmic stifle that pays off the earlier fire-listening motif.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm mutates with pressure—short clauses flare during arson, then elongate inside the whale-archive. Metaphors stay physically coherent (curtains burn before stone mouths open). One tiny loop: “archive of inhalations and exhalations” could have lost one noun, but the density justifies the breath-pun. Closure line is scaffold-free and propels outward.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The lending-library arsonist who saves memory by burning borrowers is a fresh ethical inversion. Artistic breadcrumb trail as map-making technology feels non-obvious yet inevitable once revealed. Risk is taken—lyric ellipsis, stone doors that breathe—yet causality never breaks. Synthesis is specific to this voice; swap any detail and the whole contraption collapses.</comment>
