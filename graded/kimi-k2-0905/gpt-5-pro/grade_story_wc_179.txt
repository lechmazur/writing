<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Mara’s shift from siege-general to soundless surrender is credibly seeded through embodied micro-choices (pulse under thumb, silent laugh against sternum). The narrator’s pacifist schemer trait stays active—every beat is a calculated tactic—yet the interior contradiction (using war’s own logic to end war) is left stated, not dramatized in gesture. Closure cost is felt—“resentment stepped back, almost relieved”—but the narrator’s own cellular memory is told once and never retested, blunting the symmetry of shared transformation.</comment>

<comment>Accumulative/lyric lens holds: each repetition of silence, dust-braids, and broken teeth layers pressure until the final quiet image reweights the premise. The 120-word orientation anchor is met (“soundless sanctuary…”) and the braided-river dust map at closure pays off the early pattern. One因果 hiccup: the sanctuary’s rule-set (“reappears when needed”) is asserted, never constrained; luckily it complicates rather than resolves, so the waiver applies. Closure is a Charged Poise—options narrowed, cost legible in Mara’s soundless laugh—earning the high band.</comment>

<comment>Micro-setting triumph: the music box’s broken pin, the sanctuary’s hush, and Mara’s sternum function as tactile geographies that constrain every tactic. Sensory economy is ruthless—no visual sweep of dunes, only the glitter of a thorn learning mercy—yet the dust motions rewrite campaign maps underfoot. Final image recharges the broken pin pressed to skin, making the object the charged lens through which surrender is re-seen. One whisker from 9+ only because the outside world’s “reality shifts” remain a label, never a felt environmental pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—release resentment without humiliation—tightens through escalating bodily stakes: pulse, shoulder angle, sternum. A single meaningful deepening occurs when the box translates memories into muscles, foreclosing the option to keep hatred sharp. Cost is visible: Mara cedes ramparts she admits were “never safe,” generals feel a quiet that is not defeat. The causal agency is the narrator’s persuasion, not external trick, satisfying lens purity.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: grace is not forgiveness but a re-forged blade that dulls by saving. Subtext lives in gesture—helmet under arm, sabre numbed—never in commentary. The final image of war “turned home” reweights every prior military noun (soldier, banner, siege) into domestic verbs, achieving Conceptual Repricing. No moralizing, only the body’s quiet revolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>First-person voice carries a perceptual signature: metaphors that only a tactician would coin—“citadel ceding ramparts,” “blade dulls saving a life.” Syntax tightens under pressure—fragments when dust braids into maps—then relaxes into longer cadence at the silent laugh. No head-hopping; Mara’s interior is accessed only through narrator’s tactile readings, maintaining distance. One filter-verb cluster (“I felt… I knew…”) is voice-motivated, not artifact.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm alternates between staccato tactical beats and elongating lyric lifts, mirroring the shift from war pulse to silence. Information density high: single sentences hinge grief to siege geography. No mixed metaphors; every vehicle (thorn, blade, dust river) stays within the military-love lexicon. Only minor paraphrase loop (“silent sanctuary… silence was its true melody”) costs the final 0.5 toward 9.0.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise—pacifist weaponizes broken music box to reeducate cells—feels inevitable yet unseen. Risk of lyric abstraction is embraced and paid off: the non-singing box becomes the story’s only honest anthem. Specific synthesis of cellular memory, sand-rivers, and silent architecture could not survive name-swaps. Final reconfiguration turns the war machine homeward without victory speech—bold, quiet, unforgettable.</comment>
