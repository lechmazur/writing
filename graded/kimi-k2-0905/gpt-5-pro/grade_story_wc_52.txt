<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Widow’s grief is rendered through tactile micro-choices (carving, sugar, mane) that externalize contradictory impulses—clinging vs. letting go. Interiority stays concrete (“useful is not cold…woven from what remains”) and avoids label-speak. Final pocketing of the cage is earned renunciation with visible cost: the ache in her healed wrist and the coiled mane she can now carry without choking.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each shaving, steam click, and sugar grain adds density until the final “steel-warmed” peace reweights loss. Closure is Charged Poise—the cage/boat floats in tea, crystallizing before/after with undeniable conceptual cost. No causality breaks; orientation anchored inside 120 words (“Rain steps softly…loft”).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Skylight, kettle, ash blank, and sugar crystals function as micro-setting that constrains every move; rain’s arithmetic tracks time and sharpens attention. The loft’s rust-hued peace is inseparable from the widow’s craft—sawdust scent, two-ring stove, drying boots—creating lived-in specificity. Final image of cage-as-boat recharges every prior object.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—how to house grief without trapping it—tightens as each carving stroke narrows possibility. Escalation is textural: sugar crystal dissolving, mane loop coiling, door clicking ajar; each increment raises the cost of getting the container wrong. Visible price: she forfeits the fantasy of total reunion and accepts a pocket-sized storm.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete returns: sugar=time, cage=breath, mane=untamed memory. No moralizing; final image reframes “here and gone” as simultaneous states held in one palm-sized boat. Subtext operates in silence—the un-carved silence inside the ribs—and in the cracked sugar that sweetens loss only as it disappears.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyric third-person hovers at intimate distance, filtering every perception through widow-bias: rain is “soft seconds,” sawdust is “unfinished thunder.” Rhythm modulates—long breaths for reflection, clipped fragments for carving beats—mirroring emotional pressure. No head-hopping; diction stays within craft-and-cage lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High information density: “ash wood carving blank…pale as a tame shoulder” does three jobs—color, texture, symbolism—in nine words. Metaphors are coherent (rain=timekeeper, sugar=clock) and peak-beats stay clean. Minor scaffold: “here and gone” repeated four times; cost is −0.1, well below cap.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: lion-tamer widow + wood-carving containment ritual transforms familiar grief trope. Risk—lyric accumulative structure—pays off when final cage-as-boat re-animates every prior image. Specificity of candy-shard tea stirring and mane-in-cup keeps it from feeling conceptual stunt.</comment>
