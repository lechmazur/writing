<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Jessa’s stubborn custodian ethos is vividly embodied—every tactile micro-choice (key twist, wire bridge, notebook scratch) is tethered to her vow. The interior contradiction between quiet perseverance and explosive sabotage stays alive in-scene; no tidy self-diagnosis. Cost is legible: she forfeits anonymity and leaves the key to weather, a renunciation that stings. Missing 0.3 because the contact remains a passive parcel; his interiority could have sharpened the relational crucible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal lens holds throughout: every beat is a therefore linkage—puddle map leads to hatch, key disables lights, relay spill reappears the erased. Closure is a CR: the lagoon’s gold reweights history itself, undeniable social cost on-page. Persistent constraint—the exposed relay—shapes the final escape. No teleporting props or amnesia; orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 10 and again after hatch exit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Auric lagoon and ceramic ribcage relay function as micro-setting that concretely constrain tactics: the glow reveals faces, the hatch grounding plate becomes sabotage point. Sensory hierarchy obeys Jessa’s priorities—she notes cable stripes, sweat-slick rungs, not tourist vistas. Idiom stays dystopic-tonal (“government daylight”) without anachronism. Spatial choreography is clean across ladder, tunnel, culvert. One hairline slip: “starlight dripped through grates” repeats the earlier “starlight dripped” image; still, the final image recharges it, so no cap triggered.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—prevent erasure of the disappeared—tightens when floodlights threaten to finish the cut. The single decisive turn: Jessa kicks the ground plate, trading secrecy for mass witness, price paid on-page. Escalation is causal, not coincidence; each flare narrows her options. Cost is visible: the key abandoned, the network now audible to State ears—persistent tactical consequence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from concrete particulars: memory as cattail fluff, history as molting snake-skin. The final image—lagoon mirroring the erased—offers a non-literal answer: witness is the antidote to indifference. No sermonizing; the State’s “articles and clauses” satirize themselves. Subtext in gesture: the key’s teeth “chimed when she walked”—a quiet rebellion before the loud one.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Lyrical dystopic cadence is consistent, compresses under pressure (“ lagoon flared, and for a breath…”). Perceptual signature is Jessa-specific: ads peel like “molting snakes,” slogans “sweated and whispered.” No head-hopping; distance stable. Non-standard grammar (“the night peeled off its own gold”) is pattern-taught early and paid off. Dialogue minimal but subtextual—contact’s cough-laugh signature suffices.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>High information density: single sentences do triple duty (“She fitted the phone booth key, felt the tumblers complain, and listened as the hatch sighed open like a confession”). No paraphrase loops; each image advances. Mixed-metaphor risk managed—vehicles stay physical (keys, moths, cattails). One tiny scaffold: “documenting each contact in a pocket notebook stitched from ration forms” could trim to “in a ration-paper notebook,” but artifact does not touch closure. Ear-rhythm varied; paragraph cuts purposeful.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: puddle-map as orienteering, bureaucratic erasure literalized by blank plates, relay as ribcage—each grows from premise rather than ornament. The key-as-ghost-unlocker recasts obsolete tech into insurgent tool. Risk in lyric accumulation pays off: auric lagoon mirror is unforeseeable yet inevitable. Conceptual integrity intact—no retreat to generic rebellion tropes.</comment>
