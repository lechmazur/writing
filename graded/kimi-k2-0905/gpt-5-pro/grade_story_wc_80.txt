<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The surveyor’s interiority is vivid—“I am less man than listening notation”—but his stoic/sensitive duality is asserted more than dramatized; no contradictory impulse under visible pressure. Micro-choices (pry stone, seal note) are procedural, not value-laden, so the final renunciation feels pre-ordained rather than earned. The archeologist-of-dreams motive stays lyrically stated; it never collides with an alternative want, so the arc is static. Still, the perceptual signature is distinct and consistent, keeping the portrait above mediocrity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: each embedded note thickens the pavilion’s palimpsest, tightening the stake of memory vs erosion. Orientation is swift—skiff, rising bridge, tidal clock—so the -0.3 Orientation Test is waived. Closure is a Charged Poise: the city’s “foundations acknowledge” the narrator, a conceptual repricing that makes his lifelong labor legible as cost. The lack of external opposition keeps escalation muted, but the pattern of sealing memories in mortar creates a visible before/after in the archive itself.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The submerged pavilion is rendered through haptic, tidal, mineral details—“algae flutter like patient pennants”—that constrain access and timing. Micro-setting objects (brass inkwell, barnacled plaque) physically shape the note-placing tactic; their weight and corrosion dictate hand moves. Spatial choreography is flawless across scaffold, seam, and tide-line. Environment directly mirrors internal state—water as archival reader—charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—rescue memory from erasure—is signaled early and deepens as each note is mortared; the tide’s return supplies escalating inevitability. No live antagonist, but the archival water acts as coherent pressure, narrowing the hour when mortar is wet. Visible cost is the masons’ departure and the narrator’s burnt fingertips—small but felt. The tightening is single-cycle; once the last stone is sealed, options do not further narrow, keeping escalation just shy of top band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of interlaced absence emerges organically through the masonry metaphor—voids stitched with paper that future hands might find. No explicit thesis; meaning accrues via tactile acts and sensory echoes. Final image of unseen coals under river glass reweights earlier notes as latent heat, not loss. Complexity is honored: the city forgets and remembers simultaneously, resisting moral clarity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>First-person voice sustains a maritime, archival diction—“river’s mind is archival, precise, almost kind”—without slipping into poet-speak. Rhythm modulates: longer litany sentences for memory, staccato for physical prying. Perceptual signature is consistent—notations of tide, lime, silt—anchoring subjectivity. No dialogue, so no convergence risk; interior monologue stays concrete.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Figurative density is high yet patterned—“interlaced absence,” “columns like interrupted thoughts”—taught early and paid off in closure, so no overwrite cap applies. Zero paraphrase loops; each line advances image or action. Strong verbs (“wrest,” “seal,” “trace”) replace modifiers. Sensory layering (smell of tarnished ink, mineral dark) propels rather than stalls. A single mixed metaphor—“water holds its tongue as if schooling itself to remember”—is minor against consistent control.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Premise—mortared love-letters to a drowned pavilion—is fresh; combines coastal erosion, urban archaeology, and lyric memory-work in one frame. Transformation test: swap surveyor/inkwell/pavilion and the arc collapses, proving specificity. Risky second-person address to future reader is integrated as motive, not gimmick. Final reconfiguration feels inevitable yet non-obvious, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>
