<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The narrator-teacher’s interiority is concrete—her grandmother’s crack-winter zither memory guides present tactics—and micro-choices (rotating the nicked rosette) visibly cost her authority to catalyze the mechanic and nurse. Yet the students remain typed (headphones boy, scarred mechanic) and their private turning feels narrated rather than embodied; the choral breakthrough is attributed rather than individually tasted, so the ensemble change lands as group summary, not personal cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the chord that "braided without knotting" is a Resonant Reconfiguration—harmony achieved yet the street still curses, so the victory is fragile, felt, and conceptually priced. Causality threads from rosette → subtractive method → confessed fears → shared breath; no off-stage shortcuts. However, the Orientation Test nicks −0.3: “velvet library” and autumn arrive late; by 120 words we’re already inside metaphor before spatial anchor, and the delay doesn’t pay off at closure.</comment>

<comment>The velvet library’s dust, cold-to-warm shift, and zither-rosy light-pattern on the wall give tactile, changing environment; the micro-setting of the 12-petal rosette literally paces breathing and thus song. Seasonal rain and dusk timing open the window so the song can physically leave the room—setting directly enables the final outreach beat. While vivid, the exterior street only briefly flickers; a sharper spatial sketch of the hostile neighborhood earlier would have constrained stakes more tightly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—can enemy neighbors sing together?—is signaled early and tightens when the mechanic’s triggered voice leaps. One meaningful deepening: the rosette’s nick pivots fear into shared breath, narrowing options to mutual song or retreat. Cost is visible (they stay, sing, and the street still curses) yet the price remains collective; an individual forfeiture (silence, pride, or a physical token) would have sharpened the edge for an 8.8+ entry.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme—harmony as subtraction, not addition—emerges through method and image rather than statement; the empty rosette center and final lattice projection reweight the premise without moralizing. Subtext lives in gesture: the nurse’s unfolding hands, the nick rotated toward fear. The stillness motif and braided-voice metaphor recur with shifting charge, culminating in the song drifting into rain—an earned, quiet answer that resists tidy uplift.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>First-person voice is lyrically consistent, with rhythmic, clause-layered cadence that mirrors choral breathing; perceptual signature is character-specific (choir teacher who thinks in rests and moon-phases). Compression like “traveled stillness” is taught early and paid off. Occasional elision—“expectantly resigned” twice—edges toward template cadence but stays within patterned, legible music. Dialogue is sparse yet idiomatic; mechanic’s “wore the same coat” line carries subtext without overt exposition.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and imagistic with high information-to-word ratio; metaphor chains (dust carrying “traveled stillness,” song as lantern) cohere under musical through-line. Filter verbs are rare; strong verbs like “folded themselves smaller” propel. A few scaffold phrases—“I told them,” “I asked them”—slightly stall momentum mid-scene; tightening two tags would sharpen. No mixed metaphors or looped paraphrase; final lattice image is clean, vivid, and causally tied.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>The vanishing-arts premise and subtractive-singing method give fresh angle on the familiar “music heals division” trope; specificity of zither rosette as breath-metronome prevents generic swap. Choir-practice-as-conflict-resolution risks sentimentality but is grounded in tactile detail and acknowledged partial victory (some neighbors still curse). The grandmother’s village bell anecdote adds cultural freshness, though late. Risk is moderate; bolder structural or POV play could have heightened originality further.</comment>
