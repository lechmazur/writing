<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Rowan’s quiet, obsessive caretaking is credibly particularized through soil-blackened palms and pocketed curios; his interior contradiction—tending the dead while eavesdropping on their unfinished hungers—drives every micro-choice. The moment he aligns the sovereign case like a sextant, then later presses the chess clock to “run to nothing,” crystallizes his refusal to let stories ossify into monuments; the cost is the perpetual night-shift he volunteers for, a solitude felt on the page. No secondary character exerts live pressure, so the relationship crucible is off-table, but his stance reconfiguration is earned. Voice never slips into diagnostic self-talk; instead, metaphor and gesture carry emotion, satisfying the 9+ quick test for interior contradiction under pressure.

<comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the visible river of seconds emptying the chess clock reweights the tutor’s legend from shame to mercy, with conceptual cost paid in Rowan’s acceptance of unending nocturnal labor. Causal lattice is intact—sovereign case → tapestry → echo map → clock run-down—each because/therefore linkage tightens options until the final image. Orientation is anchored by word 40 (“cobalt silo under stars”), well inside the 120-word window. No lens ambiguity; the Accumulative/Textural drive holds throughout, ending in Charged Poise where silence itself becomes the changed board.

<comment>The cobalt silo functions as micro-setting that constrains choice: its spiral ladder, hatch, and tapestry wall force Rowan’s body into slow, ritualized motion that paces the emotional reveal. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven—gardener notices moss like “errant thoughts,” metallic timbre of the coin, thimble’s shadow—never tourist-catalog. Weather is absent, but velveteen gloom acts as atmospheric pressure that softens certainty, a felt environmental constant. The final image of dew “made of old silk” recharges earlier textile motifs, satisfying the 9+ gate by charging the closure image through setting residue.

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—discover intention or let grief harden—signals early via “pocket full of unanswered questions.” One meaningful tightening occurs when the tapestry’s tension under the coin forces Rowan to decode the tutor’s aborted resignation; options narrow from general listening to a single half-square king-drop. Cost is legible: Rowan’s nights become permanently mortgaged to this quiet cartography. Pressure escalates under Accumulative lens via density of echo-maps rather than causal reversals; the cadence shift from murmured lullaby to visible clock-run-down reweights the stake with felt price.

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: intentions are soft, editable textiles, not marble truths—revealed when Rowan literally re-weaves the tutor’s shame into mercy. The tapestry’s frayed border becomes the non-literal answer: pattern is repairable only if someone keeps unpicking knots nightly. No final-paragraph moralizing; the last image of “white petals” of breath among stones lets theme resonate through concrete particulars. Subtext operates in silence—the unheard resignation is completed by gardener’s fingertip kiss to thimble-shadow, an act of consent to perpetual partial mending.

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person intimate maintains stable psychic distance; perceptual signature is gardener-specific—every noun is soil-tinted or thread-tinged, never academic. Syntax grows paratactic during decoding—“a woman’s lullaby braided through a thunderhead of chess moves”—mirroring the tangle Rowan untangles. No dialogue, so evaluation concentrates on narrative voice: diction stays within rural, tactile lexicon; no corporate register drift. Rhythm accelerates during clock-run-down paragraph, then exhales into longer sentence across dew-soaked stones, a deliberate cadence modulation under pressure that satisfies 9+ control test.

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Zero loops, scaffold, or synonym churn; each sentence advances knowledge or texture. Figurative language is sparse, pattern-taught early (“velveteen gloom,” “choirboy precision”) and paid off in final silk-dew image, avoiding purple clot. Information density is high: one sentence often performs mood, tactile detail, and causal cue simultaneously. No mixed metaphors; harbor-waiting-for-maps sustains nautical texture without violating tapestry logic. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with scene heat, propelling to closure without artifact drag.

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Premise—cemetery gardener eavesdrops on unfinished stories via textile echoes—is non-obvious synthesis of caretaking and cartography. Transformation test fails if Rowan is renamed or silo relocated; specificity of soil-blackened sextant-case ritual anchors uniqueness. Risk of lyric excess is embraced but controlled by concrete tool-use, avoiding gimmickry. Close echo of “velveteen” risks twee, yet earns place through consistent gloom-to-silk motif evolution. Fresh inflection: chess resignation completed post-mortem by gardener’s clock ritual, a reversal that feels inevitable in hindsight.
