<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The narrator’s “contact tracer for hearts” identity is vividly embodied through the hearing-aid ritual and the photograph hand-off; contradictory impulses (curiosity vs. protective duty) stay active in-scene. Eli’s shift from frozen shame to surprised laughter is micro-chosen on the bench, not declared. The only bar to 9 is that Eli’s interior is still largely inferred—the narrator does the emotional labor; we don’t feel Eli’s hierarchy of values in his own words.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the glass panel shatters behind them, crystallizing the moment when Eli re-enters the living city under shared guardianship; the cost is the ever-present threat the suit-man represents and the narrator’s perpetual vigilance. Causal chain is tight: hearing-aid cue → locate Eli → photograph trigger → crowd shield → predator retreats. Orientation is complete by line 5; no lens ambiguity. One shard, single POV, one deepening—meets scope.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The atrium’s mist, fountain pump, and glass skin are not backdrop; they breathe, stall, and explode in sync with the stake. The soaked shoes, ticking panel, and rain inside the hearing aid constrain movement and signal danger. Micro-setting (the bench, the rail) stages the decisive transfer of the photograph. Environment directly shapes tactics and final image—clears 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—keep Eli alive and listening—tightens when the suit-man closes in; the shattering panel is the irreversible escalation that forecloses the option to stay passive. Agency sits with the narrator: she mobilizes bystanders, weaponizes the crowd. Cost is legible: the city’s violence can still drop glass on you, but now Eli walks anyway. One meaningful turn suffices; no reversals needed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme—how the living discharge the dead’s unfinished business—emerges through the hearing-aid rain and the photograph that returns Eli’s own face to him. No moralizing; the final image of the “borrowed heart keeping its own steady counsel” reweights the premise without exposition. Subtext of debt vs. gift is handled through gesture (pills clenched, photo slid). Complexity acknowledged: the dead are “mostly tender,” not vengeful.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>First-person voice carries a forensic lyricism—“contact tracer for hearts,” “the city folds into a reeling hush”—that stays within the narrator’s plausible lexicon. Rhythm modulates: long breathless sentences under fog, staccato commands during extraction. No head-hop; perceptual signature (sound-first, pulse-driven) is consistent. Dialogue is minimal but distinct: Eli’s half-sentences contrast with narrator’s composed assurances.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every clause adds sensory, emotional, or causal information. Metaphors (“floor was a sleeping animal”) are fresh, not stacked. One paraphrase loop (“I tell him… I tell him…”) is minor. No filter-verb stacks or register drift. Read-aloud rhythm accelerates into the crash, then exhales—mirrors stakes. Artifact-free in final third; eligible for 9+ band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise—“contact tracer” who maps transplanted heart trauma via antique hearing aid—is singular and fully committed to. The old device hearing rain in a donor heart grafts urban gothic onto medical realism without exposition drift. Risky glass-shatter coincidence is earned because the atrium’s failing skin is seeded early. Transformation test fails if you swap parts; the concept is irreplaceable. Fresh inflection charges closure.</comment>
