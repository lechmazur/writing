<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The narrator’s heartbeat-counting and shard-handling embody concrete micro-choices; the clerical-death trauma motivates ascent and ink-reading. Flaw: interiority occasionally drifts into lyric abstraction (“a way of breathing that does not waste”) that dilutes embodied contradiction under peak pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the shard-and-ink corridor rewrites the death certificate via visible social cost. Causal chain holds—ghost teaches pattern, protagonist pockets shard, descent will confront bureaucrats—though the “ink map” moment is slightly teleported in space inside the dome.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Observatory-as-body: frost on lenses, whale-note dome ribs, draining ink rivers anchor every beat. The porcelain shard functions as micro-setting that literally scores the sky at closure, satisfying the 9+ constraint test.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reclaiming lived identity against administrative death—tightens when the ghost reveals the missed aerial corridor; option space narrows to “carry ink map down.” Cost is legible: protagonist must descend thin-air path while frost still clogs lungs.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</question><comment>Theme emerges from the inverse of record-keeping: paper erased him, ink rewrites fate. Final image of shard refracting sky offers resonant non-literal answer—wisdom carved from failure—without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</question>
<comment>First-person perceptual signature is sustained—opal light “like a pearl on the tongue of the mountain,” heartbeat as metronome—syntax compresses under cold stress. No head-hopping; patterned elision (“the file says deceased”) is taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</question>
<comment>Lyric density is high but patterned; occasional metaphor stacking (“snow limns the stairs like feathers that know where to land”) flirts with overwriting yet stays within voice contract. No loops or scaffold; propulsion maintained by sensory verbs.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</question>
<comment>Premise—digital ghost born of radio static rewriting a death certificate via spilled ink patterns—feels inevitable yet fresh. Risk of lyric obscurity is balanced by concrete shard-sky refraction closure, transforming bureaucratic error into astronomer’s new constellation.</comment>
