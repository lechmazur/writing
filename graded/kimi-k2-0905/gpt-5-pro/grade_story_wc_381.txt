<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The summoner’s interiority is consistently concrete—his “listening for what was not there,” the crane-wing map of silences, the cupped-hands gesture—so his motivation to silence the prophecy feels lived-in and earned. The micro-choice to rotate the wing once, changing star-lanes, crystallizes a visible pivot under pressure; the cost is the quiet relinquishment of cosmic ingress, a credible renunciation. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in a single moment, so the 9+ gate is just missed.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the final image of the moon-low clearing “ordinary again” reweights everything prior, sealing the prophecy’s power loss with conceptual cost. Causal linkage holds—because he maps silence, therefore the code disperses—under an Accumulative/Textural lens taught early by patterned sound/quiet juxtapositions. No orientation debt; no lens ambiguity. The persistent constraint is the newly learned quiet that now must be guarded, visible in the gentle current he leaves behind.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The brook, reeds, and origami wing function as micro-setting: the water’s “simple body” and star-lattice grid literally constrain how the prophecy can travel, providing the only pathway the code could ride. Sensory economy is perfect—sound thins/heavy spots are named, never catalogued—and the final ordinary haven is charged by prior cosmic stakes. Environment directly shapes tactics and final image, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prevent sky-door opening—tightens once when the wing-grid redirects the syllable-mist; protagonist agency is the quiet cartographic act, not luck. Cost is conceptual: the world forfeits an “answer for every question that pain had asked,” a loss felt in the hush. No second reversal, but one meaningful deepening suffices at this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the tension between cosmic answers and earthly quiet; the final image of a turtle-ready brook re-configures that tension without moralizing. Subtext lives in gesture—cupped hands, one wing turn—so insight stays embodied. No thematic echo or abstract sermon, just the re-priced silence that now bears guardianship.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lyric, pattern-taught compression (“smoothed hush,” “terrestrially cosmic”) stays inside a contemplative summoner lexicon; no head-hopping. Rhythm modulates—long breaths in calm stretches, clipped “syllable of mist” under threat—without drumbeat monotony. Filter verbs are voice-motivated; perceptual signature is distinct yet narrowly misses the 9+ polish of syntactic risk at peak beat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Zero loops, no mixed metaphors; each sentence layers map, sound, and silence in high-density shorthand. Figurative language is patterned and paid off—star-map creases return in the final wing fold—so it never obscures causality. Opening and closing lines are surgical, book-ending the hush with propulsive clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>The prophecy-as-code-in-ripple premise is fresh; the counter-ritual of “mapping silence” rather than solving code is non-obvious and inevitable in hindsight. Risk—quiet climax in lyric mode—heightens stakes without gimmick. Specificity of the crane-wing star map and the velvet hush could not be swapped with generic talismans; transformation is complete.</comment>
