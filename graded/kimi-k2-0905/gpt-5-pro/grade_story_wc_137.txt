<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid (“sympathetic skeptic who doubts the stagecraft but still holds the actor’s hand”) and embodied emotion arrives in surf-metaphors for laughter and whale-breath percussion. The narrator’s contradictory impulse—give up the solitary-logic memory at the end—lands with cost, yet the renunciation is slightly under-causal: we are told the tile “asked” for the memory rather than shown a micro-choice that hands it over. Micro-choices (chalking numbers, placing winter memory in left square) do reveal hierarchy of values, but the final surrender feels more orchestrated by the tower than actively seized. Still, flaws stay minor; the arc of generous self-revision feels earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the tower’s chamber reweights every prior path, the narrator’s private guilt is traded for public bridge, cost is unmistakable (“ash light” in cracked tile). Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density climbs through braided star-strands, chalk numerals, whale-bells, and culminates in eyelid-seam opening. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) taught by line 2, no ambiguity at end. No causality breaks; even lyric images feed the final stake. Persistent constraint—the tile stays as lent bridge—shapes the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Tower, tile, and whale migration function as micro-setting triad: parapet wind dictates chalk-smear timing, cracked star-table offers the only workable surface, whale tempo paces breath and memory placement. Salt scent and lantern-circles are filtered through stargazer POV, never tourist-catalog. Spatial choreography flawless: climb, circle, table, squares, doorway, all track cleanly. Final image of tile in doorway “anyone could borrow” fuses setting with moral cost, satisfying 9+ gate. Weather and environment (whale song as metronome) directly alter pacing of ritual.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can memories be housed without suffocating—tightens when open squares demand the very memories Lio and narrator most avoid. Escalation is textural: each chalked numeral thickens the unheard symphony until tower seams physically open, a visible cost. Agency sits with narrator’s decision to surrender his culpable night; that sacrifice reconfigures corridor geometry. Could use one more on-page obstacle before surrender to push into 8.8 band, but pressure is coherent and felt.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete particulars: chalk, cracked glaze, whale breath—not abstract thesis. Final image offers non-literal answer: bridge belongs between shores, tile remains on loan, city meets its reflection—reader left to weigh cost of public memory. No moralizing sentence; wisdom earned through ritual loss. Ambiguity is meaningful: tower keeps “breathing,” work unfinished—invites reflection without confusion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>First-person voice owns a distinctive perceptual signature—“slow breaths and barnacled bells,” “curtain coughs dust”—that fuses nautical and theatrical lexicons. Rhythm modulates: long rolling sentences mimic whale song, then fragment at flare moment. Lyric elision taught early (“wind wrote pale calligraphy”) and paid off at closure when wind is literally caught to sing. Zero head-hop; psychic distance contracts under lantern circle pressure. Dialogue minimal but natural, subtext intact.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud cadence varies; propulsive syntax carries high information density—one sentence often paints setting, advances ritual, and nails emotion. Metaphors stay coherent: winter-ice glaze parallels memory fragility, no vehicle clashes. One minor scaffold spotted (“I told him we were building a room…” repeats prior idea), but momentum unbroken. No artifact near closure; final lines crystallize without obscuring causality. Overall, ear is clean, rhythm serves pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fusion of magic-square numerology, whale-migration timing, and memory architecture feels fresh; not a trope checklist but organic synthesis. Specificity irreplicable: magic square cracks filled with “ash light,” whale bells stitched into horizon—details born of this voice only. Risk of lyric tower-ritual pays off; closure legible. Slight −0.1 because “unheard symphony” concept flirts with abstraction, but grounded by whale percussion and chalk scoring. Still, imaginative leap enlarges stakes without gimmick.</comment>
