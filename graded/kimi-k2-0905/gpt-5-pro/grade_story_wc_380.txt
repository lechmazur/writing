<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Ilya’s interiority is textured—his pocket “rectangle of absence” is a sharp embodied cue—and his micro-choice to exhume crystals and carry them to the whale gives consistent motive force. Contradictory pull between civic forgetting and private ache stays implicit; the final stance (ringing the whale) is earned. No secondary character applies pressure, so relationship crucible is N/A; head-count clarity holds. Voice stays specific to a quiet, salt-breathing observer, avoiding diagnostic labels.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: closure is a Charged Poise—cubes tapped against whale ear-bone release names back into tide, reweighting the harbor’s silence with undeniable conceptual cost. Causality is lyric-linkage rather than because/therefore; pattern taught early (flame leans, gravity pockets) and paid off at whale altar. Orientation anchored inside first 120 words (Ilya, pier night, whale). No meaningful escalation under this lens is required; single deepening at crystals → whale suffices.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Harbor, pier, workshed chamber, whale carcass—each is filtered through Ilya’s lantern-tending gaze; salt cubes function as micro-setting that alters choice (he must wait for gravity slack). Weather is iron-tasting air; spatial choreography stays clean as he moves pier → chamber → whale. Sensory hierarchy privileges salt, cold, metallic sound; no exposition dump. The whale bones charge the final image, satisfying 9+ gate. Selective detail never stalls momentum.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake: recover what forgetting erased; pressure tightens once when cube “sweats” her laugh, narrowing option to return memories to sea. Cost is felt—voice returns then fades, proving deletion is porous. Agency is attention/ritual, not combat; sufficient for lyric-accumulative lens. No external antagonist; coincidence (gravity pocket timing) complicates rather than saves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme—memory as migratory, not erasable—emerges through salt echo and whale bone resonance; no overt thesis stated. Subtext lives in objects: lantern leaning, pressed flowers, crystal bells. Final image (lanterns burning straight) reweights earlier silence without moral. Ambiguity lingers: town may still choose selective amnesia. Insight earned via tactile ritual, not assertion; avoids sentimental “all memories are sacred” platitude.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person lyric close: perceptual signature is lantern-light and salt, syntax compressed to match tidal pulse (“ring them until the sea answers”). No dialogue, so no voice convergence issue. Patterned elision (“he will bring… he thinks”) taught early and paid off. Diction stays within coastal-working lexicon; no filter-verb clutter. Rhythm mirrors tidal inhale/exhale, accelerating at cube tapping then settling into final stillness—clean under closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High information density: single sentences do world-rule work (“harbor riddled with pockets of gravity”). Metaphors lean but stay coherent; one mixed moment—“room impossibly grows wider and warm”—is earned by surreal pocket physics. No scaffold loops; paragraph cuts test clean. Read-aloud rhythm varied; opening line anchors voice. Minor over-figuration in crystal descriptions but does not obscure causality or dull closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: civic forgetting machine + salt-crystal memory archive + whale-bone resonance choir. Not a reused template; whale as archive vault feels inevitable once introduced. Risk in lyric-accumulative structure heightens meaning without gimmickry. Specificity of “ear bones heavy as bells” anchors novelty. Concept commits fully—no retreat to generic grief metaphor; harbor’s new stillness is concrete.</comment>
