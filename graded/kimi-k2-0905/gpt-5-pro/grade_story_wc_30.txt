<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The librarian’s interiority is richly particular—“I stamp the hours not in numbers, but in the shapes of returning feet”—and his micro-choice to smelt the baker’s wavering name into a tide-marked loaf crystallizes his stance under pressure. However, the lack of a palpable cost to him (beyond listening) keeps the arc one notch short of a fully earned renunciation. The contradiction between filing and accepting flux is dramatized, but the final beat grants him serenity more than sacrifice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Charged Poise: the open window and “unhurried breaths” reweight the premise that wonder survives routine once tomorrow is gone. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: cadence and returning-image density tighten until the final tide annotation. Cost is felt conceptually—no tomorrow to chase—but not personally on the librarian, keeping it just below the 9-band.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The tidal atrium’s shifting floor and moonrails constrain every cataloguing act; the creel’s weave literally accepts the alloys, charging the final image. Sensory triangulation—salt, tea, wet velvet—anchors without cataloguing. Spatial logic is clean across shards; the atrium’s “pupil” ceiling opening is a precise, camera-ready reveal.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—proving the tide will still remember—is signaled early and tightens through each smelting beat. The librarian’s agency drives the only meaningful turn: smelting identities into portable tide-loaves that foreclose fixed names. Cost is visible for visitors (identity lost/forged) but only conceptually for the librarian, capping the pressure just below 8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges inductively from the conceit that contradictions are accurate maps; no final moral is stated. The returning motif of tide-marked footprints reconfigured as calendar quietly reprices the premise. Subtext in the creel’s murmur—“every hunger has more than one mouth”—carries the emotional after-effect without sermon. Ambiguity lingers: is flux refuge or erasure?</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>First-person diction is taut, metallic, salt-flecked—“gears tick with their dust, which tastes like chalk but feels like wet velvet.” Rhythmic control mirrors tidal pull: long spondaic swells contract to single-word beats (“I listen. I smelt.”). No head-hop; psychic distance compresses exactly under peak smelts. Patterned elision (no quoted speech marks) is taught early and paid off in the hush of the final breath.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentences multi-task: “The alloy comes out as a small, cooling loaf, stamped with a tide mark no storm can erase” advances plot, object state, and theme in one clause. No synonym loops or scaffold; metaphor stack is disciplined—each image extends the maritime-clockwork conceit. Read-aloud rhythm modulates from whale-breath cadence to gear-tick staccato without drum-beat monotony. Line-level artifacts are absent; clarity stays pristine through the final window opening.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The clockwork librarian who alloys migrating identities into tide-marked bread feels inevitable yet unseen before. Risky lyric accumulation (no conventional plot vertebrae) pays off because closure reweights the premise rather than explaining it. Transformation test fails beautifully: swap any detail and the whole organism collapses. Specificity of “drift tags of hammered tin” and “moonrails gleam” roots the fantastical in tactile memory.</comment>
