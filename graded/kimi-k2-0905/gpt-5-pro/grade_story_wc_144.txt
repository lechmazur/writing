<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mara’s blindness is never used as gimmick; every micro-choice—touching the drone’s thorax, tuning bowls by ear, translating pings into yard-hand choreography—springs from the same constraint and costs her real time and calm. The interior contradiction between her need for control and the limits of auditory data peaks when the anchor lifts: she stands still while the world moves, a renunciation that feels earned. Jaro’s presence is light but sufficient to show status flux: he fetches, watches, reports, becoming her eyes without sermonizing. No diagnostic labels, no tidy emotional arithmetic—just a woman whose flaw becomes the engine of everyone’s salvation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the anchor clears the water, the air lightens, and the depot’s magnetic calm becomes the literal atmosphere of the city re-balancing itself. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens: every refracted glimmer, wing-beat ping, and rolling crate tightens the same stake—will Mara’s alternate senses deliver the hull before the tide claims the moment? The cost is the unspoken admission that her world will always require proxy eyes; the reward is that proxy becomes prophecy. The final line “the world answered in kind” re-prices listening itself as civic infrastructure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The mist-coated depot is not backdrop but instrument: tracks hollow or sing, bowls refract orders, ropes and flood-grate location determine crate retrieval tactics. Water features double as both light-to-sound translators and emotional barometers; their brightening stripe is the moment the harbor’s clock becomes audible. Micro-setting extends to the drone’s carbon lattice and magnetic beak—objects whose material properties decide how damage can be patched and how cargo can be tagged. Environment, tool, and body intertwine to force Mara’s final stance of stillness under rising iron.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—time vs. perception—locks in with the first chimed bowl and tightens each time a ping returns late or a refraction angle skews. The meaningful intensification is the western bay ringing “like an empty bell”: a sonic cue that the lost crate is outside the safe grid, forcing the drone into gull-infested territory. Escalation is textural, not causal-reversal, but the rising density of sensory data (mist thickening, tide narrowing, gulls louder) makes the same constraint feel costlier. Price is paid in wing-damage, in Jaro’s breathless reportage, in Mara’s own calm that must stay magnetic while her insides tighten.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges as the politics of attention: who gets to interpret noise, and whose interpretation moves cargo, ships, cities. No character ever moralizes; instead the depot’s collective hush after the crate rolls becomes the wordless thesis that listening is infrastructure. The bowls’ final brightening reweights every prior glimmer into a quiet credo—perception can be engineered, shared, civic. Resonance lingers in the reader’s own ear, a non-literal answer that feels like after-sound rather than after-word.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays tightly filtered through Mara’s auditory field; every descriptor is something she could weigh by ear or fingertip—“iron prayers,” “magnetic calm,” “slack tide.” Sentence rhythm mimics sonar: long waves of clause, then sharp pings of noun-verb—“Track Three sang hollow.” No head-hop, no filter-verb stacks; even Jaro’s visual reports are rendered as spoken sound. The voice is specific enough that removing Mara would collapse the entire timbre of the piece.</comment>

<comment>Density is high yet breathable: “She touched the drone’s thorax and felt the faint chatter of damaged harmonics” does characterization, plot, and metaphor in one stroke. No paraphrase loops, no mixed metaphors; figurative language is limited to two per beat and always sonic or tactile. Opening line anchors voice and stakes simultaneously; final line releases a conceptual snap that re-casts every prior sound. Proofing clean, pronoun chains unambiguous, spatial tracking flawless.</comment>

<comment>Fresh synthesis: blind rail-shop maestro using water bowls as spectrograph feels inevitable yet unseen before. The hummingbird drone is not cute tech but a fragile extension of fingertip and ear—its patch becomes a literal suturing of perception. Risk is taken with lyric diffusion of causality, yet it pays off when the final image-moment crystallizes. Could not swap Mara, bowls, or depot acoustics without the entire emotional scaffold collapsing.</comment>
