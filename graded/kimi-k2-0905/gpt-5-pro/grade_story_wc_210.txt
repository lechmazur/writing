<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The alchemist’s refusal of melodrama and embrace of discipline lands as a credible renunciation; his interiority stays concrete (“he studies that flat pronouncement like an oath”). Micro-choices—cupping the bottle, chalking then erasing the plan—embody motive without label-speak. The arrival of the two women tests but does not alter his stance, so the cost feels more atmospheric than personal; a sharper sting would push past 9.0.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the unopenable bottle reframes from failed vessel to disciplined lens, making the new civilization conceivable. Causality holds under Accumulative/Textural lens: each lantern-projection tightens the possibility of civic return, ending in a charged poise where silence equals vow. Cost is palpable in the erased chalk and unopening bottle—effort without release. Lens stays legible; no orientation debt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The cove’s wrack, tide-pools, and lantern grids are filtered through the alchemist’s selective eye; every detail either constrains method (bottle as lens) or supplies resource (algae for “tiny economies”). Spatial choreography is crisp: bottle against lantern → gridded light on cliff → shell cairns marking future streets. Weather and shingle stay causally active, never decorative. Bottle-as-micro-setting charges the final image, meeting 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—can effort replace wishcraft?—tightens when the bottle refuses to open, forcing tactical shift from miracle to geometry. One meaningful deepening: chalk plan erased by tide → must be held in working memory, raising cognitive price. Escalation is textural: each lantern projection adds civic detail, narrowing possibility toward disciplined build. Cost legible in mental load and physical shiver; no external antagonist needed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: civilization reborn not by spectacle but by iterative, unheroic labor. Subtext lives in object silence—bottle withholds, lanterns project, shells mark—so meaning accrues through use, not sermon. Final image of “softest applause” of tide over shingle offers non-literal answer: value lies in unheard persistence. No tidy moral, only reweighted premise that effort itself is the new magic.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Voice is distilled, coastal, alchemical: syntax stays lean, nouns precise (“patient oval of fossil light”). Rhythm modulates—long breaths for reflection, clipped fragments for method (“Tone: None”). Perceptual signature sharp: he sees streets in refraction, hears gulls write “cursive no one answers.” No head-hop; compression taught early and paid off. Register never drifts; final line’s metronomic cadence mirrors sea, not writer.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is almost loop-free; only minor echo (“lantern strings…loops in his head”) but pattern serves memory motif so forgiven. High density: one sentence often welds image + method + cost (“amber lens arranges lantern gleam into neighborhoods…marks them with cairns”). Metaphors stay coherent (light as street-planner). No artifact touches closure. A single paraphrase tic keeps it from 9.0 flat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: post-wish ghost-town rebuilt under anti-melodrama rule, lens-bottle as constraint-engine. Risky “Tone: None” edict is not gimmick but disciplined aesthetic that pays off in hush-applause ending. Civilization-from-silence angle feels inevitable yet unexampled. Details—streets named as verbs, algae economies—are story-irreplaceable. Concept commits fully; no retreat into festivity or miracle.</comment>
