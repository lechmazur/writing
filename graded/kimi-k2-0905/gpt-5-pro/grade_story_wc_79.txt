<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The cartographer’s quietly driven nature is embodied through tactile micro-choices—cracking the latch, blowing the whistle, reading glare-hexagons—each action tightening stakes. Interior contradiction surfaces when awe of the watchers vies with grief for the teacher, culminating in the earned recognition that maps must listen, not speak. The final “cautionary map” carried home shows visible cost: the teacher is gone, the city still imperiled, yet orientation is restored. No label-speak; every beat is filtered through shell-grammar perception.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the expedition’s fate is redefined—braided into safer currents—so the protagonist’s crossing buys communal knowledge at personal loss. Causal chain holds: gate rusts → whistle request → turtle consent → watcher answer → return with new cartography. Orientation anchors within 120 words via “gate rusts shut,” “lowest bridge,” “elder turtle.” One transition (city → turtle back) is legible; pattern of “pattern languages” taught early and paid off in final step. Cost is on-page: “fingertips come away thinking of distances no rope can measure.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Setting is not backdrop but navigational instrument: barnacled planks, shell ridges “blazing like a furrowed desert,” tidal genealogies etched on watcher-stone. Each tactile detail constrains footing, breath, whistle tone. The turtle’s living shell functions as micro-setting that reconfigures when the city tilts, directly shaping the protagonist’s balance and path. Final image of “sunwashed dread” reframed as cautionary map shows environment charging closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—will the city remain blind?—is signaled in line 1 and escalates when the protagonist forces the gate. One meaningful tightening: watchers’ glare-hexagons reveal the expedition’s assimilation, foreclosing rescue and shifting goal to guidance. Protagonist’s agency drives every turn; no coincidence resolves. Visible cost: teacher lost, gate irreparably breached, personal dread repurposed as communal map.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges: knowledge is earned through surrender to pattern, not conquest. Subtext operates in silence—gulls, glare, whistle tones—never translated into moral. Final image reweights dread from paralysis to compass, implying cartography’s ethical burden without stating it. Ambiguity lingers: watchers remain inscrutable, turtles still carry the city, safety is provisional—complexity honored.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Voice is crystalline, oceanic, compressed: “waves sew themselves in particular arrhythmias.” Perceptual signature—spiral-shell, reed-grammar—remains consistent; no head-hop. Syntax mirrors tidal surge: long clauses swell, then caesura-breaths break. Under stress diction fractures into “rough harmonic the turtles prefer,” yet coherence holds. Every metaphor is anchored to marine physics; no register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances map, body, or sound. Figurative control precise—mixed metaphors absent. Information density high: “sunlight sheets the back of an elder turtle” fuses light, texture, motion. Rhythm modulates from hinge-sigh to whistle-crack without drumbeat monotony. Opening and final lines bookend with “sunwashed dread,” creating resonant frame.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>Premise—nomadic city on turtle shells—risks whimsy yet is grounded by salt-crusted detail and ecological logic. Reed-whistle linguistics, glare-hexagon script, and cartography-as-listening synthesize into non-obvious epistemology. Transformation test fails if swapped: only this spiral-shell grammar could yield the closing insight. Risk-taking (lyric ellipsis, silent antagonists) heightens stakes without obscuring closure.</comment>
