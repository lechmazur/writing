<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The collective “we” acts as a single character whose trust in Vine is credibly earned through prior rescue (rockfall spiral) and the visible stakes of drought; Ana’s micro-choice with the bell is embodied and specific. Interior contradiction is light—no one questions Vine’s chalked authority even when risk rises—but the shared endurance/renunciation of old grudges is dramatized in the relay swaps. Cost is present (labor, pride, time) yet generalized across the group, so the emotional price feels diffused rather than individually acute.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is cleanly landed: the sky opens, dew falls, and the chalk admonition “Reexamine what you call haunting” conceptually re-prices the premise with social cost—trust is now mutual labor, not mystic dependence. Causal chain holds: chalk instructions → bell choreography → nebula arrival; no teleporting props or retro fixes. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) appear within 120 words; floating arches and orchard planet rules remain consistent. Accumulated pattern (arches, chalk, bell) tightens once through the cadence shift at dusk—sufficient escalation under Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Floating rock arches function as both atmosphere and mechanism: their shadows literally braid the fields and their hollow throats later answer the bell’s note—environment constrains and enables the final image. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered (dust braiding into silver spirals, dew beading scars). Spatial choreography is clean: relay handoffs, climb sequence, bell tilt at height track without drift. The orchard planet rules are learned through action, no expo dump; tool (bell) and micro-setting (archway lip) charge the closure beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—coax rain or lose the orchard—is signaled in paragraph two. One meaningful tightening occurs at dusk when the bell must be tipped from the arch’s fault-line: option space narrows to “climb or stay dry/quiet.” Protagonist agency is collective but visible: households swap shifts, elders climb, Ana executes the final tilt. Cost is legible in fatigue, exposed vulnerability on the arch, and the explicit forfeiture of old grudges; persistent constraint (only one bell) shapes tactics throughout.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the inversion of haunting: what seemed ghostly possession becomes communal possession—labor shared is rest earned. Subtext sits in the chalk’s silence and the orchard’s response (leaves shivering, arches singing) rather than exposition. Final image reweights “haunting” as mutual guardianship, avoiding moralizing. Ambiguity lingers: Vine never appears, so trust remains both miracle and engineered social contract.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>First-person plural voice sustains a distinct, orchard-bound diction—“ridled leaves,” “thirsty caravan,” “wrist of a sick friend”—without syntactic monotony. Perceptual signature is collective yet intimate: group memory filters through specific images (Ana’s steady wrist, pickled pears). Psychic distance stays stable; no individuated head-hopping. Rhythm modulates from dawn whisper to arch-height crescendo, matching pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “sky unbuttoned,” “woolen body of vapor” compress sensation and action. No paraphrase loops or mixed metaphors; figurative language is patterned early (trellis, braid, spiral) and paid off at closure. Sentence variety supports breathless ascent; no filter-verb clusters. Micro-scaffolding appears once (“we began at dawn…”) but advances momentum, stalls nothing. Closing line recharges “haunting” without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses agrarian drought-crisis with floating-stone SF iconography; chalk-ghost orchestrating rain-dance via antique bell feels non-obvious yet inevitable. Tropes (ghost, prophecy, collective ritual) are retooled through orchard-specific tools and communal POV. Risk—lyric accumulation, no single hero—pays off in resonant closure. Transformation test fails if relocated: bell, arches, chalk relays are irreplaceable to this world’s logic.</comment>
