<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The performer’s contradictory impulses—reporting grief yet sheltering it—are dramatized in concrete beats (offering the bouquet, narrating the kettle). Interiority stays embodied and idiosyncratic; the final renunciation of forced cheer is earned and costly. Minor slip: the “moral ambiguity” is asserted more than tested in the inspector scene, keeping him just shy of 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the remade hush is charged with the cost of permanent outsider status. Accumulative lens holds—pattern of narrated chores tightens stakes without causal reversals. Orientation is swift; turbines and farmhouse root us by line 3. One hairline slip: inspector’s “compliance” line could carry sharper cost to the performer.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Micro-setting mastery: the dried bouquet’s pollen stains the inspector’s palm, reweighting the final image. Turbines cast rehearsal shadows that constrain the window-opening beat. Every sensory pick is filtered through the performer’s grief-tuned attention; no postcard filler. Environment directly shapes the closing gesture of planting birds—environment-as-tool gating 9+ is met.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—will the regime’s residual grip close around him again?—tightens when the inspector arrives. Narrating the kettle becomes a micro-act of defiance that forecloses the option of returning to old propaganda work. Cost is legible: he signs the paper but forfeits community trust forever. Escalation is single-cadence but sufficient for lyric accumulative design.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the pattern: lightness cultivated inside grief is resistance, not denial. Final image of birds with petal beaks reweights the bouquet without moralizing. Subtext in the inspector’s silent nod conveys regime fatigue better than exposition. One tiny echo of thesis in “faithful ≠ cheerful” is earned, not intrusive.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Perceptual signature is razor-sharp: water “agrees to be less than cloud and more than metal.” Syntax mirrors the performer’s measured cadence under surveillance. No head-hop; psychic distance contracts perfectly as the inspector enters. Voice sustains lyric compression without ever losing clarity—9+ bar met.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies from long breathless lines to clipped “Witness, he says to the broom.” No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or stakes. Mixed metaphors are purposeful (iron scythes that never finish harvest) and stay coherent. One negligible filter verb cluster in “he begins dramatically narrating” keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: happiness mandate aftermath told through chore-liturgy. Wind turbines as iron scythes feels inevitable yet new. Risk of narrating mundane tasks pays off by turning domestic space into dissident stage. Conceptual integrity intact—no retreat into safe sentimentality.</comment>
