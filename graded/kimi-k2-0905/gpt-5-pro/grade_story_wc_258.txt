<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The narrator’s “steady curiosity” surfaces in only one concrete micro-choice—agreeing to walk the pins—yet remains mostly abstract. Interiority is lyrical but generic (“confusion itself felt like a map”), not character-specific. No contradictory impulses appear in scene; the emotional arc is a smooth accumulation of wonder rather than a pressured change. The final “borrowed our breath” stasis is atmospherically earned but costs nothing specific to this narrator.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Closure is a lyrical Resonant Reconfiguration—rain, steam, and shared breath crystallize the lattice—yet the cost is collective and diffuse, not protagonist-bound. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern deepens rather than causally tightens. Orientation is swift, but the loft’s spatial logic (pin placement, walking order) stays slightly fuzzy. Closure image is resonant, yet the Decisive Change happens off-page in the arriving neighbors rather than in the narrator.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Skylight loft, cork map, red string, onyx deck—each is tactile and re-used. Rain and steam function as live weather that draws people in, charging the final image. Micro-settings (bench, stoop, windows) constrain movement and social distance. Slight spatial drift: pin-to-pin choreography is evocative but not fully trackable under the walking sequence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—will the lattice bridge the silent neighborhood?—is declared late and never faces a visible fork for the narrator. Escalation is textural: layers of paths multiply density instead of narrowing options. The protagonist’s agency is observational; the decisive crossing happens when others arrive, not through a pressured choice. Cost is atmospheric, not personal; no credible loss is risked or paid.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Theme—memory as communal infrastructure—emerges through string, chalk, steam, and shared kitchens rather than exposition. Subtext resides in silence across the neighborhood gap and in the cartomancer’s refusal of profit. Final image of the loft “returning a forgotten message” reweights prior motifs without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers: whose memory is repaired, and at what price?—inviting reflection without confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>First-person lyric voice sustains a dense, rhythmic cadence that mirrors lattice-building: clauses multiply like paths. Diction stays within narrator’s plausible lexicon while coining fresh compound images (“grit-bright hush,” “kettles…whistled”). No head-hopping; perceptual signature is consistent. Minor over-exotic phrasing (“onyx-ink cartomancer”) verges on branding but remains legible and patterned.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Figurative density is high—almost every sentence carries an extended metaphor—yet the pattern is taught early and sustains the cartomancer’s voice. Occasional mixed metaphors (“constellations waiting to fall into meaning”) slightly blur physical logic. No loops or scaffold; sentences vary in length and syntax. Punctuation is clean, pronouns stable.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Reverse-engineering culture through string, chalk, and shared steam is a fresh synthesis of post-crash solarpunk hope. The lattice-as-infrastructure concept transforms familiar community-mapping tropes. Risk is taken with dense lyric prose and collective closure; coherence holds. Not quite 9+ because the narrator’s personal stake remains interchangeable.</comment>
