<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mara’s contradictory impulses—rational mystic who nevertheless kneels to frost—are dramatized in gesture (palm to dashboard) and embodied cost (cooling-metal tick). The narrator’s micro-choice to speak the father’s name is earned by the prism’s prior refracted flare and the frost spiral locking onto that seat. Interiority stays particular: “smoke and rain on my tongue” vs. therapy-speak. Closure renunciation (apology made audible in steering-column creak) forecloses skepticism with visible price.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: frost patterns accumulate density until the prism’s refraction reweights the stake—“objects absorb emotions”—with conceptual cost. The final image (keys set down “as if they might bruise”) delivers Resonant Reconfiguration: the cabin air’s new density is felt, not explained. No causality break; every beat (heater hum, frost ferns, prism flare) is an intensification, not a random cue. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are clear by line 5; later disorientation (mist dog) serves closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Quartz arbor, mist, and frost-covered sedan function as micro-setting that literally refracts and records emotion; the prism’s auroras on the ribs are the final image. Sensory hierarchy obeys mystic’s priorities: visual breath, tactile cold, auditory tick. Spatial choreography is clean—hand to hood, palm to dash, prism angle to windshield. Environment constrains the only possible “communion”—no other surface could hold transient frost memory.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—prove or disprove emotional absorption—tightens when frost spirals center on father’s seat, forcing narrator to test belief with embodied cost. One meaningful deepening: prism flare after the name is spoken locks the map of shards, foreclosing retreat to mere skepticism. Price is audible (steering-column creak) and tactile (keys handled like bruised fruit). Agency stays with narrator: speaking the name is the decisive act that changes knowledge state.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from particular frost traces rather than thesis: memory is material but only briefly ownable. Subtext operates through silence—shifted hush, cooling tick—avoiding moralizing. Final image reweights “truthful lies” glove metaphor: the lie (objects feel) becomes true enough to bruise. Complexity preserved—no sermon, only scent of reopened jar.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Narrator’s perceptual signature is skeptical-mystic: scientific chuckles inside ribs yet tracks auroras like medic reading pulse. Syntax mirrors breath-fogged patience: long clauses that scatter, then fragment at prism flare. No head-hopping; Mara observed only through narrator’s lens. Diction stays within plausible lexicon—“ballast from her spine” is imagistic yet grounded.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with heater hum; sentence variety avoids template cadence. Information density high: “lace unfurled across the glass like frantic ferns” does three jobs—visual, motion, metaphor. No mixed metaphors; vehicles (frost = ferns, hush = silt) stay separate. Zero scaffold/loop; each sentence advances image or pressure. Copy-clean; pronouns unambiguous.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Frost-window as memory substrate is fresh angle on familiar ghost-tech trope. Risky lyric accumulation paid off: frost patterns taught early, reprised as gate accepting key. Specificity—quartz arbor ribs, patient prism—renders template unrecognizable. Synthesis feels inevitable: only this combo could externalize apology as steering-column creak.</comment>
