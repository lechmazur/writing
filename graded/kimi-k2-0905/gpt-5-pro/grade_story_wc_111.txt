<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The protagonist’s motives—guilt, reclamation, and the need to outwit quantified fate—are legible through embodied ritual (polishing marbles, ribbon ceremonies). Interior contradiction surfaces when he confesses past lies yet re-uses their angles, showing a credible hierarchy of values. The final stance crystallizes with cost: he forfeits societal legitimacy to keep the maze’s private acceptance, an earned renunciation foreshadowed by “three winters” survival. Micro-choices (kneeling Auditor, hat-rejection arch) tighten status dynamics without headcount clutter.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the vine doorway fitting only the narrator’s stoop reconfigures acceptance vs. audit, with conceptual cost (exclusion of the Auditor/hat) legible in the final image. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: repetition of light-scatter and marble constellations tightens meaning rather than causal plot. Causality is present but subordinate to pattern; the Auditor’s kneel meter-reading forms one micro-turn that validates the graft without resolving it. No orientation debt; maze geography stays trackable through marble breadcrumbs and light pools.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Garden maze operates as micro-setting: vine arch, clover shadows, and trellis ribbons physically constrain who can pass and where light pools. Sensory economy favors tactile and visual (cracked glass, bent shoulders, humidity meter) filtered through aging gardener bias. The cracked marbles function as both tool and setting joint, charging the final doorway image. Weather and season implied through “three winters” and frost-cracks, enough to anchor temporal endurance without catalog.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—proving the garden recognizes devotion despite measurable luck—signals early and deepens through ceremonial micro-victories. Escalation is accretive: each marble placement and ribbon tightens private proof against public metrics; the Auditor’s visit externalizes pressure without becoming antagonistic. Cost is felt when vines physically reject the Auditor’s hat, affirming the protagonist’s exclusionary legitimacy. No coincidence resolves tension; the final arch forms from sustained labor, not luck.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: devotion’s immeasurable value vs. commodified fate. Mended deception motif recurs—first as past harvest lies, then as light-angled graft—without thematic echo lines. Final image of vine doorway reweights “garden knows its gardener” as both gift and prison, avoiding moralizing. Subtext resides in silence when hedges lean away from the Auditor, implying social exclusion the protagonist accepts.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>First-person voice maintains distinct perceptual signature: horticultural metaphor, twine-and-jar idioms, patient nurse pulse-reading syntax. Compression (“luck becomes a bar code”) taught early and paid off at closure. No head-hopping; Auditor’s interior accessed only through gesture and meter. Rhythm modulates: longer incantatory sentences for ritual, clipped fragments under Auditor scrutiny. Dialogue sparse but subtextual—his confession of deception met with polite laugh—advances plot.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>High information density: single sentences deliver backstory, sensor-tech critique, and emotional stance (“marbles… rolled away when merchants standardized fate”). Metaphors stay coherent (twine, tinder, sap) and serve emotional temperature. No paraphrase loops; each marble/ribbon beat adds new angle or cost. Minor register lift (“conceptual repricing”) acceptable as narrator mirrors audit lexicon.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: quantified-luck dystopia meets lyric horticulture. Transformation of cracked sensors into memory-bearing constellations reframes tech debris as ritual tool. Risk of sentimentality averted by refusing triumphant harvest—victory is exclusionary arch. Specific detail (“blinks like cold ponds” for tablets) keeps familiar audit trope alive.</comment>
