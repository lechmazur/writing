<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Chronicler’s interiority is lyrically rich yet static; no contradictory impulse is dramatized in-scene, and the climactic shift from “writing to tending” is asserted rather than embodied. Child interaction supplies one micro-choice—opening a new door—but the keeper’s stake in that moment remains observational, so motivation never tightens under pressure. The final stance costs nothing we witness on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Closure reaches for Earned Stasis—tending instead of recording—but the causal chain is missing: we are told “I felt my task deepen” after ceiling crack & swan twitch, yet no decisive action or forfeiture dramatizes the change, so the cost is conceptual only. Accumulative/Textural lens holds, but without a visible price the reconfiguration feels ornamental. Orientation holds, yet the single long shard teeters on summary.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Sensory filament is exquisitely selective—“stone arches sweat minerals that smell of thunder”—and every descriptor is filtered through the keeper’s loosened grip on reality. Library, river-refuge, and origami swan are re-used, lived-in, tactically functional; the swan finally constrains the exit paths. Micro-setting succeeds even if the global geography is dream-logic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—witness without judgment—remains steady; no meaningful tightening or price is dramatized that forecloses an alternative path. Accumulating refugees raises texture yet never tests the keeper’s stance with a forced choice; the ceiling crack promises escalation but resolves into patience without visible trade-off. Pressure plateaus rather than sharpens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme of caretaking memory without possession emerges organically through repeated images of paper, roots, and silence replanting breath. Final “crumbling peace is enough to cradle tomorrow” offers resonant CR that reweights earlier ruins as nurturers. Avoids moral statement, but abstract phasing near the end slightly dilutes visceral cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>First-person voice is consistent, textured, and lexically lush—“maps deserve mercy,” “river licks it without wearing it down”—with rhythmic control that slows to match contemplative stakes. No head-hop; perceptual signature of someone who “grips reality loosely” shapes every metaphor. Compression and elision are taught early and hold legible through the final image.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Prose attains poetic density yet avoids purple overload; clauses are deliberate, no scaffold or synonym loops, strong information density. Occasional elevated diction (“conceptual repricing,” “regenerative silence”) is justified by keeper’s erudite lens. Final third keeps clarity and propulsion, satisfying high-band line craft.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Overgrown catacomb-library and origami-swan portal feel fresh, but the “refuge along the river” and “records kept by humble guardian” echo tropes from Borges, Calvino, and VanderMeer. Concept of silence as renewable substrate is the standout inflection. Strong synthesis, yet not wholly non-obvious.</comment>
