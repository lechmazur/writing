<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The narrator’s “dynamically observant” trait is shown through lush cataloging of sensory detail, but interior contradiction and embodied emotion flatline; the hitchhiker’s return feels willed by motif rather than driven by a visible cost to the narrator. Micro-choices (lifting the flake, agreeing to leave it) are present yet low-stakes, so the Earned Stasis is more asserted than dramatized. Voice remains coherent, but the emotional arc never complicates under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the flake stays behind to “light this crease,” reconfiguring the narrator’s stance with conceptual cost. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern of fragmentary images (flake, scaffold wrap, boot prints) tightens into final crystallized image. Orientation is clear by line 4, no causality breaks; however, the vanish-return loop is coincidence-tolerant, keeping the score sub-9.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Mountain pullout, spruce shade, charred switchback, and glass flake micro-setting all constrain movement and supply tangible resources (flake as lens, scaffold wrap as path-marker). Sensory hierarchy skews visual but selection is urgent and POV-filtered. Spatial choreography is flawless; bodies and objects track without drift. Environmental specifics (fireweed, steaming logs) evolve with forward motion, charging the final cairn image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—recovering/transforming loss into possibility—is signaled early and reweighted when the flake is left as beacon. Escalation is textural: density of light/shard images accumulates until the crevice encounter crystallizes options. No tangible price is extracted from the narrator (time, risk, social credit), so cost remains conceptual rather than felt, capping the band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Theme of “pixelated amnesty” emerges through recursive light-fragment imagery rather than statement; the flake’s final bequeathal renegotiates forgiveness as incomplete squares of brightness. Ambiguity is purposeful—no moral is sermonized. Emotional aftereffect is concrete: the canyon brightens “square by square.” One minor echo risk: the fiddler’s direct naming of “pixelated amnesty” edges toward Thematic Echo but occurs mid-story, so penalty is minimal.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>First-person voice owns a distinct perceptual signature—synesthetic metaphors (“bridge-song,” “radio seeking a station”) and rhythmic anaphora that mirrors obsession. Syntax flexes with pressure, no head-hopping. Fiddler’s dialogue is sparse yet idiom-differentiated; subtextual grin carries threat/invitation. Register holds lyric without purple drift; elision (“stepped sideways when the wind played the right chord”) is taught early and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Line-level craft is lush but flirts with density overload: three consecutive sensory metaphors per sentence across 200+ words. Vehicles stay coherent (light, music, bridges), avoiding mixed-metaphor penalty. No paraphrase loops or template cadence; clauses propel. Minor scaffold: “luminous disbelief ribbon through my ribs” could trim to “disbelief ribbons my ribs,” but artifact does not touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Fusion of wet-plate photography shard, bridge-song spirit-guide, and vanishing hitchhiker generates fresh mythic texture. Conceptual risk—lyric accumulative structure—pays off in crystallized final image. Could swap names but not metaphors, so transformation is partial. Scaffold-wrap map and “pixelated amnesty” coinage supply memorable inflections that feel inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
