<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interiority is richly embodied—"quiet blaze held under his ribs"—and every tactile beat (palm-to-bark, ring tightening) reveals a hierarchy of values: mapping truth vs. drowning in grief. The single micro-choice to open the ring and inscribe the stillpoint is the earned pivot that forecloses his old blank-map stance; cost is the cut of stillness he now forever carries. No contradiction or diagnostic speak; perceptual signature stays consistent, flawed, and individual.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of sap-and-echo density increases until the grove forms a "nave," then cadence shifts to breath-held quiet; closure is Charged Poise—ring grooves now aligned to "poise" not place—conceptual cost legible in final image. Causality intact: each sensory absorption beat tightens stakes until the grove crystallizes the stillpoint; no teleporting props or convenient amnesia. Orientation anchored by line 4 ("ultrasonic forest") and reinforced through body-in-environment choreography; disorientation is taught and pays off at climax.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Forest is no backdrop; branches physically form a "nave," ring grooves catch "starlight," and these micro-settings constrain stance—he must kneel to receive the tone. Sensory hierarchy obeys blind POV: vibration, scent, temperature dominate over sight. Spatial choreography remains coherent; deer of echoes tracks without hoof-fall contradiction. Setting charges final image: clearing’s balanced air becomes the new compass he carries away.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—find the stillpoint or stay emotionally lost—is signaled early and tightens through each sap-grammar beat; the forest itself applies accumulative pressure until options narrow to kneel or retreat. One meaningful deepening: when ring freezes on "tongue of quiet," stillness itself becomes the threat/cost. No external coincidence; escalation is purely sensory-textural accrual. Price is the cut of eternal still he now bears—visible on page via "ring cool and sure."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme—maps as living tissues of trust rather than control—emerges through concrete pattern: blank hurt-map vs. inscribed stillpoint. Subtext operates in gesture (ring opening) and image (starlight caught in grooves) rather than thesis. Final image reweights premise: compass no longer points to north but to internal poise, a Conceptual Repricing with undeniable social-interior cost. Ambiguity lingers—he can still drown—but now possesses a "faithful star"; no moralizing closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyric-accumulative voice taught early—"quiet blaze under ribs"—and held without slippage; perceptual signature is blind, synesthetic, vibration-biased. Rhythm modulates from long patient clauses to breath-parcel fragments at climax, mirroring heart-pause. No head-hopping; single POV stays strictly skin-bound. Diction stays within plausible lexicon of a tactile cartographer; no corporate register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High information density: every sentence layers sense, metaphor, and forward motion—"tasted its grammar ripple through his skin" does three jobs. No paraphrase loops or template cadence; sentence openings vary. One mixed-metaphor risk—"coin laid on tongue of quiet"—but fits lyric register and is paid off by ring-as-lozenge image. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with pressure; no scaffold sentences or filter-verb stacks.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>Premise—blind cartographer who maps by sap and pitch—is fresh synthesis of fantasy trope with sensory realism. Stillpoint as pre-note seed reweights entire concept of navigation; not a trophy but an internalized wound-tool. Risk of lyric density is embraced and paid off by climax clarity. Specificity throughout—cedar grammar, deer of echoes—prevents generic transfer; story would collapse if names or senses changed.</comment>
