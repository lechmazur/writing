<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The watcher’s interiority is textured and consistent—choices (“I weighed each piece,” “I set the pearl...”) show hierarchy of values under pressure. The memory of losing the sky personalizes motive, but the stakes never tighten beyond a gentle equilibrium; no credible mistake or flaw complicates tactics, and renunciation feels pre-ordained rather than costly. Interior contradiction is implied, not dramatized in a single high-stakes beat, so the arc reads as serene accumulation rather than tested change.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of polishing, weighing, and hush-braiding intensifies density without external reversals. Closure is a Charged Poise—the shared glow reconfigures village and cave relationship with undeniable conceptual cost (permanent earthbound vigil). The price is diffuse but legible in “village songs might fade,” anchoring the final beat under reflective stasis.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Serpentine grotto, tide-lantern threads, and salt-fog are filtered through watcher’s patient perception; micro-setting (pearl, glass shards) constrains every decision. Spatial choreography is clean; mist drift and wet-nerve wall track believably. Environment supplies the literal tool for closure—the hollow that cradles the pearl—earning micro-setting credit.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—balance communal calm against storm-risk—is declared early but remains abstract; no on-page test sharpens the trade-off. The tightening beat is the choice to release/integrate the pearl: it narrows future weather but price is only stated (“storms could return”). Escalation is tonal density, not rising threat; sufficient for lyric mode but not visceral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of shared quiet versus blaze emerges through tidal glass, hush-pearl, and softened villagers; no explicit thesis spoils the ending. Final image—“lanterns a tide can carry, unburning and true”—reweights the opening desire without moralizing. Particulars (kelp-green shards, cradle memory) keep universals anchored; ambiguity persists about lost songs, honoring complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>First-person voice owns a distinct patient cadence—“zephyr bloom,” “read sky from water”—syntax mirrors tidal rhythm. Compression (“I lost the sky”) teaches elision early; no POV leakage. Register stays within watcher's contemplative lexicon; free-indirect moments (“the rock remembers”) feel intentional. Dialogue is absent by design, so voice remains singular and cohesive.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is high-density, lyric, and read-aloud fluent; figurative runs (“light rose without flame...”) stay coherent because physical logic is dream-consistent. No paraphrase loops or template cadence; each sentence advances pattern or atmosphere. Minor risk of purple in “condensed hush, bright as sleep,” but it lands within permissible lyric height. Closure line is uncluttered, sealing rhythm.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Premise—earthbound astronomer who re-creates constellations in sea glass—offers fresh inversion of sky-gazing trope. Integration with hush-pearl and tide-lantern language feels inevitable, not ornamental. Villagers learning “pause can carry more than a shout” supplies social inflection rarely paired with eco-fantasy. Conceptual boldness is controlled; no gimmicks, only specific detail.</comment>
