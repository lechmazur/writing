<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The copper-veined storyteller’s body-as-tool premise is viscerally embodied: “I wound wire from my own veins…tethered the diamond to my wrist.” Interior contradiction—offering personal names to a rumored curse—escalates to surrender; cost is felt when the jewel “grows warm and thirsty” and the speaker relinquishes memory. Micro-choices (where palm presses, when to split task) map a hierarchy of values under pressure. The final instrument-state lands as earned renunciation, bruise and all.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the speaker becomes “an instrument more than a mouth,” canyon and self fused, language saved but self subsumed—undeniable conceptual cost. Accumulative lens taught early (“tunnel of echoes…tightened the world into a single attentive breath”) holds through final braid-image. Pattern taught by 120-word mark, no orientation debt. The ending line “whoever listens next” reweights all prior texture-sound translation, satisfying CR without moralizing.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The canyon’s bone towers, copper wire, and flawed diamond function as micro-setting that physically constrains tactics: palm-placement dictated by bird veer, diamond bite fixing the braid. Sensory hierarchy is POV-specific—metal-skinned patience, friction-voice transduction—never tourist catalog. Spatial choreography remains coherent across palm-press, wire-tether, crosswind split. Final image of diamond set in “gentle bite” fuses body-tool-environment, charging closure under Q3 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—save a dying language—tightens when each surrendered memory narrows future selfhood; “curse asked for two more names” is the visible price that alters tactics. Agency is continuous: reading bird grammar → pressing bone → surrendering names → becoming instrument. Escalation is accumulative deepening rather than causal reversals, permissible under lens. The final renunciation forecloses return to prior identity, meeting high-band cost requirement.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the metabolism of failure: cracks as libraries, curse as appetite, translation as self-consumption. No abstract declaration—“I had promised the dead” is the only overt thesis, anchored in scene. Final reconfiguration (“together we carry the language forward”) reframes loss as conduit, resisting tidy moral. Ambiguity lingers: the rescued language now speaks through a voice no longer fully human.</question>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>First-person lyric texture sustains perceptual signature: metal-teaching-skin, diamond stutter, marrow-hearing. Syntax compresses under pressure—“copper seeped…winding into the bone”—without losing clarity. Patterned elision (no quotation marks, sparse punctuation) taught in opening lines and maintained. Voice modulates from quiet articulate to quieter still, mirroring stakes without register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density—“syllables tapping along the bone as if the towers themselves were youth again”—every image advances atmosphere or causality. Rhythm varies: long breathless accumulations vs. fragmentary beats (“I let go…”) that mimic echo fracture. One mixed metaphor (“black wreath against the bleached sky”) is minor. No paraphrase loops, no scaffold; final line lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes linguistic anthropology, metal-body horror, and ornithomancy into an inevitable whole; remove any layer and the story collapses. Risk—self-vampiric translation—heightens emotional stakes without gimmickry. The “flawed diamond rumored to be cursed” is transformed from cliché into archival tool that eats memory to save meaning. Fresh inflection feels instantly canonical.</comment>
