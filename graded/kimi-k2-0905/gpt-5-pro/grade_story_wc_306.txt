<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Mara’s interior contradiction—smiling politely while clutching a shard of broken hindsight—remains concrete and embodied; her throat moving “when futures test their weight” shows simultaneous want/fear without label-speak. The micro-choice to unhook the cloak crystallizes values (public duty vs. private doubt) with visible cost: she exhales “as if a complicated sentence finally allowed its comma.” Final stance is earned: she signs, but under conditions she could not voice before the mirror-and-chime ritual; the cloak is heavier yet lighter, a lived ambiguity. Minor hairline slip: “sincerely insincere” is named once; it never complicates an on-page decision, so motivation stays just shy of 9+ perfection.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Mara lifts the hollow mirror, sees dawn flooding through, and accepts a path that keeps doorways open while admitting fear—cost is the porous uncertainty she now carries. Lens is Accumulative/Textural: wind-chime pattern taught early, reweighted at end when copper-bone-glass sequence “protect, remember, adapt” becomes the council speech she will give. Persistent constraint—her signature is still the knife—shapes tactics; no soft reset. Orientation clean within 120 words; geography (lighthouse stairs, chart nail) tracks throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Micro-setting rules: the taped mirror shard functions as both lantern and window; its hollow center literally reframes what Mara sees, constraining her final stance. Lighthouse wind-chime constellations are not backdrop—they are the decision engine; notes stand for cost/benefit/ghost and directly output the plan she will present. Salt-stiff cloak hung on nail evolves from emblem to prop: its removed weight allows the exhale that enables signature. Sensory hierarchy obeys POV: city planner notices hinge-point homes, tidal maps, shell-stacking child—details that later become negotiation chips.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—demolish quay or protect neighborhood—signaled in first third. Tightening occurs when wind chooses copper-bone-glass sequence; this forecloses the option of pure certainty, forcing Mara to adopt conditional signature. Cost is legible: she must publically speak fear while holding the knife. Agency is decision, not endurance; coincidence complicates (storms that missed by a street) but does not resolve. No reversal, but one meaningful deepening suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from particulars: conscience-as-commodity, mirror that shows absence, cloak that is doubt itself. No moral stated; final image of porous paper in ledger reweights premise—plans must have holes to breathe. Subtext in gesture: handing back the shard is payment yet trust. Ambiguity lingers: seawall may still fail, but voice has been lent to those who sleep on hinge points. Avoids sermon; resonance is tactile, not assertive.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>First-person perceptual signature is consistent: “questions like lanterns, hooded,” “chimes tinkling like oysters speaking in coded clicks.” Syntax breathes with scene—short clauses under pressure, longer reflective cadences at dawn. No head-hopping; interior access stays bounded to hired conscience. Dialogue minimal but subtextual: “May I” / nod / unhook carries entire status shift without exposition. Diction stays within plausible lexicon of itinerant ethical guide.</answer>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</question>
<comment>Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings avoid template cadence. Information density high: one sentence often layers metaphor, prop, and emotional tilt (“I carry questions like lanterns, hooded, careful not to ignite anyone’s dry certainty”). No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances knowledge or atmosphere. Minor mixed metaphor—“cloak of doubt” is both canvas and weather—but metaphorical logic holds within lyric frame. No artifacts in closure beat; final line is clean image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise—conscience for hire—offers fresh angle on moral consultancy; wind-chime divination as decision protocol is non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Specificity grounds novelty: oyster-click chimes, salt-stiff cloak, hollow mirror instead of whole. Risk in lyric accumulation pays off: reader taught to read pattern early, so final sequence carries causal weight. Transformation test fails if relocated: hinge-point homes, tidal maps, and council knife are irreplaceable. Emotional truth > surface gimmick; vulnerability as protected commodity feels newly observed.</comment>
