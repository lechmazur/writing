<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The narrator’s mix of technical fastidiousness and raw regret is embodied in micro-gestures—thumb prickled by cloth, grease on knuckles—so motive stays tactile. Interior contradiction surfaces when facts fail to anaesthetise the Abel ache, but the swing is declared more than enacted; we’re told “the ache opened” rather than shown a fresh physical tell. The final pledge to “midwife a new story” is credible because the cloth and set list have already forced memory through the body, yet the beat still leans on summary. Earned cost is present but compressed: the emotional price is felt, yet the decisive micro-choice that locks him into the dig happens off-stage in the paragraph leap from trailer to valley.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the valley “answering” reconfigures silence into collaborative work and the narrator’s shame into forward agency, with the conceptual cost of lifelong indenture to ghosts. Causality holds—cloth → set list → Echo Bench map → vow—each because/therefore link tightening options. One causality hairline: the drawer yields the exact set list from the same tour inside a random filing cabinet in a quarry office, a lottery-level coincidence that slightly blunts escalation. Nevertheless, the final image reweights every prior echo metaphor, satisfying the cost test under a Causal lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Quarry-as-amphitheater is immediate, sonic, and stakes the entire emotional history; every reverb image is rooted in acoustics, not decoration. The trailer’s dust, flickering maps, and coffee “old enough to have a pension” ground tension in breathable particulates. Spatial choreography stays clean—Lark waves him in, drawer handle snags, they step out—no floating bodies. Environment constrains the final choice: only the valley’s stone throat can convert his failure into a new “choir,” so setting directly charges the closing image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominate stake—redeem silence after public humiliation—faces a concrete test: will he commit to exhuming gear that could revive both the valley’s myth and his name? Mid-story tightening occurs when the set list proves he himself sealed the gear under stone, converting nostalgia into obligation. Cost is visible—he writes “Dear Echo” and accepts unpaid, possibly futile labour—but the beat is a single beat; no secondary reversal escalates further. Sufficient for 600-800 words, but the price plateaus once the decision is made.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from refrains of echo, applause, and afterlife of noise: cultural memory needs a custodian once the crowd stops clapping. Subtext lives in objects—cloth, grille, set list—rather than exposition. The valley as “free reverb” reconfigured into unpaid graveyard duty avoids moralising; meaning stays in image. Final “patient calling its doctor” reweights earlier health metaphors without spelling lesson.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>First-person voice carries a roadie’s gear-head diction—tweed combos, output transformers—yet slips into compressed lyric when shame surfaces, creating credible psychic distance. Syntax ripples: long clauses for nostalgia, staccato fragments for shock (“He died a year later”). No head-hopping; sensory filters belong to the narrator’s audio-trained attention. Occasional elevated phrase—“promise filigreed with grit”—skirts but never breaks occupational lexicon, staying purposeful.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Sentences perform double duty: “The scrap prickled my thumb, as if asking whether I had finally fallen to souvenir work” advances plot, reveals vocation, and carries metaphor. No paraphrase loops; each paragraph adds new angle of cloth, map, or memory. Metaphors stay coherent—stone as choir, valley as patient—without mixed vehicles. One tiny scaffold: “confidently uncertain” is repeated descriptor rather than shown contradiction in-scene, a minor fleck.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Buried-rock-guitar premise could feel gimmicky, yet the emotional hook—roadie disgraced on live TV—grounds it in lived shame. Sonic archaeology as reclamation of self is fresh, avoiding treasure-hunt cliché. Specific touring details (ozone-smelling tarps, hotter output transformers) authenticate the world. Risk in high poetic density pays off because acoustics theme justifies reverberant language.</comment>
