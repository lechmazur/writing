<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s interior contradiction—court fines vs plant-whispers—drives every beat; the final “I choose” is earned by the prior heat-cool cycles she alone times. The insurgent-grandmother label is never allowed to flatten into caricature; her ash-braided body and ash-softened dialect keep her specific. Missing only a sharper external status clash (the council stays off-page) to expose her limits mid-scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the translucent frond glows over scaffolds, reweighting “implanted destiny” to invited destiny with felt civic cost. Causal lattice holds—kite-code → heat ritual → kernel consent—each step forecloses the council’s museum plan without reset. Orientation is taught by the second sentence; no teleporting props. Persistent constraint: the broken watch and reed songs keep time, shaping every tactical move.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Volcanic springs function as micro-setting: their breathing pulses physically gate the amber-opening ritual and time Mara’s watchless beats. The ash-clouded valley, scaffolded bathhouses, and basalt snag are re-used anchors, never tourist filler. One slip: “newborn moonlight” edges toward ornamental symbolism, but the glow is tied to the living frond that reconfigures power, so the image charges closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“obedience masquerading as fate” vs consent—is signaled in line 5 and tightened when Mara swaps command-glyph for question-glyph, foreclosing the council’s museum path. Cost is visible: the amber’s sap-thread voice interrogates her, and she publicly stakes her legitimacy on a living, un-controllable sprout. One meaningful turn suffices; no reversal inflation needed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the kite-code’s grammars of heat and question: tradition is a living grammar, not a vitrine relic. Subtext resides in the sedges’ mineral whispers and the embryo’s sap-voice—never declared, always dramatized. Final image of glowing scaffolded future reframes implanted destiny as invited evolution without sermon. Complexity acknowledged: the council’s fear remains plausible, not caricatured.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyric-accumulative voice is established in sentence one (“ghostly steam over scaffolded bathhouses”) and sustained through reed-song cadences. Compression—“ash in her braid and court fines in her pocket”—teaches density early; later elisions (“fifteenth cycle”) are legible under the taught pattern. Perceptual signature: Mara notices mineral tastes, chlorophyll translation, and pumice timing, never generic nature. No head-hopping; councilors’ interiority is kept at gesture distance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Rhythm breathes with ritual: long anaphora of “Heat for eight breaths, cool…” mirrors spring pulses without algorithmic drum. Mixed-metaphor risk—“middle music whose possibilities trembled like light in shallow water”—passes because “music” is already literalized by sap-voice. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances ritual or stakes. Final line’s “rearticulated, a living joint” offers textural specificity that recharges earlier scaffold metaphor.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The insurgent-botanist grandmother who rewrites destiny via chlorophyll translation and geothermal ritual is a fresh synthesis of cli-fi and mythic reclamation. Kite-as-code stitched with heat-interval grammar converts a child’s toy into a civil programming language—risky yet coherent. Transformation test: remove volcanic consent ritual and the entire moral calculus collapses. Bold structural choice to stage revolution inside a single phased unsealing pays off in luminous final image.</comment>
