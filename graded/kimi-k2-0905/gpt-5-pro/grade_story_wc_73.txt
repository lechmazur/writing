<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The “grim optimist” is more mood than motive; interiority is rich yet decisions stay abstract (“I climbed, believing…”) rather than dramatized through irreducible micro-choices. The dice roll is the only concrete action, but its stakes are summarized, not embodied; endurance at the end is credible yet feels like a foregone thesis rather than a spontaneous, costly stance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the staircase accepts his proof, motion continues, cost is the indefinite deferral of exit—an Earned Stasis that forecloses rest. Causality is lyric/accumulative rather than strict because/therefore, but the pattern is taught early and the final image (“proof in my chest, texture under my tongue”) reweights prior material with conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The staircase as recursive topology is evoked through repeated, self-similar risers and horizon lines; sensory selection stays tight to POV (copier toner, iron of missed chances). Spatial coherence is intentionally fluid—the steps can leak light—so the slight floating quality is thematic, not negligent; still, anchoring bodies or distances could sharpen threat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—perpetual penance versus the chance to step off—is signaled early and tightens through each “lemma” ascent. No visible resource is lost, but the accumulation of attention-as-fuel generates an abstract price; the rupture offers a live option yet he keeps climbing, a credible renunciation under the accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme—memory as a frictionless engine—emerges from the recursive climb and dice rhythm, never abstractly preached. The final texture on the tongue reprises the opening prayer for “grain, the nap,” repricing the missed moment as something almost tactile yet forever deferred; ambiguity is coherent and haunting.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>First-person voice sustains a compressed, almost incantatory syntax that mirrors staircase recursion; diction (“boundless confinement,” “topology of vows”) stays within the narrator’s intellectual register without slipping into thesis-speak. Rhythmic loops (“each landing… each riser…”) are patterned, taught, and paid off in the final ascent, giving the prose a musical engine of its own.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>High metaphor density but vehicles stay coherent with the mathematical/thermal lexicon; no mixed metaphors bruise causality. Occasional scaffold (“the staircase is a listener…”) is brief and thematic, not momentum-dragging; final paragraph avoids artifact and lets the image breathe, satisfying the read-aloud ear test.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The infinite-stair penance machine is a fresh fusion of maths, regret, and dice divination; the “proof by ascent” converts abstract guilt into a spatial ritual. Risk—lyric recursion over plot—pays off because the pattern is legible and the final texture reconfigures the opening question, making the gamble feel necessary rather than gimmicky.</comment>
