<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The narrator’s paradox—con artist’s honest child—drives every micro-choice; the ink-tallying beat embodies the contradiction under lethal pressure. Interiority stays concrete (“black mouth reflecting a face that refused to lie”) and degrades plausibly when sirens shrink perception to wheel-groove and drip-count. The final swap—breath for truth—pays off the established ledger obsession with visible social cost. Only a hairline slip: “patience with knuckles” nears label-speak yet is saved by embodied context.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds throughout: because father taught habit-truth, therefore the narrator weaponizes paperwork and routine to outlast cops. Orientation locked by line 3; the single corridor-to-alley scene tightens twice—first when the patrol light “tastes the glass,” then when the shout turns skin to arithmetic. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the ink pot tilts to streetlight and the city’s ledger recalculates breath vs. indictment. Cost is unmistakable: the narrator forfeits defiance and accepts warnings as “tax,” foreclosing future resistance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The prep-room steel and refrigeration hum function as active antagonists—softening ethics, dictating timing, grooving the gurney wheels. Sensory hierarchy obeys POV: chemical tang first, then chrysanthemum stems, then the alley’s wet cardboard—each picked for smuggling utility. Micro-setting (ink pot) constrains the final bluff and recharges the father motif. No externals break plausibility; mortuary procedure reads accurate without exposition dump.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—Yusef’s breath vs. city’s quiet death order—signaled in paragraph 2. Escalation narrows twice: patrol sighting raises exposure, shout crystallizes jeopardy. Protagonist’s agency never flags; each tactic (paperwork feint, ink-pot prop, wheel-groove timing) is a because/therefore response. Final tightening: acceptance of warning as “tax” makes the moral cost irreversible under the causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges from ledger imagery: truth as calculable currency, death as debit, asylum as credit. Subtext lives in gesture—three taps equal a metronome for courage—never explained. Final image of names “matched to drawers that kept their receipts” reweights the premise: the state’s accounting can now be subpoenaed. No moralizing; resonance arises from the concrete swap of breath for documentation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>First-person voice carries a mortician’s clipped, chemical diction—“formalin and salt,” “steel drawer and a tag.” Rhythm accelerates under sirens: parataxis and drip-count mimic cardiac stress. No head-hop; perception stays strictly to what the narrator can see or infer. Ink pot becomes a rhythmic refrain without writerly self-consciousness.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Line-level craft is near-flawless: information-dense lines (“I would not outrun them, but I could outlast their attention if I cut grief into rehearsed gestures that bored them”) do triple duty—character, tactic, theme. Zero paraphrase loops; metaphors stay coherent (“skin to arithmetic” fits the ledger motif). Minor register lift in “discipline of an equation solved to the last digit” is earned by prior math-teacher setup. Closure beat clean, no scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: smuggling a live dissident through a mortuary’s own bureaucracy, weaponizing death certificates against state murder. The ink pot as both filial relic and forged seal feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk—static corridor scene—pays off by turning waiting into active mathematics. Not quite 9+ because the political-asylum frame, while grounded, still nods to a familiar rescue template.</comment>
