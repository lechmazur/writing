<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interior contradiction is vivid—“I wrote her letters for others to sign, because my words knew the road and my heart did not”—and the final public-art renunciation carries earned cost. Micro-choices (tying ribbon, inviting strangers) reveal hierarchy of values under pressure. Slight reserve: the “inevitably whimsical” label is asserted more than dramatized in mannerism. Still, the arc from ghost-writer to self-exposure is credible and individual.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the spiral of letters becomes a public maze that reconfigures both lovers’ options; ribbon thrums with felt cost. Lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of tied pages and reweighted nest image tightens the stake. Orientation is anchored by line 4 (time “after the storm,” place “lotus temple,” actor “I”). One causality nit: the ex-lover’s appearance edges coincidence, but crowd-opening reads as social magic, not resolution. Cost is visible: shared silence overtly forecloses old private letters.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setting is not backdrop but material: pond water mirrors choices, colonnade shade hosts the spiral, ribbon from nest becomes literal joint. Micro-setting (nest, balusters, reeds) constrains physical action and recurs in closure. Sensory hierarchy—green light, dragonfly stitching—filters through the narrator’s poetic bias without tourist catalog. Spatial choreography stays clean across crowd drift and twin walk. This charges the final image and meets the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“will my words return her?”—is signaled early; pressure mounts as each stranger ties a letter, narrowing private grief into public conduit. The tightening beat is the communal spiral thickening, forcing the couple into its center with undeniable witness. Cost is visible: their silence tied to twine forecloses old clandestine letter-writing. Slight escalation dip: ex’s arrival feels externally timed, but crowd dynamic keeps agency communal rather than lucky rescue.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: shared authorship vs. solitary longing. Subtext resides in gesture—tying rather than speaking—so final silence reweights prior verbose ghost-writing. No final moral stated; image of ripple shaped like a thread offers conceptual repricing. Motif of “thread” recurs only twice yet charges closure, avoiding checklist feel. Emotional aftereffect is wistful solidarity rather than romantic triumph, satisfyingly unresolved.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>First-person lyric voice owns a distinct perceptual signature: “constellations of sincerity,” “diagram of how hearts endure.” Syntax elongates then compresses under emotional crest, mirroring tidal breath of crowd. Diction stays within poet-ghostwriter lexicon; no register drift. Dialogue is minimal but natural (“who I was to do this”) and carries subtext. Repetition of “prismatic quiet” in opener and closer teaches pattern and pays off.</comment>

<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; long breathless sentences coil into short beats (“We walked…then stood”). Metaphors are dense yet coherent—no mixed vehicles. Information density high: one sentence often does two jobs (atmosphere + motive). Minor scaffold: “letters swell…edges scalloped like lilies” overlaps floral image twice; not closure-touching, so −0.2. No filter-verb stacks or paraphrase loops. Opening and closing lines anchor and resolve cleanly.</comment>

<comment>Premise—anonymous love-letter ghostwriter builds public-art confessional—feels fresh and specific to urban post-storm temple. Nest-twist with stolen wedding ribbon offers non-obvious synthesis of nature + ceremony. Risk of lyrical overload is embraced but controlled, heightening rather than obscuring stakes. If names/places swapped, the occupational arc collapses—proof of transformative integration. Minor proximity to “write her letters” trope is re-coded through public-art reversal.</comment>
