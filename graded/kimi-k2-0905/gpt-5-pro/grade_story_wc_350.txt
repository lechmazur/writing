<comment>Mara’s motives—sonic repair, cross-cultural bridge-building—stay legible and intensify; her pocketing of the inherited weight and multilingual scaling of the bridge are concrete, costly micro-choices. Interiority is sensuous, not diagnostic: “hands smelled like brass and paper,” “voice folded a room.” Status crucible with the councilman turns on his retrieved glove, not exposition. Final renunciation—leaving weight as vow—caps causality with felt price.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the bridge’s completion reweights storage into passage and revalues “measure” as mercy. Causal linkage holds: because Mara hears the elevator’s polyglot loneliness, therefore she mobilizes choir→councilman→timber, each because-step narrowing options until the span arcs. Accumulated languages become literal fasteners; cost is visible in dawn sweat and the relinquished talisman. Lens (Hybrid → Accumulative dominant) is taught by line 4 and re-asserted in final “puente, mitawa.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Clock-tower gears, pendulum shivers, and spilled-grain syllables are filtered through Mara’s tuned ear; every descriptor doubles as actuator (gears “click like castanets,” grain “coughs with chaff”). The elevator-as-organ metaphor is sustained without physics violation and constrains final action—chute offers boards when respected as social lung. Micro-setting (body + weight + zodiacal face) charged in final palm-press image satisfies 9+ gate. No orientation drift; astral hush is cue, not confusion.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—rehabilitate conversation or lose communal future—signals in first 120 w. Escalation is accretive: each new language fastened tightens physical bridge and social risk; councilman’s beam lift is visible price. No coincidence; elevator’s memory of glove is payoff of anthropomorphic setup. Single meaningful deepening suffices at this length; option space narrows until the span must be tested by children.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from sonic particulars: translation as structural beam, measurement as mercy. No moral statement—final image of swallow-children reweights “storage into passage” without sermon. Subtext of colonial grain infrastructure is invited but not lectured; ambiguity lingers. Return of multilingua as bridge-risers creates charged callback, not token motif.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Mara’s timbral perception; syntax elongates/shortens with breath of choir and rasp of auger. No head-hop; councilman’s shift is observed externally. Multilingual fragments are patterned early and paid off in scaffold cadence “uno, deux, nape, mitakuye.” Register consistent with librarian-poet who thinks in keys and colors.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>High information density: one sentence often sets scene, advances plot, and textures voice (“offering boards, bolts, and stories to the span”). Mixed-metaphor risk avoided; grain-as-language and clock-as-heart stay coherent. Rhythm modulates—staccato counts vs. legato starlight—supporting escalation. Minor scaffold: two adjacent “like” similes in elevator paragraph; not dense enough to dull closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Grain elevator that speaks immigrant tongues and is cured by choral linguistics is fresh synthesis of magical infrastructure + social repair. Risk of anthropomorphic silo pays off through grounded causality. Final re-pricing of measurement/mercy feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Specific detail (grandmother weight, Lakota “waonsila”) prevents template drift.</comment>
