<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kestrel’s “sacredly playful” thief is vivid through gesture (kissing secrets mid-air, bowing to a clock), but the apprentice’s fear-to-wonder shift is asserted more than embodied; the final pledge lands because the spire’s cost is felt, yet interior contradiction could be sharper under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the sky stays wrong but is now “our wrongness,” a conceptual repricing paid for with the teacher’s scroll and Kestrel’s driftwood-knight confession; the causal chain of chess-for-secrets → amended covenant → flexible sky holds without gaps, and the price is legible in the cathedral sigh.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The icebound spire, pocket sundial lid, and backward tide-clock are tactile constraints that shape tactics (niche, crown, final rhythm); vapor palace, wrong constellations, and frost-letters are filtered through apprentice awe, never touristic. Spatial choreography is clean—rope, niche, stair, exit throat—so the micro-setting directly charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—amend an ancient vow to let change in—tightens when the clock demands a live sacrifice of secrets; each chess swap escalates by exposing worse truths, narrowing options until the queen’s scroll reweights the sky. Cost is visible: Kestrel’s thorn of betrayal named, the apprentice’s future forgiveness surrendered.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the parley of secrets: mercy for flux, condemnation of stasis. No moralizing—final image of “adopted constellation that winked like a conspirator” reconfigures the earlier wrong sky into earned complicity. Ambiguity lingers: wonder now includes fear, but fear is welcomed as guest.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>First-person apprentice voice carries a distinct perceptual signature of vaulted wonder; syntax tilts toward liturgical cadence without monotony. Compression (“wind scraped our faces like a patient file”) teaches the lyric pattern early; no head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks. Dialogue is minimal but character-specific: Kestrel’s quip about stealing “only what refused to serve the good” sounds like his tongue, not the narrator’s.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and rhythm, propelling ascent then descent; metaphors stay coherent (time as river, stars as kelp) and never clog high-pressure beats. No paraphrase loops, no scaffold. Information density is high—each clause adds image or stakes—yet clarity remains intact. Final line earns its resonance without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fantasy quest tropes (thief, spire, chess game) are retooled into a lyric negotiation with cosmological stasis; the chess-for-secrets mechanic and backward tide-clock feel inevitable in hindsight. Risky second-person flirtation (“we climbed”) is held stable by consistent collective interiority. Specificity of “frost blossomed into letters that named our intentions” freshens familiar ice-citadel imagery.</comment>
