<comment>The poet’s interior contradiction—wanting to mend beauty yet embracing breakage—remains vivid and embodied; the micro-choice to pluck the snapped string and gift the feather shows values in action. Status shift with the father (apology → gratitude) is legible, but the boy’s agency is mostly reactive; the final cost is felt more by the kite than by the speaker, so the renunciation is slightly under-weighted for 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the kite’s new “honest tail” reweights the premise—imperfection becomes instrument, not flaw—visible in the boy’s louder whoop and the father’s surprise-gratitude. Causal chain intact: snapped string → feather gift → re-launch → reweighted beauty rule; cost is the poet’s surrender of his own quill, a concrete forfeiture. Lens holds accumulative: pattern of “weave” repeats, density increases, final image crystallizes meaning without expository nudge.</comment>

<comment>Lagoon-reed-mast micro-setting directly enables the recovery tactic; the cobalt / red color contrast charges the final image. Weather (post-rain stillness) governs sound propagation, making the string-snap audible as a “blank,” a sensory pivot that later reverses when reeds applaud. Spatial choreography tracks bodies, kite, feather, and string without drift; no orientation debt.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“discover beauty in the incomplete”—is signaled early and tightened when the kite’s tear threatens annihilation of that beauty. Agency: poet’s decision to harmonize discord (feather graft) forecloses the option of pristine repair; price is surrender of personal tool and exposure of own philosophy to strangers. One meaningful escalation under accumulative lens suffices; coincidence (gust) complicates but does not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through concrete recurrence: “woven dawns,” string as music, feather as question—each re-weighted at closure without moralizing. Final image of uneven kite steadying into its “better song” offers non-literal answer: imperfection is the weave. Avoids thesis statement; only micro-gripe is “lesson learned slowly” which edges toward meta, but it is single phrase, not paragraph sermon.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Perceptual signature is sustained: poet notices ripples as sky/water undecided, gulls arguing wind, string fray as music. Syntax mirrors attention—long breathing cadences in stillness, staccato pluck-and-answer during repair. No head-hop; diction stays within lyric-observer lexicon; feather’s “curves like a question” is character-specific metaphor, not generic.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>High figurative density is justified: pattern of textile/music/water imagery is taught early and pays off in final weave. No mixed metaphors; each vehicle (loom, shuttle, violin) stays coherent within its domain. Minor scaffold: “the reeds answer, and the puddles give back little circles of agreement” could lose one clause, but cadence serves child’s wonder. Closure image untouched by artifact.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: kite failure → reed mast → drake-feather tail turns standard beach vignette into quiet epistemological fable. Risk of preciousness is acknowledged and balanced by concrete tactile steps (twine, knot, launch). Not transformative at worldview level, but within 700 words the reconfiguration of “broken” to “honest instrument” feels inevitable and earned.</comment>
