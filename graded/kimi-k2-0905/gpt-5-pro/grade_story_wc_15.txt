<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The weaver’s grief-stitching and willingness to “hear how openings sing when edges split” give a concrete, idiosyncratic interiority; the final act of pressing the plate into the stone book shows a micro-choice that costs visibility and safety, earning a quiet renunciation rather than tidy triumph.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>A clean Accumulative/Textural lens: the lighthouse plate’s returns (plate → niche → embossed pages) tighten the pattern and reweight the stake from salvage to shared inner light; the closing image of townspeople touching “blind pages” is a Charged Poise that lets the reader feel the new cost—seeing with hands, not eyes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Red-canyon labyrinth, tide-pool clock, etched plate, waxed thread—each object is handled, not catalogued, and the plate’s grooves literally steer the final sewing beat, satisfying the 9+ gate that environment/tool must charge the last image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Single dominant stake: coax a passage no one else has found; pressure deepens as older chalk marks testify that predecessors paid with their sleep, and the final embossing of sail-cloth pages makes the cost tactile—no siren salvation, only shared inner illumination.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The “lighthouse without a lamp” motif evolves from absence to invitation; the reader is trusted to feel that brokenness can house light if community risks touch, avoiding any moralizing sentence—theme stays implicit in the closing hush of palms on blind pages.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>First-person lyric texture sustains a seam-stitch rhythm (“I thread my needle… the stone parts with shy gratitude”) that modulates under pressure; no head-hop, diction stays within the weaver’s compass, and the patterned elision of verbs (“I go via overlapping sleepwalking paths”) is taught early and paid off in the chalked arrivals.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>High-density metaphor is balanced—no mixed metaphors in peak beat, syntax varies from long breath to fragment, and sentence openings avoid drumbeat; “orchid solace” risks purple but is ear-tested by the fevered lyric context, and momentum is untouched at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The premise—repairing a broken map with literal sleep-tracks and embossing a lightless lighthouse into a feeling book—feels fresh; the risk of lyric abstraction is embraced and survives because the final image is tactile (hands on blind pages), preventing the concept from drifting into mere cleverness.</comment>
