<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The narrator’s filial identity (“cry wolf boy who cried wolf’s son”) is more label than lived contradiction; interiority is vivid but stays lyrically assertive (“I choose a new inheritance”) rather than dramatized under duress. Micro-choices (lattice placement, beam-holding) are present yet register as ritualized stance rather than escalating trade-off. Closure cost is poetic but felt more as tonal resolve than character-specific loss, keeping motivation strong but not quite irreversible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: lighthouse, lattice, copperlight, and door-scuff motifs accrue and re-weight at the lantern-pit closure where “air returned” gives Resonant Reconfiguration with conceptual cost. Orientation is taught early (“At dusk…”) and spatial choreography stays coherent; cause is poetic-metonymic rather than strict because/therefore yet remains legible under pattern. No meaningful tightening mid-piece, but cadence shift at beam-division beat delivers the single required deepening.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Micro-setting (lattice, door-scuff, brine jars) and body-in-motion anchor every beat; lighthouse prism functions as both tool and moral engine, constraining the final tactic of “ask silence to carry weight.” Sensory filter is POV-biased, salt- and copper-toned, integrated into action without tourist catalog. Spatial and material specifics charge the final image enough to pass 9+ gate for constraint-use.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“truth devours the gullible”—is signaled early; pressure escalates via density of rumor-images rather than option-narrowing turns. Protagonist’s agency is attention/ritual, not reversible choice; cost is conceptual (burden of perpetual witness) rather than concrete forfeiture, meeting 8-band threshold but lacking visible price that alters later tactics. Escalation is atmospheric, coherent under Accumulative lens, but single tightening moment is subtle.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges from recurrent wolf/hush/truth imagery; final copperlight dressing of shoulders re-weights earlier alarms into quiet vigilance without moralizing. Subtextual gap between “crying wolf” and “feeding on being believed” is complex, plausible. Resonance is strong though slightly abstract; specificity of lighthouse rituals keeps it from drifting into maxim.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>First-person voice owns a salt-cranked, ecclesiastical diction (“clockwork salt,” “confessional crosshatch”) that stays within lexicon of an island-raised myth-tender. Syntax lengthens and breathes with the turning lens; no unmotivated register drift. Perceptual signature is consistent and sufficiently distinctive for high band, though a few lyric clusters edge toward pattern repetition rather than fresh coinage.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Rich figurative density occasionally stacks in adjacent sentences (“tide negotiated parole,” “copper plate pressing…”) but pattern is taught early and does not obscure causality. No paraphrase loops; spatial choreography is clear. One mixed metaphor ribs/skin overlap mildly jars, and filter-verb stack (“I began to hover in earnest”) is present but momentary; closure image remains pristine, so high-band viable with minor deduction.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Wolf-fable inversion through lighthouse prison conceit is non-obvious and sustained; rumor-as-carnivore is fresh conceptual twist. Particulars (lattice as sieve for hush, brine jars of yesterday) are idiosyncratic and inseparable from plot mechanics. Risk in lyric accumulative structure heightens meaning without gimmickry; transformation sufficient to reach near-top band.</comment>
