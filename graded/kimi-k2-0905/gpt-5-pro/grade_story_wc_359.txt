<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The bell-ringer’s interiority is rich—synesthetic perception, embodied cold, the amber sheet as tactile memory—but the “certify wonder” motive stays lyrical rather than forcing a visible fork in action; the sculpted hush carries the emotional turn, yet the protagonist’s personal cost is felt only atmospherically, not as a concrete forfeiture on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/lyric lens: each image-layer (bell-tone → color → hush) tightens the weave until the sculptor’s chisel-hit lets the hush “stand” as crystallized bridge; closure is the Charged Poise instant where aurora-fed hush becomes portable witness, reconfiguring city/council stakes with undeniable conceptual cost—no causal gaps, orientation taught by 60 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Ice-cavern micro-setting is continuously handled—frostbitten palms, breath on glass, aurora rib-glow—each sensory beat doubles as tool/constraint (cold can kill sleep, ice refracts tone); the sculpted hush itself finishes as the “carved harbor,” a setting-state that houses the final image, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“prove wonder is essential”—deepens through accumulative texture: each bell-stroke makes silence heavier, sleep more seductive; the aurora walk is the visible price (minutes of mortal risk), and the tightening is the hush learning to “carry courage and doubt without breaking,” foreclosing the option to return empty-handed.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as the political necessity of un-quantifiable awe; subtext lives in synesthetic translation (color = breath), the fossil moth-shadow spelling “courage,” and the final statue’s “unafraid gaze” that silently argues before any council ledger—no overt thesis, but the closing harbor of hush reweights civic value itself.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Voice is irreducibly particular: “prism-song bell ringer,” “fossil of song written by trapped sunsets,” syntax that breathes in frost-pauses; perceptual signature remains synesthetic, compressed, aurora-tilted; no head-hop, no register drift; elliptical grammar (“tone went rose, then rain”) is pattern-taught early and paid off in closure cadence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>High lyric density serves information twin-load (sensorium + concept) without paraphrase loops; metaphors are coherent (prisms like minnows, hush as foal), rhythm modulates from long inhalations to the hinge-clause “Her chisel kissed marble as my bell kissed ice”; only hairline slip—“learning how to enter stone” borders on workshop idiom—keeps from 9.0+.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>Risk fusion of aurora-bell-chisel synesthesia is non-obvious and sustained; wonder-as-civic-proof reframed through paleontological music sheet and silence-as-bridge feels inevitable only in hindsight; no trope recycling, no prompt echo; bold lyric accumulation carries stakes without gimmickry, yielding fresh inflection on both art-making and bureaucracy of awe.</comment>
