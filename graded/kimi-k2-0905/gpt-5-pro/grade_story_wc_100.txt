<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The undertaker’s grief-fatigue (“grief runs me the way water wears a channel”) is viscerally embodied; his stubbornness is not asserted but performed in the dive and the ledger work. Interior contradiction is present—shame at being the scatterer of signals—yet the final self-assignment of addresses feels slightly sudden; the causal bridge from shame to naming could be one beat sharper.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: he surfaces with a mended lens and a reciprocal address written in water/stone, the conceptual cost unmistakable. Under Accumulative lens the pattern of stillness → tapping → cataloguing → second stillness is taught early and tightens via re-shelving; no causality breaks. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 3 and the underwater drawer is sketched with spatial coherence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Body-as-setting (teeth as Morse board), tool-as-setting (lens-as-prism) and the marble stacks all constrain tactics; the final lens above the door recharges the opening “chased stillness.” Sensory economy is ruthless—salt-stained rags, plankton alphabet—yet never stalls momentum. Micro-setting passes the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—give rest an address—signals early and deepens when the drowned messages ricochet because of his own lens; protagonist agency drives every escalatory step (hiring skiff, wedging into seam, stamping ledger). Cost is visible: he trades breath for brine and accepts the city’s counter-address. One meaningful tightening suffices; no reversal is required under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the inversion of undertaker-as-shelver to undertaker-as-shelved; the final image of the lens above his door reweights “rest” from noun to reciprocity without moralizing. Subtext lives in the silence after Morse stops: who needs whom now. No thematic echo violations; no final-paragraph thesis states.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is a sustained maritime elegy—syntax lengthens and compresses like tide (e.g., “the sea grows patient and heavy, like an old librarian who has waited decades to speak”). Perceptual signature is consistent: coffin-maker’s eye sees “plot under grass with a marker that says, Here, stop.” No head-hopping; diction stays within undertaker’s lexicon; no filter-verb stacks.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm is organic; sentence openings vary, paragraph cuts tight. Figurative density is high but patterned—velvet, drawer, librarian—each re-cast to serve pressure, never purple. One scaffold loop: “chased stillness” appears twice in adjacent lines; minor −0.2. No metaphor muddle at closure; information density routinely doubles (e.g., “rings that learned the circular grammar of waves”).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Premise fuses undertaker, underwater library, and lighthouse lens—an un-obvious triad made inevitable through grief-logic. Risk distinction awarded (+0.3) for literalizing “catalog of the drowned” without collapsing into whimsy. Transformation test: swap lens for compass and the entire moral geometry collapses. No close echoes of famous scenes.</comment>
