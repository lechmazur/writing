<comment>The narrator’s claustrophobia and “prudently adventurous” contradiction are embodied in every beat—shallow breaths, ladder-counting, the lungs “taking careful, measured sips.” The compass-point gift and grandmother’s memory tether interiority to concrete stakes; the final choice to lift the compass and prick the air crystallizes the hierarchy of values (heritage over cartographic control) with visible cost. Missing only a touch more self-contradiction under peak stress to reach 9-band.

<comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the seam opens, the satchel is retrieved, the city “rehearsed its rebellion” while the narrator carries the nail-key away—an earned stasis that forecloses the path of domination. Causal chain holds: grandmother’s compass → organ note → spatial hesitation → prick → seam → key. Cost is legible in the final image (“the nail in my pocket warmed”) and the conditional promise that pressures future action. Lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern taught early and deepened by cadence shift at the final chord.

<comment>The church loft, rose window, and fog-exhaling square function as micro-setting that constrains every move—ladder rungs creak, pipes stand “like silver birches,” the vault presses “like a hand on a mouth.” The compass point and nail-key are tactile objects whose evolving states (cold star → warmed cloth) charge the final image. Spatial choreography is immaculate; no impossible positions or white-room gaps. One of the rare 600-word pieces where environment, tool, and body jointly dictate tactics.

<comment>Dominant stake—recover the key without re-enslaving the city—tightens when the organ note risks “bruising” the mutiny. The single deepening (lifting veil vs. leaving city free) forecloses the cartographer’s impulse to bind, paid by the conditional promise “I would not bind it.” Cost is felt in the warming nail and the narrator’s acceptance of perpetual negotiation. Agency is clean: every escalation stems from the protagonist’s micro-choices under spatial pressure.

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as the ethics of mapping: possession versus listening. Subtext lives in silence—the groom lost to echo, the organ’s “hum to itself,” the city’s “sly waltz” resuming—rather than didactic statement. Final image of bent narrator touching stone offers a non-moral answer: cartography as covenant, not conquest. No late thematic echo or moralizing paragraph; resonance is built from concrete particulars.

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric-accumulative, taught in the opening clause “breathing shallow as the town slept” and held through cadence of comma-spliced perceptions. Perceptual signature is claustrophilic—attention narrows to “candle ash and wet stone,” “lungs took careful, measured sips.” No head-hop; interiority stays strictly bound to the compass-bearing narrator. Rhythm modulates with stress: short spondaic bursts (“I pressed another key”) give way to elongated sentence that lets the seam hover.

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero scaffold loops; each sentence advances image or pressure. Metaphors are disciplined—“pipes stood like silver birches” grounds visual analog without mixed logic. Information density high: one sentence slips ancestry, tool, temperature, memory. Clause variation and paragraph breathers match organ swell and release. No overwriting in peak beat; the prick is a monosyllabic release after textured buildup.

<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>The “spatial mutiny” premise is non-obvious and pursued to conceptual limit: city as sentient grid that sings itself loose. Compass-point-as-key and nail-as-coordinate invert cartographic tropes without expositional dump. Risky lyric structure pays off in closure image that reweights all prior metaphors. Transformation test fails—story collapses if “nail-key” or “organ transfixion” is swapped for generic analogues.
