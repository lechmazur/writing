<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is sharp—"miracles make me itch"—and micro-choices (stepping into the stillpoint, holding the diamond) are embodied and costly. Motivation stays consistent: truth-excavator vs. Klay’s stone-clutching faith. The final renunciation—naming the engineered stillpoint yet agreeing to omit names—pays off earlier causality with visible social cost. Minor slip: Klay’s psychology is sketched more than dramatized, capping at 8.8.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a crisp Conceptual Repricing: the orchard’s “miracle” is re-priced as radioactive dust-trap, the diamond as truth-tuning fork, the narrator’s silence as complicity. Causal chain holds: shredded letters → reveal Stillwater → explain stillpoint → choice to publish partial truth. Cost is on-page: “I would write what was there… leave the names out” carries professional and moral price. Lens (Causal) never wavers.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dust that “blew red and bright,” leaves like “polished armor,” and the scarecrow’s welded rebar create tactile, POV-filtered specificity. The stillpoint itself functions as micro-setting that constrains the final choice—without its vacuum-quiet the diamond’s song would not re-tune the narrator’s compass. Spatial choreography is clean across the grove, shack, scarecrow. One minor over-description cluster (“dust fell straight down as if on strings”) keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—truth vs. comforting lie—tightens when the narrator physically holds the diamond and feels his blood slow, foreclosing the option to keep believing the miracle. Escalation is single but decisive: entering stillpoint → reading shredded truth → silence pact. Price is felt: professional integrity is compromised in real time. No secondary reversal, but one meaningful tightening is sufficient at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulates: dust, diamond flaw, shredded paper—each reweights “comfortable lies.” Final image of agreed-upon omission gives resonant, non-moral answer to the truth vs. myth question. No explicit sermon; complexity lingers. Earned wisdom: “noise makes your compass listen to the wrong song.”</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>First-person voice is steel-edged, scientifically compressed: “I try to excavate truth from comfortable lies.” Metaphor density is high but patterned (armor, heating stone, cataract star) and paid off in closure. No head-hopping; perceptual signature stays consistent. Minor register drift toward thesaurus flourish (“milky eye ran through it, like a cataract catching a star”) keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Rhythm modulates with pressure—long sentences outside stillpoint, staccato revelations inside. Information density strong: one sentence can deliver setting, backstory, and thematic cue (“Stillwater billed it as a kindness…”). No loops, one near-mixed metaphor (“dust on strings”). Closure line “leave the names out” is clean and propulsive.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fusion of nuclear-remediation start-up, wind-harp diamond, and stillpoint orchard feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Risk: turning a orchard into a radioactive dust-net could read gimmick, but grounded in shredded corporate letters and embodied cost. Transformation test passes—swap any detail and the emotional physics collapse. Fresh inflection: the curse is actually sonic north-correction.</comment>
