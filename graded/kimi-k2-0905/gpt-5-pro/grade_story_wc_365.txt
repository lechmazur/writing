<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The sensory-map-maker POV is vividly embodied—every beat filters through taste, scent, vibration—creating a credible perceptual signature. Interior contradiction is present: the narrator both craves truth and fears its gravitational drag, acted out in the choice to swallow the sea-glass taste and carry the voices outward. The cost is felt: “the pull in my teeth” and the final renunciation of hoarding weight. Micro-choices (tapping shard, climbing gantry, attuning breath) tighten the arc; no secondary character on page, so relationship bullets waived. Flaw: late label “bridges do not hoard weight” slightly over-articulates what the body has already shown, keeping it from 8.8.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the withheld truth is released, weight redistributed across universes, narrator’s role redefined. Causal linkage holds: shard→chime→log→voices released; each step because/therefore. Orientation anchored by line 5 (“abandoned spaceport repair bay”) and continually re-anchored through sensory cues. One meaningful tightening at crate-opening beat narrows options from secrecy to exposure. Cost is legible: narrator’s body becomes corridor, throat raw with foreign rain. Minor waver: “I know now the origin of my cycles” explains rather than dramatizes the epiphany, a hairline slip keeping it sub-9.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setting is micro-scaled yet omnipresent: cracked concrete, rusted gantry, coolant puddle become extensions of the narrator’s sensory kit. The green glass shard functions as mobile setting-object; its temperature and hum constrain every tactical choice. Spatial choreography is immaculate—tap, climb, wedge, swallow—each motion maps onto tactile surfaces. Final image of shard left “a bead in the loom” shows environment altered by action, steadying futures. Atmosphere of deferred intentions brewed from mint-and-burned-dust coolant remains consistent across parallel overlays. Gate met: environment charges final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—liberate withheld voices—signaled in paragraph 6 and escalates through three sensory-tuned approaches to the crate. Pressure tightens when narrator must match breath to sealed hinges, foreclosing retreat; failure would perpetuate orbital shrinkage of lives. Cost is paid on-page: body becomes conduit, throat transient corridor, shard dims. Agency is interior yet decisive; no external antagonist required. Escalation is accumulative/textural: density of voices layered onto taste and light until silence fractures. Slight reserve: escalation is steady rather than spiked, keeping it shy of 8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: weight of silenced refugees’ voices versus collective capacity to bear it. Motif of “routes braid like threads” accretes meaning—first as cartography, finally as redistribution of trauma. Final reweighting redefines map-maker from secret-keeper to channel; no moral preached. Subtext resides in gesture (throat as corridor) rather than assertion. Complexity acknowledged: supervisors believed silence was kindness; narrator does not forgive, only redirects. Resonance lingers in aftertaste of sea glass and cold iron. Avoids thematic echo penalty.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric, compressed, taught by second sentence (“engines still whisper behind my eyelids”) and paid off in final “murmur returns.” Syntax fragments and enjambment mirror cycle-breath rhythm without losing clarity. Perceptual signature is relentless: every noun carries a taste or vibration, creating an idiosyncratic filter. No head-hopping; POV distance stays interior-close. Register remains within plausible lexicon of sensory prodigy. Stress scenes shorten diction (“I swallow it”) while maintaining coherence. Distinct without purple drift; risk heightens meaning.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>High information density: single sentences deliver sensory data, spatial cue, and emotional charge (“shard refracts a thin beam from nowhere”). Metaphors stay physically coherent—threads, braids, looms extend textile motif without muddle. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances. Rhythm modulates: long breathy accumulations build to staccato beats (“I tap… I climb… I swallow”). Minor filter-verb clusters (“I feel,” “I taste”) are voice-motivated, not scaffolding. Closure line “let the breath tip me outward” is clean, propulsive. One typo-free read-aloud pass.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses migration-crisis SF with synesthetic cartography—fresh synthesis. Parallel-universe mechanic is not gimmick; it literalizes ethical choice across possible selves. Green-shard-as-prism refigures trauma lens, inevitable in hindsight. Risk: narrator consents to body-as-bridge, embracing erasure of private identity for public dispersal—bold, unsentimental. Specific detail (coolant=mint+burned dust) anchors novelty in lived texture. If stripped to new names, arc collapses—proof of irreplaceable core. Within-band +0.3 for structural risk that sharpens closure.</comment>
