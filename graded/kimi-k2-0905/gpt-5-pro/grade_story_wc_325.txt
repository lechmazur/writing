<comment>Ivo’s claustrophobia, electroscope ritual, and naming of the lost are concrete, embodied choices that reveal hierarchy of values under pressure; the final renunciation—to leave without extracting the data—earns its cost through prior tenderness and fear. Interior contradiction flickers (“fear now lined itself up behind duty”) but stays credible. No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible waived; micro-choices alone carry the arc.</comment>

<comment>Accumulative-textural lens holds: tidal cadence, cable hum, and electroscope flicker build density toward the charged poise of “Return” whispered as water rises. Closure is the crystallized instant where vigil outweighs extraction; cost is the foregone rescue of data. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land by line 5; pattern of breathing caves teaches the tidal rule early and pays off in final image. No causality breaks; ellipsis of how files awaken is allowed under lyric design.</comment>

<comment>The littoral cave, copper housings, and gold-fleck electroscope function as micro-setting that directly constrains every beat: tide governs entry, temperature shift revives circuits, mica square frames the final quiver. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven—air tastes of kelp and copper, cables “croon” interference—never catalog. Spatial choreography is clean: console, bench, mugs, doorway track without drift. Final image of vigil “riding the sheath” recharges the undersea cable motif, locking setting to theme.</comment>

<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—vigil for the erased—signals early and tightens as tide clock ticks; each canned-cold warming cycle is a micro-act that narrows the option to linger. Escalation is accumulative: rising water → reviving signal → naming the lost → choosing to leave; cost is the unrescued archive. No external antagonist; pressure is mineral time. The final foreclosed path (exit without download) is visible and felt.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of remembrance versus erasure emerges through the electroscope’s quiver and the unprinted index—no thesis statement needed. Subtext lives in silence: boiled snowmelt offered to absent colleagues, laughter encoded in clicks. Final image of vigil “riding the sheath” reweights all prior cable imagery into quiet indictment of institutional forgetting. Ambiguity lingers: will the sea allow memory next time? Complexity embraced, no moral pressed.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>First-person voice sustains a compressed, tidal syntax—“crashing hush,” “secret tongue”—that mirrors Ivo’s breath-counting claustrophobia. Perceptual signature is scientist-poet: whale-song jargon braided with synesthetic metaphor. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk zero. Psychic distance holds tight; “the surf beat its crashing hush” externalizes interior calm. Rhythm accelerates into final shard then exhales, matching water rise.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Sentence variety is high; no template cadence or paraphrase loops detected. Metaphors stay coherent—cables as veins, cave as lung—without overstuffed density. Information density strong: one line can do sensory + tool + memory (“copper housings… remembered”). Minor −0.3 for two adjacent “he” openers mid-revive sequence; otherwise propulsion clean.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: claustrophobic spelunker + obsolete electroscope + tidal archive heist-without-theft. Risk of lyric accumulative structure pays off in charged poise ending. Specificity of “codex margin illuminant gold fleck” and “solder by smell” prevents swap-out test failure. Conceptual integrity commits fully to drowned-data premise without retreat. Not earth-shatteringly novel, but angle is non-obvious and executed with conviction.</comment>
