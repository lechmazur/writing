<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Lio’s interiority stays anchored in tactile ritual—cradling the vine “like a luthier holds a bow”—and every micro-choice (selecting the tendril, singing in tree-grammar) is traceable to his tinkerer-trait. The final laugh-and-lie-down is a credible renunciation that costs him the spotlight, paying the visible price of exhaustion. No contradictory impulses are dramatized on-page, so the arc stops just short of the 9-band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens is taught by the second paragraph (moonlight “drawing out nerves…into glyphs”) and held to the final image of “breakfast steam rose.” Closure is a Charged Poise: the arbor’s single shiver reconfigures the village’s stance toward daily covenant, and Lio’s prone body is the felt cost. Everything aligns inside the 120-word orientation window; no causality gaps.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The arbor is not backdrop but instrument: dew-catchers, sap stir, and branch-spokes physically constrain how Lio strings the bells and how the villagers rotate the shadow wheel. Micro-setting (vine tendril as bow, copper coil as luthier wire) directly shapes the culminating knot. Sensory economy favors touch and sound over visual plenty, keeping the world rules consistent. The final image of steam rising “light by light” recharges every prior surface.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—restore sacred covenant—is signaled in paragraph four and tightens when the vow “snagged like a burr.” The meaningful turn is the collective pivot of the shadow wheel; it narrows options to speak the vow in the correct alignment, paid for by Lio’s emptied posture. Pressure accumulates through sensory density rather than external antagonist, satisfying the Accumulative lens. Could edge higher if the price were sharpened beyond fatigue.</comment>
<question>5</question><<grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the reversal of human-tool relations: the arbor becomes the active singer, villagers the responsive instrument. No character states the moral; instead, breakfast steam and birds “stitching words” offer a non-literal answer that reweights prior chimes and pollen. Sacred practice is shown as daily habit, not creed, avoiding sermon. The final “why we meet here” is embedded in Lio’s gift of a star-knot, keeping subtext in gesture.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric achieves a perceptual signature steeped in vegetal grammar—“sap rose to consider”—without violating POV knowledge. Sentence rhythm mirrors ritual cadence: long anaphora for incantation, clipped fragments at the shiver moment. No dialogue, so voice distinction is judged solely through narrative texture, which remains singular. Compression like “moon sank a finger width” teaches the pattern early and pays off in final dip.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>Lines are multivalent: “dew stitched silver” does image work while foreshadowing the later sewing of sound. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances setting, metaphor, or beat. Figurative logic stays internally consistent—moonlight as reader of glyphs, spindle as oldest limb—without muddling causality. Opening and closing sentences read aloud with natural variation, no template cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The inversion of instrument and player (arbor sings, humans are strings) is a fresh inflection on eco-fantasy. Risk is taken by eschewing conflict-driven plot for accumulative ritual, yet closure remains legible. Specificity of copper coil, orchard limb, and tree-grammar prevents swap-out with any generic grove. The synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight: moon as tuner, dew as notation, village as chorus.</comment>
