<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>The archivist’s reflexive self-erasure and hunger to “teach the hinge to others” is felt in every micro-choice (walking backwards, spoken annotations). Interiority stays concrete, never drifts into label-speak, and the renunciation at the end—holding still while others walk free—carries visible cost. Status shift with the girl is cleanly tracked: pity → alliance → gratitude, all through shared action. Only lack of a second contradiction keeps it from 8+.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the library’s hinge-glyph physically opens, brother steps out, archivist’s own exile is proven still locked. Causality holds under the Accumulative/Textural lens: tea-leaf geometry → hinge glyph → annotation → release, each beat thickens pattern rather than forcing plot turns. Cost is unmistakable in the final sentence—“my turn arrived” denied. Orientation clear by word 60.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Forgotten library operates as micro-setting: dust turns to glittering script, lectern becomes hinge, mirror shard reorients space. Every sensory detail is filtered through archivist’s archival gaze—air “preferring to be archived.” The empty swing outside is audible through walls, tightening the clock. Environment directly constrains the final choice: the aisle opens only when hush is allowed in.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—reversibility of exile—tightens once via hinge-glyph revelation, cost paid by archivist who enables release but remains locked. Escalation is density-driven: each annotation and tea-leaf pattern adds weight until the swing-hush triggers aperture. Agency remains with archivist; girl’s plea complicates but does not resolve. No coincidence; every beat is earned by handling of glass, tea, mirror.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: mercy as combat, tenderness as weapon, archives as living tissue. Subtext lives in gestures—girl’s shrug, brother’s cough, archivist’s folded hands. Final image reweights earlier metaphors: the corridor that “forgets you” is now watched from inside by its keeper. No moralizing, only charged poise that invites reflection on who gets to walk both ways.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is crystalline, compressed, rhythmically controlled—“slivers of sight like spiteful petals” teaches the lyrical pattern early. Perceptual signature never slips: every noun is archivist-tagged, every verb an archival act (shelved, labeled, annotated). Syntax tightens under pressure: clauses shorten during hinge-moment. No head-hopping; girl’s interiority surfaced only through archivist’s sensory read.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Near-zero scaffold; sentences carry double duty—description + concept, action + symbol. Metaphors stay internally coherent (shadow as cat, tea as handwriting). Two adjacent “then” sequences appear but cadence is purposeful, mirroring methodical archival process. No loops dull the closure image; final line is clean, propulsive, undiluted.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses mirror-shard archiving with reversible exile, a synthesis not seen in slush. Risk-taking—lyric accumulative structure, glyph-based magic—heightens meaning without obscuring causality. Specificity of method (tea-leaf geometry, charcoal annotation) makes the frame unforgettable. Transformation test fails if names changed: only this archivist teaches hinges with mirror slivers.</comment>
