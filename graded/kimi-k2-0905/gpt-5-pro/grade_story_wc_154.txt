<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The translator’s interiority is relentlessly concrete—coral ridges as memory, scarf as tourniquet—each micro-choice (photographing then folding phrases) reveals a hierarchy of values. Sifa stays mostly asleep, so relationship pressure is off-loaded onto the waiting triangle; the narrator’s grafted consent still carries visible cost when the coral’s map is recognized. No therapy-speak, only embodied ache; the refusal to speak “everything” is an earned renunciation that forecloses heroic transparency. Character voice never flattens into archetype; the occupational lens filters every noticed detail.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the boy’s lip-corner lift confirms the tactic worked, reconfiguring stakes for all parties without a shouted victory. Causality holds because the decrypting labor (mid-scene beat) directly enables the sunrise hand-off plan; the coral show-and-tell seals consent. Cost is legible in “I do not say everything” and the scarf sacrificed to steady plaster—translator’s purity of voice is the price. Lens stays situational: pressure is coherent social triangle, not external explosions.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mist-clad atrium and salt-breathing windows function as micro-setting: moisture blurs ink and dictates how messages must be copied before they dissolve. The coral fragment and plaster cast literally constrain hand movement and reading angle, steering the decryption tactic. Spatial choreography is immaculate—bodies shift into triangle, coral passed on diagonal. Weather is not backdrop but deadline: dawn tide will expose jetty, forcing sunrise decision.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“carry consent without lighting new fires”—is signaled in paragraph four and tightens when each decoded line forecloses a possible weaponization by either family.translator’s decision to withhold full truth is the single meaningful turn that narrows options and buys mercy. Price is explicit: personal vow of selective silence, plus physical proxy cost of scarf. No coincidence; escalation is purely negotiative pressure under situational lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges as translation itself—every act of mediation scars and heals simultaneously. Subtext lives in the bent proverb: each side hears maternal voice, proving language can multitask without preachy meta. No final moral, only the image of coral passed hand-to-hand, repricing “map” as covenant rather than territory. Emotional aftereffect is quiet ache that lingers because the translator’s purity is permanently compromised.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>First-person voice owns a distinct perceptual signature: medical-poetic diction (“tidepool breath,” “labyrinthine atlas”) yet never leaves translator’s professional bias. Rhythm modulates—long breathy sentences under sedation hush, then tighten into clipped report to families. No head-hopping; even Sifa’s grin is surface-read. Filter verbs are voice-motivated (“I realize”) and culminate in micro-choice. Compression like “lotus-hearted ache” is taught early and repaid at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lyric density is high but patterned—metaphors return as tools (coral = map = seal) so figurative layering earns its place. No mixed metaphors; fog stitching to palms to metronomes stays within atmospheric register. Scaffolding nearly absent; only one paraphrase loop (“shared anxieties” echoed) but it accrues thematic weight. Opening and closing lines are ear-tested, propulsive. Register never drifts above POV’s plausible lexicon.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Fresh angle: story reframes wartime negotiation through tactile cryptography of a child’s cast—object usually ignored. Coral-as-atlas is not quirky ornament but functional cipher key. Risk of quiet, asleep child protagonist pays off by making translator sole agent. Synthesis feels inevitable: decoding medical plaster becomes literal peace-building. No close echoes; avoids stock “war-zone interpreter” tropes by keeping gunfire offstage.</comment>
