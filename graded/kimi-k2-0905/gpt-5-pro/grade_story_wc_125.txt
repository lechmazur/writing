<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The poet’s yearning to “discover the texture of time” and his tender stewardship of the rope anchor interior contradiction and embodied emotion; the rope’s twin memories (flight v. betrayal) braid through micro-choices, and the final refusal to relinquish the mapped knots costs him his visual compass while gifting the escapee release—a renunciation that is credibly earned and felt.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>A Causal-Accumulative hybrid lens holds: each “uncovering” action (rope → mural → poet’s ear) tightens the moral/artistic trade-off until the poem-for-second swap reweights both stakes; closure lands with visible cost—the poet gives up his mapped knowledge and departs “blind” yet salt-rich—satisfying the Decisive Change with undeniable price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The terra-cotta grotto, starlight geometry, and breathing cliffs are vividly selective, POV-colored, and tactile; the mural-whale and rope micro-setting constrain every tactic and charge the final image as repository and witness, cleanly qualifying for 9+ environment-to-choice gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—map/poem vs. annulment of the “second” of imprisonment—tightens once via the visitors’ offer; poet’s refusal to trade the whole braid forces a creative counter-offer that materially narrows his future options and costs him navigational certainty, fulfilling meaningful escalation under the lens.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Time-as-texture emerges through tangible acts (rope-knot calendar, clay whale ribs) rather than slogans; the ending crystallizes theme by letting layered artifacts keep witness without moralizing, achieving a resonant Conceptual Repricing that re-weights patience/art over erasure.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The drifting poet’s diction is lyric yet grounded (“ear for tender static,” “starpit overhead”); rhythmic variation mirrors emotional tides, no head-hopping, purposeful compression taught early and paid off in closure; voice stays singular, idiosyncratic, and read-aloud musical.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Lines are dense, propulsive, and loop-free; figurative language is selective (“the sea rehearsing its sleep”); no mixed metaphors; sentence cadence modulates with scene breath, and high information ratio advances image or choice with every clause; minor hairline repetition of “breathe/breathing” does not obscure clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of cosmic visitors, knot-map time, and clay-whale witness feels fresh; the poet’s refusal to hand over his art for a clean erasure of trauma offers a non-obvious moral calculus; risk-taking structure holds coherence, and specific idiom (“bright fatigue”) prevents swappability.</comment>
