<comment>Issa’s interior contradiction—mourner and avenger—drives every beat; the prick-and-feed ritual is a concrete micro-choice that externalizes guilt. The final renunciation (using the seed to eat the binding she once cast) is causally earned and visibly costly, satisfying the 9+ quick test. Only the slight distancing phrase “warlike serenity” keeps her from full 9-band embodiment under peak pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the orchard’s spin stalls, the lake’s blank reflection reweights the premise—mirrors now show nothing, freeing Issa from the teacher’s lie. Cost is unmistakable: her blood feeds the seed, the seed eats her own binding, foreclosing the old identity. Causal lattice holds throughout (“because the trick failed, she remembered; because she remembered, she returned”). One shard, one continuous scene, no orientation debt; lens is Accumulative/Textural, pattern taught by line-level cadence and paid off in the final blank sky.</comment>

<comment>The swirling orchard vortex is not backdrop but antagonist: its rotation physically constrains Issa’s ritual steps and must be un-bent for progress. The flesh-eating seed acts as micro-setting/tool hybrid, its sieve-mouth determining how gently the ice can be breached. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true—she notices root-shivers, apple-bumps, the hush knit like armor—never touristic. Only the absence of a single weather or body-detail in the final image keeps it from 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—truth vs mirrored deception—is signaled in line 1 and tightens when the seed’s appetite forces her to pay blood for clarity. The orchard’s slowing spin is the decisive deepening that reweights options: paths to shore open only after she feeds the seed her own binding. Cost is legible on-page: blood, the seed’s bite, and the permanent erasure of Master Ren’s glamour. No reversal overload; one meaningful cadence shift suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: reflection = erasure, blankness = agency. The final image of a lake that “reflects nothing but winter sky” conceptually reprices the whole premise—mirrors now expose the inner room rather than external face. Subtext operates in gesture: seed eating the knot she tied years earlier dramatizes self-forgiveness as self-cannibalism. No moralizing line; resonance is purely imagistic, lingering and ambiguous in the clean ache described.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is compressed, war-drum cadence—“unbend,” “loosening its fists,” “apples bump the shore like helmets”—syntax mirrors tactical mind. Diction stays within druidic lexicon; no academic register drift. Patterned elision (“through expanding circles”) is taught early and paid off in the final outward ring of paths. Only two near-echoes of “knits a hush like armor” / “honed, an old warlike serenity” keep it from perfect 10; still earns 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>High information density: each sentence advances image or tactic—“seed unfurls a mouth of tiny sieves” does object-work and action-work simultaneously. No scaffold loops; metaphors stay coherent (armor/hush, helmets/apples). Rhythm accelerates with parataxis during unbinding, then breathes into longer cadence for the blank-sky closure. Minor filter verbs (“she senses”) are voice-motivated and sparse; no artifact touches the final beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Frozen confession inside orbiting drowned trees is a fresh synthesis of fairy-tale and eco-horror; the seed that eats spells rather than ice is a specific, non-obvious tool. Risk—lyric repetition of “unbend” and mirrored blankness—pays off by reconfiguring meaning rather than feeling gimmicky. Transformation test fails if Issa is swapped with generic quester: her particular guilt-tutor relationship is irreplaceable. Concept commits fully; no retreat into safe moral balance.</comment>
