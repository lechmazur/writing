<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Aurel’s calm exterior vs. the “hive of second thoughts” gives a credible fault-line; the apology without poetry and the decision to cede the stick to the audience show a micro-choice that costs him control. The interior contradiction is concrete, but the troupe partners remain slightly sketched—Miri’s nod and Ferro’s neck-scratch are the only embodied tells—so the relational crucible never fully ignites under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: the dome’s hush, the stick’s scars, and the mirrored “Listen” accrue until the final bar corner re-weights the stake. Closure is a Charged Poise: the trio sit in “easy quiet,” the cost being the permanent relinquishment of authorial dictatorship. Causality holds; no orientation debt—the dome, moth, and stick are anchored within the first 120 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The decommissioned dome functions as both skullcap and auditorium, its curvature literally steering echoes and metaphorically steering conscience. The campfire stick’s charred tally-notches are micro-setting that constrains who may speak next. Sensory economy is disciplined—rain as “distant pencil scratches,” moth as “soft percussion”—and these images recur to charge the final quiet.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake: who owns the moral right to steer a story’s harm. The meaningful tightening arrives when Aurel inks the mirrored “Listen,” then offers the stick to strangers—this act forecloses his sole authorship. Cost is legible: he must swallow “unpoetic” apology and risk the troupe’s permanent fracture. Pressure stays internal and ethical rather than externalized, sufficient for this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the stick’s passage: authority dissolves into shared custody of narrative harm. The mirrored word, the moth tapping for a “different ending,” and the puppet’s dignified bow reconfigure ethics without a stated moral. Subtext resides in silence—Aurel’s apology is plain-type, Ferro speaks to the moth, not the humans—creating lingering ambiguity about whether real power has shifted or merely been re-badged.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person hovers at a lyric distance that still filters through Aurel’s calligrapher eye—ink, vellum, reverse-script. Syntax flexes with pressure: longer reflective sentences collapse into abrupt reportage (“He said the show had forgotten…”). No head-hopping; Miri and Ferro remain externally observed, preserving focal integrity. The rhythmic control of “meteor hush” and “easy quiet” gives the voice a signature pulse.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High information density: one sentence often does three jobs—“the stick felt heavier than wood” = tactile, metaphorical, moral weight. Figurative language is selective, never stacked in high-pressure beats. Minor scaffold: “the dome curved overhead like a skullcap” is the single overt simile and it earns its place. Cadence modulates from languid to staccato as the bar scene accelerates, propulsion intact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The puppet-parable inside a radar dome is fresh, but the core trope—artist learns to cede control—leans familiar. Freshness arrives in specifics: the mirrored palindrome “Listen,” the stick whose charred notches are literally past audiences, the moth negotiating the window. These particulars transform a generic humility tale into an embodied ethics lab. Risk is moderate; the concept commits fully without retreat.</comment>
