<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Pianist’s ache is embodied in the bench-wobble and reel-hand splice; interior contradiction (pride vs. longing) is active in-scene when he files the minute hand into the projector. The four broken-clock beats visibly foreclose his old refusal to forgive, earning the final winding. Missing higher band because Mara’s post-corridor interiority is summarized, not simultaneously contradicted.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the arbor-path re-opens, Mara steps into color, and the four broken-clock ticks audibly reweight time. Causal chain (clock-hand → reel → corridor → bench) holds; minute hand as metronome is the persistent constraint. Deduction for轻微 lens drift: the tidal arbor’s physics is accumulative/lyric, yet the final beat asks to be read as causal restitution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Station, salt-bleached bench, and flickering compass-fans are tactile, lived-in, and constrain every choice (he can’t leave the platform without facing the film gate). The arbor’s inverted surf-boughs supply the final image that recharges “tide echo in a shell vault.” Micro-setting (clock face split into “twelve uncertain countries”) is irreplaceable.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can he re-tune the hour of Mara’s absence—tightens when the minute hand vibrates the bench and the corridor ghosts approach. Price is legible: the arbor “leans” and later dissolves, implying the path will close again. Would enter 8.8+ if the text named what is forfeited (future access? stamina?).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of time as improvisable music emerges via the splice, the vibrating grain, and the unplanned encore—never sermonized. Final image of surf-learning-to-speak-in-cinders reweights prior black-and-white frames without moral. The refrain “darkness signs the staff” threads through three beats, shifting from dread to shared night-score.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>First-person lyric voice owns a percussionist’s rhythm: “stall and suck of tides,” “timetable we no longer had to read.” Compression (“I am not fool enough to crush causality under song”) teaches the pattern early and pays off in the arbor. No head-hopping; perceptual signature stays piano-tuned to absences and thirds.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Sentences do triple duty (image + motion + emotional algebra) without purple drift. Varied cadence accelerates into corridor reveal, then exhales on the bench. One mixed-metaphor spike—“compasses lay down like tired swallows”—momentarily muddles physical logic, but closure image remains clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fusing a station pianist with a film-reel corridor that blooms into an inverted surf-arbor is a fresh synthesis; the minute-hand-metronome is an indelible prop. Risk in second-person address to Mara is avoided; instead, the arbor itself becomes the concert hall. Transformation test: swap any element and the entire score collapses.</comment>
