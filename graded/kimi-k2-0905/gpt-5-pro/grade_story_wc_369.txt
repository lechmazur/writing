<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The lone protagonist’s motive—wanting to learn what trees witness—remains singular, tender, and credibly obsessive; each micro-choice (scooping dream-dust, trading a twig for the pin) embodies this interior hunger under accumulating poetic pressure. Interiority is richly embodied, never diagnostic: “I felt my hands repaired by the moon” shows, not tells. No contradictory impulse is staged in-scene, so the arc edges toward monochromatic; still, the refusal to declare a prophecy and the quiet exit with the twig constitute an earned renunciation whose cost (continuing anonymous custodial labor) is legible. The voice never slips into generic custodian cliché; the idiom is specific to this moon-struck, ledger-keeping dream-sweeper.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the narrator sets the sextant down, trades the pin for a twig, and the map “will hold”—a crystallized moment where options reconfigure without exposition. Causality is lyric, not mechanical: the sextant’s cracked mirror “clicks,” aligning sorrow-numbers with bark grain, a poetic therefore that tightens stakes under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is lyrically delayed but functional: “stormlit tower by moonlight” anchors place/weather in line 1; who/why surface within 40 words—well inside waiver. No prop or knowledge teleports; the ledger, sextant, and dream-dust recur with consistent physics.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The tower, forest canopy, and moon-polished parapet act as micro-setting that literally enables the climax: the sextant must touch sky and bark simultaneously to complete the sorrow-meter. Sensory hierarchy is POV-tuned: custodian notices flake-patterns, mop-scuffs, dream-dust “like mica” because his job is reading seams. Weather is causal: moonlight heals walls, stormlight hums the shell, both dictating when maintenance can map sorrow. Tool-as-setting (broken sextant) constrains the final alignment, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—can the maze’s sorrow be quantified and read back from the trees?—is signaled in paragraph 3 and deepens when dream-dust is matched to wall-scars. Escalation is textural: density of angles, scents, tear-edges accumulates until the sextant’s cracked lens finally “trembles” into alignment, narrowing options to this one alignment or failure. Cost is conceptual but felt: the放弃了 public recognition (no prophecy declared) and accepts perpetual custodial anonymity. Agency is interior—listening, aligning, trading—but it forces an irreversible stance crystallization.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from particulars: sorrow is not erased but metered, mapped, and returned to the trees as living archive. No character articulates a moral; the final note—“some work is finished simply by being carried to the light”—is image, not assertion. Subtext of custodial love versus scientific extraction glimmers in the twig-for-pin trade, reweighting quantification as gentle offering. Complexity lingers: the maze still aches, the worker still mops, but the data now breathes in bark.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>First-person lyric voice sustains a perceptual signature steeped in tactile maintenance detail: “patient stones,” “salt roads” of leaf-veins, “silver syllable” of the pin. Syntax flexes with pressure—fragments (“Quantities gathered…”) accelerate the alignment beat; longer clauses breathe during moon-roof vigil. No head-hopping; diction stays within a self-taught stargazing custodian’s reach (“astronomer’s broken sextant,” “bearing”). Rhythm modulates without drumbeat; cracked mirror / beaded curtain / interior weather metaphors cohere rather than clutter.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings rotate across participial, subject-verb, prepositional phrasing. Information density is high: single sentences fold tool, emotion, and world-rule (“Its mirrors spidered with cracks… still knew how to point”). Only micro-loop: “listened… listened” in adjacent sentences on roof; does not touch closure. Metaphors maintain physical logic—moonlight as tuning hum, trees as green radiographs—no mixed vehicle collisions. Clean grammar, tense stable, zero filter-verb clusters under pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fusion of custodial realism with量化 grief via salvaged nautical instrument feels non-obvious and inevitable in hindsight. Conceptual risk—lyric accumulation而非plot reversals—pays off in closure image. Transformation test fails if sextant/maze/trees swapped: specificity of sorrow-meter and arboreal witness is irreplaceable. Fresh inflection: maintenance log becomes love letter to arboreal memory. No template echo; voice owns its cosmology.</comment>
