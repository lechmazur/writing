<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The lucid-dream chronicler’s interiority is embodied and specific; the trembling hands, the scent of copper dawn on the telegram, the micro-choice to “whisper the names of the lost” all reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. The shared-burden theme is lived, not stated: Mara's shoulders lower, the narrator's ledger becomes a breathing lung, and the final vow to “carry the weight of water as a village” costs both their prior silences. Relationship shift is credible and scaled to length; no stock epiphanies or therapy-speak. Voice stays singular and textured; contradiction between healing vocation and personal grief is dramatized, not declared.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the dome hums “like a shell,” the daylily loosens its breath, and the radioed lines reweight every prior silence with undeniable social cost—“shared burdens…are the only kind that lift.” Causal chain holds: telegram → R-Lyrae timing → mural vow → radio release, each because/therefore step narrowing options until the final braiding of breath. Lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of star-pulses = stone syllables = grief breaths, intensified by each exposure cycle; no late ambiguity. Orientation clear by line 8; no caps triggered.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dome as “sleeping whale,” console dust deciding “where to land,” daylily edge “like a small star stuck in paper”—selective, POV-filtered, and purpose-built; every sensory detail is threaded through action (adjusting focus, copying glyphs, pressing flower into ledger). Micro-setting objects (telegram, ledger, monitor glow) constrain choices: the pressed petals dictate timing, the ledger’s scent cue memory, the altar inscription fixes the final vow. Spatial choreography clean; bodies track around telescope and console without drift. Environment mirrors internal state without overt symbolism—dome breathes as they begin to breathe together.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake early: decode inscriptions or remain silenced by grief. Escalation is rhythmic tightening—each star-pulse cycle forces a deeper alignment of glyphs, narrowing options until the only remaining move is to radio the lines outward. Cost is visceral: Mara's jaw unclenches, the narrator “lets go,” and the desert team’s cry through the speaker is the audible price of shared disclosure. Agency remains in each exposure, whisper, and algorithm rewrite; no off-stage resolution.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from pattern, not statement: star periodicity = breath = grief cycles; the final mural vow reframes “shared burdens” as communal hydrology, not heroics. Subtext lives in gesture—daylily pressed the day Orla vanished, now pressed again to scent the next crossing. No moralizing; the wall “declares” its vow, but the narrator lets the image stand. Emotional aftereffect is concrete: loosened petals, humming dome, braided breath—an earned door rather than a lesson.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Voice is lyric-scientific, textured by astronomical diction (“light curves,” “long period variable”) that still stays within a poet-chronicler’s lexicon. Rhythm modulates: longer breath-like sentences during exposures, staccato telegram lines for urgency. No head-hopping; single POV holds. Dialogue sparse but distinct—“When you lose the rhythm, listen to the body of your friend”—carries subtext without collapsing into prose-poem monotony. Compression taught early and paid off: “speak softly” returns as radio whisper.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High information density: one sentence often does three jobs (“We rewrote our algorithm so the timing weights matched grief, and the stone sentences started to sing back”). No synonym loops or template cadence; metaphor vehicles stay coherent (whale-dome, star-pulses-lungs). Read-aloud rhythm varied; paragraph cuts are purposeful. Only hairline slip: “stone remembering a lullaby” edges toward mixed metaphor, but the emotional logic is earned and does not blur closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fusion of lucid-dream chronicler with variable-star decryption is fresh; the premise “temple walls echo in periods” reweights both grief counseling and archaeo-astronomy. Daylily telegram as star-map cipher, grief as light-curve—specific synthesis, not gimmick. Risk in lyric accumulation pays off: the final image of loosened petals as pocket star feels inevitable yet non-obvious. No template echo; transformation test passes—swap any element and the entire emotional algebra collapses.</comment>
