<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Grief as physics: interiority stays meteorological, so panic never slips into therapy-speak. The flaw is absence of contradiction—once the method is chosen, no “what if I quit?” impulse surfaces to tension the litany. Still, micro-choices (knotting line to absence, lowering ribbon) visibly cost stamina and sanity, earning the late steadiness.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure (Charged Poise) crystallizes when the balloon steadies to “grateful for a new center” while narrator admits “I know you are already geography,” a conceptual price paid; the lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of cloud-categories and thread-knots thickens until meaning reframes. No orientation debt; sky-gondolas and star-grit are clear by line-30. One causal bump: altimeter/burner actions appear only after telescope sketch, but pattern teaches tools as extensions of gaze, so forgiven.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Gondola, telescope, notebook, graphite line, and “dusty starlight” function as micro-setting; each constrains gesture and charges the final steadiness. Vague town-lights below remain un-detailed, but airborne capsule’s creaks, burner cough, and fogged lens track spatially across every beat. Weather details (colder layers, ozone scent) alter tactic and body—exactly the 9+ gate requirement.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake: prove the atmosphere keeps record of the beloved; pressure tightens through cumulative cataloguing until final tether to “your wake.” Progression is density-based, not causal reversal, so escalation fits Accumulative lens. Price visible—chilled fingers, graphite tremor, admission of irrevocable loss—but could be sharper if one cloud-category failed or cost a physical resource.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from repeating taxonomy: naming emotions as clouds reweights grief into atmospheric custody, sidestepping sentimental “healing.” Final image—sky as loom / absence as yarn—non-literally answers the epistemic question without moral, satisfying 9+ test. No late thesis statement; only one decorative thematic echo (“spooled wholeness” mentioned twice) remains below penalty threshold.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lyrical first-person sustains controlled breath-length cadence; diction stays within meteorologist lexicon, never drifts academic. Telescope’s brass, “lanternfish” town, and “angrily patient” cumulonimbus exhibit idiosyncratic perception signature. Two predicate-stack sentences near midpoint create template cadence but pattern is taught early and paid off at closure, so minimal deduction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentences compress under burner-beat, lengthen during star-gazing. Metaphors (clouds as parenting hail) cohere; no mixed vehicles. Information density high; most lines handle action + atmosphere + taxonomy. Minor synonym churn: “dusty” stars, light, grit repeated 4× costs 0.3. No artifacts near closure, preserving 8-band eligibility.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fusion of meteorology manual with grief memoir yields fresh angle; cloud-emotion taxonomy feels inevitable, not gimmick. Specific detail—“negative monument” traced by carpenter pencil—prevents generic elegy. Risk of lyric catalogue is taken and paid off at loom-yarn reprise, meriting the upper-middle score.</comment>
