<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The narrator’s “gently meticulous” trait is enacted through the delicate handling of slides and the micro-choice to revise metadata to quiet a tremor—both carry felt cost. Interior contradiction is present: the desire to save every vow collides with the knowledge that some are already “halfway gone.” The final stance—continuing to measure while admitting uncertainty—is earned by the prior catalog of losses and the lone preserved wedding vow. The minus comes from the apprentices remaining indistinguishable stock observers; no secondary pressure is applied through them.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the last paragraph crystallizes the endless task under a “clean blank of survival,” reweighting the premise that even failure to save a vow is a form of shelter. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—each sampled frequency adds density until the final lattice of data becomes the library’s own vow. Cost is legible in the phrase “I do not know how long we can hold the passing back,” spoken after an on-page avalanche sigh. Orientation is taught early; spatial logic holds across the domed vault and atrium ice.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The frozen library is no backdrop; its “quartz hush” and frost-bitten ladders constrain every gesture—gloves smell of cedar and ice, the barometer is cracked, the dome flexes. The magic-lantern slide functions as micro-setting: its velvet hood and migrating constellations of light directly shape the decision to archive or farewell. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true—catalog cards curl “like tired tongues,” a tactile metaphor born of lifelong handling. Weather (avalanche sigh) and spatial choreography (lantern ribs, terrace of ice) evolve causally with each projection.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“keep the minutes of the dead”—is signaled in line 2. Escalation is accumulative: each sampled vow either survives the noise or fractures, narrowing the archivist’s options until only the “clean blank of survival” remains. The deepening occurs when the narrator revises metadata to include “conditions never spoken,” a micro-choice that forestalls collapse at visible labor cost. No reversal is needed; the lattice of saved/failed frequencies itself tightens the noose of responsibility.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges obliquely: memory is a shelf-life art, and every act of preservation is also an act of mourning. The luminous vows reweight from romantic ideal to data lattice—love becomes signal-to-noise ratio—without a moral finger wagging. Subtext lives in gesture: touching foreheads versus touching catalog cards, both marriages of a kind. Final image of “hexagons of data around the honey of each vow” offers non-literal resonance that lets the reader taste both sweetness and cold.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>First-person voice is crystalline, metrically controlled—“quiet as sleeping glass,” “hum-laughed,” “stubbornly bright”—a diction that could only belong to an archivist of frost. Perceptual signature is obsessive-taxonomic: breath is “sampled,” vows are “frequencies,” avalanches “sigh.” Psychic distance compresses under pressure—short clauses (“No trace to bind”) mimic the click of a slide changer. No dialogue, so voice convergence risk is bypassed; internal cadence stays intact to the last line.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is lapidary yet propulsive; every sentence layers image and concept—“lanterns strung from ribs of a dirigible” does world, body, and metaphor in one stroke. No loops or scaffold; synonym churn is avoided (each snow/ice image is distinct). One mixed metaphor niggle: “submarine crack” under ice is physically off, but the slip is brief and does not touch closure. Information density is high—e.g., “catalog cards laminated with hoarfrost curled like tired tongues” fuses object, sensory, and metaphoric work in a single clause.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Premise—cloud-top frozen library archiving the light of dead vows—is non-obvious and fully committed to. The sampling-frequency mechanic transforms romantic promise into epistemological crisis, a conceptual risk that pays off. Fresh inflection: the archivist’s own unmeasured vow becomes the final slide the machine cannot read, turning the instrument back on the observer. Synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight, yet I have never seen this exact story before.</comment>
