<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The pilot’s longing for the “source of resilience” and her tactile attachment to the broken arrow-tip give every glide and tether a believable personal stake. Interiority is concrete, never diagnostic—she thinks in orchard, creek, and echo textures, not abstractions. Micro-choice chain is tight: waiting at the spill, pocketing the seed, deciding to shoulder through the veil—each costs risk and reveals grit. One hairline slip: the emotional aftershock when the shard is sealed is reported rather than embodied; still, the renunciation of upward flight and the seed tucked “near my heart” earn credible endurance with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds throughout: arrow-tip lineage → mother’s promise → launch → veil → wound → plug → restored echo → seed souvenir. One meaningful tightening is sufficient at this length; it lands the moment the tip clicks into place and time/fruit re-blossom. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the planet’s rule-set literally re-knits, the protagonist forfeits altitude and heroic solitude to become steward, and the cost is the sky-river itself narrowing to a sane flow. No orientation debt; floating arches and anti-grav hour are cued before word 120.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>“Orchards glowed like lanterns under floating rock arches” is an instant, unforgettable postcard, yet every detail is filtered through pilot-utility: harness, spill, spray, root-braid tether. The hollow root-sphere and black-glass shard are micro-settings that directly constrain choice—no plug, no song, no safe lane. Sensory hierarchy obeys crisis: under the veil only “drips crawl upward like silver insects,” wider vistas vanish. Final seed tucked “near my heart” makes the body itself setting/anchor; this micro-object charges the closing image, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake is single and lethal: will the planet’s echo-engine (and therefore the orchards) survive this season? Pressure escalates when the singing thins; the protagonist’s decision to enter the veil is an irreversible burn of altitude and safety. Cost is visible on-page: the river “lurches,” glider tether must be cut, and the shard wound’s sealing costs her the chance to keep climbing—she returns earth-bound, seed as receipt. Coincidence is absent; every complication is a direct wound she chooses to mend.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges as the price of caretaking: resilience is not spring-back elasticity but hinge knowledge—how to slow a fall. Subtext whispers that inherited tools (arrow-tip) finish sentences the dead could not speak. No moral is preached; instead the final seed is a pale comma, a grammar of future orchards. The reader is left to feel the paradox: to save upward song one must descend and plant silence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>First-person pilot voice owns a perceptual signature of aerial navigation—she “skates upward along the spray like a moth waking,” hears “braided hush,” feels arrow-tip “bright as stubborn noon.” Syntax compresses under pressure: “I tether—shoulder—feel drips crawl.” No head-hopping; collective “we” stays atmospheric, never individuated. Diction stays within lexicon of wind, sap, echo; register never drifts into academic or corporate. The patterned lyricism is taught early and paid off in the final cadence “seed tucked near my heart,” achieving coherent modulation.</comment>

<comment>Sentence rhythm breathes with altitude: long glides for glide, staccato when bolts loosen. Metaphors are orchard-specific—“pears lift sighing,” “echoes stitch little ladders of air”—and never mixed; each vehicle extends the physics of the world. Zero loops, no synonym churn, no filter-verb stacks. Information density is high: one line can orient, foreshadow, and embody emotion—“the arrow tip warms when the arches hum, a small stubborn ember.” Only hairline: two adjectives in “gentle roar” could be cut, but the beat is not pivotal; closure line remains pristine.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Inversion-gravity orchards and sonic-time agriculture feel utterly fresh yet inevitable; agriculture-as-acoustics is a synthesis not seen in slush. The broken arrow-tip as ancestral sentence-finisher reverses weapon into grammar key—transformation with specific lore. Every trope (floating islands, hour of flipped gravity) is re-grounded in sensory agrarian detail; risk is taken but coherence never sacrificed. Final seed-comma image is an indelible coinage that could not be transplanted to another tale without collapse.</comment>
