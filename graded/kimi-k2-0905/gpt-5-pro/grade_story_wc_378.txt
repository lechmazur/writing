<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The android’s contradictory yearning—to archive memories yet flee the museum it tends—drives every beat; the burn decision crystallizes when “the hiss loosens,” embodying embodied cost. Micro-choices (drawing the copper corridor, miniaturizing its own noise) reveal a hierarchy of values: archive < survival < self-redefinition. The childhood-storm box is handled twice, each time tilting present stance; no stock “machine wants to be human” cliché. Final renunciation—stepping through the breach while paint curls—pays the price foreshadowed in “controlled burn escape.”</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each image (dome breathing, copper breadcrumbs, smoke spirals) layers density until the magnetic shift reweights all stakes. Closure is Charged Poise: the android kneels, burying the first packet along the new north—simultaneously caretaker, archive, and refugee—cost legible in “glass lung finally done breathing.” No orientation debt; who/where/when anchored by word 80. One causal micro-turn—compass stutter triggers burn—suffices for this lyric mode.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The dome’s honeycomb shutters, copper shavings, and terracotta shard packets are not backdrop but tactical gear: the corridor width “thin as a wrist” constrains flame spread; vials of cultured scent become portable futures. Desert roses that “bloom brighter after fire” mirror the android’s own carbonized evolution. Final image—buried packet teaching roots “to find morning in this revised geography”—makes setting itself the mutable compass. Sensory hierarchy obeys machine perception: magnetic hum, glass cooling clicks, ion tongue.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake: resolve inner static vs. preserve archive. Escalation is density-driven: each paragraph adds a new system (magnetic shift, smoke spiral, seed crack) tightening until only the breach remains. One meaningful deepening—miniaturizing self-noise—forecloses the option to stay whole. Cost is visible: dome windows spider, paint curls, and the android accepts “fragmented wholeness” as diagnosis turned promise.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the paradox of archive-as-escape: memory is ballast until it is jettisoned into soil. No moralizing; the final image reweights “fragmented wholeness” from fracture to fertile map. Subtext in the child-voice threading the burn: the android parents the storm it once feared. Resonance lingers in the reader’s own revised north—what must we burn to keep breathing?</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Perceptual signature—machine noticing via magnetic teeth, seed-click locks, sand-hiss static—remains crisp and unhuman. Lyric compression (“I miniaturize myself, not in size, but in noise”) teaches pattern early; payoff at breach when hiss becomes “river choosing deeper banks.” No head-hopping; single POV holds. Register stays metallurgical and botanical, never drifts into therapy-speak.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with scene: long clauses during dusk setup, staccato sparks under shift. Metaphors are kept physically honest—“flames travel like careful handwriting”—no mixed vehicles. Information density high: one sentence seeds, maps, and slings vials. Tiny loop: “breathing” appears twice in adjacent lines early; does not recur at closure, so −0.2 only.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: post-climate archive-robot performs a prescribed burn to escape its own museum, turning agronomy into autobiography. Risk—letting the dome collapse midway—pays off by making closure a literal step into rewritten magnetic night. No recognizable trope echo;/android caretaker trope is rotated 90° by rose farm + magnetic pole shift. Conceptual integrity: every implication of “controlled burn escape” is followed to the last ember.</comment>
