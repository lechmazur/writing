<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The restorer’s listening-before-touching ethos, coin-as-lens ritual, and minute console adjustments create a believable, vocation-driven interiority. Micro-choices—clap, nickel tilt, varnish wave—manifest the “methodically playful” trait under pressure. The only flaw is a slight over-summary of emotional upshift inside the mural; embodied cost is hinted but not fully tasted, keeping the score sub-9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the narrator accepts perpetual re-waking, a Charged Poise that reweights curiosity over certainty, felt when the coin is left in shadow. Accumulative/lyric lens holds throughout; each echo-deepening beat layers density rather than causal flip, culminating in the final hedge-shaped path. Orientation is taught early (sound-wave garden, cart, console) so no penalty. A hairline slip: the “caption” text is summoned late without prior cue, but it pays off immediately and does not rupture causality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The sound-wave garden is not postcard scenery; its humming hedges and legible ripples directly supply the reflected-sound tool that drives every beat. Spatial choreography stays crisp—cart, wall, console, nickel—anchoring single-scene action. The hobo nickel serves as micro-setting/object that constrains listening posture and is finally left as cost. Only minus: no weather or environmental shift externalizes the final internal change, keeping it just under 9.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will the wall speak again?—tightens through each echo-capture attempt; failure would flatten the city’s memory. One meaningful deepening: the discovered pigment diagram of elders waiting reframes personal restoration as civic patience, narrowing the protagonist’s goal from mastery to service. Cost is present (time, coin relinquished, certainty traded) but lightly felt rather than viscerally paid, capping high-band entry.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges without thesis statement: listening as communal survival—cities don’t rust when citizens learn echoed patience. The final image of the hedge shaping a walking path re-prices the premise: curiosity is a relay, not an achievement. No moralizing paragraph, only pattern and image; the reader carries the after-effect of continuous waking. Complexity stays intact—the city’s prior tuning contains both beauty and implied erosion—inviting reflection rather than dictating stance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>First-person voice is saturated with sensory synesthesia—color as breath, ripples as braille—yet stays decipherable and vocation-specific. Syntax flexes from long breathless accumulations to clipped fragments that mimic sonic bounces, supporting pressure. No head-hop; perceptual signature remains the restorer’s professional bias. Register never drifts into academic abstraction; diction stays within someone who literally paints for a living.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High information density; most sentences do two jobs (e.g., “I clap, soft, and guide the echo with the nickel held like a tiny shield, bending it through reflected sound toward the flaking blues”). Occasional metaphor pile-ups in calmer moments (“time flowers outward, each petal another room”) flirt with overwriting but are pattern-taught and paid off. Zero paraphrase loops, clean grammar, no filter-verb stacks. Final third stays sharp, allowing high-band consideration.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The sonic-mural premise is fresh yet intuitively right: of course pigments tuned to echo would forget their own voice. The hobo nickel’s wave-carved faces literalize “listening as lens,” transforming a familiar token into indispensable tool. Risk is taken with lyric repetition and nested meta-mural selves, yet causality and closure remain legible. Specificity of trade—console readouts, varnish wave signature—makes the concept lived-in, not gimmicky.</comment>
