<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The jeweler’s grief is lived-in: trembling hands, failed houseplant, refusal to touch the living. The stencil-on-vellum acts as a second skin of the dead wife, forcing micro-choices—threading light through ash—that rewire his craft. Interior contradiction holds throughout: he courts suicide-by-oblivion yet feeds strangers’ seeds. Final renunciation—keeping the observatory open—pays the cost of perpetual exposure to others’ grief, earned by every prior locket laid in the corridor.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the genuinely artificial stars re-price grief from wound to medium. “Tending is the bravest spark I know” crystallizes the new rule-set—care as illumination—after the locket corridor has already foreclosed retreat. Cost is unmistakable: he will relive his own bottom each dawn, planting lockets that outlive him. Lens is Accumulative/Textural; density crescendos until the final image braids patience into dawn.</comment>

<comment>The observatory itself is a breathing lung—brass dome, ticking instruments—whose ribs narrow choice: only star-filtered light can vivify ash. Every object (micromesh locket, breathing chamber, stencil vellum) is handled with tactile jeweler grammar; textures of ash vs. swell of seed constrain what can be attempted. Spatial choreography is immaculate: lockets placed, corridor braided, mourners’ hands on rail tracked without drift. Final planting at dawn externalizes the dome’s lesson—environment dictates the only form resurrection can take here.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—can grief be transmuted into growth rather than entropy—is signaled in paragraph four and tightened twice: first when the stencil aligns starlight into a silver corridor, foreclosing darkness as refuge; second when each locket swells, trading private ash for public seed. Cost is visible: the jeweler volunteers for perpetual reopening of his wound. Agency is attention rather than confrontation; under Accumulative lens the deepening of density reweights the stake adequately for this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the inversion of artificial vs. genuine: only the fabricated stars offer reliable patience. Subtext resides in gestures—mourners’ hands as ballast, the faintest paper-uncreasing sound—never sermonized. Final line “ready to illuminate again” offers resonant non-literal answer: care is the true stellar engine. No moral is stated; the conceptual cost is that authenticity now depends on tending the synthetic.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lapidary, each sentence a facet cut against grief: “lung paused at the top of breath” marries anatomy to architecture. Syntax lengthens and contracts like breathing—long clauses for circling grief, staccato hinges (“ash. hair. quiet vows.”) for bottomed-out halt. Perceptual signature is jeweler-precision: noticing mesh pores, seed swell, star tilt. No head-hopping; the collective “we” stays a single choral stance. Compression and elision (“they had left me the curtains”) are taught early and paid off when curtains finally narrow the beam.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm is deliberate without algorithmic pattern; sentence openings rotate from participle to noun to verb. Information density is high: one sentence often fuses tool, emotion, and world rule (“grammar of lungs after loss”). Only hairline slips—“quiet vows” skirts abstraction, “subdued ardor” is slightly self-diagnostic—but both are re-anchored by tactile follow-through. No loops or scaffolding; no mixed metaphors; closing line lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>The grief-into-light observatory is a fresh crucible for the mourning-jeweler trope; star-beam as jeweler’s torch feels inevitable in hindsight. Origami cranes carrying astral coordinates synthesizes street-art invitation with celestial navigation—risky yet coherent. Conceptual integrity commits fully: if care is artificial light, then genuine emotion must pass through machined channels. Risk distinction +0.3: the conceit could slide into gimmick, but specificity of micromesh breathing chambers keeps it grounded.</comment>
