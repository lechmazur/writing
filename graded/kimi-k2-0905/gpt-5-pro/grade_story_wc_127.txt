<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The narrator's "affectionate detachment" is lived in every beat: gloved hands on electrodes, static prickling as diagnostic tool. Interior contradiction—peddling counterfeit feeling while refusing to drown in it—drives every micro-choice. The final ledger press of the petal is earned renunciation with visible cost: he gives away the last scent of connection and stays “uncarved.” Only the brief “therapy-speak” glint in “caring that stands a step back” keeps this shy of 9+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds: each sensory layer (amber charge, blotter petal, orris accord) tightens the emotional vise until the final charged poise—her nose trembles, eyes stay open, slate untouched. Cost is legible in the last image: dealer slips the petal into ledger, sealing his own exclusion. Orientation taught at once: “Amber grotto at dusk” anchors who/where/when within 12 words. No causality breaks; static-current conceit stays consistent and pays off in closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Amber grotto functions as micro-setting: resin wall conducts electricity, dictates diagnostic ritual, and charges final image when petal is pressed into ledger. Orris–standing-water accord is handled, sniffed, traded—its wet lie literally inhaled by Liora. Spatial choreography is surgical: knee against linen, palm on stone, electrodes dialed—every move tracked without drift. Sensory hierarchy obeys POV: scent molecules > static tingle > dusk temperature; no tourist catalog.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can she finish the memorial perfume without being embalmed by grief—tightens when counterfeit courage is inhaled and her nose trembles yet eyes stay open. One meaningful deepening: the accord’s “careful lie of surviving” is offered, accepted, and metabolized into real stamina. Cost is visible on-page: dealer forfeits the petal’s residual intimacy, left “uncarved again.” Agency is shared—she sniffs, he releases—under accumulative pressure pattern.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from material: counterfeit emotion as bridge, not shore. Half-truths refract through amber, perfume accord, and the blotter petal that is both keepsake and trade good. Final image—petal archived in phloxless ledger—reweights premise: surrogacy is real labor whose reward is self-erasure. No moralizing; resonance is purely imagistic and earned.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Voice is irreducibly particular: “static leaves me briefly clean, then uncarved again.” Syntax mirrors diagnostic precision—calibrated amperage, scent memory, rhythm of breath—yet cadence softens for Liora’s entrance, a hearth-breath. Diction stays within narrator’s jeweler-loupe lexicon; no filter-verb bloat. Compression taught early (“I deal in them like cut gems”) and paid off in final brevity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet breathable: single sentences deliver scent chemistry, emotional calculus, and tactile spark. No mixed metaphors; “static netting us like spidersilk” extends prior electrical conceit. Rhythm modulates—long susurrus clauses for grotto hum, staccato for electrode clicks. Only a faint template cadence in “professionally thorough” refrain stops this at 9.0.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Premise—illicit artisan who sells fake courage by wiring grief to electricity—feels instantly new yet inevitable. Risk: merging perfumery with static diagnostics could read gimmicky, but world rules are taught early and adhered to. Transformation test fails if relocated: amber conductivity and scent-memory apparatus are irreplaceable. Specificity of labdanum-stained petal vein outruns genre tropes.</comment>
