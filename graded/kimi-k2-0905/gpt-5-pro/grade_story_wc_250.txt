<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>The guardian’s refusal to speak is embodied through breath-counting and mirror-work; the dented mirror as inherited tool gives concrete history. Emotions stay tacit—"two pages touching"—avoiding diagnostic labels. The final act of handing the mirror to the boy crystallizes a hierarchy of values: silence, stewardship, succession.micro-choice costs are visible, yet the inner contradiction between vow and intervention could be sharper under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Accumulative/textural lens: ripples, shutters, star-dots accrue until the brother surfaces. Orientation locked by line 3; space tracked cleanly. Closure is a Charged Poise—the city "lighter by one lesson," the guardian walking off with mirror ticking against ribs; cost is the perpetual burden of quiet. One scaffold spot: “they call me…” could be cut.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Dock, rain-slick planks, and boathouse shutters are filtered through guardian’s夜班 priorities: what can be opened, angled, stitched with light. Cobalt color recurs, recharging final image. Micro-setting (mirror & shutter) literally constrains rescue tactics. Sensory hierarchy narrowed to sound of drops and lamp-light reflection, matching hush premise.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: keep vow of silence while retrieving lost lives. Pressure tightens when the boy’s pointed throat forces a choice: break vow or invent light-trace. Spiral weave of shutters + mirror is the visible tactic that escalates under accruing stakes. Cost is legible—guardian must keep speaking forbidden, burden transferred to boy holding star.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from pattern: silence as active care, darkness taught by star-specks, not sermons. Final image of city “lighter by one lesson” offers Conceptual Repricing—quiet gains value. Avoids moralizing; insight earned through shutter-coded rescue. Ambiguity lingers: will boys keep or break the quiet?</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>First-person voice sustains perceptual signature: “counting ripples I chose not to disturb,” “thumbprint on the night.” Syntax mirrors breath-control—measured, spiraling. No head-hopping; boy’s interior accessed only via gesture and shuttered mouth. Rhythmic control peaks in mirror-to-boy hand-off, cadence softening into lullaby taps.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>High density: “dot moved like a measured heartbeat” does three jobs (light, pulse, pacing). Metaphors stay within water/light domain, coherent. One near-loop: “stillwater tension…instrument…hum” could compress. Zero filter-verb stacks; actions stay in strong verbs. Closing line earns resonance without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: canal-keeper who tunes silence with dental mirror and shutter morse. Guardian vow + star-transfer feels inevitable yet un-clichéd. Risk of wordless rescue paid off through visible light-bridge. Could push further if mirror’s inherited dent carried sharper physical limitation.</comment>
