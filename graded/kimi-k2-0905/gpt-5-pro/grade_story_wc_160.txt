<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The machinist’s interior contradiction—trembling yet tightening grip—embodies the “encrypted compassion” concept; embodied emotion and micro-choice under pressure satisfy the 9+ quick test. Mentor’s resin-code and the chain’s re-weighting give visible cost, though the valley council remains a faceless chorus, muting status dynamics. Voice stays coherent, singular, and tool-competent without safety-hedging. No overt diagnostic labels; the tremor is physical, not therapy-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the final inhalation of the amphitheater crystallizes options—machinery and mercy now share a lung—conceptual cost undeniable. Causal chain holds: resin pattern → chain lengths → gate schedule → valley truce; no teleporting props. Orientation is anchored within 120 words by toolkit, notebook, and basalt ribs; no disorientation. Persistent constraint: the breathing stone literally paces every future opening, shaping tactics forever.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The antique chain and breathing basalt function as micro-setting that constrains every tactical choice; removing them would collapse the resolution. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven—calloused thumb on polished links, warm draft carrying math vs. mercy. Spatial choreography is flawless: chain laid across fossilized-wave steps triggers hum. Idiom remains consistent—no tourist catalog, only the tools and ribs that matter.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—valley water war—signaled in paragraph two. Single tightening: resin pattern converts abstract fairness into measurable chain lengths, foreclosing endless debate with visible ledger. Cost is legible on-page: farmer’s thumb feels the softened ledger, guardians clap with relief-dust. Escalation is accumulative: each breath of the amphitheater re-weights the moral calculus under the “building breathes” clock.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the concrete particulars of resin, chain, and stone—no moral spoken. Final image of invisible metronome re-prices fairness as a living, breathing maintenance rather than a static verdict. Subtext in gesture: calloused thumb on chain = ledger softened but still balancing. No thematic echo; the word “compassion” never appears, only acts.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>First-person perceptual signature is sustained—math vs. mercy heard in wind, citrus ghost in envelope glue. Rhythm modulates: longer sentences for cathedral awe, clipped fragments (“I tremble”) under peak stress. No head-hopping; council stays external, focalization strictly machinist. Diction invents “fossilized waves,” “stone lung,” avoiding generic templates.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud ear is musical; sentence lengths crest and breathe like the amphitheater itself. No loops, scaffold, or synonym churn. Metaphors are coherent—“stone lung,” “fossilized waves”—no mixed vehicles. Information density high: one sentence can orient, characterize, and foreshadow (“dappled resolve” links tone to later bat-light schedule).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Premise—engineer mediates valley war via volcanic breathing schedule—is non-obvious and inevitable in hindsight. Resin-code as encryption literalizes “encrypted compassion,” transforming abstract ethics into tactile gear. Risk of lyric abstraction is embraced yet clarity remains. Synthesis feels singular: mentor’s posthumous puzzle, breathing basalt, and ledger-softening chain could not transplant to another tale unchanged.</comment>
