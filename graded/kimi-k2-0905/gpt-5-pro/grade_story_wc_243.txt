<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The narrator’s “gently thorough” disposition drives every micro-choice on the jetty; cradling the locket, pressing it into the ledger, and signing the tide are embodied, costly acts that externalize inner contradiction. The absent woman remains a felt pressure, not exposition, and the renunciation—“I can only write the ache she made useful”—earns its stoic weight through prior beats. Minor slack: the interior idiom drifts toward lit-crit near the end (“proximate causes we now own”), trimming the last ounce of lived specificity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the ledger bruise, the locket pressed into wet ink, and the tide’s inhale reconfigure the covenant with undeniable conceptual cost. The accumulative/textural lens is taught by the repeating “between breaths” motif and lands when the sea gives/takes the jetty edge. No orientation debt; spatial anchors (jetty pylons, ferryman’s boots) are clear within the first 120 words. The final image—“the sea gives it again”—makes the stake legible without exposition.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The blooming jetty is not backdrop but equipment: the brazier’s glow, the kettle’s hiss, and the rubber-tire barnacles constrain where the archivist can set the ink and when Kellen can step forward. The salt-rose wrist-corsage image reappears at the exact closure beat, re-weighted by the tide’s pulse. Micro-setting (locket against ribs) functions as spatial ground that charges the final breath-count. One hairline slip: “salt roses” is vivid but botanically improbable on creosote pylons—doesn’t break causality.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—town survival via covenant renewal—tightens through one meaningful deepening: the ink must accept the absent woman’s gap rather than restore her. The protagonist’s agency is to inscribe that gap, a renunciation that forecloses magical recovery. Pressure accumulates under the Accumulative lens: each added name, net adjustment, and gull circle thickens the texture until the ledger bruise crystallizes cost. No coincidence; the tide’s gift/take pattern is established early.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the particular ink ritual: memory is not recovered but re-negotiated through near, tangible acts. The final image re-prices “proximate causes” as secular grace—no absolution, only attendance. Subtext lives in Kellen’s shy bow and the gulls squaring their circles, evoking the town’s impossible geometry of loss. No sermonizing; the phrase “a covenant is not a spell” is spoken in-scene, not authorial nudge.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>First-person voice sustains a distinctive perceptual signature: walnut hulls “sigh,” ferry boots “ring like low bells,” ink blooms into a “brown galaxy.” Syntax lengthens under emotional load, then fractures into staccato breath-counts, mirroring tide rhythm. No dialogue leakage; Kellen’s two lines carry subtext through silence and nod. Micro-quibble: “conceptual repricing” diction sits half a notch above the narrator’s lived register, keeping it from 9+.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Line-level craft is near-flawless: no loops, scaffold, or filter stacks; each sentence layers image, body, and mythic reach. Metaphors interlock—“tideline bruise,” “ledger as skin we grow back”—without mixed logic. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image that recharges “between breaths.” Minor density spike mid-paragraph where three metaphors stack (“brown galaxy,” “harbor within a harbor,” “wrist corsage”) but the pattern is taught and pays off at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</comment>
<comment>The walnut-ink archivist ritual feels freshly specific; the covenant-through-cataloguing conceit reframes coastal gothic into archival lyric. Risk-taking—quiet renunciation instead of resurrected beloved—pays off by reweighting absence into utility. Transformation test fails if relocated inland: salt roses, ferry schedule, and tidePulse are irreplaceable. Slight proximity to “archivist of the drowned” trope is overcome by proximate-causes mechanic and locket bruise.</comment>
