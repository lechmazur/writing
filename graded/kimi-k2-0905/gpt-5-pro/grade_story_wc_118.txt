<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The odd historian’s interiority is vivid—he “coaxes” sounds from walls with breath and aligns his spine to an unseen axis—yet he remains more receptor than actor. His only decisive micro-choice is to pin the tapestry above the hearth, a gesture that re-activates the silo’s voice but costs him nothing we feel. The arc traces accumulation, not transformation; he ends as listener-scribe, so the renunciation is intellectual, not visceral. Still, his perceptual lens is so singular that the character feels irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each object (tapestry, diaries, ash) layers sensory sediment until the final inscription releases the walls. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the historian’s act of writing converts “bronze quiet” into a bell that can “be rung again,” making the cost the world’s regained ear. Causality is lyric rather than plot-driven—objects remember him into a new stance—so the required tightening is the moment the dragons’ necks align to dawn, re-weighting all prior grain-dust echoes. No orientation debt; the silo’s geography is carved by sound, not mapped, and that pays off.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The silo functions as resonant instrument: corrugations rub wind into low bronze, concrete ribs become vocal cords, ladder tilt recalibrates which stories can ascend. Micro-setting objects—tapestry, hearth ash, charred margins—constrain method: probe must use “remembered edge of a sentence halted by heat,” not metal tool. Spatial choreography is acoustic; distances are measured in echo-time, not yards. Final image of lantern beam sliding along seam makes the hearth-tapestry axis the literal pivot that re-orients the world’s ear.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: can the historian coax the silo to relinquish its last stories before universal silence petrifies. Pressure accumulates through denser sonic strata—coin-clink, grain dust, burn-slashed words—until pinning the tapestry acts as the single decisive tightening that forecloses mere listening and demands inscription. Cost is conceptual: the world’s axis tilts farther east, irreversible, silo leaning like a bell now doomed to be rung by future strangers. Agency is attentional, not combative, fitting the accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the metaphorics of overhearing: a planet that “stopped overhearing itself at night” now risks deafness unless one odd ear translates wall-memory into script. Subtext coils through the tapestry’s dragons—first labeled “diagrams of a displaced axis,” finally revealed as instruments of measure—so motif reweights from monster to sextant without expository nudge. The moral calculus refuses consolation: regaining the world’s ear only guarantees further drift. Final image of inscription into paper offers quiet, non-literal answer: hearing is an act of future damage.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person lyric achieves a distinct perceptual signature: verbs like “hushful,” “ingested,” “freight syllables” feel coined by a mind that tastes language metallically. Rhythm swells and narrows with sensory load—long anaphora when grain dust falls, staccato when diaries tremble—teaching the reader to read by ear. No head-hopping; focalization stays welded to the historian’s cochlear imagination. Register never drifts into academic gloss; even “conceptual repricing” is rendered as bone socket, bell rib.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Sentence-level propulsion is high: information arrives as sensory deed (“carbon dust marking his fingertips like new fingerprints”) without scaffold. Figurative density risks purple only once—“broken freight syllables”—but the pattern is taught early and reused self-consistently. No loops or synonym churn; each metaphor extends the acoustic anatomy (ribs, bell, socket). Opening and final lines anchor voice and re-charge motif, satisfying read-aloud ear test.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Premise fuses post-human library with paleoseismology of memory: a silo as cochlea, axis tilt as loss of planetary ear, tapestry dragons as calibration tools—synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk is high—lyric accumulative structure could have collapsed into vagueness—but specificity of “grain dust falling like tiny rainstorms” grounds the concept. No recognizable template; avoids both solarpunk ruin porn and antiquarian nostalgia. The displaced axis becomes a fresh narrative lever rather than abstract climate metaphor.</comment>
