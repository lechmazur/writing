<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The “lonely visionary” is the sole POV; interiority pulses through lyric first-person and tactile micro-choices (sweeping rust, threading ash-toned music). His starved motive—shape dawn from storm-shadows—gains moral weight when he refuses the stage, accepting permanent anonymity to keep the signal alive. Kestrel’s emergence tests but never eclipses this; the narrator’s final renunciation of limelight is earned and costs him visibility. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in scene, so the 9+ quick test just misses.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the portico spidered but standing, tomorrow left “visible-stringed,” not magical. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—storm-light and radio hiss braid into a final cadence shift that reweights the city’s stance. Cost is legible in Kestrel’s burn and the tower’s cracked glass; the visionary’s anonymity is a foreclosed path. Causality holds: council blinked because lightning-fed antennas repelled cutters, then grandparents’ war-lullabies fed the living song.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Stormlit observatory anchors by line 3; cobalt glass portico returns as both lightning rod and stage, constraining the final image. Sensory selection is urgent—penny-smelling thunder, whale-skull hum—filtered through the narrator’s radio-tuned ear. Micro-setting (the reel-to-reel vault) becomes tactical when its ash music is threaded into Kestrel’s coat, altering tactics. Spatial choreography is clean; glass state tracked from intact to spidered.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—signal survival vs. council shutdown—tightens when cutters retreat smoking, then again when traitors crack glass. One meaningful deepening: grandfather-lullaby tape reweights the stake from mere defiance to cultural memory. Agency is the visionary’s decision to stay at the tuner, accepting anonymity; cost is visible in Kestrel’s scorched shoulder and the tower’s fracture. Escalation is textural—storm density accumulates until batons fall “like rain gutters.”</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from storm-as-memory: ancient shadows are not chains but blueprints. Subtext lives in image—spoons kite, cracked moon smile—never in exposition. Final reconfiguration: visibility of strings refuses mystification, reweighting prophecy as collective labor. No sermonizing; the last line’s “honest paint” offers resonant non-literal answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>First-person lyric is sustained, with storm-drunk diction—“lightning stitched silver seams,” “paper storm crane.” Compression (“I stayed a shadow”) is taught early and paid off. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is radio-static synesthesia. Rhythm accelerates under thunder then breathes at dawn; syntax stays coherent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>High information density: “velvet rot and actuarial prayers” compresses council in five words. Metaphors are coherent—lightning as organ, glass as whale skull—and payoff in closure image. Minor template cadence in “variant allegiance” refrain (−0.2). No loops or scaffold obstruct clarity; paragraph cut test passes.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fusion of radio-prophecy, storm-organ, and spoon-kite feels inevitable and specific. Risky lyric density succeeds because pattern is taught early and closure recharges it. Transformation test fails if relocated: storm-antenna coalition and grandparent-lullaby splice are irreplaceable. Council vs. pirate broadcast freshes the tired “chosen prophet” trope by making the conductor the true visionary who refuses the crown.</comment>
