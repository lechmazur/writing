<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Interior contradiction is present—“I do not choose tonight, but I agree to cross…”—yet the tidal-pool chronicler’s observing stance dominates; action remains largely descriptive rather than choice-driven until the final deferral, so the change feels more spoken than dramatized. Micro-choices are filtered through metaphor; body and shell hinge are vivid but stay imagistic, limiting felt cost. Warmly observant trait is repeatedly asserted rather than tested under pressure. Voice is consistent and specific, but agency is diluted by lyric accumulation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the refusal to decide tonight crystallizes options with visible cost—the relationship remains suspended, tide still rising. Tangential approach is named, demonstrated, and paid off in the final deferral; lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern taught early via “sideways listening” holds. Orientation anchors (who/where) arrive by line 3; no penalty. Cost is felt but could be sharper if the deferral altered immediate tactics beyond speech; slight under-crank keeps it from 8.8.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Grotto, starlight, and tidal micro-pools are concretely handled: water temperature, barnacle light, stone migrations all constrain posture and attention. Jade cicada functions as micro-setting that alters touch and meaning across beats, satisfying 9+ gate. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible positions. Selective sensory hierarchy mirrors POV’s chronicler bias; no tourist catalog. Environment silently pressures the choice to defer, charging final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—stay or leave the coast—signaled early; pressure tightens once via the deferral, narrowing future options. Agency is linguistic (deferral) rather than tactical; no resource lost on-page, so cost is conceptual rather than visceral. Escalation is lyrical deepening, not causal chain; sufficient under Accumulative lens but less sharp than causal turns. Coincidence absent; tension survives, but visible price would elevate.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of transition emerges through iterated images of shedding, bridging, slack nets, and hinge-shells; no final moral stated. Subtext lives in silence and pool-gazing; cicada reweights meaning at end. Ambiguity is purposeful: deferral refuses tidy resolution, inviting reflection. Insight is earned via concrete catalog of thresholds rather than abstraction. No echoic thesis lines; final image carries resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>First-person voice sustains a dense, rhythmic lyricism—“salt on a cut,” “night inch its own grammar”—without syntactic monotony. Perceptual signature is strong: chronicler’s taxonomic gaze filters every detail. Diction stays within plausible coastal-poet lexicon; no register drift. Compression and elision are patterned and paid off; no head-hopping. Dialogue is minimal and subtextual; voice modulation under stress is present in shorter breath-like sentences.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is rich but disciplined: most sentences advance image or emotional charge. A few metaphor clusters risk overwriting—“sentences of foam,” “grammar of night”—yet pattern is taught early and serves texture. No loops, scaffold, or synonym churn. Minor register spikes (“conceptual repricing”-like diction) appear in abstract nounings but do not touch closure. Rhythm breathes with tide; final line is crisp.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Coastal parting conversation is familiar, yet chronicler’s taxonomic gaze and jade-cicada token freshen the setup. Tangential approach as narrative method (sideways listening) is non-obvious and drives closure. Accumulation of small marine images rather than confrontation is risky and mostly pays off. Specificity of “slack nets” and “snail bridging a star” feels particular. Could push further into unseen emotional terrain; still, synthesis is memorable.</comment>
