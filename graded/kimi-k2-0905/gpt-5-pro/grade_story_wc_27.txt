<comment>The barefoot stargazer’s interiority is vivid—learning “through skin than through fear,” letting soles “listen” to the stones—yet the arc is more posture than pressured choice. No contradictory impulse ever jeopardizes the reignition; confidence only grows, so the “awkwardly” half of the trait never exacts cost. The final stance crystallizes, but it feels foreordained rather than wrested from a lost alternative.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the ferry’s gentle startup reconfigures the bay’s silence into covenant, cost paid in the speaker’s wiped-oil “war paint” and the visible foreclosing of stealth. Causality is lyric-accumulative: each braided wire, crank turn, and whispered reply layers until the coil accepts the dolmen hum. Orientation is swift—“edge of the abandoned spaceport repair bay, in the margin of daylight” anchors by line 3. No lens ambiguity; pattern taught early and held.</comment>

<comment>The repair bay’s rib-cage cranes, scored floor, and hollow wing double as body and social map; proximity to the carved dolmen notch constrains every wiring move. Opera glasses micro-shift setting into theater, letting bolts become performers—an irreplaceable tool that charges the final image. Sensory hierarchy obeys crisis: night patrols narrow perception to hum and wire tension, then dawn widens to “algae on dark water” lights. Specificity stays high despite lyric compression; no spatial drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—keep the lull while reviving the ferry—tightens when each slow crank risks acoustic detection. Agency is deliberate attention: turning the generator “slowly,” trading speed for silence, narrowing options to “breath is the ember’s ally.” Cost accumulates in patience and forfeited time; the dawn smoke argues against delay. No second reversal, but the single deepening is sufficient under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as listening over inciting: silence is not surrender but substrate. Subtext lives in gesture—wiping oil on shins steals war paint from a future now rewriteable—showing reclamation without sermon. The stones’ song and the speaker’s map of wells reprice rebellion from noise to nurture. Final image of “quiet frequencies” answers the thematic question without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Perceptual signature is distinct—“vintage opera glasses” compress distance, “callused soles” learn through skin, diction stays tactile and operatic. Rhythm modulates from long breathes (“the lull in rebellion had settled over the coast, like a cloak thrown over a furnace”) to staccato tool codes over radio. No head-hopping; single POV holds. Compressed lyric elision (“manuals were ash or propaganda now”) is taught early and paid off when memory replaces them.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sentence variety and muscular verbs propel—skids, scored, clambered, coaxed. Figurative layering is dense but coherent: “ribcage without a heart” fits the bay’s anatomy, “algae on dark water” fits the slow light bloom. No mixed metaphors in peak beat. Micro-loop only in “breath is the ember’s ally, not its enemy”—a single permissible echo that sharpens rather than drags. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and re-charge motif.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Fusion of neolithic stone circle with post-collapse spaceport feels inevitable in hindsight; hum-as-fuel converts ritual into engineering without technobabble. Barefoot stargazer with opera glasses is fresh casting of scavenger-poet. Risk taken in lyric-accumulative structure pays off: the story dares quiet startup over explosive launch, making silence the heroic gesture. Tropes of rebel activation are subverted into communal lullaby.</comment>
