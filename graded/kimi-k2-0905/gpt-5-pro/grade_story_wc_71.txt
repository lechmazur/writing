<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator’s motivation—restoring “aliveness” to houses by reading micro-displacements—is vivid and odd enough to feel singular. Interiority is concrete, embodied, and consistent, especially in the tactile handling of salt air, drawer angles, and photo falls. No contradictory impulses are dramatized under pressure; the choice to “ask the rest” is more gesture than crucible, so the cost is only lightly felt. Still, the voice’s perceptual signature is so strong that characterization remains memorable and coherent.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the house and narrator “agree to keep each other company,” a conceptual repricing that makes the aliveness reciprocal. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—every displaced object tightens the pattern until the final hush settles. Orientation is anchored within 120 words (bay, blue house, night, first-person), so no penalty applies. Cost is visible in the narrator’s bow to the shard of hush and the vow to “ask the rest,” foreclosing the fantasy of full restoration.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The quiet bay and the blue house’s micro-rooms function as a single, breathing setting that constrains every micro-choice (chair angle, drawer gap, latch compass). Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven—salt air, porcelain tilt, rug weave—never touristic. Weather bottles and orris root return to charge the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography is impeccable; no impossible positions or white-room gaps.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can attention re-animate a house?—is signaled early and tightens through each object’s right-placement. The meaningful deepening occurs when the photo falls: the house’s past couple now Literalizes the risk of failed occupancy, narrowing the narrator’s options to “return what I can, and ask the rest.” Agency remains interior—no external antagonist—so escalation is accretive, not causal, but the cost (accepting partial failure) is legible. Enough for high-band, though a sharper external constraint could have pushed higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: attention itself is a reciprocal haunting—houses remember as much as people. The orris / weather-bottle motif reweights from quaint tools to covenant tokens at closure. Subtext in the photo—smiles misaligned with shoulders—quietly warns that successful haunting may still fail human connection. No moralizing; resonance is purely imagistic, earning its complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyric first-person achieves a distinct syntactic rhythm—“a hush that burns inward,” “feathered smell of southwester”—that is both compressed and legible. Patterned diction (“shard of hush,” “sunmark”) is taught early and paid off in the final settling of the vial. No head-hopping; perceptual signature remains consistent, even under the abstract conceit. The voice’s urgency never wavers, propelling the accumulative design.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Line-level craft is near flawless: high density, zero paraphrase loops, varied sentence rhythms, and metaphor vehicles that stay internally coherent (“ground moon,” “porcelain tilt”). One microscopic mixed image—“salt wicks into the air”—is allowable under poetic license. No scaffolding or filter-verb stacks; every clause advances atmosphere or micro-choice. Closure image is clean, unmarred by artifact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The “creeping normality noticer” is a fresh occupational lens; displaced-object divination has not been over-mined. Bay-side weather bottles and orris root feel particular, not quirky-for-quirk’s-sake. Accumulation rather than twist keeps the concept honest: no late rule changes, no gimmick. Risk is quiet—lyric interiority—but the execution is bold within its chosen register.</comment>
