<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The narrator’s contradictory mix of scientific rigor and romantic yearning is embodied in every micro-choice (how much of each vial to pour, when to pause). The final laugh that “stays, weighty” externalizes an earned interior shift. Lio’s secret and wrist-touch function as credible relationship crucible, not just backdrop. No stock phrasing or therapy-speak; even “density of presence” is stress-tested by the reactor’s physical read-out.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the city’s felt weight recalibrates under the new coefficient. The cost is visible—the laughing pebble halts at the drain, foreclosing prior evanescence. Causal chain (drops → spiral → compression) remains transparent under lyric compression. Orientation fixed by line 4; no lens drift.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Plaza, reactor, and spiral constrain every tactical decision; the grate’s circle literally shapes the final pebble stop. Twilight’s velvet lines narrow sensory bandwidth to heat and breath, matching escalating focus. Micro-setting (palm-gold stain, sleeve chalk) repeatedly alters options. No static cataloguing; every detail is handled or stepped on.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can presence attain mass—tightens exactly once when the whispered secret triggers the reactor bloom, foreclosing further abstraction. Cost is the laugh that refuses to evaporate, now a permanent city fixture. Agency remains with the duo’s calibrated pour, not coincidence. Escalation is accumulative/textural: density literally accrues drop by drop until the plaza tilts under its own weight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the iterative revaluation ritual: measurement itself is an act of love. No moralizing line tells us this; the shift from “rumor” to “pebble” is the argument. Final image of the nautilus dimming “like a yawn” reweights prior spiral grammar into tenderness. Ambiguity lingers—will tomorrow’s recalibration erase tonight’s mass?—without confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is relentless alchemical synesthesia: breath measured in lumens, resolve in droplets, laughter in grams. Syntax spirals like the columella—clause within clause—yet stays legible. No head-hop; “I” stays limited to palm-gold knowledge. Diction never exceeds the POV’s pocket-sun lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Rhythms breathe with reactor pulses: longer clauses heat up, fragments cool. Metaphors are coherent—soup agreeing, grain poured—no mixed vehicles. Zero filter-verb stacks or template cadences. One paraphrase loop (“revalue again tomorrow”) is permitted as mantra, not artifact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The fusion of hard-science calibration with romantic transmutation feels inevitable yet unseen before. The nautilus columella as central processing unit is a precise, non-obvious invention. Risk—letting poetry carry causality—pays off because the reactor’s physical read-out stays legible. Could not swap spiral for clock without breaking the mass-presence equation.</comment>
