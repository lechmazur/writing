<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The carver’s meditative slowness and inherited patience are credibly embodied in the chisel work and ribbon tracing; the interior contradiction between listening and cutting is present but stays summary. The final act of loosening the braid shows a micro-choice with cost, yet the grandmother’s spectral guidance remains a felt presence rather than a force that pressures him to change stance. No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible not tested. Voice and gesture are individual, though the emotional arc is more accumulation than pivot.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the loosened braid and glowing gaps reconfigure collective grief from containment to reception, with visible cost (the stone’s hollows, the slackened ribbons). Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each ribbon crossing and poem stanza layers density until the final cadence shift. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“ancient greenhouse at dusk”) and never breaks. No causal reversals are required under this lens; the single deepening is sufficient.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The greenhouse’s fogged panes, iron ribs, and butterfly-laden roof constrain every move: the carver must work around living stalks, uses the misting drops as metronome, and lets the vines dictate ribbon paths. Tool-as-setting (chisels, ribbons) and body-in-motion ground each beat; the final image of slackened ribbons among ferns is charged by prior crossings. Sensory hierarchy favors damp breath and wing-beat over visual catalog. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible positions.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—shape a single sheltering stone for many losses—is signaled early and tightens through each ribbon intersection; the meaningful deepening occurs when the grandmother’s poem instructs him to loosen rather than tighten, foreclosing the option of a sealed monument. Cost is legible: the stone must accept hollows, the braid must fall open, the town must live with permeable grief. Accumulative escalation suffices under the chosen lens; no antagonist needed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: collective grief is not a solid monument but an open braid that breathes. Subtext lives in the loosening gesture and the glowing gaps—no moral is stated. The final supper with poems traded among cucumbers reprises the family ritual now widened to the town, reweighting the custom from private inheritance to communal practice. Ambiguity is purposeful: the stone receives rather than proclaims, leaving room for future losses.</comment>

<comment>First-person perceptual signature is consistent: the carver hears chisels “speak,” feels poems “shiver” through butterfly bones, and measures time by mist drops. Syntax slows to match meditative pace—long clauses, comma pauses—then tightens at the final loosening. No dialogue, so voice distinction not tested; internal diction stays within a stone-carver’s lexicon. No head-hopping or filter-verb bloat; psychic distance stays shallow and embodied.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Rhythm varies: opening spondaic thunder, then liquid clauses that mirror watering pipes; no template cadence runs. Metaphors (“glass roofs turned gold with wings”) are precise and never mixed. Information density is high: one sentence often sets scene, emotion, and stakes. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn. Minor elevated diction (“spectral mentorship,” “conceptual repricing”) is voice-motivated and taught early enough to feel earned rather than grafted.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Premise—carving collective grief into stone inside a living greenhouse during butterfly migration—feels fresh and specific; the ribbon-as-braid device transforms a tagging tool into a grief map. Risk lies in the lyric stillness, but the final loosening avoids sentimental closure. No close echoes of famous scenes. If names and places swapped, the core would fracture, indicating genuine transformation rather than ornament.</comment>
