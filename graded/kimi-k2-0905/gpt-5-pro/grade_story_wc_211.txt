<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The scribe’s contradictory drives—archival duty vs. self-exposure—are dramatized in the moment he writes his own name as witness; the embodied ritual with wax shaving, ink, and tree bark makes the interior split visceral. No diagnostic label-speak; instead, “the taste of a coin haunts a tongue” renders guilt sensory. The final micro-choice (writing the prophecy beside the split) costs him his protective anonymity, paying the prior causality in full.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: by writing the prophecy as witness rather than sealant, the narrator revalues the oath archive from binding contract to living, open wound; the cost is the certainty that he will be the blade. Causal chain intact—immersing the shaving → tree speaks in Hittite → prophecy confirmed → choice made. Lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of grooves, salt-grief texture, and bark consonants tighten until the final inscription reweights the stake.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The rooftop orchard is not backdrop—its grafted pilgrim stock and cross-hatched bark physically hold the oaths, forcing the scribe’s decision; the lamp’s syrup-color and the arch of drying shaving become micro-settings that charge the final image. Spatial choreography is flawless: fog below, leaves overhead, glass rim at fingertip, bark at eye-level—each object constrains the next ritual move.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</question><comment>Dominant stake—preserve the emotional archive vs. prevent the prophecy-split—tightens when the shaving revives the famine oath he once erased; the tightening is the audible Hittite whisper that forecloses denial. Cost is visible: he forfeits the guild’s protective distance and accepts being the knife. Agency remains ritual-based (immersing, threading, writing) rather than abstract; one meaningful escalation suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the inversion of archival duty: oaths are not cages but living wounds that must stay open to remain legible. The wax shaving’s “velvet disquiet” and the tree’s Hittite whisper dramatize the idea without thesis statement. Final image—his name beside the split—re-prices the entire concept of binding, offering no moral, only residual ache.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>First-person voice sustains a somber, incantatory rhythm; perceptual signature is lexically precise (“cross-hatched pledges,” “syrup-color lamp”) yet modestly Hittite-capable. No head-hop; psychic distance tightens naturally under ritual pressure. Dialogue absent by design; interior monologue avoids filter verbs, keeps diction within scribely register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm alternates between long breathy accumulations and clipped ritual beats; no template cadence or synonym loops. Figurative layer is dense yet coherent—sound has a rind, air wears mourning gloves—each image pays off in the final inscription. Zero scaffolding; every sentence advances atmosphere, tool-use, or internal stakes. opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image that recharges earlier motifs.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Premise—oath-scribe harvesting spoken vows from rooftop orchard bark—feels inevitable yet wholly fresh. Third-grade wax-cup memory repurposed as archival tech avoids exposition dump and deepens vocational authenticity. Risk of lyric overload is embraced, but pattern is taught early (“sound has a rind”) and paid off in the final living wound. Synthesis of dead languages, grafted trees, and phonograph ghosts creates a singular mythic realism.</comment>
