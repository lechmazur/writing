<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The knight’s quiet pledge to “tend what may be” is the only decisive micro-choice, but it is telegraphed early and never tested by a second, higher-stakes beat; the interiority is lyrical rather than contradictory, so the arc feels like a single, elongated breath rather than a compounding crucible. Still, the embodied emotion (“shivering bliss” versus “old wars”) is specific and the renunciation of armor carries visible cost, satisfying the Earned Stasis threshold.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the orchard’s lens clicks into a new alignment, the knight sheds armor, and the floating pear crystallizes the cost of choosing possibility over service. Causality is accumulative/textural—pattern, not plot—so the “forgotten patterns” act as the single tightening; the vellum map and blueprint drink the night, making the shift legible. The 9+ gate is missed only because the cost is felt more than articulated in a single, irreducible image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The greenhouse is not a backdrop but an active instrument: quicksilver ribbons constrain pruning choices, the canal carries liquid night that literally rewrites the map, and the hovering pear charges the final image. Spatial choreography is immaculate—armor drops in a legible sequence, shadows spell legible letters—so the orchard passes the 9+ gate test of constraining tactics. The slight undershoot is sensory overload: citrus constellations, syrup stars, and bell fruit sometimes compete for the same beat, muting selectivity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“shape of possibility”—is signaled in line 2 and deepened when the blueprint reveals wrist/hip placements, narrowing physical options to a single soft-bodied performance. Escalation is textural: each “unsnap” loosens armor and loneliness in parallel, culminating in the floating pear that refuses gravity. Cost is felt (exposure, lightness) but not irreversible; a sharper price would have pushed the score into the 8.8+ band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as an organic paradox: service without submission, cultivation without conquest. The orchard’s equations and lullabies fused in the program reprice the chivalric code into a horticulture of futures; no character sermonizes. The final image—the pear dimpling like an ocean—offers a non-literal answer to “what is possibility?” that reweights every prior celestial fruit.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is a sustained incantation: compressed syntax (“citrus constellations hung from branches like lamps”) and kinetic verbs (“unsnapped,” “threading,” “dimmed”) create a perceptual signature equal to the POV’s alchemical literacy. Rhythmic control accelerates across the loom-steps, then breathes at the hovering pear. No head-hop, no filter-verb stack; the lyric pattern is taught in the first paragraph and paid off in the last line.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Metaphor density is high but patterned—every vehicle is vegetal, astral, or metallurgical—so the risk of purple overload is mostly averted. One coherence slip: “the chill was not coldness, but a shivering bliss” edges toward self-contradiction, yet the paradox is intentional. Information density is excellent; no scaffold, no paraphrase loops. A single template cadence (“He…then he…”) appears but does not touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The alchemical orchard as puppet-theater director is a fresh synthesis of portal-fantasy and eco-philosophy; the marionette program that literally digests night to reveal bodily blueprints is a risk that re-prices the entire quest trope. Specificity—quicksilver ribbons, bell fruit sound, mirror pears—anchors the concept so it cannot be transplanted without rewriting the whole tissue. The risk heightens stakes rather than obscuring them, meriting the upper-band bonus.</comment>
