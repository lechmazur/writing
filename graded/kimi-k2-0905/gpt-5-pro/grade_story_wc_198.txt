<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The saxophonist’s choice to “whisper without tone” in the final beats crystallizes prior interior contradiction—need to save the town vs. need to keep his name—and costs him the applause he once craved. Embodied emotion is sustained: “fog nests inside my chest…subtle feathers.” Backstory confession (“I wanted applause, a shine”) exactly primes the renunciation. One-axis flaw arc, but within 800 words the micro-choices earn the hush he dons.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens: each lyric return of drip/echo/code tightens the sonic net until negative-space silence ruptures it. Orientation of who/where/when is immediate (“I came before dawn…path led down”). Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration—silence frame holds prophecy at measurable cost (“the prophecy will nap…my whisper will ride the fog back”). Cost is legible: he forfeits renown to carry “the empty frame home.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Environment does not backdrop; it supplies tactical resource—prism atrium “catches and splits” the sax breath, literally weaponizing the grotto. Recurring ferns, stalactites, and pooling vowels track spatially and mirror internal refusal. Micro-setting of the sax body—pads “sealed eyelid” holding weather—constrains the act. Final beam “brushes the floor like a hand” recharges earlier stone-as-body metaphor, reweighting silence as benediction.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Single dominant stake—silence the prophecy—signaled early; pressure accrues through sensory density, not reversals. Protagonist agency is continual: answers code “with absence,” guides silence, shapes final breath-oval. The code’s promises (town forgetting, river dust) remain abstract; no concrete town asset is risked on page, slightly blunting cost visibility. Tightening holds under accumulative lens; final silence frame is felt forfeiture of acclaim.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of art’s necessary erasure emerges only through event: refusal to sound the note that would name/disarm the child. Subtext resides in gesture—packing damp case, “empty frame home.” No thematic statement delivered; final ledger “printed by absence” reweights prior motifs without moral. Avoids tidy binaries: prophecy paused, not killed; silence trusted to future hands.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Voice is a sustained lyric monologue whose syntax inhales/exhales with sax breath—long clauses swell, then fracture into lacunae. Diction stays within jazz-poet lexicon (“moon scale,” “ghost handwriting”). Patterned elision (“vested hush,” “negative beat”) is seeded early and paid off in closure. No head-hopping; psychic distance compresses under code assault without breaking cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Sentences perform double labor—description plus tactic: “the code licks my ears like a patient tide” advances both ambience and menace. Rhythm modulates from languid pre-dawn to clipped final buckle. One paraphrase loop (“promise held shut…melt its teeth”) is minor. No filter-verb stacks; metaphors cohere within sonic/aquatic field. Closure image is clean, uncluttered.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Merges jazz performance, cryptography, and ecological myth into an inevitable synthesis: silence as playable note that unmakes prophecy. Prism-grotto refracting breath into “ghost handwriting” is fresh visual logic. Risk taken—entire plot inside negative space—pays off without gimmickry. Could dock if “code as prophecy” trope feels familiar, but here it is literalized as drip-echo alphabet that musician counters with rests.</comment>
