<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The interiority is rich—“silence still has something to say to me”—and the mentor memory seeds a believable micro-choice: the single shutter click renouncing repeatability. Yet the trait “purposefully curious” is only labeled, never tested by a competing impulse; the blue message is received, not wrestled with. Still, the renunciation costs him the chance to keep shooting, so the arc earns its quiet stasis.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the shutter click forecloses the “second last” and the stained grain becomes a tiny monument whose conceptual cost is legible. Causality is sound—the warmed vial triggers the message exactly as seeded—but the lens is Accumulative/Textural; the deepening is the sky itself turning into product. One micro-drag: orientation (who funds the mirrors?) is slightly late, yet the final image reweights the premise, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The moonlit pumice, cold-iron smell, and pupil-like lake are selective, POV-filtered, and return in the final frame to charge the monument beat. The foil pennants micro-steer wind data for the inspector’s log, so environment shapes tactics. Camera, vial, and grain function as micro-settings that constrain the exact moment of closure. No credibility slips; spatial choreography holds throughout the pan and kneel.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“last unbranded dawn”—is signaled early and tightens when the mirror array actually flickers, forcing the one-click renunciation. Cost is visible: the inspector forfeits the safety of infinite shots, a palpable loss for a photographer. Escalation is Textural: the sky’s increasing brightness = rising ad value, not causal reversal, but the pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens. No off-stage resolutions; coincidence complicates but does not save.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the tension between documented scars and intangible memory; the crater logs keep impacts from myth, yet the inspector now creates a private myth with one frame and one grain. Subtext resides in silence vs. sale: “the hush before sunrise” becomes a sellable commodity. No final-paragraph moralizing; the reconfiguration is imagistic. The stained grain as monument reweights the idea of permanence without stating it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>First-person voice carries a scientist-poet diction—“meteors and reactions instead of clocks”—that remains within the crater inspector’s plausible lexicon. Rhythm swells and contracts with exposure lengths, mirroring photographic breath. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is consistent. The slight rise in lyric register at closure is earned by the earlier mentor echo.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Strong information density: one sentence often toggles between sensory ground, emotional stake, and procedural detail—“camera ticks with the last seconds of a long exposure, swallowing the Milky Way like bread.” Metaphors are spare and consistent; no mixed vehicle violations. One light scaffold: “the world has changed, but the stone remembers” is thematic summary, yet it is the only such line and serves as hinge into closure, so penalty is minor.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The fusion of crater cartography, film-era nostalgia, and orbital ad takeover is a fresh synthesis; no close echoes in current canon. The hourglass grain as time-delayed message capsule is a clever repurposing that feels inevitable once taught. Risk—the lyric, near-still plot—heightens rather than blunts stakes because the silence itself becomes contested real estate. Specificity throughout keeps the concept from drifting into allegory.</comment>
