<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The survivor’s refusal to mine the pool of regret is anchored by the geode-crystal beats and embodied memory; interiority stays concrete, never slides into label-speak. Micro-choices (signing the note, locking access) crystallize a hierarchy of values with visible cost. The stance shift is earned yet the partner Liyun remains functional furniture—no status pressure or distinct voice—so the relationship crucible is weak. Still, contradictory impulses act in-scene and the final renunciation carries causal weight just shy of 9-band purity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the protagonists lock the data, signing away funding—felt cost spelled in “the institution will hate us by morning.” Causal linkage holds throughout: because they released the noise seed, they locate the valley; because they refuse extraction, they accept professional exile. Orientation is taught lyrically early (“floating observatory creaks…”) and pays off in the final drift; no ambiguity under the Accumulative/Textural lens. Persistent constraint—the geode’s unmined thunder—shapes the final image, satisfying 9+ cost test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The floating observatory, salt flats, and geode crystal form a micro-setting triad that actively constrains every tactic: tilt calibration depends on deck flex; desert silence cues the pulse beat; geode placement stabilizes the readout. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true—engineer’s ears catch circuit-cool clicks, survivor’s tongue tastes iron. Spatial choreography is clean across gimbal moves and cable tethers. One notch below 9 only because atmospheric prose occasionally decorative rather than choice-forcing.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—refusal to commodify trauma—signals early and tightens once: the valley deepens, grant pressure looms, then the note seals forfeiture. Agency resides in the protagonists’ decision to damp at instability’s edge and lock access; no coincidence resolves. Cost is legible—career fallout, sleepless drift, the geode left as guardian. Escalation is single but sufficient; a second reversal would overstuff this lyric frame.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: the ethics of leaving wounds unharvested. Geode, salt, and spectral valley form a sparse but coherent motif set that reweights at closure—starlight-in-quartz now means refusal, not resource. Final image of flats accepting stars offers Conceptual Repricing: acceptance > exploitation. No moralizing paragraph; resonance built from withheld extraction and the crates-of-undrilled-silence image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>First-person survivor voice owns a distinct perceptual signature: hearing thunder inside stone, tasting iron when memory surges. Syntax flexes with stress—fragmented during blast recall, lengthened during calibration. No head-hopping; Liyun’s interior kept opaque, maintaining distance. Compression (“we whisper disturbances”) is taught early and paid off in the locked-access silence—lyric legibility preserved.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High information density—single sentences fuse sensory, technical, and emotional data (“steam hoods shiver… pulse”). Metaphors are coherent within physics of salt, quartz, sky; no mixed vehicles. Rhythm modulates: creak–gnaw–hiss sonic chain propels opening; final paragraph eases into long breaths. Minor scaffold: “like” similes cluster in first third (−0.2) but none muddy the climax, keeping the score firmly in high band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise—scientists hunting regret-wells from a balloon lab—feels inevitable yet unexampled; lyric-physics fusion avoids genre templates. Geode-as-seismograph and salt-as-unwritten-archive transform familiar objects into non-obvious instruments. Risky second-person ribbon (“you step through”) is brief and pattern-earned. Emotional specificity (rice as snow, ring slipping) grounds the concept; swap any detail and the fabric frays. Slight deduction for thematic echo phrase “unused potential pools” used twice; still, overall synthesis is fresh and memorable.</comment>
