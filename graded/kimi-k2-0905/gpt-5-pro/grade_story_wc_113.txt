<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The musician’s interior contradiction—obedience to art vs obedience to a ghost—is embodied in the rosin-on-paper micro-choice that triggers the rescue. His muted panic, tactile reverence for the program, and willingness to weaponize a harmonic show a hierarchy of values that crystallizes under pressure. The arc from passive listening to active disruption earns the “lately inspired” cost: he forfeits professional decorum and assumes the ghost’s risk. No label-speak; every thought is a physical sensation or action.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the program’s stains fade, reweighting the entire premise—ghost instruction is not to be decoded but embodied. The causal chain (watermark → harmonic → cracked bracket → north exit) is tight; each beat tightens options under Causal lens. Cost is legible in the single line “language seemed as clumsy as wet wood,” a persistent constraint that shapes the final silence. No orientation debt; anchors (who/where/when) are fixed by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Environment is not backdrop but instrument: the flooded pit constrains footing and acoustics, the lantern tremor times the harmonic, the mezzanine fracture answers the note. Micro-setting—the damp program cupped like an animal—charges the final image when it dries against the survivor’s chest. Spatial choreography never slips; water level, lantern swing, and exit vector are tracked through motion. The opera house’s smell of rope and varnish is recalled under stress, proving selective, POV-filtered specificity.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—prevent mass injury—surfaces at the watermark prophecy and tightens with each physical groan. Escalation is causal: because the musician trusts the ghost, he sabotages the downbeat; because he sabotages, the bracket fails early while the crowd is already moving. Visible price: he trades career safety for moral agency, felt in the hush that follows his “wrong” note. One meaningful tightening suffices; no repetition, no coincidence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: the space between notes becomes the space between lives, and the musician’s willingness to inhabit that limbo reconfigures heroism from performance to interruption. The fading stains at the end reprice the ghost’s code—not message but mutual breath. Subtext lives in gesture: the bow tightened before the false note is a vow. No moralizing; the final image of moon through broken cornice lets silence carry the ethical aftertaste.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>First-person texture is viola-specific: breath measured in bow hair, chords “unstruck,” harmonic “cracked glass.” Syntax lengthens during submerged listening, then snaps into staccato commands when the exit is shouted. No filter-verb clutter; perception is direct (“lanterns spoke in shivers”). Elision of the ghost’s face is pattern-taught early and paid off by the blank moonlit silence. Voice never drifts into orchestral cliché; even “thunder in the pipes” is literal plumbing.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Sentences do double duty: “I tightened my bow, slid the program under my shirt to dry, and listened” = action, object handling, and emotional cache in one line. Figurative language is sparse and precise—light as “trembling score,” silence that “mirrors mine.” No loops or synonym churn; “water” is never repeated without new physical consequence.的节奏随压力加速，但从未牺牲清晰性。Closure line “she lives there” is monosyllabic, releasing breath after tension.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses ghost story with orchestral sabotage—fresh synthesis rather than trope theft. The notion that a spirit prints warnings in water stains reconfigures disaster lore into score inscription. Specificity of the antique program’s bruised pages prevents generic haunting; the harmonic-as-crowbar turns music into tool. Risk of interrupting a live performance is taken fully; no retreat to metaphor. Final re-pricing of “in between spaces” as lived ethic, not trope, feels inevitable yet non-obvious.</comment>
