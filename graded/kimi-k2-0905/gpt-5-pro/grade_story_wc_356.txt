<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s olfactory gift and quiet ambition are vividly embodied; every beat of planting, masking, and breathing with the village is filtered through her peculiar sensitivity. Internal contradiction is subtle but present—she courts revulsion to teach stillness—yet the final cost is more collective than personal, so the arc feels slightly under-paid on the page. Still, her micro-choices (platform choice, willow-mask lesson, final sketch) track a credible shift from solitary experimenter to communal conductor.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: each donated scrap and smelled decay layer intensifies the stake until the bloom becomes a shared respiratory rite. Closure is a Charged Poise—the village exhales together, reconfigured—and the cost is the enduring stink they accept as new normal. One transition (seasons braid) is legible; orientation is swift and tree-top anchoring never wavers.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The swaying platform, cedar baskets, and wrapping-paper galaxies are not garnish—they steer tactics (where to plant, how to slow stench). Olfactory landscape replaces visual postcard, turning odor into geography that literally reroutes bodies. Final image of “braided hands” of air and villagers fuses micro-setting to theme, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—can stillness be trained inside motion?—tightens as smell threatens social rupture. Mid-story “panic skittering” beat forces Mara to improvise masks, narrowing options from solitary experiment to communal covenant. Cost is visceral: everyone chooses to inhale the unbearable, forfeiting permanent olfactory comfort.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges via scent-as-teacher: serenity is not absence of stench but attention inside it. No moralizing; the final line leaves ambiguity—tide keeps turning. Subtext of collaboration over control is earned through shared inhalation rather than stated.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person stays tight to Mara’s perceptual grammar—smells trigger weather, memory, caution. Syntax sways like bridges: long breathy clauses interrupted by staccato whiffs. No head-hop; even crowd reaction is filtered through her nose and sketching hand.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Lyric density is high yet purposeful; every figurative stretch (cathedral of odor, braided hands) pays off in closure image. Occasional stacked modifiers—“generous drift of leaves”—risk purple but never break causality. Zero loops or scaffold; paragraph cuts are clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Corpse-flower-as-pedagogy is fresh, yet story’s real invention is turning olfactory disgust into communal meditation tech. Risk—stench as spiritual teacher—could slide into gimmick but is grounded by tactile compost, coffee grounds, willow masks. Specificity makes trope feel inevitable.</comment>
