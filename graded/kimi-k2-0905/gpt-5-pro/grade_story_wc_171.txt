<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Protagonist’s contradictory impulses (negotiator vs. lifelong guilt) act simultaneously in-scene; the reed vow physically embodies a cost that forecloses speech if peace ruptures. Interiority stays concrete (“I take names on the clipboard and let the ink dry slow, so every letter remembers its weight”). Micro-choice hierarchy is visible: silence > reputation > future children. Final endurance is earned by prior causality and leaves visible cost (leaving the clipboard behind). Hairline slip: “operative gentleness” asserted more than dramatized in a second beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure = Earned Stasis: negotiator sacrifices voice, clipboard left as material seal; cost legible. Causal lens holds: each ritual step narrows options (“If violence returns, it will snap and I will fall silent”). Orientation clear by line 4; no disorientation penalty. One meaningful tightening: public confession of 27 deaths forces final vow. −0.2 because the planets’ alignment seam is named but never visibly changes tactics or timing on-page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Ancient terrace stones, cracked balustrades, bowls of river-and-ash create tactile micro-setting that guides ritual choreography and constrains where delegates stand. Warm stones, lichen, tide-smell on paper supply sensory triangulation without catalogue excess. Spatial choreography remains coherent: west edge, stool exchange, clipboard pressed to steam. Setting charges final image: reed shadow across charred wrist embodies the peace seal.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake = negotiator’s own redemption vs regional peace; signaled early (“Tonight my motive is simple and heavy”). Escalation: secret massacre revealed → negotiator offers breath-bond → silence vow narrows future options; price visible (no more speech for any army). Agency is renunciation/ritual invention, not external rescue. Coincidence absent; no reversal beyond the one tightening, sufficient for 600-800 word scope.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges: redemption is not absolution but an ongoing, visible burden carried together. Subtext lives in gesture (swapping stools, knees knock) and object (clipboard drinking signatures). No moral sermon; final line is imagistic charge. Reed-as-hinge reweights earlier “distance adjustment” motif, crystallizing that silence, not victory, is the price.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>First-person voice carries distinct perceptual signature: legal-bureaucratic diction mixed with sensuous ritual detail. Rhythmic control escalates through breath-cadence imperative (“I take a breath… and they follow”). No head-hopping; POV modesty maintained (narrator guesses General’s nod meaning). Filter verbs serve voice (“the ebony accepting marks as if it were nighttime soil”). Reed vow is syntactic crescendo that feels inevitable, not gimmick.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence runs. High information density: single line often layers ritual act, sensory detail, and internal calculation. Metaphors stay coherent (“the seam will close like a wound” fits wound/trauma frame). Minor scaffold: two adjacent sentences start with “I take/ask” but pattern taught early and reprised at closure, so forgiven. Final image line is crisp and propulsive.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Familiar peace-talk trope is inverted: victory = self-silencing, not treaty. Reed-over-tongue ritual feels freshly invented yet culturally believable. Specific detail (charred wrist, river-from-both-banks) grounds premise. Synthesis of celestial seam + clipboard + breath oath creates memorable signature. Risk in lyric register paid off by coherent closure.</comment>
