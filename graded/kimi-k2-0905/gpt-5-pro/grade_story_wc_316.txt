<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The narrator’s contradictory impulses—yearning for feeling yet fearing the return of pain—are embodied in the micro-choice to touch the jar; the cost is the audible crack of numbness. Interiority stays concrete and character-specific, avoiding therapy-speak. The final stance (carrying the jar together) is earned because the narrator’s palms-on-glass act triggers the brain’s verdict that reorders custody. Flaw: Ori’s voice is vivid but the other half-siblings blur into a collective anchor-eye, slightly diluting relationship pressure.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the shared lift of the jar crystallizes a new guardianship pact with undeniable social cost—no one owns the seed once the forest arrives. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout: each opposite gesture (salt/sweet, fan open/close) layers density until the chimes fall silent, reweighting stakes without a causal zig-zag. Orientation is taught early via the floating dojo and torn horizon, paying off when the dojo lowers to let history "step on." Persistent constraint: the brain’s pulse-words etch fog that cannot be unsaid, shaping tactics at the end.</comment>

<comment>The floating rock dojo isn’t backdrop—it supplies the aerial courtroom whose sky-edge air rights are literally at stake, forcing the hearing to be held there. The bamboo blade and brain-jar function as micro-setting: their tactile handling (strike, palm-press) constrains the verdict moment. Spatial choreography is crisp: bodies move from separate rocks to joint jar-carry without drift. Weather is integrated—the chimes measure thought like weather, then still to signal assent, charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—emotional numbness vs. shared guardianship—tightens when the narrator’s palm-touch vivifies the brain, foreclosing sole ownership. One meaningful deepening: the kata of fan open/close bridges law and breath, narrowing options to mutual custody. Cost is legible: the jar’s silence becomes a lawful signature, stripping the city of parcel-by-parcel wind rights. Pressure stays coherent under Accumulative lens; no reversal is needed because density accretes to the final hush.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: ownership of self and seed becomes impossible once life outgrows its origin. The brain’s final pulse—“a seed is not a thing but a direction”—reprises the earlier label “duplicate” and reweights it as liberation, not stigma. Subtext lives in gesture: the fans’ open/close space is the unclaimable bridge, implying law must breathe. No moralizing; the closing image of co-carried jar offers resonant, non-literal answer to the custody question.</comment>

<comment>Voice is lyric yet controlled, teaching its pattern by line 3: “history rewrites itself” signals syntactic recursion that peaks in the final “coauthor the next day.” Perceptual signature is distinct—balance “stopped arguing,” memory “shaking,” chimes “settled into a heart”—all filtered through a body relearning feeling. No head-hopping; even Ori’s kata is observed from narrator’s anchored lens. Rhythm modulates: longer accumulative sentences build to the abrupt “verdict arose,” mirroring the tonal hush.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>High information density: “salt to tongue and sweet to breathing” packs taste, body, and metaphor in five words. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances stakes or texture. Metaphors stay coherent—jar, chimes, fans form a wind-instrument motif that never contradicts its own physics. Only micro-slip: “a tidal alphabet” is slightly strained, but occurs early and does not touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fusion of clone-custody courtroom with floating zen dojo feels inevitable, not grafted. The bamboo blade that “slices pretense with a whisper” transforms familiar martial trope into philosophical scalpel. Conceptual risk—brain-in-jar as legal witness—pays off by repricing ownership itself. Specificity: “fans opened/closed to create unclaimable bridge” could not swap with any other object without collapsing the verdict mechanic.</comment>
