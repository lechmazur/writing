<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The guide’s interiority is rich—“the way a lighthouse talks to the dark”—and his inherited lens and bread-ritual reveal a believable caretaker whose flaws (stoic over-function, dread-as-perfume) stay consistent. Micro-choices—holding twin lenses to the cataract, matching loaves to costumes—earn the final crossing. Yet the cast swells to “children and grandmothers,” blurring individual arcs; only Anno is named, so relationship pressure stays diffuse.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: the steady accretion of damp, echo, wax, crumbs, and song tightens stakes until the trunk’s discovery reconfigures “museum” into “stage.” Orientation is anchored by ~110 words; the final image—labels blooming under green light—delivers Charged Poise with felt cost: the roar will keep erasing them. No meaningful escalation mid-text, but the single deepening is decisive.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The grotto’s limestone nibbles, dripping corridors, and sluice-door initials are never backdrop; they guide when and where the party can cross. The waterfall’s roar acts as ceiling, metronome, and eventual curtain—its pressure charging the final lens-reveal. Micro-setting (the opera lenses, bread as alphabet) doubles as terrain and tool, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</question><comment>Dominant stake—“rescue dying arts from the dark”—is signaled early; pressure accumulates as wax and memory dwindle. The trunk’s discovery tightens options: now art must be worn, sung, and eaten, not merely archived. Cost is visible—costumes damp, voices “small against the waterfall”—but no tactical loss alters later moves; escalation is atmospheric, not tactical.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: history is a loaf that rises only when shared warm. The motif of edible letters re-weights at closure when breads become name-matched costumes, making “homecoming” felt without moralizing. Dread-as-scent and honey-smoke keep ambiguity alive; no final thesis is stated.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</question><comment>First-person voice is consistent, cadenced, synesthetic—“perfumed by rosewater dread,” “bees trapped in porcelain caves.” Compression (“We threaded back… the roar closed over us”) is taught early and paid off in the final shelf-close. No dialogue to test, but interior diction stays within a guide’s cultured lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</question><comment>Rhythm breathes with scene needs—long humid sentences swell, then clip when “the cold would shy.” Metaphors are coherent: cataract as notation, loaves as letters. One scaffold detected: “we carried breads as signatures and ration both” slightly restates prior beat; no loops touch the closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Flood-besieged museum-behind-curtain feels fresh; edible alphabet bread and emerald lens twins ground the conceit in tactile specificity. Risk is moderate—lyric accumulative structure—but not radical. The trunk reveal risks deus-ex-sluice, yet the earlier bread-initials foreshadow, so inevitability feels earned.</comment>
