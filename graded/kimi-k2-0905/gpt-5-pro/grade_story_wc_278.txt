<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The narrator’s guilt is embodied through tactile ritual (amber lens, red tether, silver ink) and every micro-choice is tethered to the nephew’s death; the final tattooing of the name lands as earned renunciation with visible cost. Interiority stays concrete—”chiming that never fades” rather than abstract guilt. The contradiction between translating cries and misreading the one that mattered drives every beat. No diagnostic self-talk, only sensory confession.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the firmware sleeps, the fold smooths, the name glows—cost is the permanent frost inside the chest now externalized as star-writing. Causality holds: each letter dictates a physical act that reconfigures the machine and the self. The amber–insect metronome bridges guilt and repair, paying off the opening image. Time-fold logic is taught early and crystallizes when the narrator’s own initials loop through the nephew’s.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The laboratory is rendered through sound-hoarding reels, lantern-eyed machines, and meteor hush—each detail doubles as emotional filter. The amber shifts from lens to saint to cooling palm, constraining every tactical choice. Spatial choreography is clean: tether, credenza, console, ink form a single ritual circuit. Weathered scent of ash/lavender anchors the antique drawer as lived-in memory.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—silence the dissonance of old guilt—tightens when the nephew’s cry rises from the reels, forcing the final naming. Agency is ritual inscription; each silver constellation forecloses denial and pays with permanent visibility. No external antagonist needed: the haunted firmware externalizes the narrator’s own chorus. Cost is the irrevocable tattoo of the name across steel, trading private frost for public star.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the inverse of translation: giving the lost sound a body instead of giving the living a voice. The insect trapped mid-flight becomes the emblem of paused grief, reweighted when it “blinks” at the end, suggesting motion after stasis. No moralizing—wisdom is the unsaid recognition that forgiveness is a cadence, not a verdict. Final image of cooling amber re-prices the premise: guilt is not erased but held, translucent.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Voice is synesthetic—”velour thrown over a careless universe”—and stays within the tattooist’s perceptual range. Compression like “rain on teeth” teaches the reader to accept elliptical causality. Rhythm modulates: long clauses for fold-time, staccato for console boot, hymn-like for lullaby release. No filter verbs; perception is direct—”I speak the word into the room.”</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Figurative density is high yet purposeful: every metaphor is a tool—velour hush blankets sound, mothlight fans scatter memory. No mixed metaphors; vehicles stay acoustic or celestial. Scaffolding is minimal; sentences carry double duty—”silver constellations / path for a sound.” Read-aloud rhythm breathes with ritual pacing, climaxing in the single-line lullaby release.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>Fusion of tattoo artistry, obsolete audio tech, and time-fold cosmology feels inevitable, not grafted. The amber–insect as non-judging metronome is a fresh emotional engine. Risk of lyric overload is embraced and repaid when the insect “blinks,” turning object into witness. No stock grief template; the nephew’s absence is singularized by the untranslatable cry.</comment>
