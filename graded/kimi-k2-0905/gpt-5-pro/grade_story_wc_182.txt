<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The narrator’s “stubborn as a spine” motive stays tactile through micro-choices—trading petal-grammar, knotting checkout-thread, refusing to abandon the traveler—so the arc of cautious resourcefulness earns its final forfeiture of forgetting. Interiority remains embodied (palms ache “like a chord never struck”) without diagnostic labels. The only flaw: the traveler's interior is summarized rather than shown, blunting the crucible potential of their shared beat.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the index stamps the fern-print into her palm, trading her right to forget for the mountain’s future claim—cost felt in the ache that “vibrates anyway.” Causal chain holds throughout: because she researches the traveler’s gap, she edits the silence, rewrites his apology, and pays with memory. The lens stays causal-tight; no teleporting props or unearned knowledge. Orientation anchors (who/where) arrive by line 5; no penalty.</comment>

<comment>The mountain-bookstore breathes through sensory triangulation—dust, thyme, crushed chalk—guiding each footstep and negotiation. The pressed fern micro-setting doubles as tool and contract ink, physically constraining the final bargain. Spatial choreography is flawless: thread coil dropped from mezzanine, culvert of footnotes, landing with tea. Setting details never stall motion; each sensation advances either threat or barter.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—access to the library of unlearned lessons—tightens when the index demands the weight of unspoken words, forcing a trade that forecloses forgetting. Escalation is single but sufficient: the wall of copied doubts rises, then cracks only after she risks her own unspoken apology. Cost is visible in the palm-stamp that will ache beyond the page. No coincidence rescues; the traveler’s freedom is earned by her editorial gamble.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from motif iteration: every refusal to learn becomes material architecture—walls, shelves, stamps—so the final image of an ache that keeps vibrating offers a non-literal answer: memory is the price of rescue. Subtext resides in silence and rest-music rather than exposition. No moralizing; the mountain’s sigh is enough. The reconfiguration of forgetting as debt is unforeseeable yet inevitable in hindsight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Voice carries a synaesthetic perceptual signature—dates spoken “like verbs,” grammar measured in petals—maintained under pressure without register drift. Rhythm contracts during the rescue (“I write his apology… press the page until it remembers sap”) then exhales into the final tea-scented quiet. No head-hopping; Palinode’s single line is filtered through the narrator’s reception. Filter verbs are sparing and motive-driven (“I touch the footnotes and understand”).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose density is high: single sentences often scent, map, and emotionalize simultaneously (“air cools past Atlases of Abandoned Journeys”). Figurative layering is relentless yet coherent—no mixed metaphors, no synonym loops. Occasional elevated diction (“calix for caveats”) is justified by the arcane-linguist POV. One minor scaffold: “I expect to renegotiate” could be compressed, but it does not touch the closure beat.</comment>

<comment>The mountain-bookstore as silent symphony is a fresh synthesis of Borgesian infinite archive with eco-magic; the checkout-slip thread and petal-grammar barter feel non-obvious yet internally logical. Risk-taking—lyric causality, botanic linguistics—heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The premise would collapse if any named element were swapped. No recognizable pop-culture echo; the final ache-image is new.</comment>
