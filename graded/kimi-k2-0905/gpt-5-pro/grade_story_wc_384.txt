<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Interiority is rich and embodied (“the cold sang through stone,” “wrist steadied by forgiveness”), but the mentor remains off-stage and the single on-page character’s contradictory impulses are only implicitly dramatized; the final renunciation (leaving the hinge on his own name untouched) is foreshadowed yet still feels slightly abstract rather than viscerally paid for.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the decree sighs, chains slacken, and the protagonist accepts an unopened door in himself—cost is the pricked blood and the permanent partial freedom; under the Accumulative/Textural lens the drip-cadence and aurora flares tighten meaning until the final image reweights the city’s obedience without requiring causal reversals; no orientation debt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marble, oculus, stalactite drips, and refracted aurora are filtered through a calligrapher’s eye for line and texture; the sanctuary’s cold surface and micro-condensate literally become ink, constraining the act of rewriting; spatial choreography is clean; only the river guilds remain off-page abstractions, a minor loss of specificity.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—unlinking guilds from war-foundry tax-chains—is signaled early; escalation is textural: each drip, aurora flare, and counter-stroke cumulatively slackens the carved decree; the protagonist’s agency is the thorn-guided rewriting, but pressure stays intellectual rather than bodily, keeping the cost cerebral rather than visceral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: calibrated treason as mercy that refuses total erasure; no moralizing statement—wisdom is left in the quietly warmer marble; the unfinished mentor folio and the untouched hinge in the protagonist’s name create lingering ambiguity that invites reflection without confusion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>First-person voice is lyric, compressed, and consistent—syntax mimics ink strokes and drip rhythm; no dialogue, so no voice convergence; patterned elision (“a key with no apparent lock”) is taught early and paid off at closure; perceptual signature remains sharp even under aurora shimmer.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</question><comment>Sentence rhythm varies from long aurora sweeps to clipped drip-counts; occasional poetic stacking (“slow needles,” “calm sea under wounds”) borders on overwriting but stays motif-driven; no scaffold loops; one mixed metaphor—“rivers, not gates”—is allowed by doctrine; final line achieves charged poise without figurative muddle.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</question><comment>Fresh synthesis: calligraphic forgery as gentle revolution, oath-grammar as physical hinge, aurora light as writable ink; risk is quiet—refusing to open the last door in oneself—but coherence never falters; transformation test fails: swap any other artisan and the concept collapses, confirming specificity.</comment>
