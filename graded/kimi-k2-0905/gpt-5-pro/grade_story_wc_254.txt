<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The poet’s internal contradiction—wanting to cross boundaries yet refusing violence—remains abstract; we never feel the tug between those impulses in a single, embodied beat. His aesthetic drive surfaces only as narrative label (“still aesthetically driven”) rather than forcing a visible trade-off on the page. The custodians’ shift from wariness to open faces is asserted, not dramatized; no micro-choice shows the moment their stance alters. Closure rides a conceptual, not personal, cost: the boundary dissolves, but the poet’s own stakes feel static, so the renunciation is more idea than ache.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a clear Resonant Reconfiguration: the quartz colonnade’s tone drops from cathedral to throat, the ice reconsiders itself, and “we changed the world by listening” reframes the ban. Causality is lyric-accumulative rather than tight because/therefore, but the pattern is taught early and paid off in the final image, satisfying the Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation anchors within 120 words; atrium, lake, and poet are placed. No meaningful cost is dramatized inside the poet—his body, notebook, or reputation remain untouched—so the conceptual price, while legible, lacks a felt personal tariff that would lift this into the 9-band.</comment>

<comment>The frozen lake is not backdrop; its “older idea of separations” sleeps beneath and is literally renegotiated when the poet’s palm persuades ice to remember water. Quartz colonnade operates as both tool and environmental score, constraining action by harmonic permission. Sensory hierarchy skews to sound and temperature, matching the POV’s synesthetic ear. Spatial choreography remains coherent across the atrium→doors→lake traversal; bodies track without drift. The lantern-moth hush and cold-ink smell are selective, not catalogued, and evolve with the tonal shift at closure, recharging the same sensory signature.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—liberating the ban without violence—tightens once: the poet’s live paraphrase turns enforcement into invitation, directly lowering the colonnade’s tone and thinning the ice. Escalation is accumulative: each re-worded phrase loosens quartz tension; the hum drop is the visible price. Agency is verbal and aesthetic, not physical, fitting the lyric lens. No secondary reversal is needed at this length; the single cadence shift suffices. Cost is social-conceptual rather than personal—boundaries dissolve—but because the poet sacrifices nothing individual, the price feels collective, blunting the high-band requirement for a visceral tariff.</comment>

<comment>Theme emerges without statement: paraphrase as erosion of power, listening as civic act. The final wall inscription crystallizes the concept into an aphorism that reweights every prior image, achieving Conceptual Repricing. Subtext operates in the colonnade’s harmonic consent and the custodians’ silent recalibration; nothing is announced as moral. Ambiguity is meaningful—will the new permissions survive daylight?—and unresolved without confusion. Sentimentality is avoided; tenderness is vested in ice, quartz, and breath, not in triumphal humanism.</comment>

<comment>Third-person lyric, stable throughout. Perceptual signature is synesthetic-cloud: “lantern-moth hush,” “spine of light tuned to lost permissions,” “granular with new permission.” Syntax lengthens and compresses with harmonic tension, mirroring the colonnade’s drone. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk is zero; diction stays within the poet’s plausible poetic lexicon without drifting into corporate register. Patterned elision (“he was born in a village…”) is taught early and paid off in the final inscription; clarity never breaks.</comment>

<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm modulates from hymnal cadence to breath-beat: “ cathedral to throat / lanterns line / older idea of water.” No template cadence or synonym churn detected; metaphors stay coherent within the synesthetic cloud logic. High information density: one sentence often fuses sensory, emotional, and world rule (“the ice does not crack; it reconsiders”). Minor scaffold: “the poet pauses, hears…” is a soft filter; one such instance does not dull momentum. Closure line is lean and image-based, sustaining propulsion.</comment>

<comment>Premise fuses lyric physics with bureaucratic paraphrase as revolutionary act—fresh synthesis. Quartz colonnade as tuning fork for policy is specific to this world; trope of “poet saves city” is subverted by non-heroic soft entry. Boundary dissolution via salt metaphor is precise and re-animates a dead abstract. Final inscription is a new axiom, not platitude, because earned by sonic evidence. The risk of ambient lyric stasis is taken and survived because ice physically changes under fingertip, grounding concept in material pay-off.</comment>
