<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fen’s interior contradiction—cataloguer vs. releaser—drives every beat; the moment he tips the drawers into wind, the cost (his life’s archive) is palpable. Embodied emotion stays moss-green and tactile, never drifting into label-speak. The renunciation feels inevitable because the micro-choices (thumbnail lens, tremor-listening) foreshadow surrender. One hairline slip: “like bark after fire” edges toward simile cliché, barely nicking perfection.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each leaf-arch adds density until the pattern breaks with the moonstone flare, re-weighting order→release. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the arbor lifts, villages stay suspended, Fen’s hearing widens—cost legible in emptied pockets. No orientation debt; who/where/when anchored by whale-arbor in line 1. Causality is poetic but traceable: misread→tilt→catastrophe averted only by letting go.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Skyborne arbor functions as micro-setting: its bark seams, resin scent, and leaf-chimes directly constrain Fen’s grammar-building choices. The moonstone speck’s frost-flare is a tactile prop that re-configures vision at climax. Sensory hierarchy obeys Fen’s seed-sorter profession—texture over sight, taste of ash-candy over vista. Without the arbor’s creaking hush, the final release would lose spatial cost.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—villages will spill if leaves are misread—threads every paragraph; tension tightens from monument #1 to waist-high scaffold. Agency remains Fen’s: each prod is a decision that risks tilt. The single deepening (moonstone flare→“release not store”) narrows options irreversibly. Cost is conceptual but felt: the instant his catalogued towers become wind-dust, future security is foreclosed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from grammar vs. gust: order is a question, listening the only honorable answer—never sermonized, enacted. Subtext in silence: birds mute, resin gathers, implying world consent to his surrender. Recurring moonstone shifts from decoding tool to surrender catalyst, re-pricing “clarity” as weightless. Final image of open hands answers the central question without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Voice maintains moss-green perceptual signature throughout: “palms greened,” “taste ash and candy,” “hearing widened into color.” Syntax lengthens and breathes with scaffold-building, then fractures in shortRelease clauses mimicking scattered seeds. No head-hopping; single POV stays pinned to Fen’s thumbnail lens. Lyric elision (“sequences, slopes, pauses, and accents”) is taught early and paid off in final chime.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm pulses from whale-sentence to fragment (“release, not store; scatter, not save”) without algorithmic pattern. Metaphors are arboreal-consistent (whale, bark, resin) and never mixed. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence adds leaf, bone, or gust detail. Opening and closing lines bookend with lift/landing motion, securing cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: dendrolinguistics—tree as grammar, sorter as translator—feels inevitable yet un-mined. Risk of preciousness is neutralized by tactile cost (empty drawers, waist-high monument collapsing). Folklore shift from “arbor remembers” to “sorter forgets on purpose” re-weights tradition without gimmick. Transformation test fails if relocated: only an airborne memory-tree could demand seed-scattering as survival.</comment>
