<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Anya’s contradictions—insomniac yet patient, methodical yet dream-driven—stay active in every micro-choice. Her body registers fatigue through terracotta warmth and mint scent rather than labels. The renunciation of sleep and the open-door policy carry visible cost: she banks the lamps alone, palms inkless vow. One slip: the “methodically hopeful” tag is asserted twice; still, the trait is dramatized by the ledger she keeps at dawn.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: Anya presses the keep-glyph into her skin, crystallizing the wager that tomorrow’s strangers will return. The moonlit path, the breathing greenhouse, and the ledger’s coin-for-thyme entries all re-weight the premise with felt cost. Causality is accumulative: each painted word seeds a reciprocal gift, tightening the obligation to continue. No lens ambiguity; the pattern is taught by line 4 and paid off in the final inkless pulse.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The smog-choked city is filtered through Anya’s lungs and fern breath; greenhouse glass refracts neon into exhausted fruit, constraining visibility and forcing tactile navigation. Terracotta pot, cracked pane, and rain barrel act as micro-settings that determine where glyphs can be written and thus who will enter. Spatial choreography is flawless: courier → violinist → nurse → boy, each arrival cued by a new written surface. Only the saffron quiet risks atmospheric sameness, but it modulates to mint steam and thyme coin, keeping the sense palette alive.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prove kindness is memorable—tightens when each stranger’s recognition triggers a reciprocal gift that increases Anya’s obligation to keep the door open. The meaningful deepening occurs at the janitor’s unasked refill: the system now sustains itself, narrowing her option to ever close. Cost is legible in her dawn exhaustion and the ledger’s evidence of sleepless labor. No reversal, but the accumulative pressure under Accumulative/Textural lens is sufficient for this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the ledger’s literal accounting of kindness, not thesis statements. The lost languages motif reframes literacy as hospitality: to read is to welcome. Final image of the inkless keep-glyph reweights prior glyphs from words into scars, making the theme of custodianship undeniable. No moralizing; the resonance is purely imagistic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Perceptual signature is painterly: light pools like milk, neon smears like exhausted fruit, vowels trade for bread. Syntax favors compound metaphors that compress scent, touch, and memory into one stroke. Rhythm accelerates with each arrival, then exhales into the long final sentence that mirrors the moon’s slide west. Zero filter verbs; every image is delivered through Anya’s hand or nostril.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentence variety is painter-brush varied: long pigment-loaded clauses alternate with staccato arrivals. No paraphrase loops; “watered by feel, as if reading braille across roots” performs two jobs—tactile and metaphoric—in one breath. One near-muddle: “saffron quiet deepened” is used thrice; the repetition is purposeful cadence but borders artifact. Otherwise information density is high without purple drift.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The moon-tipped brush that drinks light instead of ink is a fresh inflection on the magic tool trope; it literalizes the idea that language can be nourishment. Coupling insomnia with nocturnal hospitality turns a clinical condition into civic infrastructure. Risk—letting strangers wander in—pays off through the janitor’s unsolicited refill, proving the experiment self-sustaining. Specificity of harbor cant on hibiscus leaf makes the concept unswapable.</comment>
