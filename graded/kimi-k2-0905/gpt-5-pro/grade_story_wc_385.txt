<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is lyrical but stays embodied; the shell’s warmth and hiss tether abstraction to flesh. The choice to sing for every stolen half crystallizes a value hierarchy—voice as gift, not commodity—yet the council’s flight feels slightly convenient, trimming the cost that would push this to 9+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the canyon’s echo-market is short-circuited when names return untendered, a social cost made legible in the glittering syllables. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each sung layer thickens pattern until the final image reweights the premise. Orientation is taught by the second sentence; disorientation serves the lyric pattern and is repaid at closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The serpentine nexus functions as micro-setting: its coiled walls force the singer to crawl and later to stand where breath can reroute echoes. Shell, body, and stone each constrain choice; the final image of sunlight feeding the shell charges the closing beat. Sensory hierarchy favors sound over sight, matching the POV’s profession.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recovering the physics of echo versus silence—tightens when the council admits the canyon banks abandoned voices as interest. One meaningful deepening: mother’s voice reveals the singer’s own debt, turning abstract inquiry into personal cost. Price is legible yet diffuse; the council’s retreat blunts the final pinch.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the tension between voice as currency and voice as kinship; the shell’s final braid of instructions reconfigures “echo” from obedience to mutual recognition. No moral is stated—resonance arrives in the image of sunlight warming the emptied shell, a quiet Conceptual Repricing that invites rereading.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>First-person lyric sustains a reed-blown cadence without monotony; perceptual signature filters every observation through auditory metaphor. Patterned elision (“songs carry a reed-blown melancholy”) is taught early and paid off when the final breath steers surf into stone. No head-hopping; psychic distance stays tight to the singer’s hollow-tuned throat.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm mimics canyon delay—long caesuras followed by clipped revelations—propelling without scaffold. Figurative density is high but purposeful; mixed metaphors are avoided. One paraphrase loop (“the universe hums its secret song” appears twice) slightly dulls momentum; otherwise diction stays specific and propulsive.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The echo-market of stolen voice-halves feels freshly mythic yet socially precise, reframing real-world silencing as literal commerce. Risk lies in the lyric refusal of a physical showdown; the payoff is the crystallized notion that harmony—echo reunited with source—breaks the bank. Transformation is irreversible: the story collapses if the shell is swapped for any generic talisman.</comment>
