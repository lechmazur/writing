<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The painter’s interior contradiction—trading another’s heartbeat to keep their own honesty—shows simultaneously in the locket’s ticking and the refusal to promise Lio certitude. Their calm is never placid; it trembles in the wrist-tilt that bends light into the mirror-door and in the whispered admission “a possibility, not a promise.” Micro-choice hierarchy is legible: they kneel to the child, yield the locket, then withdraw, paying with permanent exposure of their method. The borrowed pulse’s cost is dramatized, not labeled, and the renunciation of full control satisfies Earned Stasis.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the terrace’s “second city” heartbeat is felt at the parapet, reweighting every prior mirror-glimpse with the cost of shared belief. The causal chain is tight—storm → prism light → painter’s arrival → coded song → mirror opening → communal loan of pulse → bells sever the spell—each because/therefore link narrows possibility toward communal endurance. No orientation debt; who/where/when anchored by line 3. Lens holds Accumulative/Textural: density of refrain (“hush before bells,” “prism parapet after rain”) intensifies until the final image crystallizes the new civic rhythm.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The echoing terrace is not backdrop but instrument: its balustrades cup puddled sky, its bricks drink rainbow bands, its wells breathe when lullabied. Spatial choreography is flawless—bodies orbit the wells, slate meets parapet, light pools exactly where breath is held. Weather residue (slick bricks, swallows) constrains footstep hesitation and times the mirror awakening. Micro-setting qualifies: the prism parapet re-appears with reweighted meaning, now a civic second heart.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can the city relearn reflective hope—tightens when the painter exchanges personal honesty (the borrowed heartbeat) for communal possibility. Escalation is textural: each mirrored “unspent maybe” thickens the cost of belief until the crowd’s tapped rolling pins become the city’s new pulse. The decisive deepening occurs when Lio’s slate, once blank, fills with light-ferried words, visibly paying the price of anticipation. Bell peal ends the hush, but the forfeited privacy of the painter’s method forecloses retreat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: reflection is incomplete unless refracted through shared vulnerability. The borrowed heartbeat motif migrates from personal meter to civic rhythm, re-pricing solitude as collective liability. Final image of “second city beside the first” answers the thematic question—how to see around corners—by making communal sight the残留 cost. No moralizing; resonance is purely imagistic.</question>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice owns a synesthetic cadence—“swallows spooled their quiet,” “banding shadows like measured breaths”—taught early and held without slippage. Perceptual signature is painter-specific: skies are “puddled,” songs are “coded lullabies,” time is “the hush before bells.” Rhythm modulates from elongated vowels (dusky harmony) to staccato taps (bakers’ pins, children’s claps) under rising pressure. No head-hopping; collective chant remains exterior, filtered through painter’s ear.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Figurative density is high but patterned—rainbow, mirror, heartbeat form an interlaced set paid off in the final image. No mixed metaphors; “puddled skies” stays liquid, “spooled quiet” stays thread-taut. Information density strong: one sentence often sets scene, mood, and causal cue (“prism parapet after rain threw unsubtle rainbows”). Minor scaffold: “after rain” repeats twice early; does not recur in closure, so −0.2 only.</question>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</question><comment>Premise—mirage painter who trades heartbeats to teach mirrors possibility—feels fresh yet inevitable within fabulist city lore. Specificity of coded children’s songs as keys, and slate-as-screen, prevents abstract drift. Final reconfiguration of civic heartbeat is non-obvious and grows from established pattern. Risk in lyric compression heightens coherence rather than obscuring it.</comment>
