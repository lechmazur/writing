<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The aromatherapist-narrator’s anosmia and “listening to water and to people” give a specific, character-bound way of perceiving; micro-choices (warming hands, refusing to remove the screw) enact a hierarchy of values—story over mechanism. The midwife’s single nod and “jaw like someone holding back a hillside” externalize her pressure and create a crucible that alters mutual stance. Interiority stays concrete, avoids therapy-speak, and the final quiet hand-touch on the dome shows earned endurance with felt cost. No secondary pressure from Master Isidor beyond helper role, but within the two-character limit this is acceptable.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the screw remains, the bone pin is added, water speaks “like forgiveness that remembers the work ahead.” The cost—accepting flawed time, mid-wife’s grief, narrator’s permanent sensory loss—is legible in the final image. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of water-drops, breath-fog, and quiet hand-moves thickens until the cadence shift at the final line (“tiny applause shaped like water meeting time”). No orientation debt; anchors (who/where/when) clear within first 90 words.</comment>

<comment>The glass dome, fogged by deliberate breath, becomes micro-setting that must be negotiated before the screw can be eased; its condensation stripes guide the wire angle and directly constrain the fix. Tool specificity—bone pin drawer, thin wire, felt washer—grounds occupational plausibility without exposition dump. “Water binds at the screw” gives tactile physical logic that governs the climax beat. Spatial choreography is clean: three bodies around the bench, hands, dome, screw tracked without drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—honor the midwife’s lived time without erasing trauma—signaled when she names the clock “Time for a first cry.” Escalation is textural: each droplet stutters like an infant’s first breath, tightening the emotional cost until the screw’s partial release becomes the single meaningful turn that forecloses perfectionist repair. Agency is narrator’s refusal to extract the screw; price paid is acceptance of asymmetry, mirrored in the uneven but steady drip. Cost is visible on-page: midwife’s exhalation “that could have been a name.”</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from particular: midwife’s quilted time vs. uniform blanket—stitched by need, not measure. No overt thesis; final image of “tiny applause shaped like water meeting time” reweights earlier drops as communal mercy rather than mechanical precision. Subtext lives in gesture: silent blessing of the screw equates birth-work and repair-work. Complexity retained—grief not erased, smell not restored—avoiding tidy moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>First-person voice carries a distinct perceptual signature: replacing smell with “listening to water,” mapping emotion through drip intervals, noticing “rain script” on glass. Syntax remains calm, rhythmic, mirroring the “trembling calm” tone; no filter-verb clusters. Dialogue is minimal but distinguishable: midwife’s terse poeticism (“time is a quilt”) contrasts with narrator’s gentler metaphors. No head-hopping; Master Isidor stays external, voice intact.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm breathes with scene tension; sentence length varies from short percussive fragments (“They speak in minutes”) to longer flowing images. Figurative language is selective—no mixed metaphors; “water learning to speak” stays coherent within story logic. High information density: one sentence often shows tool, emotion, and symbolic overlay. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; “time drips” reprises purposely at closure. Copy-clean, no typos.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Premise—aromatherapist who lost smell repairing scentless water-clocks—offers non-obvious synthesis of sensory loss and mechanical empathy. Screw-as-midwife-memory transforms familiar “fix-the-object” plot into meditation on birthing time itself. Risky lyric compression taught early and paid off in final auditory image. Specificity throughout (bone pin, felt washer, fogged dome) prevents swap with generic repair shop. Transformation test passed: remove smell-loss or screw-history and the emotional calculus collapses.</comment>
