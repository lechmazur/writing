<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Interiority is lush, salt-steeped, and specific; the sculptor’s contradictions (restlessness vs. craft) live in every beat. No second character on page, so relationship crucible N/A. Micro-choice to angle lantern slide into arch is credible hinge, though cost is more atmospheric than tangible. Final stance of carrying the lesson forward reads as earned renunciation with visible salt-cold fatigue.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: lyric density crests into a resonant reconfiguration—lantern slide’s final projection turns arch from threat to gate. Closure lands with conceptual cost: the new map demands perpetual improvisation, no return to GPS certainty. Orientation clear by line 6; no penalty. Causality is associative rather than tight because/therefore, but pattern is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Storm-arch as micro-setting constrains every move: ribs of basalt dictate crib shape, foam glare supplies projector light. Salt-metal taste, turbine drone, wet ozone—sensory hierarchy filtered through sculptor’s tool-eye. Spatial choreography clean: slide, driftwood, body track across wet sand without drift. Final image of arch-shadow-as-gate recharges opening threat into permission—setting actively reconfigures meaning.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake: survive disorientation and re-imagine navigation. Escalation is atmospheric deepening rather than narrowing options—each lantern ghost layers stakes onto communal craft. Agency visible when sculptor angles slide and builds crib; cost is loss of technological certainty. Turbine hum persists as audible price, but on-page trade-off softer than high-band requires.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges as collaboration across time: solitary driftwood becomes communal shelter via inherited lantern knowledge. No explicit thesis—idea pulses through ghost images and final invitation. Final non-literal answer: maps are listening exercises, not coordinate grids. Slight risk of poetic over-abstraction keeps score below 9.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>First-person lyric retains perceptual signature: syntax coils like rope, verbs hammered to nouned drift. No dialogue, so naturalism N/A. Compression (“storm swallowed the road”) taught immediately and maintained. Register stays within sculptor’s artisan lexicon; metaphorical excess feels voice-driven, not decorative. Distinct rhythmic fingerprint carries through final blessing image.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Read-aloud cadence varies—long breath-sentence follows staccato fragments. High density: one sentence often paints weather + memory + tool. Occasional stacked metaphors (“turbines a drowned organ”) flirt with overwriting but stay legible. No loops or filter-verb stacks; closure line cleanly propels. Minor scaffold: “perpetually learning” repeated without fresh angle late in text.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: driftwood craft + lighthouse slide + offshore turbines = 21st-century folk tale. Ghost-slide projection onto natural basalt theater is novel visual hinge. Risk of lyric density pays off by making listening a form of navigation. Conceptual integrity holds—no retreat into conventional plot. Specificity of gull-maps and salt-bread alliances feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
