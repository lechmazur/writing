<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Iren’s grief-anchored patience and methodical micro-choices (counting mummified apples, unscrewing the sextant index) keep him credibly grounded; the interior contradiction between trapping and freeing the dream is embodied in breath-by-breath action. The final renunciation—letting the dream run yet belong—pays off the wife-loss motive with visible cost: the broken sextant now points only to warmth, foreclosing any future personal use. No head-count issues; choreography stays clean. Hairline slip: “needed truth more than polished show” edges toward label-speak, but is immediately dramatized by the cracked mirrors.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of mirrored returns (twilight frost, glass mountains, breathing cadence) tightens once when Iren turns mirrors outward and offers the scarred index—an irreversible gesture that reweights the stake from capture to co-creation. Closure is a Charged Poise: the orchard rings, paths unroll, boundaries erased, cost legible in the broken sextant’s new uselessness for stargazing. Orientation anchored by word 80 (“At the center stood Iren…”). No causality breaks; fog corridors and shard frames track spatially.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fog, rime, and apple skeletons are filtered through Iren’s tool-maker eye—every sensory note (velvet-clapper bell, hoarfrost routes) constrains his next move: where to place the next shard, when to exhale. The irrigation tower’s absence becomes the glass-mountain crest, charging the final image. Micro-setting (cracked sextant arc, frozen mud under sole) directly shapes tactical choices. No static tour; weather evolves with each breath beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—restore the orchard via the runaway dream—signaled in paragraph 3. One meaningful tightening: offering the sextant’s index forecloses Iren’s ability to measure stars, narrowing options from capture to shared stewardship. Pressure stays coherent under Accumulative lens; each mirrored return increases density until the dream folds in. Cost visible on-page: the broken device permanently repurposed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme of erasure-as-restoration emerges through mirrored returns and breathing synchrony; no explicit thesis. Final glass-mountains image reweights earlier wife-dream without moralizing. Subtext in the velvet-clapper bell: invitation, not alarm. Ambiguity lingers—will the harvest last?—but cost is undeniable.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Third-person hovers at Iren’s shoulder, adopting his patient tool-maker diction: “yearning geometry,” “numbers anchoring him.” Rhythm modulates with fog thickness—long vowels for haze, clipped fragments for gear clicks. No head-hopping; perceptual signature consistent. Experimental compression (“earth loosening, branches widening”) is pattern-taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>High information density: one sentence often does three jobs (action, atmosphere, metaphor). Figurative language is selective—no stacked metaphors in peak beats. Occasional syntactic parallelism (“each inhale… each exhale”) is purposeful, taught by second paragraph. Minor filter verb (“felt”) in final third but does not dull closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: broken astronomical tool + breath-based mirror-craft + orchard-as-ribcage yields a non-obvious restoration rite. Risk in lyric repetition pays off when glass mountains rise from absent tower. Conceptual integrity holds—no late rule changes. Specificity of spotted mirrors and velvet clapper prevents template drift.</comment>
