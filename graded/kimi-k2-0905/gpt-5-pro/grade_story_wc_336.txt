<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The pruner’s interior contradiction—obedience to the seed-charge versus the lure of invention—never crystallizes in a single, costly micro-choice. Every pruning act is reported as gentle success; no cut fails or wounds him, so the promised “visible cost” is only declared, not dramatized. The bees’ permission (“Cut kindly”) is the closest beat of pressure, yet it changes nothing in his tactics; he already prunes kindly. Result: arc is coherent but flat, missing the flaw-driven mistake that would force renunciation or price.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each captured essence and pruning gesture thickens color-density until the Gray’s drink reweights the world. Orientation is anchored by the second sentence; later spatial shifts (root bridge, echo orchard) track cleanly. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the valley brightens, the seed’s root silver-thread visible, cost acknowledged (“I trimmed to make space for arrivals”). The only abrasion is a soft causal leap—the Gray’s instant conversion via one glass—so the repricing feels slightly convenient, not irrevocable.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The parapet waterfall and mossy stone remain tactile and constraining: the pruner works at the cliff’s lip, shears in belt, mist on skin. The heirloom seed’s burnished thumbprints and the root-bridge’s violin tremor charge both tool and environment so they alter tactics (seed planted in warmed soil, bridge crossed with hook). Spatial choreography holds across the mirror-orchard and return. Minor over-packaging of lyric adjectives (“radiant hush,” “starlit mouths”) nicks economy but never obscures the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</question><comment>Dominant stake—restore color/wonder—signals early and tightens through pattern: each pruned branch returns hue, each captured essence brightens air. The meaningful deepening is the Gray’s reveal as famine, not foe; this reconfigures moral stakes but is narrated rather than enacted, so the cost is felt conceptually, not viscerally. Protagonist’s agency is steady but not endangered; no tactic fails or backfires, keeping escalation lyrical rather than perilous. Still, the accretive brightening satisfies the lens and culminates in an undeniable social reprice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges as reciprocal caretaking: stories feed the Gray, the orchard feeds the valley, mercy feeds the pruner. Subtext resides in scent-pearls and the Gray’s trembling horse image—famine disguised as dusk—avoiding overt moral labels. The ending image of “color like language” reweights earlier chromatic motifs without sermon. Complexity is slight because opposition is a single hunger-personified; nevertheless, the emotional aftereffect lingers as communal wonder restored.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</question><comment>First-person voice maintains a sustained horticultural liturgy: diction of lullaby shears, starry moss mouths, and silver-root looms feels individual, not templated. Compression (“I crossed, pruning hook in belt, seed in palm, hope planted under my tongue”) teaches the reader to accept paratactic leaps early; payoff is the final cadence where cadence itself equals color. No head-hop or register drift; perceptual signature stays rooted in orchard-time (“bees count sleep”). Occasional stacked adjectives flirt with purple but always serve the hymn-like rhythm.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Rhythm breathes with pruning action: short snips alternate with long inhalations of mist and scent. Metaphors are coherent within arboreal logic—branches speak, moss has mouths, roots loom—no mixed vehicles. High information density: one sentence often carries scent capture, emotional state, and world-rule clarification. Only hairline flaw is a faint synonym loop (“color of wonder,” “brightening, leaf by leaf by leaf”) that murmurs rather than advances in the final third, keeping the piece just outside 9-band purity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</question><comment>Fusion of orchard-tending with inter-world root-loom is fresh, not grafted from familiar templates. The Gray as famine-of-stories re-casts ecological allegory into mutual narrative husbandry, avoiding both evil antagonist and easy healing. Risky lyric elision (pearls of scent, laughter glasses) is taught early and repaid in the closing braid of light. Specificity of silver-root threading between worlds makes the concept irreplaceable to this valley; remove it and the closure collapses.</comment>
