<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The protagonist’s synesthetic need to “hear colors” and the obsession with finding the “sound of trust breaking” give a jagged, specific interiority; every micro-choice—seeding cochlear organoids, burning the oilskin note—grows from that flaw and costs him distance from his father. The final moment of letting the aid hum “a kindness…honest and cold” is earned renunciation that forecloses revenge while keeping ache legible. Secondary characters stay off-stage; the single-POV crucible holds, so relationship/status bullets are waived. Only the father’s dialogue edges toward thematic summary, a hairline slip that caps the score at 8.7.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a crystallized Charged Poise: the protagonist straps the aid beneath his own auricle and hears the exact contour of paternal retreat, a Resonant Reconfiguration that reweights every prior absence. Causal chain holds: because he alloys filaments with aurora and the burned promise, therefore the device learns the sonic contour of betrayal; because he accepts its cold kindness, he forecloses revenge and “sets the orchard to grow.” Cost is visible: the whitening hiss of pigment letting go is the moment he pays his father’s betrayal into the machine and takes the loneliness of that knowledge on himself. Orientation is taught by image (frostlight, kelp, ribs of ships) and anchors by line 6; lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds through final aurora curtain.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The sunken orchard greenhouse is no postcard; its panes, aurora filter, and scaffolded dwarf-trees constrain every graft and mic placement, while the ashen forge literally supplies the alloy that becomes the hearing aid’s soul. Micro-setting of the burned oilskin note functions as the moral crucible: its whitening hiss is the audible ghost of trust the protagonist distills into circuitry. Spatial choreography is clean—rope of bubbles, orchard grid, shipyard cavern—each distance tracked without drift. Sensory hierarchy obeys the synesthetic POV: color is heard, teal is a cracked chime, aurora hums; this biases every descriptive choice and charges the final image where aurora “throbs, a tired curtain,” reweighting the marvel as battered.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—“find the sound of trust breaking”—is signaled in paragraph 3 and tightens when each absence is soldered into the prototype. Escalation is Accumulative: layers of sampled lacks (hush after pump, skipped diver heartbeat, whitening hiss of oilskin) progressively alloy into the device until the spectral notch is unmistakable. Visible price: the father’s retreat is not fixed but translated into a “warm pulse in the ear,” accepting permanent emotional winter. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length; no reversal is required, only the final crystallization where the aid releases “thin ice singing” instead of rage.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: memory is not recital but an alloy of absences that can be forged into new listening. The orchard’s refusal to ripen and the aurora’s tired miracle reweight each other by closure, offering a non-moral answer: acceptance of fracture is the only fruit. Subtext lives in gesture—the father will not meet gaze, the rope of bubbles trembles like “pale bells I could barely hear”—so the emotional aftereffect is concrete, unsentimental. No late symbolism is harvested; every recurrence (aurora, forge, orchard) constrains choice or charges the final poise.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>First-person synesthetic voice sustains a perceptual signature where color is always heard and silence has tint; diction stays within the lexicon of an acoustics engineer (“spectral notch,” “mitotic rhythms”) without drifting into jargon. Rhythm compresses under pressure—“I slid the old promise note…listened…whitening hiss”—then elongates in the orchard walk, mirroring the protagonist’s attention swing between fevered forging and exhausted acceptance. No head-hopping; unreliability is limited to the synesthetic bias, paid off when aurora misreads wonder as fracture. Dialogue lines are few but carry indirection: father’s “I trusted you to make it out” is both apology and self-absolution, heard by the aid as retreat.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentences are dense but propulsive: “kelp brushed the ribs of ships and the orchard scaffolds, and their greens whispered tin” does triple sensory work. No loops or scaffold; each paragraph cuts cleanly—remove any and you lose knowledge of forge, father, or device. Metaphors stay coherent within underwater physics (bubbles like pale bells) and synesthetic logic. One mixed vehicle—“aurora…a trembling veil…tired curtain”—is allowed because it accumulates the same aurora across emotional phases. Register never drifts; even technical terms are filtered through POV need.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fusing synesthesia with underwater salvage acoustics yields a premise that feels inevitable yet fresh; the “sound of trust breaking” as a design spec is a non-obvious angle on father-wound stories. Risk in form—lyric accumulative structure, no conventional antagonist—pays off when the final orchard image crystallizes meaning without exposition. Transformation test: swap any detail (aurora color, forge metal, orchard fruit) and the emotional calculus collapses, proving specificity. No close echoes of famous scenes; the burnt oilskin hiss is too particular to forget.</comment>
