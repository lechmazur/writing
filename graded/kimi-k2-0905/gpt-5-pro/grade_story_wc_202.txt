<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The narrator’s motive to "honor overlooked histories" is declared repeatedly but never tested by a contradictory impulse; no interior contradiction surfaces when the lens refracts the names. Emotion stays cerebral—"Memory becomes elusively tangible"—without embodied contradiction or visible cost to the speaker. The single micro-choice (unfastening the painted door) is presented as inevitable, not a hard-won renunciation, so the arc lands as observant rather than transformed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure achieves a quiet Resonant Reconfiguration: the market physically lowers its ladders after the names are spoken, a legible before/after image that reweights the city’s relationship to its own past. Causality is accumulative-textural: the refracted harbors accumulate until the naming ritual crystallizes meaning; the cost is conceptual—the city must now carry its erased labor—rather than a private loss to the narrator. Orientation is taught early ("alchemist's market strung high above city rooftops") and anchors hold; the final image of "tide within a tide" circles back, satisfying the lyric pattern.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The rooftop market is more than postcard: the frayed-wing rope sign, oxidized hooks, and lantern-breathing canvas all constrain how the narrator moves and what can be discovered. The lighthouse fragment itself acts as micro-setting—its angle literally determines which letters appear, so environment dictates epistemology. Spatial choreography stays clean; bodies sway with beams while the painting is cradled over flame, grounding the lyric flights.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—recover erased laborers’ names—is clear from line 9; pressure deepens as each hidden harbor is coaxed into legibility, but the narrator faces no external opposition or internal trade-off. The only tightening is the count of thirteen harbors becoming words; no option is foreclosed to the speaker, so cost is communal, not personal. Escalation is therefore observational rather than tactical, satisfying the accumulative lens yet remaining modest.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without slogans: the shift from decorative canvas to civic map reweights art itself as archive. Subtext lives in gesture—the elder’s coppered thumb wiping eyes—rather than exposition. The final image of the city "catching on its own past" offers a Conceptual Repricing that makes remembrance a living snare, not a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice carries a sustained lyric cadence—"storm-bright chimneys," "cartographers of smell"—that teaches its patterned compression early and never breaks register. Perceptual signature is anchored in light and refraction: windows become currents, pigment holds grammar. The elder’s dialogue ("we rehearsed this meeting across lives") stays within the narrator’s plausible reportage, maintaining distance while letting mythic tone breathe.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Metaphor density is high but purposeful—each image extends the nautical-light motif; no mixed vehicles. Occasional scaffold ("elusively tangible" repeated thrice) drags without new inflection; likewise "between childhood and now" becomes a chorus. Sentence rhythm modulates effectively, but the closing "tide within a tide" line is the first moment where cadence truly crystallizes the emotional charge.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The skybound alchemist market reframes rooftop noir into luminous archive; using a lighthouse shard to read apprentice nail-head writing inside paint is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis. Risk is taken—the entire plot is a metaphysical translation session—yet causality holds. Specificity of "saltpans" and "talk's teeth" keeps the vision anchored; without these particulars the concept could slide into steampunk garnish.</comment>
