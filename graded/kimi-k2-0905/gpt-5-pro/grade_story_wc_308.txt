<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The narrator’s vocation as “harmonic stone skimmer” is shown only through silent listening and micro-choices—tapping the arrowhead, humming a single note—so the trait is credibly lived-in. Interior contradiction surfaces in the refusal to chase yet yearning to guide, embodied in the warming stone. Earned renunciation lands when stillness becomes the door; the cost is the perpetual return (“I seat myself again”). Voice stays particular, never drifts into label-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the wandering pulse loops back as guide, the map draws itself while the narrator remains motionless—felt cost is the lifelong vigil acknowledged in “this map is never finished.” Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each echo-layer reweights the stake until the final breath. Orientation is taught early by the bone-canyon throat image; no anchors ever blur. The persistent constraint (perpetual returning dust/echo) shapes the final image and forbids 9+.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The canyon’s bone towers actively constrain—sound sketched by marrow, gulls braiding a boundary the pulse will not cross—so environment shapes tactics. Micro-setting (arrowhead as tuning wedge) charges closure when it warms, reweighting grandmother’s legacy. Sensory hierarchy obeys the skimmer’s ear-centric craft; visual detail is filtered through acoustic consequence. Spatial choreography remains flawless across bird flocks, echo ribs, and the river-ghost seam.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—learn to navigate without moving—tightens when the pulse tests the narrator with a stutter; refusal to chase narrows options to stillness alone. Escalation is accretive: each echo-layer adds dust-date signatures, braiding gull boundary that forbids step. Visible price is the eternal return seated again at end. One meaningful intensification suffices; no reversal needed under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from particulars: cartography by refusal, ledger without theft, forgiveness as uncurling fingers. Final image reweights premise—stillness becomes motion for the world—without moralizing. Subtext lives in silence, ash-taste, warming stone; no thematic statement is handed to reader. Resonant ambiguity lingers: guide and guided swap roles yet remain trapped in the same loop.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Perceptual signature is unmistakable—sound as distance-chart, gull-turns as marginalia—held across every sentence. Syntax mirrors breath-control: long tide-like clauses broken by caesuras that mimic echo decay. No head-hop; first-person knowledge stays strictly bounded to what ear and palm can test. Diction stays within plausible lexicon of desert-wandering listener yet achieves rhythmic music.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence layers new pressure (dust-date, braid-boundary, ash-taste). Metaphors are coherent—bone ledger, cruel accordion—and never muddle causality. Rhythm accelerates into single-word beats (“I hum a tally”) then exhales into longer clauses mirroring circling gulls. Information density is high yet remains oral-legible; no filter-verb stacks dull immediacy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: echo-cartography via motionless audition feels inevitable yet unseen before. Risk of entire plot hinging on bird-pattern reading pays off because pattern is taught early and repaid at closure. Specificity—“date written as abrasion,” “concerned relatives” of walls—grounds abstraction. Premise commits fully: navigation without moving is not metaphor but lived procedure.</comment>
