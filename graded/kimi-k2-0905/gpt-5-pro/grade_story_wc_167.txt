<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The glazier’s quiet stubbornness—“my motive is simple and stubborn”—is repeatedly dramatized (choosing to let the atrium “show itself,” tipping light onto the ledger). Interiority stays concrete, never ventriloquizing non-POV minds. No visible cost is extracted from him, however; he risks neither social nor material loss, so the arc leans observation more than crucible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the harbor-master folds the ledger after colors rewrite its debts, and the bay “accepts” the argument. Causality holds: because the glazier stages the light-show, the official’s stance destabilizes; therefore tomorrow’s vote is bendable. Lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of pond rings + light spectra—taught early and paid in the final image of “smiling lips” ripples.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Pearl Bay, dawn fog, salt-stung glass, and the prism atrium are all kinesthetically handled: fog “trumpets up the ribs,” colors “rake the floor,” the ledger is bead-wet. Micro-setting (the cracked pane) literally steers the climax—tilting it refracts the council’s future. Spatial choreography is flawless from pond to atrium to quay; no orientation drift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake: save the atrium from chrome erasure. Escalation occurs when the spectrum lands on the ledger page, narrowing options: demolition is no longer abstract to the harbor-master. Cost is visible—social credibility for the official, potential job for the net-mender—but is felt by others, not the protagonist; hence pressure is strong yet slightly vicarious.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme—mundane surfaces hold unpriced value—emerges through glass and ledger imagery, never sermonized. Harbor-master’s “plans could bend, like glass when fired just right” crystallizes the metaphor without abstraction. Subtle counter-reading lingers: gentrification may still win, but the atrium has already re-priced memory. Final image of overlapping ripples “smiling” reweights prior pond motif cleanly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vocabulary of glazier—“panes speak in ticks and hairlines,” “concentricities,” “putty than petitions”—is idiosyncratic yet vocally consistent. Rhythmic compression (“beam leapt into rainbows that wandered… sampling ropes, fish scales, boots”) teaches the lyric pattern and sustains it under emotional pressure. No head-hopping; distance remains steady interior. Dialogue minimal but distinct: harbor-master’s bureaucratic cadence versus glazier’s imagistic terseness.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is dense but breathable: “glass dust still glittering in the seams of my cuffs” does triple duty (occupation, texture, time of day). Occasional elevated diction (“noctilucent reckonings,” “conceptual repricing”) momentarily lifts above workman lexicon but reads as conscious mystic register rather than thesaurus drift. No mixed metaphors, loops, or scaffold beats. Final line cadence mirrors opening hush, closing the circle cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fusing fiscal ledgers with light refraction via a cracked greenhouse pane is genuinely fresh; “noctilucent reckonings” literalizes moral accounting as visible spectrum. Transformation test passes—only this glazier, this bay, this dawn could yield this payoff. Risk lies in lyrical opacity, but pattern is taught early enough to keep payoff legible. Slight dock for echo of eco-gentrification trope, though lens twist redeems it.</comment>
