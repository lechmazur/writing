<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Neris’s revolutionary past is more label than lived pressure; only late does “kneeling can be strategy” embody a micro-choice. The custodian role supplies clear status and embodied ritual (velvet over mirrors), but internal contradiction between rebel and judge stays verbal. Final “defunct heart considers revolt again” crystallizes a visible cost—an earned stasis—lifting the score. Still, earlier beats lean on epithet rather than tensioned action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the city becomes “open conservatory” and Neris’s stasis—returning to drape the last mirror—carries felt cost of permanent ache. Causal lens holds: shard demonstration → vote → judge’s ruling because/therefore chain. Orientation is taught early (“We live after time becomes visible… baroque asteroid”) so disorientation is waived; corridor geography stays trackable. One tightening only, but it reweights civilization’s meaning under coherent rule of visible time.</comment>

<comment>Baroque asteroid is not backdrop but tool: nickel cliffs, cherubs cut into ore, gilt veins dictate tribunal location and mirror-covering ritual. The shard acts as micro-setting—its facets literally emit the civic past, constraining verdict options. Sensory hierarchy filters through Neris’s poetic lens (bronze-rain threads, comet-hair seconds). Final image of storm-banged windows reuses earlier anchors, charging the closure with environmental corroboration.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—save the city from being quarried—signals in line 3. Escalation tightens once: shard tableau overturns decadence claim, foreclosing Vark’s looting path. Agency is Neris’s calibration and tilt; cost visible when Vark bows “annoyed but alive,” conceding grudging future opposition. Pressure stays coherent under causal lens; no reversal needed for 600-word scope.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: civilization as unfinished craft versus ruin; shard nursery image reframes “decadence” into pedagogy. Subtext lives in mirror ritual—fear of memory multiplication—paid off when collective covering quiets temporal chorus. Final lines offer resonant, non-literal answer: architecture of remorse replaces ash, no moralizing. Burnished sorrow tone deepens from patina to warmth, showing thematic modulation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>First-person voice owns a sustained poetic register—“threads like bronze rain,” “seconds walk like tame animals”—that feels character-specific, not generic. Syntax modulates: elongated anaphora for ritual, clipped fragments under storm. No dialogue, so voice distinctness rests on diction and metaphor density, maintained without register drift. Occasional near-purple heaps (“liturgy from the crust”) flirt with excess but stay motivated by Neris’s poetic inclination.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>High figurative density risks overwrite; several adjacent sentences launch metaphor vehicles that nudge toward purple. Rhythm remains varied and read-aloud strong; paragraph cuts are purposeful. One paraphrase loop: “burnished sorrow” repeated with small variation—intentional motif but still loops. No grammar or prop contradictions; clarity preserved, but slight compression would sharpen already-good lines.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Visible-time asteroid + archaeological tribunal is fresh synthesis; genre trope of lost civilization flipped into living conservatory. Risky lyric accumulation is taught early and pays off in final shard vote, making “braid everything into seconds” feel inevitable. Specificity: nickel-cherub corridors, slow-amber wind veins, mirror-covering ethics—all particular to this world. No close echoes; concept commits fully without late rule invention.</comment>
