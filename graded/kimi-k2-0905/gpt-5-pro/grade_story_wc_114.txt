<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The narrator’s guilt-riven interiority is embodied in fever-chilled, aurora-lit perception and the graphite smudge that reweights memory; silence is dramatized as a weighable, glacier-like mass. Motive stays consistent: protect Luca’s name and the wedding convoy by swallowing truth, then expiate by broadcasting risk. The micro-choice to lift the loose graphite onto the scale crystallizes this arc with visible cost—O.4 mg of shame made legible. Only minor slack: late-introduced “director” and donor camera feel briefly convenient rather than lived-in.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly with conceptual cost: the swallowed truth is physically weighed and publicly spoken, a decisive CR that reconfigures both forecast and conscience. Single-shard structure holds; aurora/grids/graphite callbacks tighten the cadence rather than loosen it. Orientation (who/where/when) arrives within 120 words via metal grate, antennae ribs, siren time—the disorientation of fever is functional, not confusing, so no penalty. The only hairline slip: “oracle” is anthropomorphized (“clicks its relays like teeth”) before its AI nature is anchored, a micro-lag in causality that nudges off perfection.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The alpine weather station is no postcard: rime-crusted vanes, wool-muffled drives, and the desiccant scale literally calibrate choice—only here can dust-level guilt be weighed. Micro-setting objects (botanical sheet, graphite smudge, fault-tolerant cluster) constrain every beat; their physical states evolve on-page. Spatial choreography stays crisp: console, grate, bench, microphone form a single continuous workspace. Final aurora bruise recharges the opening “auroral sorrow,” charging the image with closure cost.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—avalanche risk vs. Luca's reputation—signals early and tightens once: the moment the oracle offers a live forecast window for the climbing convoy. The protagonist’s agency is the final broadcast; it narrows options from silence to public warning and carries unmistakable social cost (curses “up the mountain like smoke”). No artificial reversals, just the single deepening that forces the reveal. Could nudge higher if the physical price (job loss, donor fury) were hinted beyond reputational smoke.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme—truth’s mass is measurable even when near zero—emerges through the graphite smudge rather than assertion; the scale’s absurd precision converts philosophical guilt into grams. The botanical illustration silently interrogates the ethics of mapping beauty vs. hazard, a tension never moralized aloud. Ending image (aurora as bruise that “hurts and heals”) offers resonant CR without sermon. The only whiff of convenience: “donors smiling at our clean instruments” leans prompt-adjacent, a trace of institutional commentary that slightly externalizes the dilemma.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is fever-cooled scientific lyric: POV notices in millibars, graphite veins, seismometer microflares—perceptual signature is unmistakable. Syntax compresses under fever (“my head cools along with the anemometers”) yet stays legible; patterned elision teaches itself by line 3. No head-hopping; anthropomorphic oracle remains externally observed, internally consistent. Final read-aloud cadence—roll call of instruments including Luca—flips grief into ritual without slipping into sentimentality.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High information density: each sentence layers meteorological, moral, and tactile data without scaffold. Figurative control sustains extended aurora/avalanche metaphors that never collide; vehicles stay physically coherent. Zero paraphrase loops, no register drift; technical jargon (outgassing clicks, glide plane, desiccant scale) is accurate and POV-appropriate. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and re-charge motif, meeting the read-aloud ear test.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: avalanche forecast via AI cluster wrapped in wool, guilt weighed on a frost scale—specific, non-obvious, impossible to swap into another tale unchanged. Conceptual risk—turning silence into milligrams—pays off cleanly. Alpine saxifrage as hidden fracture map fuses botany and geology into a single ethical object. Minor proximity echo: “oracle” as anthropomorphic AI is familiar, but here it learns grief from logs, a humanized twist that feels earned rather than borrowed.</comment>
