<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Tamsin’s interior contradiction—sharp listener who performs clownishness—shows in every micro-beat (bending candle-flame while laughing off Rauk). Her motives stay legible, but the text over-relies on abstract interior summary (“she understood she was unraveling conspiracies”) instead of embodied irrationality during peak beats. No real relationship crucible is dramatized on page; Rauk is only a foil name. Endurance costs are present yet generalized, not viscerally felt.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: a Charged Poise crystallizes when she resets the orrery—future coups still coming but now mis-timed, cost acknowledged. Causal chain holds: stitch shifts → bell drift → gate yaw, each step because/therefore. Penultimate paragraph does summarize the upcoming apprentices rather than dramatize their changed odds; that softens the Decisive Change edge by a hair.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The dome, candle-glass, and orrery gears double as micro-settings that constrain every move; without them her sabotage is impossible. Sensory hierarchy is biased to Tamsin’s cloth-and-wind attention, never tourist catalogue. “Cobalt observatory” remains slightly generic, but the “blue hush like a held breath” hooks the final image, so cap not triggered.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—thwart the coup—stated early; pressure escalates through successive micro-tamperings that each narrow timing precision. Agency is continuous; every bell-slip or thread-pull is her hand. Cost (city still doomed, only delayed) is legible but conceptual, not visceral, keeping it shy of top band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of “listening as resistance” emerges through stitch-and-bell misalignment, never sermonized. Final image of futures being quietly stitched offers resonant reweighting. Subtext in Rauk’s laugh and hesitations sharpens irony. Quiet ending invites reflection without tidy moral, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Voice is distinctive—compressed lyric cadence, metaphor-dense yet internally coherent. Patterned elision (“galaxy-chart embroiderer,” “adjacent possibilities”) taught by line 2 and paid off at gate-hinge beat. No head-hopping; psychic distance contracts under pressure—“she breathed so softly the flame bent.” Occasional adjective stack (“sugar-traced lines”) edges toward purple but stays within POV lexical ceiling.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm modulates from long accumulative clauses to short hinge-commands that mimic gear ticks. Information density high; each metaphor carries double duty (wax = seal & clue). One mixed-metaphor risk—“murmuring flock” applied to map flicker—barely coherent but occurs mid-scene, not at closure, so minor chip.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Synthesis of embroidery, astronomy, espionage feels inevitable in hindsight; no genre template carries this exact stitching-astrolabe logic. Risk of lyric condensation is high yet clarity survives. Perspective and tool-use are particular to this piece; swapping “cloth” for “coded telegraph” would collapse entire method. Fresh inflection charges the final image of mis-timed futures.</comment>
