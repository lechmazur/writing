<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied (“skin microflinches, breath catches, eyelid tremors”); narrator’s contradictory hunger to listen yet fear loss of control is present throughout. Relationship with Mara acts as crucible—her skepticism and tactile grounding force micro-choices that shift power. Final renunciation of pill-return is credibly costly because prior beats show the lure of unfiltered voices. One hairline slip: “therapy-speak” label “controlled empathy” appears in exposition without immediate embodied cost, keeping it under 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal lens: static shock → leaked appetite → build light-map → ground room → send recall email; each beat tightens options until the protagonist forecloses re-dosing. Closure is Earned Stasis: the grounded strap softens voices but the shard stays in pocket, a felt trade-off. Cost is legible in final image: “neighborhood hum” accepted in place of telepathic torrent. Orientation and set-piece causality clean; no teleporting props or amnesia.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Light painting studio tools (camera rail, fiber wands, muscovite shard) constrain every tactical choice; body-as-micro-setting rules the wand triggers. Shard’s “fractally precise” splitting of light literally builds the walkable map, charging closure. Ozone-and-dust odor anchors time-zero after shock; spatial choreography of loft ladder discovery is coherent. No excess breadth; every sensory pick feeds action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake: can the protagonist keep listening without being consumed? Escalation: each wave Mara projects tightens the color trigger rules until the final grounding strap is the only safe path; refusal to re-pill is the visible price. Agency remains with narrator’s choreographed motion; no coincidence resolves tension. Cost is on-page: trading unlimited access for moderated “neighborhood hum.”</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of consensual, crafted empathy vs. pharmaceutical intrusion emerges through action, not statement. Subtext in Mara’s “quietly closed fist” and the shard-as-key carries the tension between skepticism and wonder. Final image reweights “willowglass hope” as fragile but mineralized—choice made lucid without moral tag. One minor echo: “illuminate hidden pathways” drifts toward prompt-speak but is saved by literal light trails.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>First-person perceptual signature is consistent—synesthetic metaphors (“light obeyed like a dog in fog”) and mineral lexicon remain in narrator’s plausible range. Compression and elision (“ladders in the print”) are pattern-taught early and paid off. Dialogue minimal but natural; Mara’s two spoken lines advance stakes and carry subtext. No POV leakage or filter-verb clutter; rhythm mirrors breath-catch tension.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>High information density: single sentences do world-building and advance causality (“Out of my pocket I pulled the muscovite geode sliver… it felt like a key, and the door was breathing”). Metaphors are cohesive—no mixed vehicles. One paraphrase loop: “we would devise a choreography … each step a rule, each breath an instrument” restates intent without new pressure, a −0.2 artifact that keeps it sub-9. Otherwise rhythm breathes with scene tempo.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Synthesis of telepathy-recall trope with tangible light-mapping is fresh; shard’s optical property is not exotic for gimmick but reweights empathy as spatial navigation. Risky second-person address to reader (“you are humming”) is earned by prior shock causality. Transformation test: story collapses without mineral light-splitting and somatic choreography—no generic swap possible. Specific quarry backstory roots object in lived history, not ornament.</comment>
