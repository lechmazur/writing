<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is rich and sensor-grounded; the tapping ritual embodies contradiction between scientific order and grief. Micro-choices (tapping dates, re-marking beacons) visibly escalate stakes. Mother’s absence-as-presence complicates motives without tidy epiphany. Hairline slip: “brave” note borders on sentimental label, barely keeping cost legible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the moon’s 18-year nodal swell rewrites the path, charging every prior measurement with new contingency. Causal lens holds: each tapping session → data → re-charted Trace; lunar周期长 drives final stance. Accumulation pattern taught early by marginalia “nodes?” and paid off when atlas page sleeve becomes living beacon. Cost is undeniable: “we swear to cross… in listening” forecloses old innocence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Sea-level station, silted shoes, battery-fogged shack form a micro-setting that constrains every choice: only slack-window crossings possible, reflective paint angled to lunar pull. Torn atlas page handled, creased, sleeved—object-as-setting that re-orients navigation. Sensory economy favors salt, hum, gull heckle over vista catalog. Final image of sleeve in tower drawer re-anchors place within human memory loop.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake: can the Trace be read before next widetide drowns it? Pressure tightens when logs reveal 18-year cycle, shrinking crossing window to imminent wider tide. Agency: protagonist elects to teach children moon-bell code, accepting partial loss of control for shared vigilance. Cost visible: “we do not restore the reefs” admits ecological grief unhealed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from iterated lunar patterns vs. human memorial—paths vanish not from forgetting but from gravity remembered. Subtext in tapping: science as elegy, data as love letter. Final bell-lift image reweights all prior crossings: safety now a communal listening, not conquest. Avoids moralizing; resonance stays in salt-sleeved atlas.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>First-person coral-witness voice owns scientific precision braided with bereft lyric: “reefs taught me to count absences.” Percussive syntax mimics tap-code; diction stays within coastal technician lexicon. No head-hop; Jun kept at pipe-distance maintains POV discipline. Compression like “sunsoft” mints fresh compound without register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Rhythm modulates from long tide-swell sentences to staccato tap fragments, propelling without scaffold. Figurative density peaks in “mirage paved with eels” yet stays legible. No synonym loops; “tides still rehearse old griefs” only grief mention. Minor filter verbs clustered mid-story but serve as breathing space before data crush.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fuses climate-science lyric with folk-navigation mystery; 18-year lunar node as plot engine is non-obvious yet inevitable. Risk of lyric mosaic paid off by taught tap pattern and sleeve closure. Tropes (lost path, eco-grief) transmuted through concrete instrumentality of reflective-sand beacons. Transformation test: story collapses if lunar nodal tide removed.</comment>
