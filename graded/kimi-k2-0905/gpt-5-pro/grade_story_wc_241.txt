<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Interiority is precise (“my pulse that kept miscounting”), motives cleave across disciplines—probability vs luck—embodied in gesture (placing the lantern to soften fluorescent glare). The father’s refusal of soup and her counter-maneuver with carrots crystallize status flip with visible cost; micro-choice of lighting the lantern at the climax is decisive and earned. Flaw: “widening perspectives responsibly” drifts toward self-explanatory thesis; minor over-articulation near end caps the score.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>Accumulative-textural lens: each map annotation increases pattern density until the father’s handwriting detonates a tightening that fuses archive, city, and ward. Closure—lantern light bridging bedsides—earns Charged Poise: options re-weighted, no reset, felt cost in wince-and-sip. Causality maintained by continuous object (lantern) and micro-choices; orientation immaculate inside 120 words. Pattern taught early (adopting lantern), paid off in final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Candle lantern acts as micro-setting: mica pane constrains light quality, softens glare, enables the father’s first smile; rain on glass tracks accumulating pressure, droplets mirroring probabilistic “pearls.” Library stacks remain gently sketched, but sensory economy favors the lantern-body nexus which re-configures in the final image. Meets 9+ gate: object constrains tactic and charges closing beat. Spatial choreography clean; no geography drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—can she coax father to eat—signaled by ward call; archive traversal escalates by each handwriting hit, tightening until carrot negotiation. Agency resides in interpretation and lantern placement; coincidence (finding father’s old scrawls) complicates, not rescues. Meaningful turn when she pockets map + lantern and acts—hospital confrontation; cost legible in father’s wince and her steadying cup. Persistent constraint: light itself becomes leverage.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: contradiction as generative (“maps must contradict themselves to stay alive”). No thesis statements; insight delivered through final image of rain revising glass—non-literal answer about mutable routes. Subtext hidden in carrot code, nurse initials; silence during soup tasting carries weight. Resists moralizing; complexity held in father’s simultaneous surrender and assertion of luck.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>First-person perceptual signature—numbers miscount, light is “probability distribution,” rain ticks like coin—sustained throughout. Syntax modulates: long reflective sentences in library, clipped fragments during ward arrival. Filter verbs kept when voice-driven (“I pictured”) and paid off; no head-hop. Dialogue minimal but authentic (“You followed the markers”). Register stays within academic daughter lexicon; no corporatese.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>High information density: single sentence often layers archive, weather, body, probability metaphor. No loops or synonym churn; mixed metaphors avoided (“rainlight and fire in one film” is coherent). Rhythm breathes—varied sentence openings, paragraph lengths create visual cadence. Occasional elevated diction (“lucid contradictions”) justified by narrator’s academic lens; does not obscure causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: probability pedagogy + graffiti cartography + hospital negotiation. Lantern-archive-city triangulation feels inevitable, not gimmicky. Risk taken with lyric accumulative structure pays off in charged final image. Transforms familiar “estranged parent reunion” by embedding inside cryptic transit lore; emotional specificity rescues premise from abstraction.</comment>
