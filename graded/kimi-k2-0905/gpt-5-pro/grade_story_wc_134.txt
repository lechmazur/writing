<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>The clairvoyant narrator’s interiority is concrete and character-specific (“quartz laugh,” “room we carry inside”), but the pilgrim remains a luminous cipher; because the pilgrim’s choices drive the climax (nodding the shadow into the vowel), the narrator’s passivity in that moment slightly undercuts the earned cost. Still, the contradiction of a seer who misses his own fate is dramatized, not declared, and the final humility feels legible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the vowel now houses the shadow, the pearl is warmed, and everyday sounds have been irreversibly re-priced—cost is felt in the new weight of the ordinary. Causality is lyric-accumulative rather than plot-sequential; the pattern of “listen→translate→house” is taught early and pays off in the final list of domestic words that now chime. One tight transition (pilgrim arrives → vowel ritual) keeps the shard within the two-shard allowance; orientation is anchored by ~100 words. No causality breaks.</comment>

<comment>The cave is not backdrop but instrument: proximity to stalactite organ determines who can sing the shadow into residence, and the pearl’s niche is a micro-setting that literally tunes the outcome. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven—“quartz laugh,” “air tastes faintly of pennies”—and every descriptor is filtered through the clairvoyant’s occupational ear. The final image of warmed pearl in palm is inseparable from the setting’s acoustic gift; remove the cave and the story collapses.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>A single dominant stake—magnify everyday magic until it sings—tightens when the pilgrim risks hosting the shadow inside the communal vowel, trading abstract benevolence for a permanent, audible alteration of ordinary sound. Pressure escalates accumulatively: each domestic sound added to the choir makes the looming shadow’s need concrete. Cost is visible: the town’s vowel is now haunted by a listener that will never leave; options are narrowed because every future sweep of a broom will ring with this new tenant.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: the sacred is not elsewhere but inside the broom’s swish, the dog’s heartbeat, the bus door’s sigh. The final list of household words act as conceptual repricing—readers re-hear their own kitchens forever. No moral is offered; the ambiguity of hosting a shadow in language itself is the resonant answer to the promise.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Voice is irreducibly specific: “bell dipped in water,” “gulls returning, beaks bright with small reflections,” syntax that breathes with cavernous pauses. The clairvoyant’s perceptual signature—sound-first, synesthetic—never leaks into tourist brochure diction. Free indirect style stays clean; no filter-verb stacks; the pilgrim’s speech is distinct in its liquid brevity. Compression (“the silence tilt so politely”) is pattern-taught and repaid at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is lush but disciplined: each figurative reach is anchored to sensory payoff—“kitchen noises and lullabies” keeps the metaphor tethered to audible fact. No loops or scaffold; information density is high (one sentence often layers acoustic, emotional, and mythic registers). Rhythm accelerates into the list of ordinary words, then lands on the single tactile image of the warmed pearl—cadence mirrors arc. One mixed metaphor (“eclipse leans closer, curious as a moth”) is hairline but does not touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The premise—haunting a vowel, not a house—feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight; the story commits fully to acoustic metaphysics without retreat. Risky lyric compression could have obscured stakes, yet clarity holds. Everyday magic is a familiar motif, but here it is literalized through cave acoustics and shadow tenancy, not asserted; the synthesis of quartz acoustics + host-vowel is non-obvious and specific to this voice.</comment>
