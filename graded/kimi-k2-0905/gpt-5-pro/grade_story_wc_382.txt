<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The tutor’s calmly spectral presence and the narrator’s earnest apprenticeship create a believable, lightly comedic crucible; interiority remains concrete (“faint comic ache in my molars”) and the final promise is earned through prior listening drills. Yet both characters stay within their atmospheric roles—tutor dispenses wisdom, pupil absorbs—so contradictory impulses and higher-stakes choices never surface. The decision to keep returning is credible but not freighted with visible cost. Fine for length, but not yet pushing against personal limits.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The piece teaches an accumulative/textural lens early—meteor punctuation, wax impressions, rooftop grammar—and lands a Resonant Reconfiguration: the city now “speaks in courtesies” while the narrator bears “borrowed authority.” Closure carries felt cost (the cooling seal on skin) and the pattern holds. Orientation is secure by line 3; no lens ambiguity. A single tightening beat suffices, but causal linkage stays light—more atmospheric accretion than because/therefore chain—so cap stays below 8.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Rooftop garden, basil scent, broken tiles, meteor shower, and the seal as micro-setting all filter through a consistent perceptual signature; the seal finally brands the narrator, charging the last image. Spatial choreography is clean across the single scene. Sensory selection mirrors emotional tempo—meteor flashes narrow attention, cooling stone widens it. Environment both constrains (only parapet for stamping) and resources (beeswax, candle) choices, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—learning to hear buildings—signals early; pressure tightens when the narrator must “speak back” to the roof with a small truth, revealing the apartment’s root-pretense. This single deepening satisfies accumulative escalation, but options never truly narrow and no visible price is paid (time, social credit, risk). The meteor shower is coincidence that complicates mood, not resolution, so lens coherence holds. Cost is atmospheric, not tactical, keeping score shy of 7.0.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</question><comment>Theme—“agreed-upon lies” as shared myth that lets tenderness step outside—emerges through sealing ritual, meteor punctuation, and the final courteous interrogation rather than any thesis statement. Subtext resides in gesture (pressing wax to stone) and silence (never asking how the tutor died). Final image of “borrowed authority” on skin reweights prior lessons without moralizing. Some abstraction (“city signs what it is unwilling to admit”) inches toward echo, but complexity and ambiguity remain intact.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>First-person voice owns a distinct syntactic rhythm—long breathless clauses that mimic listening in the dark, diction pitched slightly elevated yet consistent with a language-obsessed narrator. Perceptual signature is specific: “library breathing,” “green encyclopedia after lights out.” No dialogue to test, yet interior monologue stays idiomatic and purposeful. Compression (“decades had become a single very considerate minute”) is taught early and paid off; no head-hop or register drift. Minor indulgence in periodic cadence keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</question><comment>Metaphor density is high but patterned—meteor commas, kettle mouth, bishop’s ring—serving atmospheric accretion rather than cluttering a causal beat. A few mixed metaphors (“library breathed,” “sewn seams”) coexist without violating physical logic. Scaffolding is minimal; sentences vary in length and opening. Loop check clean. Occasional elevated diction (“conceptual ache”) fits narrator, but two near-simultaneous “as if” clauses in closing line slightly dull final image; else clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</question><comment>Fusing ghost-tutorial, meteor shower, and architectural semiotics yields a fresh hybrid; the seal-as-signature motif is particular rather than borrowed. Risky lyric compression is mostly earned, though the premise nods to urban-fantasy tutoring trope. Specificity of “basil smelled like a green encyclopedia” keeps it from abstraction. No close Famous-line echo, yet concept of buildings confessing through wax feels novel. Transformation survives proximity test: swapping names would gut the rooftop grammar lesson.</comment>
