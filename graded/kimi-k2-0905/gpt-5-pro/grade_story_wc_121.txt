<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lio’s interiority is concrete—his “habit of resisting” gravity is a lived tic, the tablet’s warmth against his palm is a pulse. Contradictory impulses coil in-scene: he both clings to the reset-loop and longs to “fall for once,” enacted when he finally lets gravity adopt him. The final renunciation—walking home under “quiet arches like everyone else”—pays the accumulated cost of eternal return. The only hairline slip is occasional lyric shorthand (“my faces taught themselves to contradict”) that leans summary amid embodied beats.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: releasing the anti-gravity habit stitches the viaduct into “a single road,” a legible before/after. The causal chain—tablet cadence → procedural maze → fall → stillness—tightens every loop; no shortcut resets. Orientation is taught early: “the glowing viaduct after rain” anchors place/time by line 3; later disorientation inside the maze is paid off when the same stones become “quiet.” Cost is unmistakable in the final image: Lio forfeits omnipotent float for mortal footing.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The viaduct’s wet stones, thinning halos, and puddle-doors are tactile, bias-filtered—Lio notices what gravity normally hides. Micro-setting doubles as tool: the tablet’s runes and the arch’s echo are environmental levers that gate progression. Spatial choreography is flawless—every stair forms under a foot that remembers doubt, bodies track cleanly. The final single road reweights the setting from labyrinth threat to mortal welcome, satisfying the 9+ constraint gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“conquer the labyrinth of self or be divided”—is signaled in paragraph 4 and escalates via each chamber’s mirror- selves. The meaningful tightening occurs when choosing the weakest-echo staircase: it forecloses omniscient float and narrows options toward the fall. Cost is visible: eternal return forfeits arrival; the final fall pays with mortality. Agency is micro but decisive—each tablet whisper seeds the next corridor; no reliance on coincidence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the iterated image of halos thinning to darkened brightness: the cost of omnipotent sight is never arriving. Subtext resides in gesture—floating a thumb-width above stones shows refusal of human weight; walking home shows acceptance. The tablet’s final single-line promise avoids moralizing; instead the viaduct’s shift from warning to welcome reconfigures meaning. Ambiguity lingers: mortality is both gift and loss, unsentimentally earned.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>First-person texture is unmistakable: “stones still remembered light,” “rain slowed to single notes spaced like decisions.” Syntax coils under pressure—compressed clauses mimic breathless float; longer cadence arrives with stillness. No head-hopping; perceptual signature stays gravity-obsessed. Experimental elision (“numbers missing their middles”) is taught early and paid off when the stair forms from absence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm breathes with scene tempo—short percussive bursts during float, expansive cadence after the fall. Metaphors are internally coherent: “lamp buzzed through my skull like a gnat” sustains insect-light imagery. No synonym loops; each recurrence (“arches multiplied inside the arch”) adds compression, not filler. Information density high—one sentence often layers setting, emotion, and rule exposition.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of gravity-defier myth with procedural-generative maze feels fresh, not grafted. The tablet-as-mirror trope is retooled: it seeds corridors with heartbeat, turning memory into architecture. Risk—making climax a renunciation of super-power—pays off by reweighting familiar arrival as mortality. Near-inevitable in hindsight yet non-obvious at outset, satisfying the transformation test.</comment>
