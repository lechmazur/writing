<comment>The librarian’s interiority is dense and character-specific—his refusal to “trap the dream” is a micro-choice that crystallizes his hierarchy of values. The palette as proxy for Aria’s absence gives embodied contradiction to his grief, and letting the dream pass through him is a credibly costly renunciation. Voice drift into lyric abstraction occasionally flattens embodied emotion, but the final porous stance is earned. Could edge 9+ if one more beat showed a concrete tactical loss tied to that renunciation.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the unlatched door reweights every prior capture attempt into a deliberate non-cage, with the conceptual cost that the librarian forecloses reunion with Aria. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—the final image is a pattern break that reconfigures meaning rather than a causal solve. Orientation is taught by ~80 words; disorientation serves closure payoff. Cost is legible in the final line: “what I love may pass through” = permanent porousness = felt forfeiture.</comment>

<comment>Environment is not backdrop: the canal’s rust taste, the prayer-flat rock’s spatial constraint, and the palette’s salted corners all shape the tripod placement and color-matching tactic. The “coastline made of letters” final image is charged by these micro-settings, satisfying the 9+ gate. Whisper cadence acts as live clock, tightening time. One minor slack: “stone mouths” is vivid but not re-anchored later, leaving one spatial cue floating.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—reclaim Aria vs. release dream—is signaled in paragraph 3. Escalation is accumulative: each exposure deepens the cost of porousness rather than narrowing options causally. The sunrise itself is the tightening agent; its first light forces the final palette tilt. Cost is visible—letting the dream go means Aria stays tide-bound—but the beat is single-thread; no secondary resource loss compounds tactics.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</question>
<comment>Theme emerges from the reversal of cataloging: archiving becomes anti-caging. The cipher reweights from code to communion, a resonant reconfiguration that invites reflection on how libraries can be winds, not quarantines. No moralizing—final line is image, not thesis. Ambiguity lingers: is porousness liberation or perpetual loss? Complexity sustained.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>First-person lyric voice owns a distinct perceptual signature—synesthetic color-sound, maritime metaphors, monk-painter syntax. Rhythm modulates: longer clause-swells in calmer beats, fragment-crests at shutter clicks. No head-hop; interior access stays strictly librarian-bound. Register stays inside plausible island-philosopher lexicon; “tidepool cathedral” is earned compression. Minor echo: “ribbon” used twice for both dream and knot—intentionally thematic but borderline tic.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>High-density lines—each sentence layers job, tool, memory, motion. Metaphors are coherent within maritime palette; no mixed vehicles. One paraphrase loop: “paint with light / paints with light” in adjacent clauses costs −0.1. Otherwise zero scaffold, zero filter stacks. Final third clean; closure image unmarred. Read-aloud rhythm pulses like ferry engine, mirroring scene tempo.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise—floating dream-library between whisper islands—is non-obvious yet fully grounded in cataloging metaphysics. Risk of preciousness offset by tactical specificity: color-matching the cipher, ferry slack-chain, salted palette corners. Transformation test fails if relocated to mainland city, proving irreplaceability. Synthesis of photography-monk-librarian feels inevitable in hindsight. +0.5 risk bonus for committing to lyric elliptical structure and landing legible closure.</comment>
