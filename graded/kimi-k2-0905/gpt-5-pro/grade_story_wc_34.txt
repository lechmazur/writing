<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The balladeer’s quiet, almost ritualistic determination is rendered through embodied micro-choices—unrolling the kit, clamping the bolt plate, grounding ink—each revealing a hierarchy of values under pressure. Interiority is concrete (“my breath tuning to the hush,” “singing for the gaps”) rather than diagnostic, and the final relinquishing of the bolt plate beneath the mural shows a visible cost. No contradictory impulses are staged in a single beat, so the 9+ gate isn’t cleared, but the arc earns a credible renunciation that forecloses no-loudness as a tactic. The character remains an individual voice rather than type, and the flaw (reticence) actively complicates the mission.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the mural stiffens into a “lantern” of circuitry and petals, the ghost disperses with a promise shaped like a pause, and the bolt plate is left as a future key—cost is felt in the forfeiture of anonymity and the exposure of hidden needs. Causality holds throughout: each graffiti glyph is a because/therefore plea that narrows the ghost’s options until it compiles micro-kindnesses. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive by line 3 and never drift; the misty cloud-courtyard is stable scaffolding. The final image of descending song reweights the premise: the city will breathe differently because of this encoded silence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The flower press bolt plate functions as micro-setting: it physically braces the stencil, grounds lethal static, and finally becomes the literal “key” left for the next storm—meeting the 9+ gate. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered (“steel glinting like a coin minted for rain,” “petals crackle with ozone”). Spatial choreography is immaculate across the parapet, railing, and distant towers. Weather is not backdrop but conductor: lightning precedes every causal breath the ghost takes.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—giving silent neighbours a voice—tightens when the bolt plate grounds live current, risking exposure of both balladeer and ghost. One meaningful reversal: the ghost shifts from passive auditor to active micro-agent, dimming corridors and loosening bus schedules—legible cost paid in visible LEDs. Agency is renunciatory rather than combative, but still forecloses the option of remaining unheard. Coincidence is absent; every kindness is compiled from deliberate pigment-and-petal uploads.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges without thesis: the civic invisible can only be helped by art that risks electrocution and anonymity. Subtext resides in negative space of glyphs, the unlit corridor where a nurse naps, the pause-shaped promise—never stated, only sampled by dew beads and status chimes. The final image reweights the premise: public consoles will open not because officials grow hearts, but because a ghost tasted rose-veined cadmium and chose to act. Ambiguity lingers—will the council obey?—but the cost is undeniable.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Voice is a sustained lyric register (“tinkersong wonder,” “parliament of whispers”) yet remains anchored in tactile process: bolt plate, copper lead, stencil clamp. Perceptual signature is consistent—sound is always hush or breath, colour always storm-charged, motion always drifting. Compression is purposeful (“I am not loud because the city has enough alarms”) and pays off when thunder arrives late, creating a measurable pause. No head-hopping; the single POV never exceeds what a drifting balladeer could sense.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm mirrors the lightning/thunder interval: short breath-like clauses build toward longer, grounded lines. Figurative language is dense but patterned—each metaphor is revisited (coin-minted rain, sheet-music veins) so density reads as design, not overwrite. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn; each image advances either static risk or civic wish. Opening and closing lines are sonic bookends that re-charge the motif of sung silence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>The fusion of graffiti activism with a literal ghost-in-code is fresh, yet every beat is grounded in weld, pigment, and rose-vein memory—specificity prevents concept-from-over-idea. Risk is taken: a 740-word single-scene lyric that relies on electrical grounding as plot logic, but the physics is cued early and never broken. Transformation test fails if relocated: only this storm-press-bolt ecosystem lets silence become legible code. Bold compression and civic stakes lift it above familiar “hacker-poet” templates.</comment>
