<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>A clear internal want powers the beats, but interiority stays abstract (“unused courage waits”) rather than dramatized. Emotional labels (“my heart from running”) are repeated; no embodied contradiction under pressure. The kneeling offer is a micro-choice that advances, yet the dog’s return feels like gift-luck, not earned by prior flaw or tactic.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/lyric lens holds: pattern of star stamps and indirect paths reweights arrival. Closure lands in the quiet constellation card—conceptual repricing carries felt cost of relinquished chase. Orientation drifts early: “the path refuses to hold still” teaches disorientation, but who/where stays hazy past 120 words; waiver applies, so no penalty. No causal break, but escalation is tonal, not option-narrowing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Environmental specificity is high: “conch-hum whispers,” “lichened fences,” “moonbread air” all filter through POV urgency. Micro-setting (ticket punch, fence posts) constrains tactics—stars literally mark the route home. Spatial choreography remains coherent across ridge, fold, and landing. Weather and tide act on bodies; no static catalogue.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recover the dog—signals early and tightens only tonally; no live option is foreclosed. Because the lens is Accumulative, the required “meaningful deepening” is the star-path lighting the descent; cost is lyrical, not tactical. Protagonist agency limited to kneeling invitation; resolution leans on dog’s voluntary approach rather than a trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme of gentle courage emerges through refrain of “after the leash breaks” and the shift from chase to welcome. Subtext lives in gesture: stamping stars into air, humming tide syllables. Final image reweights pursuit as patience—resonant yet slightly sentimental. No overt moralizing, but theme is iterated more than questioned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>First-person lyric voice sustains oceanic cadence—“sea sigh turning inside my ribs,” “moonbread air”—without monotony. Diction stays within poetic narrator’s ken; no head-hop. Syntax mirrors tidal rhythm; compression taught early and paid off in final lullaby line. Dialogue absent, so no voice convergence issue.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentences layer concrete nouns and active verbs. Occasional purple clusters—“mist lifts like thin shawls,” “twilight blooms like a bruise”—but metaphor logic stays consistent. No paraphrase loops; one near-repeat of “gentle persistent.” Figurative muddle absent from closure beat. High density overall, but elevated register occasionally distances urgency.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh angle: star-stamped ferry guides as psychopomps for a lost-dog vigil. Indirect ridge route reverses heroic chase trope into receptive patience. Specific coastal vocabulary (“mooring stones,” “conch-hum”) localizes myth. Risk of soft pastoral is present; could swap names, but emotional cadence feels singular.</comment>
