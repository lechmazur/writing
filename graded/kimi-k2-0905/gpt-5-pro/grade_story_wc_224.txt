<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>The narrator’s interiority is rich and embodied—grief is “teeth” that chew through sleep—but the seer is a prophetic cipher rather than a second character under pressure; the only crucible is the self. Micro-choices (offering the key, surrendering a counted breath) trace a believable arc from exile to earned belonging. No contradiction or label-speak; the flaw is the seer’s opacity, which keeps relationship/status bullets from activating.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>A single accumulative/textural scene is taught immediately: the mountain-bookstore is a living palimpsest whose aisles “braid and unbraid.” Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—the final image of a palm-shaped room re-weights “home” from noun to practice, paid for with an exhalation that is both gift and forfeiture. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are lyrically delayed but serve the final reconfiguration, so the Orientation Test is waived.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The bookstore-mountain is not backdrop but instrument: staircases loop like “handwriting,” floors reform as “unreadable skin,” forcing the protagonist to re-calculate every step. Sensory hierarchy is POV-tilted—smell of glue/ash/rain, thunder learning the narrator’s name—so setting constrains movement and meaning. The lost language stone is a micro-setting that charges the final image: its warmth literalizes the cost of belonging.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“understand the shape of home”—tightens when the seer declares shelter ≠ hiding, forcing the narrator to risk touch via feather. One meaningful deepening: the stone’s grammar rewrites corridors into climate, making retreat impossible. Cost is conceptual but legible: the exhalation offered is unstoried breath, a piece of life that cannot be reclaimed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the reversal that home is not found but practiced; no moral is stated—final image is a palm-opening room. Motifs (key, feather, thunder) recur with shifted valence: the key that once locked now opens, thunder urges rather than threatens. Subtext lives in gesture—hand guided to stone, breath wrapped in breath—so insight feels discovered, not declared.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>First-person lyric voice sustains a dense metaphoric weave without purple drift; syntax mirrors maze (“corridors braid and unbraid”). Perceptual signature is consistent—world is read by texture, temperature, wind—so POV never leaks. Feather-as-reading-instrument is taught early and paid off at climax, legitimizing the non-standard method.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Rhythm varies from long breathless coils to clipped imperatives (“I ask,” “He says”) that mimic ascending steps. Metaphors are sustained, not stacked—no mixed vehicles, no filter-verb clutter. Minor scaffold: “every step writes a question” / “my feet cannot read” is a paraphrase loop; does not touch closure, so −0.2 only.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Core premise—library that nightly rewrites reality—transforms familiar “search for home” into ontological cartography. Risk of abstraction is offset by tactile method (feather) and bodily cost (breath). Synthesis feels inevitable: a map that apologizes for rooms not yet claimed reframes exile as authorship. No close echoes; stylus is personal, not gimmick.</comment>
