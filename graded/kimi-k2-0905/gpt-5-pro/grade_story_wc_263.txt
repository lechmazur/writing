<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The narrator’s motivation—freeing creativity—remains lyrically asserted rather than dramatized through micro-choice; the single decisive action (turning the brass circles) is too briefly embodied to expose contradictory impulses or cost. Interiority is evocative but stays at atmospheric distance (“I felt the hour between breaths open”) rather than revealing a hierarchy of values under duress; no visible flaw or mistake compounds. Earned stasis is declared, not crystallized on the page, so the cap on 9-band is preserved.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly under an Accumulative lens: the final image of the narrator bowing while the aurora keeps the archway lit re-weights meaning with conceptual cost—mapping the unmeasurable leaves a “thin line of cold” inside. Orientation is anchored by word 30; causality is lyric, not because/thereor, but pattern-taught early via “unwritten calendar” and paid off in the last line, satisfying lens clarity. One meaningful tightening occurs when sparks become syllables that open the fledglings’ eyes; however, the prior beats are more tableau than escalating pressure under a single dominant stake, preventing 8-band entry.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The aurora-lit archway, frost, and brass instrument are filtered through a consistent lyric POV; cold arcs and comet-tail air recur to constrain bodily movement and ritual action. The archway functions as micro-setting that literally gates the transfer of creativity; its light folds and unfolds in the final image, charging closure with undeniable visual cost. No spatial contradictions or white-room gaps; selective sensory economy keeps description tethered to the narrator’s astronomical task.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</question><grade><comment>Dominant stake—freeing creativity—remains abstract; pressure is atmospheric rather than option-narrowing. Escalation accrues by image density (sparks → syllables → fledglings opening eyes) rather than by a tightening that forecloses a live alternative; no concrete resource is risked or lost. Cost is felt conceptually in the final image, meeting lens requirements, but agency is largely observational; the narrator turns circles and “spoke softly,” neither act creating a reversal that changes tactics.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme of liberated imagination emerges implicitly through the procession of sealed-then-roused fledgling thoughts; the final aurora wave answers with wordless permission rather than moral. Subtext resides in silence and ink running from beaks, avoiding overt thesis. However, the lyric register flirts with poetic abstraction that occasionally drifts toward pseudo-profundity (“shadowed rapture”), keeping the score below 8.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>First-person voice sustains a star-salted, frost-bitten diction that is unmistakably singular; perceptual signature is consistent (“the sky asked for mercy for all fallen things”). Syntax modulates from elongated lyric fragments to the sharply cadenced last line, mirroring the breath-like aurora folds. No head-hopping or register drift; poetic compression is pattern-taught in the opening and paid off in closure, satisfying experimental allowance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm alternates between incantational anaphora and crisp monosyllabic closures; paragraph cuts coincide with image shifts. Occasional metaphor density in adjacent sentences (“ash on its feathers,” “star-salted mantle”) flirts with overwriting but remains coherent under lyric mode. No loops, scaffold, or filter-verb stacks; information density stays high. Closure line is clean, resonant, and free of artifact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The fusion of aurora, unwritten calendar, and astronomical instrument as creativity-prison key feels freshly synthesized; trope of freeing muse is tilted through astronomic measurement of “falling star syllables.” Specificity of brass circles that warm under breath rescues the concept from generic fantasy. The lyric risk heightens stakes without obscuring closure, qualifying for +0.3 risk bonus within band.</comment>
