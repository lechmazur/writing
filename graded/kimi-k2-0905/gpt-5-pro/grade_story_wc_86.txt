<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The negotiator’s interiority is concrete—weight of grandmothers desk-pull, ledger finger on Daro’s line—and micro-choices (untethering lantern, demanding names) visibly cost him social breath. Interior contradiction flickers but stays subsumed by role; still, the final “I will hold this furrowed hush” crystallizes earned endurance with felt residue.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the last handshake lifts mist just enough to reweight the neutral ground rule-set; cost is the perpetual stewardship he accepts. Causal chain holds—moon-sync, apology sequence, Daro’s refusal—each because/therefore tightens until the final image forecloses easy forgiveness.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Parapet stones, antique pull, and low-breathing mist constrain every tactical move; the chest niche literally shapes who can stand where. Final lantern flicker against bruised water re-uses environmental elements to charge the resonant image, meeting 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—keeping neutral ground alive—tightens when Daro withholds crossing; negotiator’s demand for named apology narrows options and raises social cost. One meaningful deepening suffices; price is legible in the mothers’ still-blinking blame and his own chest holding their breath.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from iterative naming and withheld forgiveness: neutrality is not balance but unending vigilance. Final image of gulls “practicing forgiveness less grudgingly” reweights prior orchard-burn and net-cutting without moralizing, achieving Conceptual Repricing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>First-person voice carries distinct coastal cadence—“gull bone,” “bruised water unresentful”—and perceptual signature filters every object through negotiator’s weighing instinct. Compression like “garden for careful words” teaches pattern early; no head-hopping, distance stable.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Lyric density stays purposeful; no mixed metaphors or filter stacks. Minor scaffold—“furrowed hush” thrice—does not touch closure beat; information load remains high with rhythmic variation. Read-aloud ear test passes.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prisoner swap on moon-clock neutral parapet feels fresh; antique drawer pull as inherited conscience transforms familiar war-atonement trope. Risk of lyric stasis is converted into tactical object that must be handled before anyone moves, making specificity indispensable.</comment>
