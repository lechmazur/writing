<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The bell-ringer’s calm, listening stance is embodied in every micro-choice (tuning, letting the child ring, refusing to preach); the final shrug-epiphany “I only arranged listening” crystallizes a credible renunciation of authority that costs him nothing yet gives everything to the crowd. Interiority stays concrete—“the sting of deep corridors” felt in the child’s hand—never drifting into diagnostic talk. No secondary character applies pressure, so relationship bullets are correctly N/A. The only hairline slip: “powerfully gentle” is asserted more than tested, but the child’s bell-ring pays it off with visible metal.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the protagonist forecloses the path of priestly certainty, accepting the modest cost of anonymity while the mined light pours a quiet crown over the crowd—image makes the conceptual reprice unmistakable. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: because/therefore chains are soft, but density of refracted light→sound→footsteps tightens until the hallway itself becomes a current. Orientation is taught lyrically—“golden shadows pool”—and pays off in the final amber rim. One transition (lab→street) is legible; pattern of stations is established by 25 % mark.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The carbide-lens is the micro-setting that constrains every tactical choice: it angles light, teaches bells new throats, and finally crowns the pilgrims—remove it and the entire closure collapses. Spatial choreography is clean: lens→table→hall→door→street; no floating rooms. Sensory economy is ruthless—coal-scarred glass, knuckles in paint, breath between syllables—each detail re-appears charged in the final image. Tone of “golden shadows” modulates from hush to communal glow without ever naming sentiment.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—discovering the texture of connection—is signaled in paragraph four and tightens through each station’s audible map that forecloses isolation. Escalation is textural: densities of light, knock-patterns, and breath accumulate until the hallway current literally moves shoes; the price is the protagonist’s relinquishment of narrative control. No coincidences; pressure remains coherent under Accumulative lens. Cost is visible in the final rim of mined light that brands shoulders—social credit transferred from curator to crowd.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: connection is not broadcast but refracted—light bent through scars, silence bent through company. The bells’ final quiet crown reweights the entire premise: silence is not absence but a room waiting for company. No moral is stated; the child’s ring and the stranger’s laugh carry the epiphany. Ambiguity lingers—can bells forgive?—left resonant rather than resolved.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>First-person lyric voice owns a consistent perceptual signature: “prism-song bell ringer,” “obedient fans of light,” “slow bell of each other”—diction stays mined-mythic without slipping into catalogue. Rhythm accelerates with parataxis during crowd flow, then slows to a single amber ember, mirroring the pilgrimage’s pacing. No head-hopping; “we” remains collective stance. Compression like “timelines ruined, and nights sewn together without plugs” is taught early and paid off in final quiet.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm is hypnotic yet varied; sentence lengths create visual waves. Information density high—each sentence does double duty (e.g., “dust listens as if preparing to confess” advances atmosphere and stakes). Zero paraphrase loops; no mixed metaphors. Minor hairline: occasional stacked modifiers (“quiet crown of mined glass”) but they serve the lyric pattern and do not obscure the closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Premise—sound pilgrimage guided by scarred light—is fresh synthesis of ritual physics. The carbide-lens reborn as sacrament feels inevitable yet unforeseen. Risky lyric accumulative structure pays off in final crowned shoulders. If relocated to another city or ringer, the entire emotional machinery collapses—transformation test passed.</comment>
