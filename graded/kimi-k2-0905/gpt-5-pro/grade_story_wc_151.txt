<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The pseudonym creator’s interiority is vivid—“tired grin like a night lake,” the tactile love of margins—and micro-choices (kneeling to recode chalk, folding the letter) reveal hierarchy of values. Yet the decisive moment—the promise to the edges—lands as gentle stasis rather than a visible renunciation that costs him something concrete; the cost is all Mira’s. Still, the mentor recursion (Oona’s arrows) gives credible continuity to his flaw/struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds: chalk color→margin→alias→decoy accumulates into a Charged Poise at the brass slot. Orientation is anchored by line 4; causality is interior but coherent—each chalk revision literally rewrites the envelope’s risk. Closure reweights the premise: the margin itself becomes agent, cost felt in “promise the edges.” Only minor slack: the post-scanner rules are asserted, not tested, so the conceptual cost is slightly abstract.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The golden arcade breathes—brass teeth, pigeon vows, dew-lit chalk—each detail filtered through the namer’s connoisseur eye. The clipboard’s lacquer reflects “night lake,” turning tool into micro-setting that constrains the final fold. Sidewalk chalk is not backdrop but code surface, its colors literally mapping envelope margins; this charges the final image. Spatial choreography is immaculate from bench to slot.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“make my words arrive unbroken”—tightens once: the chalk cipher collapses postal surveillance into a single maneuver that forecloses the unsafe route. Agency is shared: Mira surrenders data; protagonist rewrites the margins; both accept slowed transit as price. Cost is legible in the hush before the slot, but because the scanner threat is off-stage, the price stays conceptual rather than visceral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges obliquely: identity is writable surface, memory dwells in the slack spaces institutions ignore. The chalk→margin→alias chain reconfigures meaning without proclaiming it. Final image—hand lowered, promise to edges—offers resonant non-literal answer: safety is not erasure but controlled exposure. No moral, only charged poise.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>First-person voice is crystalline, synesthetic, with signature tics: compound epithets (“futuristic nostalgia”), metaphorical leaps that stay sensual. Rhythm flexes—long breathless sentences for dawn light, clipped fragments at the slot. No filter-verb clutter; perception is embodied (“throat tightens,” “letter weighs”). Distinction holds under pressure; no head-hop.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet aerated: “the faint perfume of gum arabic” does triple sense/occupation/texture duty. One mixed metaphor (“mouth full of coins” beside “brass teeth”) is hairline but doesn’t cloud causality. No loops or scaffold; paragraphs are lean, each advances stance or setting. Closural promise line is lucid, rhythmic, unadorned.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Premise refreshes the stale surveillance trope by weaponizing stationery ephemera—margins, chalk, gum arabic. Sidewalk cipher-game as postal hack is non-obvious yet inevitable once taught. Risk is taken with lyric slow pacing in a spy-ish micro-plot; coherence held. Specificity of “ebony clipboard” and “stamp looks bruised” anchors freshness.</comment>
