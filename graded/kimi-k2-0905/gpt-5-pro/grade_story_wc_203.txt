<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The technician’s calm, tactile competence stays credible; interiority is thin but consistent. No contradictory impulse is dramatized—he simply follows ghostly cues—so the final “lightness” feels asserted rather than paid for. Still, the embodied dust-analysis beat shows micro-choice under pressure and keeps the score above mid-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: exposing the ceiling grift reweights the circus’s moral rule-set and the narrator’s vocation. Causal chain is intact—barrel → hatch → mirrors → expose—though the ghosts’ stakes are declared not tested. Cost is implicit but legible: the booth can no longer sell its lie. Meets 9+ quick test for closure with cost; lens is Accumulative, held throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dust, mirror-crawlspace, and barrel are specific, tactile, and action-integrated. The ceiling mechanism directly constrains the final exposure move, satisfying the 9+ gate. Sensory economy is tight; no orientation debt.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—uncover what ceilings hide—tightens once when the hatch yields the mirror rig. Pressure is situational, coherent, but single-pulse; no secondary tightening or price paid by protagonist. Escalation is sufficient for length but not high-band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of hidden ethical rot emerges organically from the ceiling reveal; no overt moralizing. Final image of “cracks letting truth escape” offers resonant non-literal answer. Subtext in ghost silence and dust patterns is effective, though secondary stakes (ghost hunger) remain abstract.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>First-person voice is textured, rhythmic, and technician-specific: “loads and escapes,” “shafts and cables.” Metaphors are controlled, never purple; perceptual signature holds. No head-hop; lyric compression is taught early and paid off in final “habit of looking up.”</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>High information density—almost every sentence layers image + motion + subtext. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Rhythm modulates with discovery beats; paragraph cuts are clean. Minor over-packaging in opening two sentences keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Fusing elevator repair with ghost-grift exposure feels fresh and specific; the mainspring barrel as both timepiece and latch key is an ingenious pivot. Dust-pattern forensics repurposes technician skill into ghost-hunt method. Risk-taking is coherent, not gimmicky.</comment>
