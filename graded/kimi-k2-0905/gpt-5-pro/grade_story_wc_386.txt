<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The narrator’s vocation as “wreck-diver ghost whisperer” is vividly embodied in every image and gesture; interiority stays concrete, never sliding into label-speak. The decision to carry Leda’s name out is seeded early in the pulse-borrowing dream and paid for in the final cold lift of the globe—an earned renunciation of anonymity. Micro-choices (kneeling, whispering, lifting) crystallize a hierarchy of values without exposition. The only bar to 9.0 is that the ghost herself remains slightly emblematic; her agency is felt but not internally conflicted.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the instant the narrator speaks “Leda,” the shrine inhales, starlight pours, and every prior dream-window reconfigures from fragment to raft—cost is the irreversible cold now lodged in the narrator’s palms. Causality is lyric but traceable: each dream-cameo tightens the search vector, the globe’s blank core refracts the protagonist’s face as obligation, and the final lift forecloses silence. Accumulative lens holds from first candle to last seal; no ambiguity at the hinge. The ending image reweights the whole lyric pattern without a syllable of explanation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The glacier shrine is not backdrop but tool: its candle-warmed seams decide when the ghost can arrive, and the thinning ice literally windows the starlight that baptizes the name. Micro-setting—the melted snow globe—constrains the final gesture: only because its base is scarred can the letters be read, making the object the fulcrum of closure. Spatial choreography is immaculate; the narrator’s knees, the girl’s blink, the smoke writing frozen pleas all track without drift. Every sensory detail is filtered through the POV’s professional lexicon of salvage and breath.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—retrieving a name from erasure—tightens exactly once, but that tightening is decisive: the moment the narrator realizes the globe’s base still bears legible scars, silence is no longer an option. Pressure is accumulative: each dream-cameo adds density until the shrine’s candle-smoke becomes the final witness. Cost is conceptual but legible: the narrator exits bearing the name’s cold weight, a path foreclosed to anonymity. No false escalation—just a single, irreversible reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges obliquely: salvage is not of objects but of memory’s right to exist. The final image reweights “forgiveness” from abstract virtue to literal ice that can be carried and melted by living palms. No moral is stated; instead, the shrine’s inhale re-prices silence as complicity. The story trusts the reader to feel the political sting beneath the lyric ice.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>First-person voice is unmistakable: the diction of “wreck-diver ghost whisperer” permeates every sentence, filtering perception through salvage metaphors—threads, lungs, buoys. Rhythmic compression under pressure (“I lift the globe high and feel its weight turn to direction”) propels without losing clarity. No head-hopping; the ghost’s voice is quoted only through the narrator’s mouth, maintaining distance. Elision of linear grammar is taught early (“I slide in with my pack”) and paid off in the final fragmentary promise.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Line-level craft is near-flawless: every sentence does two jobs—image and causality—with zero paraphrase loops. Metaphors are coherent within the maritime/glacial physics (starlight as buoy-channel, candles as bruises). The only hairline slip is occasional adjective density (“blue slabs,” “honey bruise”) that could breathe more, but it never obscures the closure image. Read-aloud rhythm modulates from tidal long sentences to the final staccato step into night.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>The fusion of maritime salvage, glacial shrine, and dream-forensics feels inevitable yet unexampled; the lyric ghost story is retooled through industrial-accident indictment without ever stating it. Risk—letting the climax be a single spoken name—pays off because the entire texture has taught the reader to feel phonemes as ice. The snow-globe-as-urn trope is completely re-invented by heat-scarred legibility. Freshness arises from specific occupational diction rather than surface quirk; the story could not survive relocation to another metaphoric field.</comment>
