<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Ilya’s interiority is lyrically specific—“the world seemed to rarefy around his ribs”—and his poetic vocation is shown through action (carrying redacted notebooks, reciting the banned poem). The moment he stands on the catwalk and reads to the storm is a credible renunciation that costs him the safety of silence. Mara functions less as a second character than as a catalyst voice; status/push-and-pull stays soft, so relationship crucible is only lightly charged. Still, the flaw-to-cost pipeline holds: the same sensitivity that got his work censored now propels him to expose it to lightning and witnesses.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands with unmistakable cost: the bell rings into a silence “full of relief, the hush of ink drying on sky”—a Charged Poise that reweights both the stakes of censorship and the act of speaking. Causality is lyric-Accumulative: the timer’s clicks, the storm’s cadence, and the scarred sky photos layer until the only remaining action is to speak the poem aloud. Orientation is clean by line 10; the envelope-in-timetable mechanic is taught early and paid off when Mara confesses to planting it. No lens ambiguity; pattern holds.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The observatory’s glass dome, chemical smell, and “old star charts peeled like weathered tattoos” are tactile, choice-guiding details; the catwalk height and upward-firing rain physically pressure the final reading. Body and tool function as micro-setting: the darkroom timer’s “mechanical heartbeat” and the “nicked face like a veteran” objectify Ilya’s own timed survival under censorship. Environment directly constrains the climax—no shelter from lightning while reciting—so the 9+ gate is met. Phrases such as “cloud seas” and “tin taste of beginnings” are compressed yet precise, never stalling momentum.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—voice versus erasure—signals in paragraph 1 and tightens each time the timer clicks. The meaningful deepening is the revelation that storm-scars can be photographed and timed; this reframes Ilya’s private redaction as part of a mappable sky-complicity, narrowing his options to public speech. Agency is crystallized in the final act: he elects to read aloud while lightning writes overhead, paying the price of exposure. Cost is felt on-page—“the silence that followed was not empty”—meeting the 8+ bar; could have hit 8.8 if a persistent physical constraint (e.g., timer running out of spring) had directly imperilled the reading.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme—censorship as a shared atmospheric scar—emerges through scarred sky plates, redacted notebooks, and the literal scarring of film by lightning, never through exposition. The final image of ink drying on sky conceptually reprices every prior crossing-out: speech is now indelible weather. Subtext is carried in gesture (Mara handing over the same envelope) and in the metronome of the timer, not in statement. Minor deduction for one overt thematic line—“to understand the cartography of scars”—but it arrives early and is re-earned by closure, so sermon penalty is minimal (-0.3).</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person lyric compression is consistent, with perceptual signature in phrases like “mountain air thin as his breath.” No head-hopping; Mara’s interior is never ventriloquized. Filter verbs are scarce; when used (“he felt the slight resistance”) they’re embedded in embodied action. Rhythm modulates with pressure—short sentence bursts during the climb, then longer rolling cadences as the storm breathes in—demonstrating disciplined voice control.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Sentence variety and information density are high: “Rain fired upward from the cloud seas, bright with electric threads” does double sensory work while advancing plot. A few metaphor layers verge on excess (“storm-kissed wonder,” “weathered tattoos”) but never clog the decisive beats. No loops, scaffold, or register drift; pronouns stay clean through the single-scene choreography. Opening and closing lines are crisp anchors that could survive a copy-editor’s scalpel untouched.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Fusing Soviet-style samizdat with astronomy noir feels fresh, yet grows organically from the premise: astrophotographic plates as forbidden manuscripts, lightning as censor’s pen. The “cartography of scars” concept reweights both celestial and political wounds without announcing itself as allegory. Risk—the entire plot hinges on a metronome and a recitation—pays off because the storm is credibly dangerous and the poem is actually spoken. Not quite 9+ because the Mara-device is faintly contrived, but the synthesis is memorable.</comment>
