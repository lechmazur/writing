<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The thief’s contradictory impulse—stealing light yet giving it—drives every beat; the mirrored encounter with the older self crystallizes a credible, costly renunciation. Interiority is sensorily anchored (“jar hums like a heartbeat”), never abstract. micro-choice to release, not capture, the moonbeams forecloses his habitual identity with visible, felt price. Relationship with florist only off-page; no status shift, so relationship crucible bullet waived.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the released moonbeams redistribute fate and reconfigure both selves in one image. Causal linkage holds: bouquet warning → recognition → joint ear-to-door → renunciation; cost is legible in “relieved light” and the mother kept alive. Lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern of light-theft refractions tightens meaning rather than options. No orientation debt; anchor triad clear by line 6.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Station’s emerald tiles, service-door paint, and moonlit roof trusses act as pressure valves—proximity to tracks and the brass “destiny” door literally channel the final choice. Micro-setting objects (jar, bouquet, timetable glass) constrain tactics: jar must open here, bouquet codes dictate wait. Sensory hierarchy skews visual but moonbeam touch and metallic scent keep balance. Spatial choreography clean; no impossible positions.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether to keep or release the captured light—tightens once when the mirrored self appears, narrowing options to stay or board. Escalation is textural: each refracted image (departures glass, shoe-mirror, florist window) increases emotional density until refusal is the only breathable act. Cost is the thief’s surrendered legend and the older self’s surrendered train. Coincidence (meeting self) complicates but does not resolve; agency remains with the jar’s release.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from reciprocal theft: taking light versus giving it back. Subtext resides in floral codes and mirrored faces rather than overt statement. Final image of moonbeams “clicking tiny shutters” offers conceptual repricing—world briefly forgives itself, reweighting the thief’s moral ledger. No sermonizing; complexity preserved in the unsolved future of both selves.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>First-person lyric voice sustains a controlled poetic cadence without sacrificing clarity; perceptual signature filters every observation through light-thief ontology. Compression (“timing smelled of cut stems and station metal”) is taught early and paid off in final “relieved light.” No dialogue to judge; free-indirect stays clean. Vocabulary (“minnows testing a river mouth”) stays inside idiom of a metaphysical photographer.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Rhythm modulates from long, breath-held sentences to staccato fragments that echo train announcements. Figurative density is high but patterned—each metaphor is refracted light, so coherence holds. No scaffold loops; every sentence either advances image or tightens choice. Peak beat “moonbeams clicked their tiny shutters” is crystalline, unobscured.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The conceit of stealing not faces but moments of vulnerable luminescence is fresh; mirrored-self encounter avoids cliché by being mutually elective rather than corrective. Floral-code language system is specific to this world and replicable for future stories. Risk in lyric accumulation pays off: final “respectful trade” recharges every prior refraction. Premise could not survive substitution of elements; its coherence is inseparable from station, moon, and jar.</comment>
