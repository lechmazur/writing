<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Mara’s interiority is lyrically particular (“She bows near the bridge so the violin scratches out stars, then backs away to offer milk”), her contradictory desire to perfect the imperfect is embodied in micro-moves under rising pressure, and the final renunciation of flawless sound costs her the safe silence she once cherished. The boy and diver remain functional types rather than full secondary crucibles, but her solo arc satisfies single-POV scope. No label-speak; embodied emotion carries every beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the chronic hush is not banished but taught to “listen behind voices,” a felt social cost paid by Mara’s relinquishing control of flawless pitch. Causal chain holds—every storytelling beat is enabled by her prior choice to invite error. Orientation is anchored by line 3 (“sunken orchard greenhouse ringed by shipwrecks”) and the pattern is taught early. Persistent constraint: the cracked bell will never sound whole; this limitation shapes the final tactic and image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The greenhouse glass, ship-rib elders, and cracked bell function as micro-setting that constrains tactics—glass panes dictate where the bowl catches leaks, ship ribs dictate fire placement, bell’s fracture dictates the final timbre. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: Mara hears salt dripping before she sees light. Spatial choreography is flawless across the dive and bell-hoist. Final image recharges every prior acoustic surface.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—releasing the chronic hush—tightens when each storytelling act risks louder rupture; escalation is Accumulative: density of shared voices increases until the cracked bell’s first pulse reweights silence from foe to partner. Visible cost: the bell’s missing tongue and the violin’s deliberate scratchiness foreclose flawless harmony forever. One meaningful deepening suffices; no reversals required.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without sermon: the unfinished is the only space where communal life can continue after ecological ruin. Subtext lives in gesture—coins, cherries, and a napkin map sharing the same bowl crystallize value shift from commerce to mutual caretaking. Final cracked-honey note is the non-literal answer, reweighting imperfection as the new survival mode. No thematic echo; no moralizing final line.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric voice sustains a perceptual signature attuned to acoustic texture; every metaphor is sonic (“drops answer back,” “bow scratches stars,” “bell yields cracked honey”). Syntax modulates with pressure—short fragments during fire-start, lengthened cadences during bell descent. No head-hopping; collective “we” in closing line is a stable Charged Poise, not POV drift. Elision (“she tunes by listening…”) taught early and paid off in every subsequent tuning act.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm is oceanic—varied sentence openings, no template cadence. Information density is high: one sentence often layers acoustic, emotional, and ecological data. Figurative control precise: “ribs of ships encircle like elders” marries anatomy, ancestry, and acoustics without mixed metaphor. Zero loops, scaffold, or register drift; no artifacts in final third.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Premise—post-burn rainforest community re-growing music inside salt-drowned glass—feels inevitable yet unexampled. Transformation test fails if relocated to generic desert or intact forest; specificity is the engine. Risk in hybrid lyric structure pays off: closure still legible under Accumulative lens. Fresh inflection: using a cracked bell as communal larynx for a hush that learns to breathe.</comment>
