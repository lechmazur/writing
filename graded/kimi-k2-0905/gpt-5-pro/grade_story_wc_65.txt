<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>A single, nameless “I” carries the entire piece; interiority is rich and particular (“ignorance cartographer”), embodied emotion vivid (“shoulders drop”). No contradictory impulse is staged in scene—pressure is mostly rhetorical—so the final choice feels pre-declared rather than wrestled. Still, the vocation-level motivation stays consistent and the micro-choice to write the trellis not the wall is credible with felt civic cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the quill hovers, the city leans, uncertainty is embraced. Causal chain holds: unchecked past oracle → Council fear → trellis offer → acceptance. Orientation anchor (who/where) is clear within 50 words. The only drag is a 40-word reflective block that slightly dilates the tightening beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Obsidian spire, reed-shaped chamber, cracking lake—each detail is filtered through cartographer priorities and subtly guides the decision to model rather than decree. Micro-setting (the slate table’s brass orreries) doubles as tool and garden, charging the final image. Weather is causal, not decorative: lake-sigh softens Council resistance. Spatial choreography is clean throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“will the city accept a constraint-respecting forecast?”—is signaled early and tightens once when the Council’s fear is counter-modeled. The meaningful turn is the speaker’s refusal to deliver certainty, which forecloses the Council’s preferred path and carries civic risk. Cost is conceptual but legible: future openness itself. No visible resource loss keeps it from 8.8+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</question><grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: knowledge that admits its own gaps is more durable than false certainty. The kingfisher-as-trellis image reweights earlier motif; the final “we stood together” crystallizes a civic stance, not a moral. No tidy binary—uncertainty is teacher, not hero. Resonant ambiguity lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>First-person voice is lyrically compressed yet always legible (“ignorance cartographer,” “cages make reckless wings”). Syntax lengthens under contemplation, shortens at the hinge moment of raising the quill. No head-hop; perceptual signature stays consistent. Patterned elision (“before the pen meets…”) is taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Rhythm breathes with argument cadence; no adjacent paraphrase or template runs. Figurative density is high but each metaphor is swiftly repurposed (orreries as gardens, maps as honest gaps). Register stays within the cartographer’s plausible lexicon. One near-muddle: “pressure hides under smoothness” is rescued by immediate lake-crack auditory grounding. Closure line is crisp.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The “ignorance cartographer” premise freshens the familiar “seer who refuses to prophesy” trope by embedding it in civic brass-and-abacus logistics. Risk is taken: 750-word single-scene reflection-led arc hinges on a non-event (not writing). Synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight—trellis not wall—earning the +0.4 risk bonus. Could edge higher if lake-crack had physically altered the quill stroke.</comment>
