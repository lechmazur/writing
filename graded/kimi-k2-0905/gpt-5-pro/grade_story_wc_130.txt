<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority shines—"I must dovetail grief with practice" crystallizes a believable contradiction. The conjurer’s choices (humming, tracing, packing) grow from a single motive and carry visible cost. Missing only a hairline: no second character on-page to test status shifts, so the full crucible bullet is waived.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is CR: “a single fruit of chalk and salt” reprices the entire premise—mathematics becomes taste, solution becomes scaffold. Lens is Accumulative/Textural; cadence slows, stakes deepen, cost is undeniable. No orientation debt; anchors land by line 3. One transition (orchard → exit) is legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Micro-setting triumph: the glass eyes function as both mirror and lens, constraining every measurement the conjurer makes. Drip tempo, stone cracks, and root-black water evolve with emotional pressure. Sensory hierarchy obeys POV—only what can be sung or weighed is retained. Final image recharges the skylight crack.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—turning absence into countable continuity—tightens once when the stalactites slow and the apprentice figure refracts. Cost is felt (orchard gifts the chalk-salt apple), but escalation is single-pulse rather than a because/therefore chain; under Accumulative lens this suffices. No visible loss of tool or stamina, so ceiling stops at 8.3.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the equation scaffold itself—mathematics as tenderness, not solution. The chalk-salt apple is the non-literal answer, reweighting “math of emotion” into taste of recognition. No sermon, no thesis echo. Ambiguity lingers: unfinished theorem stays open, yet continuity is tasted.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Perceptual signature is relentless: mineral radiance, decimal pauses, velvet pupil reflections—diction never leaves the conjurer’s lexicon. Syntax breathes with drip tempo; fragments appear only when drops hesitate. Pattern-taught elision (“neither gone nor present”) is paid off in the final bow. No head-hop; single POV holds.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>High information density: one sentence often twins sensory data with abstract math (“joy equals expansion”). No loops, no scaffold, no mixed metaphors. Rhythm accelerates at the slowing drip—an intentional inversion. Closure beat is crystalline: “silence opens like a gate” without register drift.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: taxidermy eyes + stalactite drip = emotional barometer. Orchard-as-equation is conceptually bold yet rendered tactile. Transformation test fails if eyes swapped—only glass never-lived can listen in mineral grammar. Risk (lyric math in 740 words) heightens coherence without obscuring closure.</comment>
