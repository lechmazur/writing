<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The mapper’s interiority is vivid and embodied; contradictory impulses ripple under every chalk stroke. Micro-choices (lowering the punch, stamping the blank ticket) carry visible cost and foreclose retreat. The final renunciation—truths as travelers, not prisoners—earns its ache through the litany of personal admissions. Voice never slips into diagnostic labels; even “trembling certainty” is lived, not asserted.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the fortress dissolves into a platform where sentences walk themselves home. Cost is legible in the ticket’s blank glow and the narrator’s last raised hand. Accumulative lens holds: each offering tightens the hush until the vault brightens. Pattern taught early (cracks → arrows) pays off in the star-map floor that writes back.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The city’s skin—pavement cracks that breathe direction—functions as both setting and navigational tool, constraining every turn. The railyard’s “contour of absence” becomes a door only when the punch clicks, fusing object + environment. Starlit vault literally reconfigures space into a listening chamber, forcing the final stance. Micro-setting (ticket blank, gate of hush) charges the last image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can I pay for my own silences?—tightens with each ticket-stamp until the blank itself glows. Agency is crystalline: every arrow followed is a prior refusal rewritten. No coincidence; pressure grows because the narrator keeps offering real nights and real lovers. Final cost: the fortress never kept truths, only the shape of holding—option foreclosed, stance crystallized.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the inversion of maps: territories we draw for others vs. the uncharted we refuse to enter. Motif of “backs of words” reweights at closure—meanings now walk away on their own. No moralizing; the whispered “truths are travelers” is an image, not a thesis. Emotional aftereffect lingers as the uncanny lightness of unburdened silence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature—geometry of feelings laid onto street grids—remains laser-specific; even rain hums like tuning forks. Syntax breathes with the mapper’s pulse: long lattice sentences for route-calculus, fragmented clicks for ticket stamps. No head-hopping; distance tightens from satchel to starlit vault without register drift. Final image retains rhythmic control: “trembling certainty” modulates into charged poise.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Almost every sentence carries dual duty: “cracks in pavement forming arrows” maps terrain and psyche in one breath. Zero paraphrase loops; no scaffold. Metaphors stay internally coherent—ticket punch as tiny thunder—without crowding peak beats. Minor late elevation (“listening fires”) barely grazes closure; clarity remains intact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>Fusion of urban cartography with metaphysical transit feels inevitable yet unseen before. Phantom punch clicking only for secrets-paid fares transforms a dusty prop into moral technology. Risk in lyric vault section pays off by making silence audible. Specificity—backs of words, inkless ticket—prevents allegory from turning generic.</comment>
