<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The narrator’s contradictory impulses—hunger for truth vs. reflexive skepticism—live in scene: turning the beaded wheel while tasting soap/oil/pleading, feeling beads bite skin. Interiority is concrete (“drowsy alertness bloom behind my eyes”), never diagnostic; the micro-choice to turn the wheel costs blood and belief. The swallowed tag becomes a coin against gum, a bodily refusal to relinquish the mass of swallowed truth. Earned Stasis lands: he carries the weight, foreclosing the mother-erased version of his father; cost is the taste of metal and the click of life’s gears he cannot un-hear.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: confession → maps calls → tunnel → valve → tag/ledger, each because/therefore tightening options. Closure is the Decisive Change: the ledger’s zeros re-price his father’s life; the tag in cheek makes the cost bodily. Orientation anchors within 120 words: “abandoned train tunnel,” “factory ghost shift,” mother’s confession. No lens ambiguity; pattern of rust/schedules taught early; final image (tag as coin) persistent constraint shaping next silence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Tunnel, wheel, beads, ledger, tag—each object is handled, not catalogued. The beaded valve wheel constrains the final act: its glass/plastic beads bite skin, turning memory into wound. Grease-slick rails and lye-damp air evolve as gate opens; smell shifts from metallic to paper-bleach, guiding descent. Micro-setting succeeds: the lunch pail and ledger in the niche are the entire world for the climax.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—find the swallowed truth’s weight—tightens when wheel turns and zeros in ledger erase father’s hours. One meaningful escalation: choice to open gate narrows options to either accept erased math or carry it; protagonist chooses oral, bodily keeping (tag in cheek). Cost is palpable: the “click” of life’s gears, the metallic taste. Agency drives turn; coincidence only complicates (footsteps without feet).</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges via industrial erasure: zeros where a life should be. Subtext in gesture—beads as prayer substitute for unbeliever—reweights at end: tag becomes relic. No moralizing; final image (coin against gum) non-literally answers how much erased life weighs. Ambiguity lingers: ghost shift as both joke and lived extinction. Particulars (soap/oil/pleading taste) ground universality without abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>First-person voice distinct: syntax elongates then compresses under pressure (“I slid down, reckless indeed, my light a tired moon”). Perceptual signature—“appraise their fear the way surveyors weigh slopes”—anchors narrator’s skeptical empiricist bent. No head-hop; diction stays within mill-explorer lexicon. Rhythm mirrors breath: long anaphoric sentences in tunnel hush, staccato descent into niche. No dialogue, hence no voice convergence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>High density: single sentences fuse action, image, abstraction (“confession…warm weight like another hand”). No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances. Figurative language disciplined—metaphors stay industrial (prayer gulped at daylight). One mixed image only: “machine that never stops” as both literal conveyor and metaphysical appetite, but justified by radio-call source. Final line cadence mirrors heartbeat; no scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Ghost-shift premise refreshed through actuarial horror: zeros in ledger = erased life. Risk taken in lyric density, but pattern taught early (“liturgy made of rust, leaks, and schedules”) and paid off. Beads-as-relic transform cheap craft item into secular sacrament. Emotional specificity trumps surface novelty; yet tunnel/ledger/tag configuration feels unique. Transformation test fails—could not swap setting without breaking causal chain.</comment>
