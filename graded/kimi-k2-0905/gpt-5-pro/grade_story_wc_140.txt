<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The survivor’s compulsive listening and cartography of rumor are concrete, embodied choices under pressure; the final shared silence with the woman shows earned stasis. Interiority stays sensory—“cold arrangement of causes in my throat”—never abstract. No secondary character applies pressure, so relationship bullets are waived. The flaws (namelessness, compulsive collection) directly shape the closing choice to teach listening, paying the cost of perpetual ghosthood.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of layered fragments tightens until the poison label and the woman reweight the stake—memory reclaimed through shared listening. Closure is Charged Poise: “together we moved…returning what it gathered” crystallizes options with felt cost of eternal witness. Orientation is taught early—“the harbor remembers me”—so no penalty. One transition (office to rows) is legible; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Harbor, containers, tide, and poison label are never backdrop: the label’s almond scent charges the final image; container walls literally speak names. Micro-setting (body-as-archive) constrains the protagonist to auditory cartography. Spatial choreography is clean: wedged between rusted walls → office → rows at evening. Weather and boot-prints in mud evolve with tidal clock, mirroring internal erased/recovered rhythm.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—reclaim erased identity via memory-texture—signaled in line 3. Pressure deepens through accumulating fragments; poison label tightens threat of official erasure. No reversal, but one decisive deepening: clerk’s “no one harmed officially” forecloses appeal, forcing shift to communal listening. Cost is visible: acceptance of ghosthood as price of witness.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from specific harbor detritus: erasure is a bureaucratic tide, memory is glass softened by rumor. Subtext in gesture—tucking label into pulse sleeve—carries murder/memory fusion without statement. Final image reweights “clean holds” promise into shared custodianship of toxic archive. No moralizing; irony lingers that official narrative stays “correct.”</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>First-person lyric accumulates cadence through anaphora and maritime consonants—“gulls are overseers, cranes are metronomes”—taught immediately. Perceptual signature is haptic-acoustic, never visual-catalog. Filter verbs (“I felt”) are voice-motivated, not hedging. No dialogue to distort; internal diction stays within dockhand lexicon. Closure cadence slows, mirroring tidal inhale.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>High figurative density is patterned early—diesel sheen, crab hieroglyphs—and paid off in final tide metaphor; no mixed vehicles. Sentence rhythm accelerates with ship-horn fragments, then exhales into long final clause. No loops or synonym churn; each image adds new sensory layer. Occasional elevated diction (“conceptual repricing”) is narrator’s self-invented bureaucratese, justified.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Premise—ghost alive by clerical error—flips survival trope into archive haunting. Container labyrinth as memory palace feels inevitable, not gimmick. Risk of lyric fragment mosaic is rewarded by closure that reweights rumor into collective resistance. Specificity of almond–seawater poison label is unforgettable; removal would collapse thematic chemistry between murder and official bath.</comment>
