<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The adjuster’s motive—“to whisper a lullaby across a thousand lifetimes”—is lyrically declared but never tested by an opposed want; interiority is atmospheric, not contradictory. The puppet-as-key-holder is a lovely micro-choice, yet the only visible cost is the slow of the clock, not a renounced desire. Emotional embodiment is strong (“bruised awe,” salt-taste of stillness) but stays in one register. Earned stasis is present, but the absence of a live opposing pressure keeps the arc just shy of top-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Cumulative/Textural lens is taught at once (“nested patterns,” tide cadence) and held to the final image; closure is a Charged Poise where slower time and inward ribbon-light reweight the stake with undeniable conceptual cost. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) are nested inside sensory detail—no penalty. The sequence of key-turns and lullaby scatter is legible micro-escalation; no causal turns are required under this lens. Final line “to welcome” crystallizes the reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The lighthouse, pane of hush, and puppet head are not backdrop but tools that constrain each ritual step; the pane literally swallows sound, altering what the adjuster can hear before acting. Spatial choreography is immaculate—hand, key, finial, lens move in tracked succession. Weather and tide evolve from bruised dusk to confident starlight, mirroring the clock’s slackening. Only missing is a sharper bodily risk from the environment to reach 9+.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“keep endings patient” via slower fall—is signaled early and deepened through each nested pattern gate. Agency is the deliberate key-turns that “unknot a century”; price is tasted copper regret and widened seconds. No external antagonist is needed; pressure is coherent cosmic urgency. Cost is legible but abstract (taste, time-width) rather than a concrete forfeiture, keeping it just below top band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the adjuster’s practice of mercy-as-slowing rather than any stated moral. The lullaby motif migrates from girl’s gift to cosmic seed, reweighted in the final ribbon-light image. Subtext operates in silence: the puppet’s open jaw = world’s need for audience. Avoids sermon; ends on image, not thesis. Slight abstraction of “kind weather” keeps it from 9+.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>First-person lyric voice sustains a bruised-awe cadence with tidal sentence rhythm; no head-hop. Diction (“vouchsafe,” “comb-ing its memory”) stays within the adjuster’s ceremonial register. Compression taught early—“nested patterns,” “pane of hush”—and paid off in closure. No dialogue, so no voice convergence issue.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Lines are dense but never paraphrase-looped; each image advances stake or atmosphere. Metaphors (bell-shaped stillness, salt taste) stay coherent and sensory. Occasional elevated Latinate diction (“vouchsafe,” “conceptual”) is consistent with ritual voice. One near-template run—“pattern of tides, pattern of light, pattern of scars”—is pattern-taught and forgiven.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Doomsday-clock-keeper in a sound-swallowing lighthouse is a fresh synthesis; puppet-as-key-casket evolves from prop to witness. Lullaby as cosmic intervention subverts typical apocalypse tropes. Specificity of nested rings drinking dusk feels inevitable yet new. Risk is quiet rather than gimmick, earning its lift.</comment>
