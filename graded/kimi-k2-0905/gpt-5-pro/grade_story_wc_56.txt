<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The seeker’s interiority is vivid and embodied—every beat of poling, every flicker of the sundial shadow is filtered through a mind trained to distrust clocks and read stains. His contradictory impulses (rage vs. colder patience, salvage vs. exposure) act simultaneously in scene, not in summary. The final stance—naming currents instead of shouting—earns its cost: the foreman’s bucket-set-down slump, the siren’s conscience-cut blast, the sundial’s black verdict across the logo. Micro-choices (waving the key, half-tarping crates, speaking “not loud, but thoughtfully clear”) crystallize a hierarchy of values that forecloses silence without turning the protagonist into a crusader caricature.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the sundial’s shadow becomes a black verdict that reweights every prior ledger scratch and crate label; the canal breeze “as if witnesses exhaled” makes the social cost undeniable. Causal lattice is tight—because sundial scratches align with ledgers, therefore the hatch is opened; because the siren is wound, therefore the town’s listening is threaded. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: density of water-images, paper-flutter, radio hush accrues until the pattern ruptures with the siren blast. No orientation debt; who/where/when is anchored by line 3, the sundial warm against the chest by line 5.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The canal is not backdrop but archive: every piling, sluice gate, and crate constrains movement and memory. Micro-setting supremacy—sundial face, ledger scratches, padlock key—functions as topography the protagonist must physically navigate and morally read. Spatial choreography is immaculate: skiff, hatch, viaduct, balcony vectors track without drift. Weather is agentive: the breeze rises “as if witnesses exhaled,” charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—decode the architecture of lies before the water rewrites him—is signaled in paragraph 4 and tightens when the sundial scratches point at the conduit. One meaningful deepening: the realization the flood was “throttled and timed, not unleashed” forecloses the option to blame nature and forces the choice to公开. Cost is visible—the foreman’s stance lowers “like a man placing a heavy bucket down”—and social: the town’s listening is now threaded, irreversible. Agency is accumulative rather than explosive: photograph, haul, speak “not loud,” each step paid in real time.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete particulars: loaf-wrapper calendar, pawned badge, blank reports—every artifact is a lie’s brick. No abstract sermon; the final image of paperwork crossing town “like a weather front” is a non-literal answer that reweights the premise: truth becomes a climate, not a verdict. Subtext in gesture—watchman’s empty palms, foreman’s bucket-set-down—carries more weight than exposition. Moral ambiguity is preserved: the protagonist gains no ceiling repairs, only the colder patience of “serene upheaval.”</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is relentless: radio hush, ledger flutter, sun marginalia—every perception is filtered through a mind that reads time in stains. Rhythm modulates with pressure: long accumulative clauses build until the siren blast cuts the day “clean,” a one-sentence fracture that mirrors the town’s awakened conscience. Diction stays inside the POV’s plausible lexicon—no academic register drift. Purposeful elision (“paperwork crossed town like a weather front”) compresses fallout without head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>High density: “sundial face bore scratches that matched ledger initials I had found in mud” does triple duty—object, evidence, causality. Metaphors are coherent and risk-taken: “sun writes marginalia on everything” extends naturally to the shadow-verdict across the logo. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances story or reweights image. Minor scaffold: “like pages turning themselves to a verdict” and “like a heron landing” are two similes in quick succession, but both teach the pattern of natural inevitability and pay off at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: noir investigative arc compressed into a single canal drift, flood-as-ledger-entry concept reconfigures eco-disaster trope. Risk in lyric accumulation pays off—the sundial as gnomon of moral accounting feels inevitable in hindsight. Specificity over gimmick: “loaf-wrapper calendar,” “morphine-pawned badge” could only live here. Transformation test fails—remove canal, sundial, or radio hush and the whole moral calculus collapses.</comment>
