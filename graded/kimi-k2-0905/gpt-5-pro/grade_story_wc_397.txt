<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The euthanasia-tourist premise is interiorized through lyric, body-level beats (“parasol tip ticked against my chest like a metronome”). Interior contradiction—yearning for endings yet postponing the button—drives every micro-choice. Cost is felt: the appointment keeps slipping, stakes stay personal. Voice never drifts into diagnostic speak; the flaw of loose-reality gripping is lived, not labeled.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the narrator consciously postpones death again, now schooled by the harbor’s grammar of almost-endings. Causal chain holds—storm salvage → Mikko’s mentoring → sonic revelation → choice to wait. Orientation is taught early (drift-ice marina, euthanasia reservation envelope). No teleporting props; parasol tip, tapes, and crate accrue meaning and reappear to sharpen the final pause.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Drift-ice marina is not backdrop but instrument: floes nudge cleats, a split ice-shield sounds “violin’s mercy,” forcing retreat and saving the boy. Wind harmonics against masts tutor the narrator in listening, directly shaping the final decision. Parasol tip operates as micro-setting-on-body, constraining movement and ticking passage of time. Sensory hierarchy skews auditory/tactile, matching the lesson of “approaching endings.”</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will she press the button?—tightens through each salvage dawn; postponement costs accumulate (appointment rescheduled twice on-page). One decisive tightening: the ice-crack rescue crystallizes that endings can arrive unbidden, making scheduled death feel premature. Escalation is causal under Situational lens: external pressures (storm detritus, Mikko’s counsel, saved boy) force stance crystallization rather than plot reversals.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of listening to almost-endings emerges through recurrent sonic imagery (harbor bells, wind harmonies, tape squeal) rather than statement. Final image—narrator choosing to trawl again—reweights earlier death wish into life-attuned vigilance. No moralizing; meaning stays implicit. Subtext in Mikko’s dialogue (“you learn them by standing still enough to vibrate”) seeds closure without sermon.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>First-person voice owns a distinct lyric cadence and perceptual filter: reality is “gripped loosely,” grief heard as wind chords. Syntax stretches in accumulative coils yet snaps short under pressure (“That sound was an ending arriving and not arriving”). Mikko’s speech carries salt-crusted brevity distinct from narrator’s introspective swirl. No head-hopping; psychic distance compresses authentically during the ice-split rescue.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lines are dense but mutually reinforcing; no paraphrase loops or synonym churn. Mixed metaphors (“thread of before still tied… luggage that takes the shape of our backs”) extend rather than muddle. Read-aloud rhythm modulates from legato reflection to staccato crisis. Occasional elevated diction (“filigree,” “intonations”) fits the narrator’s lyric bent without register drift in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Euthanasia tourist + disaster-relief trawling is a fresh juxtaposition that probes liminal endings daily yet refuses grimdark cliché. Sonic motif converts familiar ice-and-sea imagery into an unfamiliar meditation on listening as survival. Stakes hinge on interior recalibration rather than external twist, avoiding speculative gimmickry. Conceptual risk (lyric postponement of death) pays off through tight causal patterning.</comment>
