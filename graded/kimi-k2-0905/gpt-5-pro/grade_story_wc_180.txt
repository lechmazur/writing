<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The quartz-eye mender’s interiority is vivid and embodied—“a shard sits where my left eye once looked”—and every micro-choice (kissing the ribbon, handing the receipt-map) grows from the same wound-plus-wonder contradiction. The kids function as live pressure, forcing the mender to externalize the deciduous-vow philosophy; bandaged-knee kid’s whispered “promises get heavy” is a perfect status shift. The only flaw is a trace of self-diagnosis in “I said my mistakes, which is a school…” that edges toward label-speak; still, the final renunciation of wages for listening carries visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a textbook Earned Stasis: the ribbon darkens with water, the leak is taught to “speak,” and the protagonist walks away having foreclosed payment for wisdom. Causal linkage holds throughout—because the guild breached, the mender enters; because the pipe weeps, the ribbon is sacrificed. The orientation anchor (who/where/when) is nailed in the first 30 words. The receipt-map hand-off is a Decisive Change that reconfigures the kids’ agency and crystallizes the “seasonal handshake” without sermonizing.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The cathedral-as-canopy is not postcard scenery; it literally supplies the drip-pressure that forces the repair and the final image of “a cathedral that had forgotten its congregation remembered fruit.” Micro-setting objects—spoon, copper wire, ribbon—function as portable terrain, constraining every twist of the fix. Spatial choreography is flawless: bodies on overturned pew, irrigation line traced along nave, water beadwork visible at eye-level. Only the faintest excess adjective drift (“thick drip returned to soil”) keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will transient wisdom be honored without pay?—tightens when the pipe fails and the only currency left is the sentimental ribbon. The meaningful turn is the ribbon’s sacrifice: it changes the mender’s options (can’t gift it to daughter later) and visibly alters the water’s behavior. Cost is legible in the darker, soaked silk. Pressure is accumulative/textural rather than causal-reversal, appropriate to the lyric engine; one deepening suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges entirely through inverted agricultural metaphors: contracts rot like leaves, vows shed, cathedrals grow fruit instead of faith. The final image—water speaking with a new accent—reweights “breach” from legal to organic without a single thematic sentence. Subtext resides in the ribbon’s silence and the kids’ green cheeks; no character states the moral. The deciduous-vow concept is dramatized, not declared, and the accidental wisdom tone stays intact.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>First-person voice carries a lapidary, carpenter-poet diction—“pears considering gravity”—that never slips into thesaurus excess. Perceptual signature is unmistakable: quartz-eye sees light fractures in water beads and metal washers. Compression is taught early (“quartz-eye mender, and no one argued”) and paid off in the final “seasonal handshake.” Minor cadence echo in “we could wait…we could make do” is purposeful, not template.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Zero loops, zero scaffold; every sentence advances image or tactic. Density is extreme—“citrus humming with bees” packs sight, sound, and imminent fall in five words. Metaphors stay physically loyal (tape is “brittle,” joint “weeps”). Only one near-repeat of “committee” is allowed because it is self-consciously reframed. The final line “they called it a seasonal handshake” is a perfect rhythmic snap that re-opens rather than closes, earning its ellipsis.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The breached-contract-becomes-orchard is a fresh synthesis of infrastructural decay and vegetal reclamation; not a trope catalog. The ribbon-as-clamp is a risk that could read as twee but is justified by prior paternal ache and the soaked darkening that follows. Transformation test fails: this exact emotional engine could not run without quartz-eye, ribbon, and cathedral canopy. The deciduous-vow philosophy is non-obvious and organically wired to every beat.</comment>
