<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The dock-worker’s “listening” flaw and “graceful” trait stay ornamental; no embodied contradiction or micro-choice shows these qualities altering tactics. The scrimshaw planting is the lone visible decision, but it is narrated as fait accompli rather than a pressured moment that costs the narrator something concrete on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the island’s refusal of ownership and the pier’s loosened bolts reweight the premise with social cost. Causality is lyric-accumulative; the scrimshaw’s mother-whale guilt and the whale-call pattern are taught early and return to charge the ending, satisfying the lens. Minor orientation slip: “sublittoral fringe” and eddy/crane imagery arrive before spatial anchor, but the lyric pattern justifies the waiver.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Harbor, tidal flats, eelgrass, moon jellies, kelp cathedrals—each sensory layer is filtered through the worker’s professional eye and doubles as emotional mirror. The scrimshaw and the island function as micro-settings that constrain the final choice (planting the bone, accepting impermanence), meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—freedom via self-detachment—is signaled early and tightened once: the island demands the narrator “argue with fear until kindness outlasts it,” a clear trade-off. Cost is present but abstract (surrender of identity labels); a tangible forfeiture would have pushed the score higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through recurring images of detachment (ropes, maps, island, pier bolts) rather than overt statement. Final image of “ropes of light and forgiveness” reweights prior material without moralizing, achieving resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lyrical first-person voice sustains a distinct perceptual signature—tidal motion, dock-worker diction, whale-call cadence—without head-hop. Compression and elision (“nerve bright current,” “mutinous compass”) are pattern-taught early and paid off at closure; rhythm modulates with pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High information density: single sentences braid action, metaphor, and emotional tilt (“whale lifts and falls beneath me, shaping paths with muscle like underwater weather”). No loops, mixed metaphors, or register drift; occasional adjective richness is justified by lyric mode.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Familiar trope—magical object grants redemption— is revitalized by maritime specificity, mother-whale guilt, and the island’s anti-colonial refusal. Risk in lyric-accumulative structure heightens meaning without obscuring closure; transformation feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
