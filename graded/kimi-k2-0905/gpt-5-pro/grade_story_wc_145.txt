<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The narrator’s dry-witted composure stays consistent: every micro-choice—rotating the compass, scraping the ice, breathing on the glass—grows from the obsession with “where the rivers begin.” The final kneel and canteen-drop is the earned cost of that obsession; no interiority slips into label-speak. The lone flaw is the off-stage “bargain with the stillness,” a motive never dramatized, but it doesn’t derail the closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the black pupil under the ice rewrites cartographic logic, and the price is the narrator’s bone-deep chill—“the cold edits our bones.” The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout; each condensation map thickens the pattern until the final image reweights all prior rumor. No causality breaks; the falcon’s return is the taught trigger that pays off in the departure beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Ice, rust, kettle steam, and graphite stub are never backdrop: they dictate where the narrator can kneel, what can be scraped, how breath becomes map. The sastrugi ridge and glass-born dendrites mirror each other exactly, converging to authorize the drill-site; environment physically shapes the climax. Micro-setting (compass, dog-ear) is handled in motion, not listed. The final condensation applause on the canteen is the charged reprise that locks setting to theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>One dominant stake—prove the sub-glacial convergence—tightens when every condensation map narrows the search grid; the falcon’s return is the single beat that forces departure and thus the ice crossing. Cost is legible in frozen fingers and the swallowed drop of “alphabet of stones,” a visceral price paid on-page. No antagonist is needed; the lake’s uncracked silence is coherent pressure. Escalation is steady but modest—one meaningful deepening, not a spiral—hence stops just short of the 8.8 band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the inversion of cartography: mouths-to-heads becomes pupil-outward, a quiet revolution never sermonized. The phrase “maps mishear them” seeds the idea; the final glass-drawn filaments visually answer it. No moral is stated—only the image of shy lines rehearsing under miles of quiet—creating resonant ambiguity. The condensation motif returns reweighted, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The atlas-editor voice owns every syllable: “stovetop kettle,” “weathered paper” hardtack, “long syntax” breath. Syntax tightens under pressure—“I kneel... I scrape... I lower”—then relaxes into longer contemplative coils, mirroring cold-induced breath rhythm. No filter-verb stacks; perception stays embodied. The falcon’s “clacked dictation” is the only speaker, yet still sounds avian, not human ventriloquism.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Every sentence does two jobs: “The ice receives us without cracking, which is its own kind of threat” advances both atmosphere and stake. No paraphrase loops or metaphor muddle; vehicles stay coherent (condensation = isobaric prayer = dendrites = antlers). Varied sentence length creates natural inhale/exhale rhythm. Only hairline slip: “long syntax” is borderline abstract, but immediate granite/fern smell grounds it.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The premise—rivers begin at a single sub-glacial pupil—takes the familiar “source of the Nile” trope and renders it microscopic, geographic, and existential. The falcon-as-editor, condensation-as-map, and kettle-as-oracle are fresh syntheses that feel inevitable once established. Risk in structure (quiet lyric, no antagonist) heightens rather than softens stakes. Transformation test passed: swap any detail and the whole intellectual/emotional engine collapses.</comment>
