<question>1</question>
<grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>The narrator’s “luminous skeptic” trait is embodied through the faint glow and the refusal to believe until tasting proof, but interiority drifts toward summary (“I wanted to know…”) rather than moment-to-moment contradiction under pressure. The ring-as-tongue method gives tactile micro-choices, yet the final belief shift is declared, not dramatized with visible cost. Naira’s authority substitutes for the protagonist’s earned change, so the arc feels assisted rather than compelle.</comment>

<grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the taste of “clean stone and warm milk” reweights the premise—weather-carrying is bridge-work, not sentence—under an Accumulative lens. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive within 120 words and the aurora-forest election conceit is taught early enough to waive disorientation penalty. Causality holds: each tasted flavor triggers the next micro-move toward the bluff summit. Cost is felt in the narrator’s trembling mouth, but the final beat is more image than irreversible choice, keeping it shy of 8+.</comment>

<comment>Lavender-bluff-under-aurora is not postcard scenery; pollen ballots and lichen counters turn forest into polity, constraining the timing of the converge action. The tin ring functions as micro-setting: its changing tastes dictate direction, charging the final image when “salt binds storms.” Bodies move through fog-leaking pockets and steaming kettles, so every object is handled, not lectured. Spatial choreography stays clean across the climb to crest.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—will the narrator accept that weather-carrying is duty, not curse—tightens once when the taste-map orders the crest converge. Agency is present (the ring prompts the move), but the price is primarily sensory, not tactical; no option is foreclosed. Pressure accumulates via tasted signatures rather than a causal reversal, fitting the Accumulative lens. The trees’ vote outcome is off-stage, so the personal cost feels moderate.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without sermon: memory needs legs between oceans, and taste is the body’s ballot. The aurora re-writing weather back brighter re-prices “futuristic nostalgia” as collaborative stewardship, not retro yearning. Subtext lives in gesture—steam falls as private rain—never in thesis lines. Final image of “tasting the future” gives resonant, non-literal answer to the central question.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>First-person voice is lyric, compressed, and consistent: “sky glanced down like an old recorder” sets perceptual signature. Syntax mirrors tasted synesthesia—sweet/sour/bitter clauses—without monotony. No dialogue-heavy beats, but what little is spoken (“Your glow says skeptic…”) carries subtext and regionless idiom. Psychic distance stays tight; no filter-verb bloat under peak aurora glare.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies: long breath-unit sentences for aurora flow, staccato tastes for beats. Information density high—“granulated sugar sticking to my tongue” does triple sense/setting/stake work. Two near-loop spots—“weather is memory and duty” echoed by Naira and later narrator—subtract without grave damage. Metaphors stay coherent within synesthetic logic; no mixed-vehicle crashes at closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The synesthetic compass tasted on the tongue is a genuinely fresh speculative instrument; it turns metaphor into navigable tech. “Forests hold elections” reframes pollen as ballots without coy eco-allegory. Risky lyric accumulation pays off when aurora swallows and re-writes weather, a re-pricing that feels inevitable in hindsight. Concept, setting, and emotional arc collapse together—remove any layer and the whole architecture fails.</comment>
