<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The narrator’s vanishing and return are motivated, the contradiction between scholarly retreat and relational need is embodied in the glass ink well, and the final “we” grammar is earned. Interiority is concrete (“scholarship of retreat”), flaws complicate choices, and the cost of silence is visceral. Yet the epiphany—“language of we is a grammar I will not lose again”—leans toward articulate summary rather than raw embodied contradiction, keeping it just below the 8.0 gate.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the open door and shared codex reconfigure trust with felt cost under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality holds—the door opens only after vow-braids accumulate—and the ink well’s return threads the dispersed past into the present. A minor orientation wobble: “last year” is the only temporal anchor for the prior collaboration, but the archive’s dust-and-metronome texture teaches the pattern early enough to waive heavier penalty.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The archive’s dust-choked shelves function as micro-setting, constraining movement and pacing the vows like a metronome; the glass ink well literally steers the reconciliation gesture. Sensory selection is POV-tight—“dust greeted me like a choir of hush”—and the sealed room’s exhale mirrors internal trust. Spatial choreography is clean; bodies track from catalog desk to sealed door without drift. The codex-on-pedestal image charges the final moment, satisfying the 9+ object gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restoring collaboration—signals early and tightens through each handwritten vow; the “before paths diverge” clock adds light pressure. Escalation is accumulative: each promise thickens the braid until the door yields, a visible price paid in exposed vulnerability. No external antagonist is needed; internal silence is the foe, and its cost is dramatized when past silence is confessed. The tightening is singular but sufficient for this length; options narrow to speak or stay shut out.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the braid of promises rather than from overt thesis: language as covenant, not data. The ink well’s shift from inherited relic to shared vessel reweights “symphonies of truth” into lived accountability. Final image—“leave the door ajar for others”—extends the personal repair to communal ethic without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers: the archive will test them again, so the grammar remains contingent, not tidily resolved.</answer>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>First-person voice is lyric yet controlled, syntax elongates during vow-making then contracts at the click of the door, mirroring breath. Metaphor density is high but patterned early—dust as choir, shelves as staves—so it reads as taught cadence rather than clutter. Diction stays within the narrator’s scholarly lexicon without academic drift. Dialogue is minimal; when Mara speaks—“You forgot this”—it’s crisp, goal-driven, distinct from narrator’s ornate interior.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Strong rhythmic variety, sentences breathe from long image-chains to short declaratives at hinge moments (“The door gave a small click”). No paraphrase loops; each metaphor extends the musical conceit without contradiction. One mixed metaphor—“drop of intent”—is minor. Information density is high: one sentence often carries setting, emotion, and backstory (“It had belonged to my grandmother…”). Filter verbs are minimal; perception stays embodied.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The vow-braided door that opens only on reciprocal promises is a fresh inflection on the “magic lock” trope, grounded in linguistic specificity rather than generic spell. The extinct-language archive as reconciliation site fuses professional obsession with emotional restitution, avoiding clichéd café apology. Risk is taken with accumulative lyric structure, yet pattern is taught early and closure remains legible. Slight deduction for echo of “symphonies of truth” prompt phrasing without full transmutation.</comment>
