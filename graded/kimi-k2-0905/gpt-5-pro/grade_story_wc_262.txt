<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator’s calm, map-making interiority is consistently voiced; the “I am here to find where unused love is stored” motive is plain and sustained. No contradictory impulses ever contend on the page, so the promised internal conflict is only asserted, never dramatized. The manager’s trembling supplies exterior pressure, yet the narrator’s stance never shifts or forecloses a path; the ending illumination feels gifted rather than earned. Still, the idiosyncratic perceptual lens and embodied film-handling details keep the characterization individual and vivid.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The piece teaches its lyric-accumulative pattern early (“I am the crystal gazer…”) and lands a Conceptual Repricing closure: the blank leader glowing like mercy visibly reweights the premise, showing that unused love resides in the never-projected clear seconds. Causality is interior and symbolic rather than sequential; the lens holds. The Orientation Test is satisfied by ~80 words. The only minor drag is that the final beat is narrated rather than dramatized—the manager nods, envelope warms—but the reconfiguration is legible and charged.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The projection booth is rendered through tactile, POV-filtered specifics: heat-smell carpet, sprocket gutters, splice tape topography. These micro-details constrain the narrator’s search method and literally charge the final image when the clear leader is threaded and glows. Spatial choreography is immaculate—strip cradled, scissors handed, envelope sealed—keeping bodies and objects trackable. Environment thus functions as both map and crucible, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—locating the storage site of “unused love”—is signaled in the second paragraph and tightens once when the narrator identifies the transparent leader and splice tails as the hidden reservoir. This deepening reconfigures the manager’s options (he must archive the scraps) and carries a conceptual cost: love that never met light is severed from its intended audience. No visible price is exacted from the narrator, keeping the escalation shy of the 8.8+ band, but the pressure coheres under the accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the conceit: emotion archived in cinematic waste—love excised to fit runtime. The blank leader’s final glow offers a non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior images of severed letters and unprojected frames. Subtext resides in gesture—the manager blinking “as if thunder had whispered his name”—rather than exposition. The slight withholding of narrator cost keeps it from full 9.0 resonance, but complexity and ambiguity are preserved.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The first-person voice sustains a hypnotic, consonant-rich cadence (“hushed thunder… domesticated storm chained to gears”) that mirrors the projector’s purr. Diction stays within the narrator’s plausible lexicon while achieving lyric density. Filter verbs are present but motivated by psychometric distance. No dialogue means no voice convergence risk; the prose itself is the character. Minor template cadence in “I tell him… I ask for…” is drowned by rhythmic variety elsewhere, so the 9+ quick test is nearly met.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Sentences perform double duty—advancing metaphor and tactile action simultaneously (“perforations pulsing… adhesive holding together what could not otherwise be adjacent”). Figurative layering is high but pattern-taught and paid off, avoiding purple overload. A few near-loops (“letters that never learned to arrive… forgotten lyrics might finally find their tune”) are purposeful thematic echoes, not artifact. The closing image is crisp and uncluttered, propelling the reader outward.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The psychometry-of-film concept feels fresh and specific; the notion that excised clear leader hoards unradiated love is non-obvious yet inevitable once revealed. Vintage cinema ephemera, map-making mystic, and archival rescue interlock without checklist vibe. Risk is taken with lyric density, but coherence holds. Transformation is strong: swapping any detail—object, setting, metaphor—would collapse the story’s unique charge.</comment>
