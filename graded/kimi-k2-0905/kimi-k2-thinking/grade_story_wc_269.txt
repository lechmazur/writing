<comment>Lina’s witnessing role is credibly anchored in embodied ritual—each tap of the railing reveals interior contradiction between helplessness and compulsion. The interiority stays specific to her; no “climate grief” clichés intrude. The shift from passive recording to active chart-making is earned by the atlas page cue and lands with visible cost: she accepts the station’s drift as her only fixed point. Micro-choices (tracing ink, tapping curvature) keep the arc intimate, though the stakes never tighten beyond observational endurance.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands cleanly as Conceptual Repricing: the vanished lane reweights the premise that predictive models are coral-fragile. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of rising breaths, periodic ghosts—held to the final image. Orientation is complete by line 5; no penalty. The cost is unmistakable in “some paths are gone, others waiting to be drawn,” but the tightening is single-thread; no secondary reversal or constraint shapes tactics, keeping it shy of 9+.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The floating disc, steel railing, and mildewed archive are tactile micro-settings that constrain posture, reach, and memory. Sensory hierarchy skews to touch and sound—salt-stiff paper, knuckle percussion—mirroring the protagonist’s need for physical anchors against formless water. Spatial choreography is immaculate: paper fetched, atlas traced, case sealed; bodies never ghost. Weather is implied through rising gauge, not dump, letting the station itself breathe with the tide.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—why routes vanish—is signalled by the torn page and escalates through data fragments; one meaningful tightening suffices. Pressure is textural: each bleaching ghost and gauge tick raises the waterline of dread. Agency is observational—she assembles, records, charts—but the final image forecloses passive hope: she must draw new lines herself. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral; the lane’s erasure is felt, yet no tool or chance is lost on-page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the equation of obsolete maps and bleached coral—both casualties of shifted baselines—without sermon. The periodically eternal refrain accrues ironic weight: cycles persist yet worsen, refusing redemption. Final image of “rhythm of a world reborn” offers quiet CR that reweights prior motifs rather than moralizing. Subtext stays in gesture: tapping as memorial refusal, waterproof case as ark of orphaned knowledge.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is coral-witness particular: scientific precision (“calibrating sensors”) braided with fisherman-learned percussion. Syntax mirrors tidal surge—long swells of clauses, then staccato knocks. No head-hop; distance stays tight inside Lina’s perceptual filter. Register never drifts into policy jargon; even “fossil-fuel ban” is embedded through consequence, not slogan. Rhythm is pattern-taught early and paid off in the final fade, earning high-band control.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Line-level craft is spare yet musical; no scaffold loops or synonym churn. Metaphors are disciplined—tide as breath, atlas as anchor—without mixed collisions. Sentence openings vary; paragraph cuts carry knowledge or emotional charge. One near-purple “white shroud” is forgiven for imaginal economy. Read-aloud ear test passes: the tapping cadence propels without drumbeat monotony.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis treats climate grief through cartographic nostalgia—shipping lane and reef both erased by model collapse—an angle not over-mined. The station-as-instrument, tapping-as-inquiry method feels native rather than quirky ornament. Risk is taken by privileging accumulative lyric over causal plot; coherence holds. Transformation test: story collapses if coral witness or atlas page is swapped, proving specificity achieved.</comment>
