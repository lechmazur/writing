<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction is present—his “operative gentleness” against the scar of a failed cease-fire—but the embodied cost is only asserted (“weight of redemption weighed on his shoulders”) rather than dramatized in a micro-choice until the final beat. The clipboard-touch moment lets shared guilt replace personal guilt, so the renunciation is earned, yet the shift is collective, slightly blunting individual arc visibility at this length.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: failed past → ritual gamble → shared touch → treaty signed; the hum of the clipboard is the decisive change with conceptual cost (they must now share a fragile future). Orientation is clean by line 4; the lens is causal throughout. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—options narrow to trust or rupture—price transferred from lone negotiator to entire circle.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Terrace, solstice light, and planetary alignment are woven through action; the stones warm under bodies, the light kisses clipboard edges—environment constrains the ritual timing and supplies the hum that seals the pact. Micro-setting (clipboard surface as ritual altar) charges the final image, meeting the 9+ gate. Some cosmic language edges toward ornament, but never stalls momentum.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can ritual words become lived peace?—is signaled early and tightens when the scarred general demands proof; the clipboard hum physically forecloses skepticism, forcing a collective yes. Cost is legible: they must now defend an agreement born of superstition as much as policy. Escalation is single but sufficient for 700-word window.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through recurrence of “price” and “shared fragility”; the final whispered blessing lets imperfect signatures stand as mosaic of hope—no moral sermon. The flawed beauty idea reweights earlier failed cease-fire: imperfection is the only vessel for peace. Resonance is oblique yet unmistakable.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Third-person omniscient hovers close to negotiator; perceptual signature—“forgotten promise,” “silent ballet”—is lyrical yet consistent. No head-hopping; distance stable. Compression in final paragraph is purposeful, cadence slowing to match exit rhythm. No dialogue, so voice carries all subtext effectively.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Rhythm modulates: long opening sentence sets cosmic scale, then shorter pulses mirror ritual pacing. Metaphors (“stone from the same terrace”) cohere; no mixed vehicles. Minor scaffold—“the negotiator… the negotiator”—but never in high-pressure beats. Final line offers crisp image that recharges “flawed beauty” motif.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Ritual-as-binding-spell freshens familiar peace-table scene; planetary alignment linked to acoustic hum gives speculative edge without breaking credibility. Synthesis feels inevitable after opening celestial cue. Risk is moderate—could slide into fantasy cliché—but restraint keeps it grounded. Specificity of “ebony clipboard” as relic prevents generic swap.</comment>
