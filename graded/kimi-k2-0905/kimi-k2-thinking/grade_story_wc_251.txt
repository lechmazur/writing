<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Motivation and interiority are clear, especially in the turning moment where he decides the time has come to act, but his journey is delivered in summary, so agency feels rounded rather than granular under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing with a quiet, conceptual cost felt at "the faint scent of change"; lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of window-puzzles deepens civic mood; summary-to-scene ratio is high, muting some causal edges, but the final reweighting still reads legible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The cobalt library, mist, and grotto reappear with charged specificity, forming an ambient micro-setting that constrains how the rebellion can manifest—quietly, indirectly, through ambience rather than force: the grotto’s magnetic draw shows citizens remapping their routes on the page.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The dominant stake of quiet civic awakening tightens when the first synchronized window puzzles go live; this Cadence Shift raises social cost without violence; legible, though escalation is incremental rather than perilous.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of "second thoughts" is mostly emergent from the chess puzzles and final "Question the king" line; the closing whisper about the pawn-dream of queening crystallises the quiet uprising, avoiding overt moralising but verging on thematic echo; resonance solid but tidy.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Third-person lyric voice sustains a hushed, fable-like cadence; idiom consistent and atmospheric, but syntactic rhythm stabilises early and resists modulation under mounting pressure, muting the final lift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Clean, spare sentences with few loops; fresh adjectives ("cobalt", "crystal-click") but occasional triple modifiers ("synchronized window displays across town") feel gently overwritten; closure beat remains clear.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Framing civic resistance through chess puzzles in lit windows is a non-obvious, memorable angle; the magnetic grotto concept gels with quiet congregation rather than spectacle; ground-level detail keeps the fable from feeling purely allegorical, though it leans on archetype.</comment>
