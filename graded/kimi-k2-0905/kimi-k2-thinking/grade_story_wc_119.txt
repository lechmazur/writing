<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Mei Lin’s shift from passive seer to active composer is legible and earned: the specs let her convert prophecy into orchestration, and the cookie she writes for herself shows cost. Interiority is concrete—“salt air would bleach the future from her bones”—and her micro-choices (placing each cookie, hiding the case) track with motive. The flaw: we never feel her contradictory impulse to keep the old power; once she decides to “compose,” doubt vanishes, flattening conflict.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: discovery of specs → decoding microdots → writing targeted cookies → observable consequences. Closure is a crisp Conceptual Repricing—she rewrites her own fortune, and the shell’s microdot spiral confirms the new rule-set with undeniable cost: her old self is gone. One transition (night→morning) is clean; time and space stay anchored. No orientation debt; the “open secret” idea is taught early and pays off at the end.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment> Lighthouse, salt air, Fresnel lens, starboard bilge—every sensory pick is filtered through Mei Lin’s urgent bias. The microdot specs act as both tool and micro-setting, constraining every subsequent choice; the spiral shell recharges the same logic at the end. Spatial choreography is flawless: loose stone, lamp room, dock, mail-boat seat all track without drift. Weather and beer-coaster minutiae double as espionage substrate, marrying texture to function.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“can she reclaim agency from accidental prophecy?”—tightens the moment she writes the first instruction-cookie. Each placed cookie is a visible price (she could be exposed) and narrows options: once Tomás finds the ring, the island’s gratitude becomes a social debt she must maintain. Escalation is accumulative rather than reversed; the seven-minute ferry delay is the single intensification that crystallizes her new power. Cost is legible but lightweight—no lasting consequence touches her directly, capping tension at 8.0.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: prediction is passivity, composition is agency. The returning image of the spiral—lens, shell, microdot—reweights “fate” as something that can be printed, baked, and eaten. Open secrets motif stays subtextual: fishermen look away, Tomás says “found it on the ferry” instead of “I know.” Final image offers resonant ambiguity: she waits for a tide that may never arrive, underscoring that authorship still depends on larger currents.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays welded to Mei Lin’s perceptual slate: “fortune cookie crumbs,” “finger pointing at guilty stars,” “dough held unused”—driven, idiosyncratic, salt-bitten. Syntax tightens under pressure: “She placed one cookie… another… third…” becomes staccato recipe. No head-hop; free indirect style is clean. Dialogue is minimal yet subtextual—Tomás’s five-word gift speaks volumes—preserving voice purity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense but never purple: “lighthouse stood… like a finger pointing at guilty stars” is the single overt simile and it earns its place. Rhythm modulates—long coastal sentences collapse into clipped orchestration beats. No scaffold, no loops; information dual-loads (cookie = instruction + social lever). One micro-slip: “accidentally prophetic” is used twice in close proximity; a sharper variant would avoid echo. Closure line is crisp and image-locked.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: Cold-War microdot tech grafted onto coastal lighthouse noir and fortune-cookie noir—three vocabularies merged without seams. The “open secret” trope is inverted: instead of dark truth everyone knows, it’s a creative power everyone pretends not to see. Risky second-person echo in fortune syntax (“The man in the yellow slicker…”) is justified because it becomes the diegetic script she’s writing. Not quite 9 because the core mechanic—write cookie → reality bends—leans on a whimsy that could feel gimmicky without the microdot rigor.</comment>
