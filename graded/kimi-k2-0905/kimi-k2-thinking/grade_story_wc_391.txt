<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Elara’s interiority is concrete—her boots “finding purchase,” the viaduct’s hum “in her teeth”—and her micro-choices (calibrating sensors, stepping onto the ice) track her shift from impatience to poised catalyst. The “patient revolution” motive is repeatedly stated rather than dramatized in contradictory action, blunting internal conflict. No second character appears, so relationship crucible rules are waived; her solitary stance is credibly earned yet emotionally monolithic.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the final pulse releases the network-quieting magnetic surge, a conceptual repricing that makes the community’s newfound mental quiet legible and irreversible. Causality holds—every beat links lunar azimuth → flux → pulse → silence—so the Accumulative lens is coherent. The cost is felt in Elara’s caged urgency released, not erased; the “restrained wildness” is the price she continues to carry.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>The frozen lake, basalt sanctuary, and magnetic viaduct are filtered through Elara’s surveyor gaze; textures (ice-ridges, rail-skin of flash-frozen rain) constrain her pacing and tool use. Spatial choreography is clean—she steps from sanctuary onto pre-roughened ice, transmitter built from salvaged rail shards—so environment actively enables the climax. Weather and magnetism evolve causally with each lunar tick; no static postcard repetition.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake is clear early: free the far-shore minds by disabling the tyrant’s crisis-manufactured network. One meaningful tightening occurs at the moon-11-degree beat, narrowing options to “send pulse now or wait another cycle.” Cost is visible—Elara’s own “caged urgency” is the price of waiting—but the pulse itself is bloodless; no tangible personal loss beyond sustained restraint.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme—patience as forge rather than submission—emerges through lunar cycles, magnetic pulses, and the final quiet skies rather than exposition. Subtext operates in silence: the three-short/three-long lights speak rebellion without slogans. The last image of her reflection holding “every future she had helped to free” reweights prior mappings with conceptual, not moralizing, resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elara’s perceptual signature—instruments, azimuths, pressure ridges—without filter-verb bloat. Syntax mirrors her calibrated mind: clipped noun phrases (“magnetic viaduct arched,” “moon path crossed”) that breathe under pressure. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk is zero; the lyric-technical diction remains internally consistent and purposeful.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, high-density; sentences perform dual duty (“The viaduct’s hum was a low thrum she felt in her teeth, a restrained wildness…”). Occasional lyrical uplift (“aurora of disturbance in the falling snow”) is patterned early and paid off, not purple. Minor template echo: repeated “unyoke” as noun and verb approaches mantra, but the cadence supports thematic insistence rather than slackens momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The magnetic-viaduct-as-intention-compass after rain is a fresh causal device; lunar ice-tide mapping as revolutionary timing feels inevitable yet new. Risk is taken in withholding a conventional confrontation—revolution is quiet signal, not battle—yet coherence holds. Specificity of basalt shards salvaged into transmitter, moon-degree math, and flux pulse roots the concept in lived detail, resisting generic dystopia template.</comment>
