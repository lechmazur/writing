<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Elara’s diligent curiosity is shown through concrete action—decoding the hopscotch numbers, tracing carvings—rather than labels, and her final solitude carries a felt cost. Yet the interior contradiction (ambition vs. isolation) is stated more than dramatized in-scene; the moment she “realized the phrasebook had been left for her” is summary, not embodied micro-choice. The earned stance is visible, but the emotional layering stops short of genuine irrationality or flaw-driven mistake. Still, for 750-word scope, the arc is coherent and renunciation is legible.</comment>

<comment>Causal lattice holds: hopscotch coordinates → phrasebook → valley → luminance → map, each beat a because/therefore linkage. Closure is a Charged Poise: the airship sails on, Elara’s voice now “both lifted and anchored,” a crystallized reconfiguration of her solitude with cartographer’s authority. Cost is felt in the final image—the phrasebook tucked away, path foreclosed. One micro-turn (discovery of coordinates) is sufficient; no orientation debt; lens is clean causal throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Airship hull, brass lantern, ozone scent, starling murmurations—details are selective, POV-filtered, and return to charge the final image (“starlings trailing like a farewell”). Whispering Crag and luminance are sketched rather than deep-mapped, but at this length the micro-setting (phrasebook, hopscotch board) constrains choice and thus satisfies the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography is clean; no white-room syndrome. Tone matches twilight wonder without tourist catalog.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—chart the luminance to earn cartographic greatness—is signaled early and tightened once: the coordinate discovery forecloses alternate routes and redirects the airship. Escalation is single but meaningful; the luminous valley reveal narrows options and confirms her wager. Cost is present but lightly registered (she remains solitary); a sharper forfeiture (crew risk, map ink running low, etc.) would have pushed higher. Still, agency drives every turn under causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Theme—wonder versus solitude—emerges through recurrent starling images and the phrasebook breadcrumb rather than overt statement. Final image reweights earlier motifs without moralizing. Subtext in Kess’s rare praise and Elara’s finger-tracing of carvings carries quiet irony of succession. Complexity is present but not deeply ambivalent; the cost is more poignancy than moral reckoning. No final-paragraph thesis statement; avoids sentimentality.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Third-person close stays locked to Elara with lyric, compressed diction (“graphite a faint echo of the starlight”) that matches twilight awe. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is consistent—she notices angles, bearings, ink stains. Dialogue is minimal but natural; Kess’s whispered praise carries subtext. Rhythm modulates: longer cadence for starlings, staccato pencil stroke for discovery. No register drift or filter-verb stacks.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>High information density: “dog-ear…folded corner marking the section on celestial navigation” does three jobs in nine words. Metaphors are clean, no mixed vehicles. One paraphrase loop: “sociable isolation defined her days…solitude she had cherished now felt like a quiet strength” – slight echo costs −0.2. Otherwise sentences vary openings; no scaffold. Final line lands with image, not explanation. Proofing clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: antique airship + starling murmurations + hopscotch board as cipher feels specific to this story world, not checklist. Luminance-as-map-light is a neat conceptual twist that reweights cartography itself. Risk is quiet—lyric rather than plot-twist—but coherence justifies it. No close echoes of famous scenes. Detail is particular (ozone, brass, dog-ear) rather than generic fantasy furniture.</comment>
