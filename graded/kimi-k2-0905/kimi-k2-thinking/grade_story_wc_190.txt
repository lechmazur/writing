<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Kael’s calm, pedagogic interiority is consistent and embodied; the storm-glass reactions give concrete micro-choices under pressure. The diplomat’s shift from nervous drumming to silent tears is visible, not labeled. The vial-gift moment crystallizes her motive with cost—she surrenders her talisman—but the story lets the diplomat’s change feel slightly quick, muting the full “earned” punch.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the diplomat’s quiet weep and acceptance of the vial reweights silence from threat to portable peace, cost shown in Kael’s relinquishment. Causal linkage holds: each harmonic adjustment causes his measurable calm. Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the final hush reprises the opening echo, tightening cadence. One hairline slip: “fluidly logical” appears twice as self-conscious phrase rather than action proof.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</question><comment>The drifting prism terrace functions as micro-setting: its rotation and harmonic panels directly enable Kael’s tactic and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective—brass meter, crystalline feathers, prismatic light—filtered through her technician’s eye. Spatial choreography is clean; no geography drift. At 600-800 scale, the terrace’s buoyancy ratios and refractive shear supply concrete constraint sufficient for 9-gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can the diplomat be taught to bear silence?—is signaled early and tightens when his drumming spikes Kael’s meters. One meaningful deepening: his heartbeat flips from frantic red to calm blue, narrowing his options from flight to acceptance. Cost is visible in Kael giving away the vial, forfeiting her own comfort tool. Pressure stays coherent under Accumulative lens but lacks a second hard trade-off, keeping it just below top band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</question><comment>Theme emerges organically: silence as constructed, habitable space rather than void. Subtext lives in gesture—the diplomat’s slowing fingers, the vial’s calming spirals—never sermonized. Final image of the pocketed vial reweights the premise without moralizing. One soft echo of “fluidly logical” drifts toward thematic label, but the resonance holds.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Kael’s technician perceptions; no head-hop. Syntax mirrors her calm metering—long cadences, controlled clauses—then tightens during meter spikes. The diplomat’s diction is distinctively bureaucratic (“I don’t have time for this”) against her hush-inviting idiom. No register drift; non-standard punctuation is absent, so conventional clarity is met.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</question><comment>Prose is dense and musical—information layered in lyrical clauses without scaffold. Metaphors (crystalline feathers, vaulting hush) are consistent with world physics; no mixed vehicles. Minor paraphrase echo: “fluidly logical” twice in similar phrasing costs −0.2. Rhythm accelerates and breathes with scene needs; no template cadence detected.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Premise—atmospheric gondola that teaches silence via harmonic engineering—is fresh, not stock SF or magic-teaching trope. Specificity of brass meters, refractive shear, and storm-glass chemistry grounds the concept. Risky choice to dramatize internal calibration rather than external peril pays off through accruing micro-changes. The vial-gift reprise feels inevitable yet non-obvious, satisfying transformation test.</comment>
