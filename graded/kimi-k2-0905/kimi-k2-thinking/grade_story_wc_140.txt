<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The survivor’s haunted compulsion to collect overheard fragments is vivid, embodied (crouching, pressing palms), and internally consistent; the micro-choice to add the poison label to the box crystallizes a hierarchy of values—memory over safety. Interiority is concrete and character-specific (“he wants to know if memories feel like burlap or silk”), avoiding diagnostic labels. The final stance—nameless yet self-defined—carries visible cost: he forfeits official identity for a jury-rigged one built of scraps. No contradictory impulses are shown simultaneously, so the 9+ quick test isn’t quite met, but the arc is credible and felt.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the box, now heavy enough to “register on some cosmic scale,” reweights existence itself while the survivor stands “real, filtering the morning light through the reality of his own making.” The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout—each fragment layers density until meaning emerges in the negative space. Orientation is taught by line 5 (“Port authorities call the place the Grid”), waiving any penalty. Persistent constraint is legible: administrative erasure remains irreversible; the box’s weight anchors him to an outlaw life. One hairline slip: “translation” is named rather than dramatized, keeping it just shy of 9+.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The Grid’s salt-stained concrete, vent holes, and twenty-high stacks aren’t backdrop; they shape how he scavenges and where the bottle lodges. The tide rhythm supplies a living clock that times every micro-beat. The rusted tackle box functions as micro-setting, its changing weight constraining whether he can carry or must abandon it. Final image—water licking the anchored box—charges the entire atmosphere with irrevocable cost.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reclaiming erased selfhood—signals early and tightens through each layer added to the box. Pattern break at the poison label (“his own handwriting”) escalates abstract threat to personal proof, narrowing options: he can no longer treat fragments as neutral curios. Cost is visible when he places the box in the tide yet it refuses to float, signifying permanent outlaw ballast. Escalation is textural rather than causal, satisfying the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</question><comment>Theme emerges obliquely: erased histories concentrate into poison that must be handled, not denied. The poison label’s return reweights earlier fragments (“dangerous, sealed, poison”) without declarative moralizing. Final line—“what it means to have been dead and still be living”—offers resonant, non-literal answer: identity is whatever mass you can keep from washing away. Ambiguity persists yet is coherent, inviting reflection on administrative violence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is distinct: bureaucratic diction (“administrative erasure,” “cosmic scale”) collides with sensory precision (“salt on skin after the water has dried”). Rhythm modulates from long, tide-like sentences to fragmentary beats mirroring the collector’s shards. No head-hop; POV stays locked to survivor. Non-standard compression (“filters reality differently”) is taught early and paid off in the final light-filtering image.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose carries high density: “sediment of stories—fragments that drift like tidal debris” performs atmosphere, stakes, and metaphor in one stroke. Occasional poetic overlap (“texture that emerges is not silk nor burlap, but something sharper”) risks minor metaphor stacking but serves the textural lens. No loops, scaffold, or register drift. Final sentence propels toward the next departing horn without drumbeat monotony.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Concept of bureaucratic undeath via shipping-container labyrinth is non-obvious and fully committed to. Trope of amnesia is transformed into administrative erasure with specific consequence: container numbers, tide clocks, poison label in scratched handwriting. Without the Grid and the box, the emotional arc collapses—high transformation test pass. Risky lyric accumulation could have dulled causality yet here intensifies resonance, meriting the upper +0.3 risk bonus.</comment>
