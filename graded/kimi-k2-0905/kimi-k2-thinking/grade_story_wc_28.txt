<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Arin’s interiority is vivid—“heart forged in frost and flame,” “retrocognitively trapped”—and his micro-choices (kneeling, cupping the tessera, carving the name) embody the steel/empathy tension. The contradiction is present but toggles rather than acts simultaneously; we get frost, then flame, not both at once. The final stance is earned: renaming costs him the last warmth in his pocket and forecloses forgetting. Still, the enemy-soldier memory is asserted more than dramatized, keeping motivation just shy of the 8.8 gate.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the carved “Plaza of Embers” reconfigures the city’s memory and Arin’s own stance, the tessera’s click against his ribs a felt cost. Causality is lyric-accumulative; each retrocognitive pulse tightens the obligation to remember. Orientation anchors within 120 words (“ancient plaza… shattered sky”). The lens holds, but the price is more symbolic than tactical—no object state or future path is visibly foreclosed—so it stays shy of 9.0.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plaza is rendered through ash-scented air, charred pillars, the mosaic’s chipped curves—details that constrain movement and supply the literal tool for renaming. The shattered sky acts as a living ceiling that lowers emotional oxygen. Micro-setting (the stepping-stone’s soft underbelly) becomes the surface on which the new world is written. No slip touches the closure image; environment is inseparable from the final act.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—how to remember without being consumed by frost—signals early. Pressure escalates through retrocognitive intrusions that narrow Arin’s options to act *now* before the city erases the name. The carving is the decisive, irreversible act that costs bodily warmth and social erasure. Cost is legible but not persistent; no future consequence is dramatized, capping entry to 8.0 band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the paradox of “aberrant mercy”: the only mercy worth remembering is the enemy’s, complicating the binary of victim/perpetrator. The renaming refuses tidy redemption; instead it carves grief and grace into the same stone. Subtext operates in silence—no sermon, only the tessera’s faint glow. Final image reweights earlier material without moralizing, but the insight is slightly front-loaded in Arin’s whispers, keeping it from 9.0.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyricism stays close to Arin’s perceptual filter—“air smelled of ash and forgotten spices,” “wind sharp as a knife.” Syntax compresses under pressure (“He cupped… carved… walked”) then elongates in retrocognitive loops, mirroring temporal slippage. No dialogue, so voice unity rests on diction; “warm coldness” recurs with shifting inflections, paid off in the final smile. Distinctive without slipping into purple, and the pattern is taught by line 3.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: one sentence often does image + interior + forward motion (“The tessera glowed faintly, as if acknowledging the burden…”). Metaphors are spare and consistent—no mixed vehicles. Occasional template cadence (“The plaza… The wind… The city…”) is purposeful, teaching an incantatory rhythm that peaks in the final paragraph. Minor scaffold: “retrocognitively trapped” is repeated verbatim; clipped at −0.2, leaving high-band clarity intact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Returns the familiar post-war ruin through the un-familiar hinge of “aberrant mercy,” forcing the reader to grieve alongside the enemy’s compassion. The tessera-as-memory-chip and renaming-as-irreversible-act feel specific to this plaza, not transferable. Risk is taken in the lyric-accumulative structure, but coherence holds. Lacks one final surprise or conceptual flip to reach 9.0 territory.</comment>
