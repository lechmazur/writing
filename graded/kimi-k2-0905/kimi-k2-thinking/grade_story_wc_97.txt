<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The pianist’s interiority is poetically rendered—his grief is embodied in the yellowed keys, the silent gears, the blood on his fingertips—yet the arc is more mood- progression than choice-progression. The broken clock and sheet-music cipher act as extensions of self, but no contradictory impulse is dramatized in scene; once he decides to fly, resolve is seamless. Still, the final endurance (“played until his fingers bled”) pays a visible cost, earning a Renounced Stasis that fits the lyrical mode. Slight shortfall: we never feel him hesitate or reconsider once airborne, so the change feels preordained rather than freshly chosen.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a lyric Resonant Reconfiguration: the arbor sways like a living cradle, compasses rest, and silence becomes “full of the promise of another encore.” The cost is felt—the bleeding fingers, the still-silent clock—so the ending reweights the premise without exposition. Causality is Accumulative/Textural: each film fragment and metronomic image thickens the pattern until the final cadence crystallizes meaning. One minor slip: the “hidden map” reveal is lightly ornamental; the coordinates arrive more by poetic fiat than by tested puzzle logic, nudging the score down from 9.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The skeletal glass station, rusted strings, and silver-grain film stock are tactile and idiosyncratic; the tidal arbor itself acts as both refuge and resonant chamber that literally hums under the piano, constraining the final encore. Selective sensory hierarchy—cold weight of the broken clock, steely scent of clouds—mirrors the POV’s wistful filter. Spatial choreography stays clean across airship landing and moss-covered platform. Meets the 9+ gate: the living arbor’s low frequency directly shapes the pianist’s decision to play “until the silence was not empty,” charging the closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—can art outlast severed time and lost love?—is signaled early via the stuck clock. Pressure escalates by Accumulative deepening: each flicker of compass, each rusted key, each hidden frame intensifies the cost of staying vs. leaving. The decisive tightening occurs when he threads the final reel and the silhouette of the arbor appears—this single image collapses nostalgia into forward motion. Cost is visible (bleeding fingers, silent gears), but because the airship ascent itself presents no fresh obstacle or reversal, the escalation plateaus just shy of the 8.8 band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: time can be shattered yet remain playable; music is the clock that can still tick in parallel worlds. The broken clock’s return as silent counterweight to the final note reconfigures meaning without moralizing. Subtext lives in gesture—his smile at “the stars wink,” an implied dare to deterministic sorrow. The steely longing never resolves into comfort; instead it lingers as charged poise, satisfying the 9+ test of a non-literal answer to the central question.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person lyric floats close to the pianist’s perceptual register—diction is precise yet haunted: “skeletal frame… sang,” “cloud stuff,” “velvet darkness.” Rhythm mirrors musical phrasing, with crescendo sentences leading to fragmentary breaths under peak emotion. No head-hopping; focalization stays tightly bound to his fingers, pocket weight, and auditory horizon. The voice is unmistakable—no other narrator would liken silence to “silver threads” or describe compasses as “dancing between north and nowhere”—fulfilling the 9+ distinct-signature test.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is near-flawless: high density, zero paraphrase loops, varied cadence, strong verbs (“spill,” “rattled,” “swayed”). Metaphors stay coherent within the musical/clockwork lexicon. One hairline slip: “the horizon began to bruise” edges purple, but the image is brief and motivates the storm, so artifact penalty is minimal (−0.1). Closure line “the music remained… etched into the wind” lands clean, no figurative muddle. Satisfies the 9+ quick test for zero line-level debris in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The fusion of steampunk film-reel puzzle, floating hyper-bonsai, and cloud-top piano recital is fresh yet inevitable in hindsight. Specificity—“silver branches and floating leaves,” “low resonant frequency” of bark—prevents the arbor from feeling generic sky-garden. The encore-as-time-defiance synthesizes metronomic and botanical imagery into a single emotional rule: music can graft new futures onto broken pasts. Risk is high, but coherence holds; the concept would collapse if transplanted to another setting or instrument, meeting the transformation test.</comment>
