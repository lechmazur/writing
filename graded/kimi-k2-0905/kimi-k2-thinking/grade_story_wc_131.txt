<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mara’s “kindly methodical” nature is embodied in every micro-choice—installing rungs, shifting the tape, caching the crayon—so her final invisible smile carries earned cost. The boy remains a necessary receiver rather than a crucible, so relationship pressure is absent, but her interior contradiction (hunger to be seen vs. need to stay hidden) is dramatized in the final breath-held beat. Reflection is anchored to present tactile cues and alters next moves, satisfying BRR. One hairline slip: “sense memory was her language” edges toward label-speak, though it is instantly grounded by coal-smoke taste.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the boy reads aloud, Mara tastes coal smoke, and the library’s “delicate restoration” reweights every cached breadcrumb with visible emotional cost. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each cached object layers density until the final hush crystallizes meaning. Orientation is secured by word 40 (“subbasement”), well under the 120-word cap. No causal break; even the power outage is texture, not deus ex machina.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The library’s crawl spaces, steam pipes, and loose baseboards are not backdrop but tools that constrain how Mara can act; the seventh-shelf baseboard must be pried to deliver the tape. Sapphire dusk and coal-smoke taste recur, recharging the final image when the boy’s voice replaces the 1957 woman’s. Spatial choreography is immaculate: we track her vertical climb, the pocketing of the reel, the cross-legged boy on the pre-placed blanket. Environment, body, and object jointly charge the closing beat, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—Mara’s need to become visible without being seen—tightens when she risks moving the tape from pipe to children’s shelf. One meaningful escalation: the outage closes schools, guaranteeing a child will arrive, forcing her to cache rather than hoard. Cost is legible: every breadcrumb increases exposure should a librarian notice. Under Accumulative lens the pressure is a density shift, not a reversal, sufficient for 600-word scope.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the pattern of cached gifts: visibility can be reciprocal without physical presence. The tape’s ghost voice and the boy’s live voice form a palimpsest of caretaking across sixty-six years, reweighting “being seen” as auditory communion. No moral is stated; the final image of Mara tasting coal smoke while listening delivers conceptual repricing. Ambiguity remains—will the boy search for her?—inviting reflection without confusion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays strictly inside Mara’s perceptual signature—rivets, rust, coal-smoke taste—never ventriloquizing the boy. Syntax is methodical, clauses stacking like crawl-space moves: “Down she climbed… She’d cached… She would cache…” Rhythm accelerates only at “She held her breath,” mirroring stakes. No dialogue, so voice distinction bullet is N/A. Register remains within a self-taught maintenance worker’s lexicon; no corporate drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Every sentence advances cache logistics or sensory memory; zero paraphrase loops. Metaphors are spare and coherent: “library exhaled shadows like a lung” is singular, not stacked. Information density is high—one sentence can place rungs, date the tape, and foreshadow the boy. Final line “something more delicate had been restored” crystallizes without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The invisible caretaker trope is refreshed by the specificity of ferromagnetic tape, crawl-space anatomy, and the 1957 children’s broadcast. Caching as plot engine is novel at this scale. Risk is moderate—quiet lyric accumulation rather than twist—but coherence is total. Could edge higher with a sharper surprise, yet the emotional reconfiguration feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
