<question>1</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>Guardian is a mood silhouette, never choosing under pressure; no contradictory impulse surfaces. Child mirrors but also serves as passive recipient, not agent—no interior contradiction, no visible cost. Label-only “silent empathy” abstracts rather than embodies motive. Final beat is tableau, not earned renunciation.

<question>2</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Closure is a soft tableau—starlight on water—lacking Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration; no cost is legible on page. Guardian’s acts (mirror, shutters) are unmotivated within causal lens; no because/therefore chain narrows options. Accumulative lens applies, but pattern (light-weave) never reweights stakes—just repeats. Child’s smile is declared effect without on-page trade-off.

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Cobalt dock, rain-slick planks, iron-and-rope air are vivid, selective, and filter through guardian’s marine perception. Micro-setting success: dental mirror’s silver glint becomes horizon line, constraining final scatter. Spatial choreography clean; no floating bodies. Weather stays causal—wet planks govern footfall and light-play.

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—teach darkness to love stars—remains abstract; no concrete loss or narrowing of options. Guardian never faces opposition or resource limit; tension is atmospheric, not actionable. Stillwater tension is mood, not pressure that forces adaptation. No credible price paid; escalation is verbal intensifier (“stillwater tension hummed”) without causal trigger.

<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Theme—stars as hope visible only in dark—emerges imagistically through scattered light, avoiding explicit moral. Final image reprises mirror-to-water star-scatter, reweighting earlier motif with quiet resonance. Lapses into thematic echo: “taught darkness to cherish stars” is prompt-level articulation, not earned epiphany. Complexity limited by guardian’s flaw-free perfection.

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person lyric voice sustains controlled distancing suitable to mythic tone; syntax varies, favors liquid consonants mirroring water. Perceptual signature—guardian reads sky as bruised, rope as iron—remains consistent. No dialogue, so no register drift. Compression (“spiralingly calm”) taught early and paid off in final vortex image.

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>High metaphor density throughout; some beats risk purple (“quiet vortex,”“stars descended to listen”) but pattern is taught and coheres. No loops or synonym churn; sentences propel. Mixed metaphor “bruised sky” safe within lyrical register. Final clause “memory of every star-touched wave” slightly overwrought yet cadence fits closure.

<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Star-weaving canal guardian is fresh archetype; dental mirror as star-catcher is specific, not generic. Light-pattern pedagogy repurposes derelict dock into cosmic classroom—risky but coherent. Concept never retreats into safety, commits to lyric register. Familiar “child learns wonder” spine is not subverted.
