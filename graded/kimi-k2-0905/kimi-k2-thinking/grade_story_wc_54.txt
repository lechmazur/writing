<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Mira’s curiosity-to-engineer arc is clear, but her interiority stays in generalized “stoic wonder” rather than sharp contradiction. The shift from solitary mapper to community animator is told, not embodied in a micro-choice that costs her anything; the children arrive as grateful audience, not crucible. Competence is foregrounded, struggle absent; no visible flaw complicates the resurrection.

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closures on Charged Poise: the terminal glows with children’s laughter and the sextant is sealed as relic—cost is felt as communal opportunity reconfigured. Causal chain (find object → reroute flows → awaken space) is linear; no tightening or reversal raises stakes. The lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern of flow imagery holds to final line. Orientation anchored by word 45; no penalty.

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Spaceport ruins are tactile—rusted pipes, dust-thick flyers, cracked tiles—filtered through Mira’s engineering gaze. Solar panels and canal trickle supply resources that enable the resurrection; setting shapes tactics. Sensory palette stays narrow (visual, metallic, water) but purposeful; micro-setting (sextant) becomes transmitter dial, charging closure image.

<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore wonder to town—signaled early but remains abstract; no visible price (time, risk, social credit) is paid by Mira. Escalation is additive, not tightening: each new flow success lands smoothly with no resistance or trade-off. Children’s arrival extends rather than tests the mission; luck complicates nothing. Closure is resonance, not option foreclosure.

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of infrastructural hope emerges organically from concrete acts—water mirror, amber lights, paper rockets—never sermonized. Sextant motif evolves from navigation tool to communal relic, reweighting meaning at close. Subtext in children’s mirrored faces versus abandoned gates offers quiet social irony. Final formula “Hope = Flow × Purpose / Time” is overt thematic echo, blunting nuance.

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person close stays locked to Mira; perceptual signature is engineer-filtered—“network of latent flows,” “hydraulics with heartbeats”—consistent, rhythmic, specific. Syntax tightens under action: short verb clusters mirror installation momentum. No dialogue to test voice distinction; internal diction stays within plausible intern lexicon. Final line cadence mirrors earlier flow refrain, achieving deliberate echo.

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is lean, high-density; most sentences serve two jobs (image + motion). Occasional poetic lift (“bruised orange sky,” “apneic stillness”) is earned and patterned early. No scaffold loops; only minor filter verbs. Metaphors stay coherent; no mixed vehicles. One paraphrase loop—“flow” repeated three times in 30 words—drops score a hair.

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Familiar “save the ruins” premise is refreshed through civic-engineering lens and carnival afterglow. Sextant-as-transmitter is a clever repurposing that feels inevitable in hindsight. Kids-launch-paper-rockets payoff converts derelict spaceport into imagination launchpad without schmaltz. No bold structural risk; linear uplift keeps it shy of 8.5+ originality band.
