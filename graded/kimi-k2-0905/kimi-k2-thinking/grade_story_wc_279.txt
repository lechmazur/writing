<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The chalk artist’s interiority is vivid—her fingers “read the silence like braille”—and her motive to “discover meaning in the mess” is dramatized through the risky act of drawing on the mandala. Yet the contradiction between whimsy and the solemn cost of rewriting communal memory is asserted more than embodied; we never feel her regret or fear in her body. The final smile feels unearned because the prior beat shows no micro-choice that costs her personally.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the violet slash reweights silence from void to map, and the grotto’s chalk fossils make the cost legible. Causality under Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each chalk stroke thickens the hush until the tile’s dissolution crystallizes silence. The single-scene structure is coherent; spatial anchors (grotto floor, mandala center) remain stable. The seventh-turn rule is taught early and paid off in the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The grotto’s breathing stone, lilac mist, and ghost-shifted sand grains are filtered through the artist’s tactile priorities; the mandala itself functions as micro-setting that constrains her chalk spiral. Sensory hierarchy favors touch and hearing over visual catalog. Weather (mist thickening per stroke) evolves with action rather than decorating it. The tile flake’s warmth and powdering provide concrete state-change that charges the final silence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will the village remember its trauma rightly—is signaled early and tightened when the tile commands “Complete the circle, but break it at the seventh turn.” The artist’s agency is decisive: she interjects the violet slash that forecloses the perfect circle and releases the voices. Cost is conceptual but legible: the grotto will remember while the village forgets again. One meaningful intensification suffices under Accumulative lens; no reversal is required.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme—memory as map rather than void—emerges through the chalked spiral and the fossilized stories on the grotto wall, never stated. The violet question-mark slash reweights the premise without moralizing. Ambiguity is purposeful: the villagers may still choose denial. Subtext in the tile’s whispered instruction and the monk’s ghost-traced sand invites multiple readings.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tightly fused to the artist’s perceptual signature—fingers as diplomats, silence as braille. Syntax lengthens and breathes during mist-thickening, then snaps into the short imperative of the tile’s phrase. No head-hopping; psychic distance contracts under pressure. Diction stays within the artist’s plausible lexicon while retaining lyrical lift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “lilac unease,” “emergent hush,” and “chalk fossils” each do double duty for atmosphere and stakes. No synonym loops or template cadence; sentence openings vary. One mixed metaphor—“violet mist” vs. “lilac unease”—is minor and does not touch closure. Final line crystallizes without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The premise—using ephemeral chalk to rewrite collective forgetting via a haunted mandala—feels fresh yet inevitable. Risky lyric compression is taught early and paid off in the glowing chalk lines. Specific detail (molar-sized tile, seventh-turn break) prevents abstraction. The grotto-as-memory-archive trope is transformed through tactile immediacy and the violet slash that questions rather than completes.</comment>
