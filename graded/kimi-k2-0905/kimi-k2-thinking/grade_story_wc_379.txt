<comment>Mira’s curator-gift is shown, not told: the locket warms as it drinks stories, an embodied micro-choice that externalizes her knack. Interiority stays concrete (“stories woven through these walls”) and her final smile is a credible renunciation—she keeps curating, but now for community, not objects. No contradictory impulses appear in-scene, so the 9+ quick test fails, yet the arc lands with visible cost: the courtyard saved, her solitude traded for public guardianship.</comment>

<comment>Causal lens holds: locket → key → address → mailbox → letters chain logically; each discovery tightens options until the bulldozer arrival tests the stakes. Closure is earned and costly—Elena inherits the caretaker role, Mira forfeits anonymity, the courtyard becomes a historic site—so Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost is on-page. One minor causality warp: Samir’s grandmother sleep-talks the exact cue “where the jasmine blooms white,” a convenience not seeded earlier, keeping the score sub-9.</comment>

<comment>The courtyard is never a postcard: jasmine vines “strangle” the post, survey flags “intrude,” colors shift from apricot to rose—details that mirror rising stakes. The mailbox itself becomes micro-setting, its brass face and rusted lock constraining every attempt to open it until the key turns. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible positions during dawn gatherings. Meets 9+ gate: the mailbox charges the final image and constrains the choice to display the letters publicly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—save the courtyard by proving stories matter—remains coherent. One meaningful tightening: developer flags appear overnight, forcing Mira to accelerate from passive listening to public curation of the letters. Cost is legible (loss of her private sanctuary, exposure of neighbors’ grief), but the escalation is slightly cushioned: city council stalls the tower off-page, so the price is shared rather than personally borne, capping short of 8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: listening as communal glue surfaces through the letters’ content, never sermonized. Final image of the polished mailbox reweights “listening” from passive to activist act without moral tag. One soft spot: the phrase “listening heals” is printed on the prompt-like note inside the locket, a faint echo that keeps it from the 9-band.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person voice keeps perceptual signature crisp: Mira “reads secret histories in chipped porcelain,” a curator’s synesthetic lens. Rhythm modulates—longer sentences for reflective dawn, staccato when bulldozers arrive. No head-hopping; Elena’s tears are externally observed. Filter verbs minimal; “the locket grew warm” is active. Dialogue sparse but natural; Samir’s skateboard clicks anchor his age. Clean free-indirect style throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Strong information density: single sentences layer object, history, and stakes (“silver, tarnished, with a tiny keyhole no bigger than a grain of rice”). One scaffold trace: “She began her investigation through neighborhood storytelling” is tell-ish, though immediately dramatized on the benches. No mixed metaphors; jasmine strangling mailbox is coherent. Final paragraph drifts toward template cadence (“The sandstorm had passed, leaving only calm”), a loop that blunts the last line’s punch, holding below 8.0.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh angle: locked mailbox as living shrine, not puzzle box. Integration of thrift-store curator with oral-history activism is non-obvious and feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk taken with mosaic of voices, but pattern is taught early (Mira on bench at dawn) and closure stays coherent. Derivative Premise Guardrail waived: community-vs-developer is familiar, yet reframed through epistolary gratitude rather than protest signs, yielding specific emotional truth.</comment>
