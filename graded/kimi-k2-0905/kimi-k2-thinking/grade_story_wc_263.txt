<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Interiority is lyrical but abstract; “trapped creativity” is declared, not dramatized through contradictory micro-choices. The only embodied beat is lying on ice; no visible flaw or cost drives the final release. Motive stays static; the sextant and stars act upon her rather than revealing hierarchy-of-values decisions.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each image layer (sextant, star-tracings, aurora) deepens the stake of silence vs. song. Closure lands as Charged Poise—she rises with “quiet confidence” and the page now “alive,” a reconfiguration with conceptual cost (the frozen journey can’t be undone). Orientation is swift; causality is atmospheric, not beat-by-beat, acceptable under lyric mode.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Ice, sextant, and aurora archway are tactile, temperature-felt, and directly constrain the resting action that unlocks voice. Selective sensory triage—starlight on brass, silk-thread lullaby—mirrors internal hush without cataloging the tundra. Final rainbow flare from the lens recharges the setting as confirmation of change.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—break creative silence—signaled early; pressure intensifies via accretion of celestial images rather than narrowing options. No concrete trade-off or visible price is dramatized on page; the silence simply lifts after she lies down. Escalation is aesthetic, not tactical, sufficient for lyric arc but below high-band cost requirement.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme—creativity as cosmic memory—emerges through stardust motif and final aurora fade, never sermonized. Subtext of necessary darkness (“cocoon”) complicates the release, giving ambiguity. Final image of rivering stardust reweights earlier blank-page despair without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person lyric voice sustains moon-biased perceptual signature: “sky that never forgot its stars,” “silken shadows.” Syntax lengthens and contracts like breath, matching auroral pulses. No dialogue to fracture voice; diction stays within poet’s lexicon, culminating in meteor-streak sentences that mirror restored flow.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Figurative density is high but patterned early (“ink run dry,” “starlight ghost”) so it reads as taught texture, not clutter. Occasional soft repeats—“stardust,” “shadowed rapture”—used for incantatory effect rather than synonym churn. No mixed metaphors or filter-verb stacks; final paragraph propels without scaffolding.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Arctic aurora gate as creative unblocker is fresh synthesis of grandma-sextant + circumpolar myth. Risk lies in pure lyric accumulation rather than plot, but coherence under Accumulative lens keeps it from gimmick. Specificity of brass instrument on ice block anchors the cosmic frame in tactile reality.</comment>
