<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The poet’s interiority is lyrically sustained, but his contradictory impulses (escape vs. preservation) are announced rather than dramatized in scene; no micro-choice visibly costs him anything until the final sentence, so the “earned” renunciation feels asserted. The rope’s backstory arrives as retrospective label, not embodied memory under pressure. Still, the sensibility is consistent and the voice-specific worldview keeps the score above mid-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure is a legitimate Charged Poise: the decision to carry the rope onward crystallizes the impossible choice between past anchor and future openness, cost felt in the final line “every fray is a door.” Accumulative/textural lens holds: pattern of knots and grotto layers thicken meaning until the final cadence reweights the stake. Orientation is clear by word 60; no causal contradiction. Lacks a persistent external constraint that could have sharpened tactics, keeping it shy of 9.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Terra-cotta grotto breathes through tactile verbs—“walls seemed to breathe,” “sediment band a page”—and the starlight slit actively tugs the rope ends, charging the final image. Spatial anchors hold; no white-room gaps. Micro-setting (rope body, knot pattern) functions as extension of environment and constrains the poet’s manual dance. Would need one more causal interaction—e.g., a strand actually snagging—to breach 9.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—how to feel time’s texture—is signaled early and deepens through the repetition of “pattern” and “layer.” The single tightening occurs when the poet refuses to climb out, preserving the weave; cost is conceptual (foreclosed escape) rather than visceral. Accumulative escalation is coherent but gentle; no new external pressure narrows options after the grotto entry. Meets短篇要求 but stays modest.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the poet’s tactile metaphors: time as braided rope, not line. The final reprise—“every fray is a door, every knot a home”—offers resonant reconfiguration without moralizing. Impossible choice motif is insisted lyrically, yet the ambiguity feels earned because the poet’s body keeps enacting it. Stays below 9 only because the grotto’s prior whispers never contradict or complicate his stance, leaving thematic tension slightly static.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays tightly fused to the poet’s perceptual filter: syntax elongates during knot-work, contracts at starlight flickers. Diction—“ethically playful reverence,” “passionate subtlety”—is self-conscious but consistent with a poet-narrator who thinks in oxymoron. No head-hopping; psychic distance stable. Rhythmic control heightens toward the end without obscuring causality. Minor template cadence in “each ___ a ___” anaphora keeps it from perfect 9.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong read-aloud rhythm, varied sentence lengths, high information density per line. Occasional paraphrase loops—“pattern of knots that mapped moments,” “layers of meaning hidden beneath”—deduct 0.3. Metaphors stay coherent (weave, braid, door) and physically rooted. No artifact touches the closure beat. Tight but not yet surgical; a few nominalizations could be verbs.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: prison-escape rope reimagined as time-loom under starlit grotto is non-obvious and fully committed. Energy beings remain alluringly off-stage, avoiding exposition dump. Risk—lyric recursion, minimal plot—heightens rather than obscures meaning. Transformation test passes: swap rope for knife and whole pattern collapses. Slight deduction for familiar “poet in cave” archetype, but texture reclaims ownership.</comment>
