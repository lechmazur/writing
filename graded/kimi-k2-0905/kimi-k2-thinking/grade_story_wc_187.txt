<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The archivist’s interior contradiction—preemptive nostalgia vs. archival duty—surfaces early and endures, but no micro-choice in-scene actually changes her tactics; she only listens, measures, and writes. The final “acceptance” is asserted rather than dramatized, so the cost feels intellectual, not visceral. Still, her perceptual filter is specific and consistent, keeping the score above mid-line.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the hush reweights identity from fragments to “spaces where experience dissolved,” a resonant reconfiguration with conceptual cost. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of shadow-length notes, whispers, crystal images—and the cadence shift at the end is legible. Orientation is taught by word 50 (stormlit observatory above frozen fog), so no penalty. One minor loop: “preemptively nostalgic grief” is announced twice in near-paraphrase; otherwise causality holds.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stormlight, crystalline plateau, and tessellated forecourt are rendered through the archivist’s measuring gaze, each detail filtering her task. The hexagonal panels that record footsteps and raindrops act as micro-setting that literally stores memory, constraining her next move (she must kneel and place the quill). Spatial choreography is clean between observatory and forecourt; no floating rooms. The environment’s cold and sound-conducting properties mirror her internal narrowing, charging the final hush.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—how to sculpt identity from undifferentiated collective memory—is signaled early. Pressure escalates texturally: the chorus of whispers intensifies, shadow lengths vary, but no single beat forces a trade-off or irreversible choice; the climax is listening into silence. Cost is conceptual (she gives up “solid” identity) rather than tangible, keeping the score below 7.5. Still, the deepening hush reweights options under the Accumulative lens, satisfying minimum escalation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: memory is not fixed artifact but dissolving fog we learn to breathe. The refrain of “preemptively nostalgic grief” and the final journal line reprice the premise without moralizing. Subtext lives in gesture—kneeling on cold crystal, measuring shadows—rather than exposition. The closing question about becoming “sum of every voice” invites counter-readings, sustaining ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person POV stays tightly aligned to the archivist’s perceptual syntax: “stormlight, neither sun nor moon but weather’s own pulse.” Filter verbs are few and motivated; diction remains within her scholarly lexicon. No head-hopping; psychic distance compresses naturally under the “deepening hush.” Rhythm modulates from long observational sentences to the final fragmentary question, mirroring her attenuated attention.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical yet information-dense; most sentences do two jobs (atmosphere + world rule). One paraphrase loop—“preemptively nostalgic grief” / “preemptively nostalgic heart”—costs −0.2. Metaphors stay coherent (fog solidifies, shadows stretch generations). No scaffold sentences or template cadence; final line earns its silence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The conceit of memory-as-measurable-shadows and rain-drop archives feels fresh, not a re-skinned ghost story. Risk is taken with quiet, non-causal structure, yet the pattern is taught early and pays off in the final hush. Specificity—Day of White Roses barely a finger-width—prevents generic abstraction. The synthesis of meteorology and historiography is non-obvious and inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
