<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interiority is lyrical and concrete—“hollow out the self until only the receiving remains” is character-particular. The seasonal-mute vow motivates her tuning and eventual self-erasure, a visible cost. However, no contradictory impulse is dramatized on-page; she glides from vow to transcendence without resistance, so the final renunciation feels foregone rather than earned in-scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each paragraph layers a new medium—iceberg fragment, wind-driven beams, color return—until the final image reweights the premise. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the child’s touch reframes preservation as transmission, costing the tuner her remaining pigment. Orientation is taught immediately (“whispering bluff before dawn”), transitions are legible, no causality break.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Micro-setting (iceberg fragment the size of a child’s heart) literally constrains the tuning and is charged in the final image. Atmosphere is selective—altitude’s freeze-thaw magic, lichen flaring emerald—never generic. Spatial choreography is clean: sculptures turn on balanced axes, child reaches, droplets prism. Environment guides every micro-adjustment of weight and tension.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</question>
<comment>Dominant stake: preserve wonder via resonance. One meaningful tightening: the arrival of the wordless child forces the tuner to recognize transmission over hoarding. Cost is visible—she fades into the sculptures, pigment bleeding out. Escalation is accumulative: each kinetic piece adds pressure until the child’s touch crystallizes the shift.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the pattern itself: meaning resides in vibration, not vocabulary. The iceberg fragment’s reprise (ancient whale-song inside future ice) reweights wonder as reciprocal, not archival. No moralizing; the final laugh is a sonic object, not commentary. Ambiguity lingers: who will tune after the tuner dissolves?</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Lyric third-person hovers close to the tuner’s perceptual bias—“blue breath of glaciers,” “hundred tiny sounds of her tunings.” Syntax coils like wind-girded beams, then fractures into clauses that mimic metallic resonance. No dialogue, so voice distinction is internal; the child’s widening eyes are filtered through the tuner’s sonic ontology. Pattern-taught elision (“language had dissolved”) stays legible.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Rhythm alternates between long breathy sentences and clipped fragments that echo bell strikes. Information density is high: one sentence can carry altitude physics, pigment loss, and mythic time. Zero loops; no mixed metaphors. Final line—“mute and perfect and forever new”—earns its triple adjective through prior acoustic buildup.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses post-linguistic solarpunk with high-altitude kinetic organ—fresh synthesis. Risk: making silence musical without slipping into gimmick; succeeds because every sonic image is tied to material physics (ice density, wind torque). The “symphonies of truth” could feel abstract, but here they are literalized as climbable architecture. Transformation test fails if you swap iceberg for any rock—its prehistoric breath is irreplaceable.</comment>
