<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Wick’s grief-sniffing transition from body-finder to message-archaeologist is credible; his paw-level micro-choice to press the leaf into the hatch lock crystallizes his arc. Interiority stays animal: scent-maps, ear-drum Braille, no anthropomorphic self-analysis. Contradictory impulse—duty vs. abandonment—remains present but under-played; one more beat of visible physical cost (limping, dehydration) would push to 8+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the leaf, cylinder, and vault form a density spiral that reweights “distance” from mileage to silence. Closure is Charged Poise—Wick curled among messages, cost felt in the hush he now breaks nightly. Orientation clean by 120 words; causality intact (leaf → hatch is set up by vein-pattern match). One causal gap: how Kess’s phonograph still turns with a cracked horn on one scavenged battery—minor but keeps it sub-9.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Scrap-spine settlement, cracked radiator water, leaf-vein vault hatch—each detail is tactile and choice-shaping. Micro-setting rule satisfied: the wax leaf doubles as tool and key. Wild hush tone mirrors internal desolation without overwriting. Spatial track stays clean across three-day traverse; one more audible texture (metal groan underfoot inside vault) would nudge 8.8.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“translate distance into closeness”—tightens once, at hatch riddle answer; cost is emotional, not tactical. Agency is present: Wick walks, trades, decides to open vault. No secondary reversal, but single meaningful deepening fits 600-word scale. Persistent constraint (silence) shapes final tactic—curling up to listen—so cost legible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through recurrence of preserved voice vs. living silence; no authorial thesis stated. Final image of dog enfolded by disembodied love reweights earlier salvage into recovery. Ambiguity remains: is he soothed or trapped? One near-echo of prompt language (“translate distance into closeness”) is internalized through Wick’s memory, not sermon, so barely dodges Thematic Echo penalty.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to bloodhound senses: smell-first exposition, ear-drum syntax “like Braille.” Rhythm compresses in vault scene—short sentences mimic cylinder clicks. No dialogue to distort. Diction remains within canine perception; only “conceptual repricing” skirts excess register. Distinctive perceptual signature sustained.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>High information density: single sentences layer scavenger economy, war aftermath, and emotional stakes. No scaffold loops; metaphors stay consistent (rusted spine, fire-colored veins). One mixed image—“wind carried a wild hush”—is earned by pattern. Final paragraph risks paraphrase repetition of “distance” but serves cadence. Clean proofing.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</question>
<comment>Post-apocalyptic message-in-a-cylinder is familiar, yet bloodhound POV and olfactory Braille feel fresh. Synthesis of phonograph grooves + scent memory creates specific inflection. Risk—quiet ending inside archive—pays off by reconfiguring salvage as intimacy. Transformation test passed: arc collapses if protagonist is human or object is digital.</comment>
