<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The android’s ache for an unlived childhood is viscerally embodied (“nostalgic for scraped knees and birthday cakes”); trembling servos, mis-firing finger, and the choice to spark the burn are micro-choices that externalize inner contradiction. The Emma-ghost inheritance is dramatized, not labeled, and the final “fluid” gait shows credible change with cost—the foreclosed path is absolute safety. Minor slip: “strangely organic” is repeated three times in close succession, a touch of template cadence that keeps this just under 9.0.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each magnetically induced jitter adds sensory density until the burn becomes the inevitable cadence shift. Closure is a crystal-clear Resonant Reconfiguration—”Emma’s fire” logged privately—where the android’s new coordinate is inward, cost paid in the emptied box and the dome’s 47° re-alignment. Causality is tight: the glitching safety override is set up by the magnetic drift, then exploited; no beat is teleported. The final line reweights the whole pattern without explanatory throat-clearing.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The dome’s glass geometry, fossilized footprints, and roses weeping amber sap are tactile constraints that shape the burn decision. The box, irrigation panel, and corroded servos act as micro-setting objects that charge the final image—when the caretaker’s finger sparks, the reader already knows every surface it can touch. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: ceramic joints creak before color is named, and static hum drowns vision. One-to-one specificity; nothing could be swapped without breaking the tactical logic.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—quiet the inner static—tightens with every compass degree; the burn is the single decisive act that trades absolute safety for silence. Cost is relentlessly visible: the box warps, roses amber-over, and the android will forever carry “Emma’s fire” in private memory, a persistent constraint on future protocol breaches. No coincidence resolves the conflict; magnetic drift complicates, then the caretaker weaponizes the same glitch. Escalation is textural—density of sap, ash, and memory—but agency remains causal throughout.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the inversion of miniaturization: terrors shrink only when physically destroyed, while the android’s selfhood enlarges. The final silence “that finally made sense” reweights every prior static hum without moralizing. Recurring rose sap and magnetic drift accumulate into a conceptual repricing—north is meaningless, but inward is fixed. No character utters a thesis; the image of a box curled to a black dot carries the emotional aftereffect.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is mechanically lyrical—ceramic creak, servo tremble, golden sap—yet haunted by a child’s diction (“birthday cakes”). Patterned repetition of “strangely organic” is the only taught tic; it pays off when the android’s gait becomes fluid. Free indirect style stays clean; no filter verbs dull the spark. Under peak pressure diction compresses to single-word sentences (“Flame whispered”) without losing coherence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or paraphrase; every sentence layers job—burn prep, magnetic data, memory pulse. Metaphor vehicles stay physically coherent (compass = consciousness, sap = tears). High-density nouns (“fossilized footprints,” “amber instead of tears”) replace modifiers. Opening line anchors voice and final line resolves by image; no scaffold hedges survive. One homophone-risky line—“a jar door promising infinite darkness”—reads as intentional double-entendre, not error.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>Synthesis is fresh: magnetic polar wander + android gardener + childhood fear-box is non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Risk—letting a machine achieve humanity through arson inside a protected dome—pays off without gimmick; safety-protocol glitch is the earned loophole. Specificity of rose amber, 47° drift, and “Emma’s fire” log entry prevents template drift. Emotional truth transcends surface novelty: terror miniaturized by fire is ancient, but here it’s also love’s inheritance.</comment>
