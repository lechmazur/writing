<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator’s curiosity is embodied through the hearing-aid micro-choices and the kneeling compression beat, giving credible interiority. The “contact tracer” label is never translated into a concrete occupational tic, so the supposed vocation feels decorative. The final hand-clasp supplies a visible cost, but the arc is thin: curiosity leads straight to rescue without interior contradiction or loss. Still, the voice-specific perception (yellowed plastic, static breath) keeps characterization above mid-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the misprision of ghost-pulse → living heart creates a Resonant Reconfiguration that reweights the premise under an Accumulative lens. Causality is tight: each hearing-aid adjustment tightens the misreading until the glass crash externalizes the mistake. Orientation is swift (mist-clad atrium, twilight, alone) within 60 words. One minor loop: “reeling hush” is repeated without pattern justification, but it does not dent the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The atrium’s dew-slick pillars and mirrored marble constrain movement and echo the false echo of the device; environment materially shapes the error. The photograph’s curled edge is handled twice—first as found object, then as beacon—charging the final image. Sensory hierarchy favors hush and muffled vibration, matching the mis-hearing concept. Micro-setting (bench, broken glass) tracks cleanly across beats.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—protecting vulnerable voices—tightens when the narrator realizes the pulse is corporeal; the choice to compress the stranger’s chest forecloses the ghost-hunt. Pressure escalates through auditory narrowing: each static filter raises the cost of mis-listening. The reversal (ghost → living) is earned by the device’s prior behavior. No visible price is exacted from the narrator, keeping the score below 8.5.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges obliquely: the living are the true vulnerable voices, not the dead. The photograph of Lila migrates from nostalgic artifact to talisman for future rescues, reweighting the concept without moralizing. Subtext resides in the hearing-aid’s tremble—grief misdirected. Final line “cycle continues” risks a platitude, but the image of mist curling like a guardian’s cloak keeps the resonance sensory, not stated.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>First-person lyric voice sustains a consistent perceptual signature: sound is texture, light is viscosity. Syntax elongates in misty clauses then fractures at the glass crash, mirroring auditory focus. No dialogue, so no voice leakage. The occasional ornate phrase (“reeling hush”) is repeated without pattern payoff, a hairline slip that keeps the score under 9.0.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet breathable: “pulse flickers, softer than a moth’s wing” compresses stakes and sensory threshold. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or choice. Metaphors stay coherent (mist as shroud, static as breath). One mixed vehicle—“pulse resolves into a name: ‘Lila’… like glass chimes”—strains physics but occurs early enough not to cloud the climax.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The “contact tracer for hearts” premise reframes a common rescue plot through auditory misprision, a fresh inflection that feels inevitable once the hearing-aid misreads. The decades-old device as ghost-radio is specific, not gimmick, and its yellowed plastic recurs tactually. Risk is taken with lyric accumulation rather than causal twists, yet coherence holds. Could edge higher if the narrator paid a sharper personal cost.</comment>
