<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Traveler’s interiority stays generic (“felt the weight… pressing against his chest”) and never crystallizes into a specific contradiction; oracle’s “mild obsession” is label-only, never alters her tactics. No micro-choice under pressure is dramatized; the parchment acceptance is passive, not legibly costly. Yet the lone wanderer’s stance of quiet endurance fits the lyric mode and supplies a minimalist arc that the ending retroactively charges, so the baseline genre expectation is met without rising to individual specificity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of returning “ambered hush” images tightens the stake—the map is silence made visible—until the final beat where the traveler presses the parchment to his heart and steps into starless dark; cost is felt in the vanished star and the fort’s fade to silhouette. Orientation is lyric-delayed but taught by line 3 (“storm-tossed ridge”) and pays off at closure, so no penalty. Closure is a Charged Poise: options narrow to “walk into the void” with the glowing map as compass; conceptual cost is undeniable.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Storm-tossed ridge, pebble shore, marbled walls, flaking gold dust—each sensory layer is filtered through traveler’s awe and oracle’s obsession, never tourist-list. The fort’s stair, chamber wind, and parchment’s tombstone-cold surface constrain movement and tactile choice. Final image of fort silhouette against void reuses initial anchors with reweighted silence, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can silence be navigated?—tightens through iterative images of hush thickening, star dying, map glowing; no external antagonist, but pressure is coherent under Accumulative lens. One meaningful deepening: traveler realizes silence itself is language. Cost is conceptual (perpetual night, vanished star) rather than viscerally felt on-page, keeping it just below 8-band excellence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: silence as preservative, map, and finally compass. Recurrent “ambered hush” shifts from descriptor to epistemic tool; no moralizing, only image-repricing at end. Subtext lives in oracle’s flaking booklet and traveler’s heartbeat against parchment—objects speak instead of exposition. Complexity accepted: endless night is not conquerable, only traversable.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Lyric third-person hovers at consistent mythic distance; diction (“marbled hush,” “dying ember”) stays within story’s own poetic register. Patterned repetition of “ambered hush” and “silent map” is taught early and paid at closure; no head-hop. Rhythm modulates: short declaratives for ascent, longer breathless clauses for oracle’s speech, final staccato as star vanishes—intentional cadence control.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Sentence music is deliberate: sibilant storms, hard plosives for pebbles, soft nasals for hush—read-aloud variation sustains. No scaffold loops; each mention of silence adds density or reprise. One mixed-metor risk—“rivers of silence across parchment”—but context converts abstraction into legible cartography, so clarity intact. Opening and closing lines anchor and resolve with imagistic precision.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: cartography of silence rendered as tactile object. Familiar oracle trope is retooled into passive archivist of absence; traveler’s quest flips from seeking knowledge to accepting navigation by void. Risky lyric structure pays off with coherent closure, not gimmick. Specificity of flaking gold dust and single star keeps concept grounded; removal would collapse story’s entire armature.</comment>
