<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Kael’s interior contradiction—hunter of empathy turned reluctant planter—drives every beat. The baseball’s heft and elevator ascent dramatize his renunciation with visible cost. Emotional summary (“jaded wonder”) occasionally abstracts embodied state. No second character on page, so status/relationship bullets waived.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: erased memories → newspaper clue → baseball key → elevator ascent, each therefore-linkage narrowing options. Closure lands as Earned Stasis: he forecloses hunter identity, cost felt in “pulse of time-traveler’s signature.” Orientation锚定 within 120 words. No meaningful escalation reversal, but single tightening sufficient for length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Bioluminescent lake and crystalline cavern constrain path choice and mirror internal glow/fragility. Baseball as micro-setting charges final image. Sensory economy tight: antiseptic scent, turquoise skin paint, humming water. Spatial choreography clean across bridge-tunnel-elevator sequence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—kindle empathy—signaled early. One tightening: labyrinth fork forces echo-listening choice that forecloses return to sterile room. Cost visible: cavern tremor threatens collapse. Agency resides in Kael’s decision to ascend with baseball, not luck.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through image-loop: hunter→keeper, sterile→glow, erased→remembered. No explicit moral; final whispered “Elias” reweights premise via time-loop resonance. “Jaded wonder” tone carries thematic ambiguity without sentimentality.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Kael’s perceptual filter: “delicately robust” diction mirrors his fractured calm. Rhythm accelerates during cavern tremor without syntactic monotony. No dialogue, so dialogue bullets waived. Free indirect clean: “he realized…” tied to present stimulus.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High information density: single sentences layer memory, scent, color. No paraphrase loops; metaphor (“lake itself could shatter yet endure”) coherent. Minor register drift toward lyric Abstract (“new trajectory”) but stays within POV lexicon. Final line anchors cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Time-travel baseball + empathy labyrinth synthesizes familiar tropes into concrete sensory arc. Specific detail—“Elias Chronos” signature shimmer—prevents generic swap. Risk taken: quiet ascent ending, but closure legible. Not radically novel, yet integration feels inevitable.</comment>
