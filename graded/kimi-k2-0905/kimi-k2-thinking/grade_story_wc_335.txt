<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The archivist’s renunciation of return is earned: every annotation stroke, backward step, and tremor of tea-spill shows the price of choosing Lin over homeland. Contradictory impulses—yearning for return versus protective mentorship—coexist in the same beats, not summarized. Interiority stays concrete (“tremor slightly as she pours”), never drifting into label-speak. Final smile cracks the stern mask, proving micro-choice hierarchy under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: she seals the shard, foreclosing return with visible cost—“who would teach you to read the leaves?” spoken over trembling hands. Causal chain holds: annotation → shadow recognition → mentor choice, each because/therefore legible. Orientation anchored by 110 words: empty swing, moss-stone library, backward gait. Lens is Causal throughout; no ambiguity at end.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Forgotten library constrains choices: dust motes, marble scrapes, and the velvet pouch become tactile tools of the trade. Micro-setting object—tea-stained parchment—literally guides the final annotation, charging the closure image. Spatial choreography is clean: archivist circles table backwards while Lin sits, breath fogging shard; no impossible positions. Sensory economy favors hush, leaf-geometry, and swing-arc, all filtered through archivist’s occupational bias.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“decipher shadow or stay exiled”—tightens when annotation succeeds yet she still chooses remaining; option of return is foreclosed on-page. One meaningful turn suffices: the instant shadow dances, freedom becomes possible yet rejected. Cost is visible: trembling pour, sealed pouch, and Lin’s white knuckles. Agency is her pen stopping, then finishing the glyph that locks her fate.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of quiet resilience emerges from tea-leaf spirals and swing arcs, never stated outright. Final image—library breathing—reweights the hush from loneliness to shared breath, a Conceptual Repricing. Subtext lives in gesture: backward walk becomes ritual of reverence, not mere tic. Combative tenderness is the medium, not the message; no moralizing closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person hovers close to archivist, filtering every detail through her perceptual signature: dust motes “hold breath,” swing echoes laughter only she hears. Syntax mirrors her reversible habit—“circles the reading table...in reverse”—creating rhythmic signature. Diction stays within lexicon of archivist-poet: “shard-mirror,” “geometry of tea,” never academic. Free indirect clean: “exile is a door that swings both ways” reads as her lived maxim, not narrator intrusion.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sentences vary from hushed sibilants to percussive scrapes, accelerating during annotation then slowing for pouch seal. Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances knowledge or image. Metaphors stay coherent: tea leaves as “stepping stones,” shadow as “tentative hand,” all paying off in final dance. No register drift; “glyph,” “velvet pouch,” and “resonant reconfiguration” belong to her world.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Shard-mirror archivist reverses mentor trope: exile chooses to stay, making reversible exile a fresh hinge. Tea-leaf geometry as decryption tool is particular, not generic fortune-telling. Risk of backward-walk gimmick is earned by ritualizing it into reverence. Shadow caught in glass reweights from curse to heirloom, a synthesis that feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
