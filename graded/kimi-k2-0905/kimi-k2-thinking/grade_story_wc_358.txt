<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Investigator’s competence is clear, but interior contradiction is thin; the patch acts as talisman rather than active spur to a visible micro-choice. No moment shows her forced to trade safety, time, or method because of a flaw or blind spot; the final resolve feels incremental, not paid for.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the mapped wind “fingerprints” reconfigure future risk with conceptual cost. Causal chain (gust → crash → mapping) holds, but the decisive beat is compressed into a single paragraph; the cost is implied, not felt on the body or page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Container maze and venturi corridor are tactile and specific; wind readings tether description to goal. The patch-as-micro-setting earns bonus: its warmth in pocket reappears in final image, charging the exit with residual unease.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prevent repeat disaster—remains abstract; no live second container or circling helicopter forces an immediate trade-off. Escalation is intellectual (data spike) rather than tactical; pressure plateaus after the venturi discovery.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Theme of foresight versus fatal convergence emerges through wind mapping, but final paragraph verbalizes it (“world was a web of converging forces”) rather than letting image reweight meaning. Subtext is present yet leans toward statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight; perceptual signature filters through professional metrology lexicon. Rhythm modulates with gust cadence; no head-hop. Voice is serviceable, not singular—could swap with any competent technician POV without ripple.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Sentences breathe with wind tempo; no loops or scaffold. Occasional elevated diction (“singular convergence,” “conceptual repricing”) nudges register above POV pay-grade, but clarity intact. Metaphors stay coherent; no figurative pile-ups under pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Fusing forensic meteorology with container architecture feels fresh; wind-as-culprit reverses usual human-error plot. Premise is memorable, yet investigator remains archetype; deeper idiosyncrasy could push higher.</comment>
