<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s “warmly methodical” trait is vividly embodied in the tactile rope-work; her contradictory impulse—dismissal of impossibility vs. archival caution—drives every micro-choice. The moment she touches the Chain, interiority crystallizes: “warm as living skin” fuses motive and sensation. Closure renunciation (accepting archives will never be “complete”) is earned through prior因果, with visible cost in tingling fingers. Only minus: no second character on-page, so status/relationship bullets N/A—cap 8.4.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: seal anomaly → folio → tower → hidden door → rope → re-braid → history healed. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) nailed by word 80; no drift. Closure is Conceptual Repricing: the midnight chime adds a beat that reweights 300 years of scholarship—undeniable social cost. Persistent constraint: the vanished door and altered maintenance logs prove price survives the scene.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Clock-tower mechanism room functions as micro-setting: brass gears and cold exhalation constrain her path choices; the rope itself becomes hybrid tool/setting whose braid-tension records timelines. Spatial choreography is immaculate—panel reveal, narrow passage, suspended rope—tracked without drift. Final image (new chime beat) recharges the opening “fable of absence.” Missing 9.0 only because broader campus geography is implied, not tactile.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore aborted timeline—signaled at seal discovery. One meaningful tightening: re-weaving the phantom thread physically forecloses the “safe observer” stance; cost = altered institutional memory. Agency is continuous—every archival step narrows options until the braid-merge. Coincidence (door appears) complicates, does not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: archival negative space as living history. Subtext woven into rope fibers—each twist = unmade decision—avoids thesis statement. Final image (new chime beat) offers resonant non-literal answer: completeness is unattainable, clarity is possible. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers via “sonic ghost now given voice.”</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elara’s perceptual signature—spectroscopic analysis, cataloging contradictions—without head-hop. Diction (“semantic bomb where the wires were stories”) is character-specific archivist idiom. Rhythm accelerates during braid-work, mirrored by stuttering gears. No dialogue, so voice purity intact.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; sentences vary in length and opening. High density: “fable of absence, a story told by what was missing” does triple thematic/orienting/emotional work. Metaphors (starlight fiber, submarine precision) stay consistent to clock/sea idiom. No figurative muddle in peak braid-beat; tactile verbs drive momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: archival cataloging as surgical time-repair via ceremonial rope DNA. Risk—temporal mechanics without exposition—paid off by causal clarity. Transformation test fails if names/places swapped; rope-braid logic is inseparable from university mythology. Specific detail (1643 wax, 1809 bricked door) anchors originality.</comment>
