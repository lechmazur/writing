<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the scar-mapping, root-binding, and palm-takeover of the clipping dramatize her contradictory impulses in scene. The final stance—she will plant herself as threshold—carries visible cost (palms threaded silver, ancestral wounds re-opened) and is causally seeded by the maze visions. Secondary pressure is absent (no on-page character to spar with) but her internal crucible is strong enough for this length. Voice stays particular, never drifting into therapy-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the clipping roots in her palm, re-weighting the covenant from burden to living garden. Causal linkage holds: maze topiary → scar-link ritual → ancestral memory → self-as-crossing. Orientation anchors who/where/when by line 3; no penalty. One meaningful tightening—roots pulsing beneath ancestral scars—narrows options to “become the intersection.” Cost is legible in the final image; lens is Causal throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Cobalt glade, dusk light, mirrored maze, and scarred ground are sharply sensory and filtered through Elara’s visionary bias. The topiary clipping micro-setting constrains every beat—warm leaf, spiral memory, palm-root fusion—and delivers the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography inside the maze is coherent; no floating bodies. Weather and light evolve with the eclipse beat, guiding her final dawn choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“find the intersection of dreams before next dawn”—is signaled early and tightens when ancestral root-network forces her to occupy that intersection herself. One visible price: lifeline scar re-inscribed by silver tendrils, foreclosing retreat. Escalation is causal: each scar-touch narrows option space until only embodiment remains. Slight deduction for abstract phrasing of “dream intersection” that never crystallizes into concrete peril beyond metaphor.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: covenant as living reciprocity vs. ancestral enclosure. The shifting maze image reweights from childhood trap to future threshold without authorial statement. Final image offers resonant non-moral: garden must grow wild, not walled. Avoids sermon; complexity remains in the ancestral collage of regret.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Voice is lush yet disciplined—syntax coils like hedge-maze, diction stays within visionary lexicon (“dreamstuff,” “starlight and regret”). Perceptual signature is consistent: Elara notices patterns, warmth in leaves, eclipse shadows. No dialogue to test, yet internal rhythm modulates from anxious flutter to clarion certainty. Filter verbs minimal and motivated; no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentence openings rotate across sensory and metaphoric beats. High information density—“leaves still warm with captured sunlight” does triple sensory, symbolic, causal work. Zero paraphrase loops; no mixed metaphors. Occasional elevated diction (“constellations yet unmapped”) fits POV ambition. Final line lands clean, recharging “root and branch, scar and dream.”</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: eclipse-as-hidden-covenant + topiary-as-memory-implant + scar-as-portal network feels inevitable yet uncliched. Risk of lyric maze-collage pays off by making ancestor faces the price of visionary lineage. Specificity of “cobalt glade bruised purple” anchors cosmic stakes in local color. Not derivatively fantasy-template; the garden is obligation, not wonderland.</comment>
