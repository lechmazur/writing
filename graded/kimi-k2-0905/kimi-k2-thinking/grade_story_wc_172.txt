<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Vesper’s contradictory impulses—ruthless drought-engineer vs. relic-hoarding sentimentalist—are dramatized in the single gesture of smashing the egg; the cost (guilt-ghost echo) is felt, but interiority occasionally drifts into label-speak (“amoral truth gnawed”) rather than embodied contradiction, keeping him just short of 9-band integration.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each return to the cracking salt map deepens the stake until the egg-release becomes the decisive pattern-break that reweights preservation against destruction; closure lands as Charged Poise with undeniable conceptual cost. The manufactured drought’s upstream causality is asserted, not witnessed, a minor ellipsis that keeps the score just below 9.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The salt flat’s crystalline crust, resonant hollow, and mirror-fissure map are not backdrop but instruments: they guide Vesper’s steps, amplify the single note, and ultimately record the ghost-echo. Micro-setting (egg glass, condensed breath) constrains the final gesture; weather evolves from lull to deluge, erasing the map yet fixing the sound—an 8.9 for environment-as-apparatus.</comment>

<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—can a lost song be bought with a stolen river?—tightens once: the map converges, the egg falls, option to undo drought is foreclosed. Escalation is accretive rather than causal-reversal, but the audible cost (thin pure note against vanished villages) makes the trade-off visceral; lacks a second tightening beat that would push into 8.8+ territory.</comment>

<comment>Theme emerges as the price of preservation through destruction: every image of fracture (mud, egg, conscience) reweights the same moral equation. Final museum speaker recycles the note into eternal souvenir, crystallizing the paradox without sermon. Subtext stays in gesture—finger tracing wing-shape—keeping resonance taut; a hair more specificity on displaced villagers would clinch 9.0.</comment>

<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric maintains atmospheric distance yet filters every perception through Vesper’s ruthless-sentimental bias: “fractured grace,” “bruised sky,” “echo of extinct birds” repeat with pattern-taught cadence that climaxes in the single cracked note. No head-hop; diction stays elevated but within a collector-aesthete’s lexicon. Rhythm breathes with thunder lulls, propelling the final release.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Line-level craft is spare yet sonically tuned: varied sentence openings, no scaffold loops, metaphors (mirror salt, bruised sky) coherent and brief. Information density high—each sentence advances image or stake. One mixed vehicle (“fractured grace” as both moral and geological) barely grazes clarity; otherwise impeccable, read-aloud fluent, closure image pristine.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses eco-crime with sound-archaeology in a way that feels inevitable yet fresh; the salt-crack map as phonograph groove is a specific, non-obvious invention. Risk taken in lyric repetition pays off in closing note. Could push 9+ with sharper ethnographic residue of the drowned village, but the fusion of drought, egg, and echo is already memorable.</comment>
