<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lyra’s pacifist reflex is vivid in micro-gestures (sheathing the knife, tea ritual), and her perceptual gift is shown, not told. The father-shadow supplies credible interior conflict, but the stranger beat is too polite—his departure note is a soft reset that costs her nothing. Earned stasis lands, yet the emotional plateau feels slightly tidy.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: each rose row, artifact, and storm gust thickens the same stake—quiet continuity. Closure is a charged poise: the disc and sandbag counterweight crystallize her chosen stasis. The stranger exit is micro-turn, not decisive change, so cost is conceptual, not visceral; still legible under lyric mode.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dome filters, sand-scrape on glass, rose petals “thick like parchment” supply tactile micro-setting that constrains every choice. Temperature, scent, and light are braided into action—no postcard lapses. Final altar tableau re-uses both relics as spatial anchor, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve peace inside the dome—tightens twice: stranger intrusion and storm. Both escalate through sensory density, not external reversals. Agency is caretaking endurance; price is vigilance fatigue, but the lack of a live trade-off keeps tension lyrical rather than visceral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from pattern: objects meant for violence (sandbag, disc) re-purposed for cultivation. No moral is stated; the final image of counterweighted relics re-prices “quiet” as a cultivated artifact. Roses absorb the lesson, letting motif echo without sermon.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lyric third-person hovers at poetic distance yet stays anchored to Lyra’s perceptual filter—“petals thick like parchment,” “quiet seemed to hum.” Rhythm modulates between long breathy clauses and clipped horticultural actions. No head-hop; voice is consistent, compressed, and teaches its pattern early.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Almost every sentence doubles duty—image + pressure: “she used the sandbag scrap as a counterweight to clear them.” No scaffold loops; metaphors stay physical. A single purple phrase—“perfume a quiet fire”—is earned by prior temperature imagery. Read-aloud rhythm is deliberate, varied.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Pacifist botanist daughter of bounty hunter is fresh angle; ballast scrap transformed into greenhouse counterweight is specific repurposing. “Inculcating plants with values” risks gimmick but stays grounded in tactile labor. Risk is moderate; freshness comes from synthesis, not shock.</comment>
