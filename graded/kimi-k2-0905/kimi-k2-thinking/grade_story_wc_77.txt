<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Mira’s interior contradiction—clutch pain to stay present while courting the very fear she must interrogate—plays out in concrete beats. The clasp-bite and forward drag of her feet embody the hierarchy: witness > scream. Final renunciation (“You are the only one who returned”) is earned because every micro-choice has rehearsed the stance of survivor-not-victim. Minor slip: “trauma-induced synesthesia” is diagnostic label-speak mid-crisis, nudging down.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each beat (photo → carnival → mirror confrontation → question to fear) tightens because/therefore links. Closure is a Decisive Change: fear’s rule-set is publicly re-priced when the entities confess their limit. Cost is visible—the clasp light dies, mirrors crack, advisor silenced—so path is foreclosed. Orientation clean by word 80; no teleporting props.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Funhouse is rendered through tactile decay—peeling plywood grin, filthy glass—while the pearl’s pulsing micro-setting acts as portable environment that constrains choice (release it = lose weapon). Corrupted gold footprints and smoke-faces supply selective sensory hierarchy keyed to Mira’s gift. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from entrance to center to exit. Weather limited to “bruised twilight,” sufficient for length.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—turn fear’s amplification back on itself—signaled in attic and escalated by converging footprints and mirror screams. One meaningful tightening: forced question “What frightens you?” narrows options from flight to interrogation. Price legible—clasp extinguished, advisor gone—so tactics must change thereafter. No off-stage rescue; escalation is protagonist-driven.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of survivor-as-unintelligible-to-fear emerges through image chain (second heartbeat, pearl of possible screams, empty photo) rather than statement. Final paradox reweights earlier dream notes, giving conceptual cost: witness language is now hers alone. No moralizing; resonance lingers in cracked mirrors. Ambiguity remains whether luminance is gift or curse, enriching reread.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature filters every surface through oily/residue optics. Syntax tightens under stress—“She raised the clasp high, and its pearl erupted”—mirroring urgency. Advisor’s riddles carry distinct diction without invading Mira’s interior. No head-hopping; voice modulation purposeful.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sentences carry double duty (action + sensory filter) with varied rhythm; no template cadence runs. Figurative language disciplined—one metaphor per beat, paid off (oil, smoke, glass). Minor scaffold: “flickering entities that filled the corridor” could compress, but does not obscure causality. Opening and closing lines bookend with propulsive clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Reversing haunt logic—fear feeds on the living, yet is terrified of the revived—feels fresh and inevitable. Carnival funhouse is familiar, but photographically cursed mirrors that exhale specific phobias particularizes it. Dream-dictionary paradox mechanic avoids generic spell trope by tying rules to grandmother’s marginalia. Risk in second-death premise pays off through coherent world logic.</comment>
