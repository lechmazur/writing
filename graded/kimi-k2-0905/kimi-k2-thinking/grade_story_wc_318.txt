<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Eleanor’s spectral grief and “mournfully eager” interiority remain concrete—her pull-cord grip warms, wind thrums through absent lungs—so embodied emotion and contradictory impulse stay on the page. Micro-choices (ease grip, gentle final yank) visibly calibrate risk to Sarah’s sanity, enacting her hierarchy of values at cost of self-dissolution. Interior contradiction stays live: she both craves reunion and accepts erasure. Flaw complicity absent: the piece never lets her test or confront limits of ghost agency, so growth plateaus slightly.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Anchor (who/where/when) appears by line 3; orientation is clean. Accumulative lens holds: each cord-yank thickens sonic texture, re-weighting grief’s silence until laughter finally cracks upstairs; closure is the charged hush that follows, felt cost legible as Eleanor thins. Causal logic accepted under after-life conceit; pattern taught early (cord + tunnel = wind music). Minor slack: absence of stakes test for “too-much wind” risk keeps closure shy of 8+.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The echo-chamber tunnel functions as micro-setting that literally multiplies sound, enabling every tactic; concrete damp, recoil vibration, off-kecho kazoo timbre are filtered through Eleanor’s conductor ear. Sensory choice stays urgent—what the tunnel turns into music dictates next yank intensity—so environment constrains choices and charges the final image (silence that now breathes). Spatial choreography is tight; no geography drift. World rule (dead can tug sound from cord) established early and stays consistent.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore laughter—signalled in paragraph one. Escalation is textural: each louder, warmer gust macerates silence calcifying around Sarah’s heart until laughter audibly fractures it; price is Eleanor’s accelerating fade. Agency is present but single-note (yank/soften); no second reversal. Coincidence does not resolve, meeting situational lens. Could edge higher if ghost risked definitive self-expenditure rather than gradual thinning.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: grief can be permeated, not removed; music of remembered ridiculous love opens breathing room for mourning. Subtext carried in gesture—ease of grip, warmth of handle—never moralizes. Final silence charged with possibility reweights earlier lullaby fragments without stating lesson. Ambiguity stays fruitful: household will ache again, but now air circulates. No abstract thesis paragraph; avoids sentimental uplift.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited ghost POV is stable; diction stays within a yard-conductor’s lexicon (“stuttering machine,” “broken kazoo choir”). Rhythm lengthens during wind swells, contracts in whisper releases, mirroring breath the dead no longer need. Perceptual signature vivid: sound as color, wind as dental drill or lullaby. No head-hop; filter verbs (“felt,” “heard”) justified by incorporeal state. Dialogue absent—appropriate, no penalty.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Highly figurative but patterned early (“choir of broken kazoos”) so read as taught, not clutter. Information density high: one sentence often does memory + sensation + choice. Few filter stacks; occasional adjective coupling (“mournfully eager,” “weightless shush”) yet compressed. One paraphrase loop: “macerate ... hard silence ... calcified” ideas repeat across two adjacent sentences; small drag. No mixed metaphor; closure sentence clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: ghost-as-leaf-blower-conductor converting grief into off-key wind symphony is non-obvious and specific to this voice. Risk of preciousness is acknowledged and grounded via tactile handle heat, broken crockery crash, real sibling phone call. Tropes (melancholic ghost, haunted tunnel) are re-cast through sonic prankster lens. Emotional truth > surface novelty; image of wind softening to tender hush lingers. Transformation test passes—plot collapses without conductor motif.</comment>
