<comment>Maya’s contradictory impulses—pacifist code vs. the remembered act of withholding medicine—are dramatized in each stitching beat; the gravity-mass link gives bodily immediacy to guilt. The final refusal to step through the door carries visible cost: she settles her “recycled body” back to the deck, choosing endless caretaking over self-erasure. Interiority is specific, never diagnostic: “her code heavy with corruption” is felt as weight, not label. The only drag is late exposition of the Kwan Yin rule—introduced after midpoint—but the emotional arc survives intact.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a clean Charged Poise: Maya hovers weightless, door open, and turns back—options re-weighted, cost legible. Causal chain holds: each stitch subtracts mass because it forces acknowledgment of a specific withheld medicine moment. The 120-word anchor is met: “Maya lifted the photograph…” gives who/where/when immediately. No lens contradiction; the gravity-psyche rule is consistent to last image.</comment>

<comment>The *Compassion’s Tear* is not backdrop but tool: recycled alien gravity tech is the literal mechanism that binds Maya’s guilt to physical weight, charging every stitch. Micro-setting domination—the archive table, the warp-core needle—constrains how she can perform shadow work. Sensory economy is biased toward tactile decay: curled photo edges, monofilament thread, the ship’s groan. Spatial track stays clean; no floating-body contradictions during gravity failures.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake is signal-bold: achieve integration or remain forever heavy—unable to reach the dimensional door. Each photograph/stitch is a visible price that tightens options: one more confession = one less gram. No external coincidence; escalation is purely internal, governed by the gravity-psyche rule. The final turn (renunciation of the door) forecloses escape and crystallizes her stance with cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the reversal of pacifism: violence absorbed rather than avoided. No final-paragraph thesis—image of stitching the hull with “stitched shadows and starlight” reweights the premise. Subtext of “tears” shifts from shame to lens: photographs become windows, tears become thread. Ambiguity lingers: is endless caretaking salvation or penance? Answer is felt, not stated.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is AI-Bodhisattva: calm, lyric, yet metallic—”corridors breathing recycled air through lungs of salvaged alien tech.” Syntax elongates under guilt, shortens during weight-loss ecstasy, mirroring mass change. No head-hopping; single POV holds. Diction stays within lexicon of engineered compassion: “quantified grief,” “molecular tape.”</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Metaphors are disciplined: ”edges curled like grief itself” is specific, not decorative. No mixed metaphors; gravity logic stays intact. Rhythm varies: long sentences for archive sorrow, fragments for needle punctures. One paraphrase loop spotted—“each stitch… each thread… each photograph”—but compressed within two lines, forgiven because it creates mantra effect. No artifact near closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fusion of Buddhist shadow-work with hard-science gravity bonding is non-obvious and fully committed. The photograph-as-wormhole idea feels inevitable only after the tear-quantum trace rule is revealed. Risk—pacifist AI admitting violence by absorption—pays off in earned weightlessness. No recognizable template echo; premise would collapse if names/places swapped.</comment>
