<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her fingers “mapping each wire as constellation memory” and “spatially imaginative mind” seeing molecular structure—so interior contradiction is alive. The final transfer of stored love into her body is a renunciation that costs her silence and solitude, earned by the psychometry beats. No second character on page, so relationship bullets N/A; headcount stays within default. Micro-choices (suspending strip, hand on tank) reveal value hierarchy and foreclose demolition-era escape.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: Mira carries the theatre’s archived love as silver-nitrate skin map—cost is irreversible silence and bodily tenancy. Causal linkage holds: because she incubates the strip in amber bath, therefore the letters dissolve into transferable geometries; because she accepts the map, therefore the building’s soul migrates. Orientation anchors (Rialto, final week, projection booth) arrive within first 120 words; no penalty. Lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of unused love reweights the stake until the map tattoos her—and holds without contradiction to last line.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Projection booth, deco molding angles, and squeak of Maltese cross are specific, tactile, and filtered through Mira’s spatial bias; environment literally stores love in corners and armrest gaps, constraining her tactics. Sensory spread (hot metal, amber sludge, torch-song echo) is selective and purposeful, never stalls momentum. Micro-setting qualifies: the two-inch gap between seats G12–G13 functions as love-container and shapes her discovery. Meets 9+ gate: the booth’s 90° corner physically hosts the neutron-dense love that is transferred to her skin at closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—recover unseen love before demolition—signalled on page 1. One meaningful tightening: the film dissolves into silver dust that maps storage nodes, foreclosing passive observation and forcing her to accept bodily tenancy. Escalation is textural: density of unspoken letters accumulates until it reweights her biological frame. Cost is legible—she weeps, walks silent, “charged, complete”—but price is metaphysical rather than tangible loss, keeping it just shy of 8.8+ band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: unexpressed love doesn’t vanish, it archives itself into architecture until a compatible reader appears. Subtext operates through spatial metaphor—love nests in 90° corners and armrest no-man’s-land—never articulated as thesis. Final image reweights premise: the map under her skin is the theatre’s quiet answer to demolition, a conceptual repricing that makes the building’s soul portable. No sermonizing; goodbye letters stay implicit, resonant.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is distinct: compressed, lyric, syntactically fractured to mimic Mira’s synaptic mapping—e.g., “celluloid ghosts,” “neutron star matter.” Perceptual signature is spatial-geometric; she sees “molecular structure still humming,” a crystal gazer’s idiom maintained without head-hop. Rhythm accelerates under revelation (“Hushed thunder of revelation built…”) then settles into final cadence, mirroring incubation arc. No dialogue, so dialogue bullets N/A; narrative diction stays within her plausible lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty: “Theater below played final week—empty seats, hollow music” fuses setting, stakes, tone. Figurative density is high but patterned—film-snake, love-star, map-skin—taught early and paid off at closure; no mixed metaphors. Filter verbs are minimal; when used (“she felt unused love accumulate”) they serve psychometry frame. Minor scaffold: “forgotten lyrics searched tune” phrase repeats twice; cycles are adjacent but serve accumulative cadence, so −0.2 only.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Premise—movie palace as love-archive that can be psychometrically migrated—is fresh, non-obvious, and commits fully to magical logic. Transformation test fails if Mira is swapped out: only a spatially-visionary crystal gazer could read building angles as love-containers. Risky lyric compression and 90-year incubation timeline pay off in resonant reconfiguration rather than gimmick. Specificity: “Maltese cross movement” frequency, amber sludge molecular hum—details not transferable to another venue.</comment>
