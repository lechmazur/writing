<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elias’s contradictory impulses—clinging to the meteorite yet letting pigeons carry pieces of himself—are dramatized in embodied beats (palming the stone, balancing on the beam). The ledger rewriting is motive, not label, and his final smile shows earned renunciation with visible cost: he closes the book, forecloses invented pasts, and trusts birds instead of paper.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: dust-mote pattern teaches early, tightens through meteorite warmth and ledger closure; final “new pattern bloomed” is Conceptual Repricing that reweights trust from paper to sky. Cost is legible—he abandons the ledger, his only relic of control—so Earned Stasis satisfies closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Skylight beam and dust function as micro-setting that constrains every tactical choice: balance, mapping, release. Meteorite chip is handled in three distinct states (warm, sealed, glowing), charging the final image. Spatial choreography is flawless—beam, pigeon shadow, floorboards track cleanly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve the echo—tightens when each pigeon flight forfeits paper control; meteorite warmth and dust mapping are visible prices. One meaningful deepening: closing the ledger forecloses retreat to invented pasts. Agency remains Elias’s throughout; coincidence absent.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulate versus flight: paper trails fixed, pigeons mobile. Dust-mote constellations reconfigure at closure, answering “how to keep an echo” with trust in motion rather than archive. No moralizing; resonance is imagistic, non-literal.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyric compression taught in first paragraph—“sunlight sliced,” “column of swirling dust”—and sustained: syntax mirrors tightrope breathlessness. Perceptual signature is bird-trainer precise (counting motes, wings “soft shout”), no head-hop. Final whispered lyric modulates without register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Rhythm accelerates with pigeon releases, then settles into longer cadence at ledger close. No loops or scaffold; every sentence layers job—advance image, deepen motif, tighten stakes. Figurative control peak at “dust map like a question” without mixed metaphor.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fusion of Mars fragment, pigeon courier, and dust-mote cartography is non-obvious yet inevitable. Risk—lyric mosaic instead of causal plot—pays off via coherent closure. Fresh inflection: meteorite as portable star guiding terrestrial map; could not swap elements without breaking logic.</comment>
