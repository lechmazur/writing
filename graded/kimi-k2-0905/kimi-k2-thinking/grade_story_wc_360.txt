<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Cassian’s interior contradiction—analytical coldness vs. the euphoric wave that “threatened to drown his calculations”—is dramatized in scene, not labeled. The borrowed personalities act as conflicting impulses that alter his micro-choices (ink bleed, notebook entry), and the final renunciation—“still uncertain, still searching”—carries visible cost in the spent halo fragment and vanished stars. The only drag is a touch of diagnostic shorthand (“the mathematics of emotion”) that slightly flattens peak embodiment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the equation in the notebook is crossed out and replaced by a living flux, a reweighting of the entire premise with undeniable conceptual cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density increases via star extinction and fragment decay until the final image crystallizes options. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“topaz workshop”) and the pattern of vanishing stars pays off in the last line. Cost is legible in the spent fragment, the blank sky, and the self-confessed failure of linear emotion.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The topaz walls and halo fragment function as micro-setting: their pulsing light and copper shadows constrain Cassian’s choices—he times each print to the fragment’s heartbeat and stops when it dims. Star extinction is not mere atmosphere; it mirrors the fragment’s decay and charges the final darkness with conceptual cost. Spatial choreography stays clean: press, bench, vellum, notebook track across beats without drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can empathy be algebraically extracted and transferred—tightens when the fragment’s fracture makes reversal imminent. Escalation is textural: each printed sheet depletes the fragment and erases a star, narrowing options until the final “Empathy = DeltaSelf / DeltaOther” admits bidirectional flux. Cost is visible in the spent fragment, the poet’s stolen euphoria returning to leave Cassian hollow, and the sky’s total blackout that forecloses further prints.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the concrete failure of the equation: the final notebook line is not stated but lived—Cassian’s reeducated stance that emotion is a living flux. The topaz glow lingering in darkness reweights earlier images without moralizing. Ambiguity is purposeful: the reader is left to decide whether the experiment’s ruin is tragedy or revelation, yet the cost is undeniable.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is a controlled lyric cadence—long, luminous sentences that mirror press strokes and star-fade. Diction stays within Cassian’s artisan lexicon (“ glyphs,” “damped oscillation”) without academic drift. Compression tightens under pressure: clauses shorten as the fragment dies, rhythm echoing faltering heartbeat. No head-hopping; perceptual signature remains singular and paid off in the final “matrix of light and shadow.”</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Sentences do triple duty: “The halo fragment flickered, its light now fractured, projecting a mosaic of shadows onto the ceiling” advances story, embodies emotion, and foreshadows closure. Figurative control holds—no mixed metaphors; star-death and fragment-death stay physically coherent. Zero paraphrase loops; each line adds new visual or conceptual information. Final line is clean, propulsive, and charges the initiating image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Premise—emotions as printable, solvable equations—is non-obvious and pursued to its ruinous implication. The halo fragment’s bidirectional leakage feels inevitable in hindsight yet fresh in execution. Risky lyric density pays off: the vanishing stars are not decoration but the tightening clock that forces the final conceptual repricing. Specificity of letterpress mechanics and notebook calculus anchors the speculative frame in lived craft.</comment>
