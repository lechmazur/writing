<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The vendor’s renunciation of her own incision is credible and carries cost, but her interiority is largely abstract (“mindfully scattered,” “deliberately scattered”) rather than embodied. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in scene; the woman customer is a passive recipient, so relationship-as-crucible is absent. Micro-choices are reported, not staged, keeping pressure at arm’s length.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the vendor’s self-exile in “radiantly empty” threshold space reconfigures meaning with felt cost. Accumulative/textural lens holds: pattern of incisions → harvested silence → vendor’s own withheld incision. Orientation is taught early by floating library and bottled moonlight; no causality breaks. One meaningful tightening: the vendor bottles silence for herself, sealing her perpetual outsider stance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Glass orchard library and bottled moonlight are vivid, selective, and return to charge the final image (“bottled another fraction of moonlight”). Spatial choreography is clean: customer enters, light pools, books rustle, vendor remains behind counter. Environment constrains the vendor’s final choice—she cannot drink her own product without dissolving her role—meeting 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“find the place where stories begin”—is signaled early and deepens when the vendor quantifies absence to map origins. Escalation under Accumulative lens: each incision intensifies the library’s archive of unwritten stories, narrowing the vendor’s options until she refuses her own incision, paying the price of perpetual exile. Cost is legible on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme—stories begin in engineered silence—emerges through iterated incisions and the vendor’s final refusal, not exposition. Subtext in “glimmering parole” reframes erasure as liberation; final image of “lantern above the sleeping world” reweights prior material without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers: is unwriting a gift or violence? No thematic echo violations.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lyric third-person hovers at vendor’s shoulder, perceptual signature attuned to light, glass, and negative space. Patterned elision (“mindfully scattered,” “integrated fragmentation”) is taught by line 3 and paid off in final self-scattering. Rhythm modulates with pressure: long breathless sentences during incisions, clipped fragments at dusk. No head-hopping; diction stays within poetic fabulist register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry triple duty—image, concept, cadence—without scaffold. Figurative layering (“stars like puncture wounds”) is sparse and purposeful, never congesting high-pressure beats. Zero paraphrase loops; each mention of moonlight reweights meaning. Final line’s “anchored only by the void it filled” lands clean, propelling closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Floating library that unwrites narratives via bottled moonlight feels inevitable yet unseen; synthesis of erasure-as-origin is non-obvious. Risk in “integrated fragmentation” pattern pays off: formal scattering mirrors theme without gimmickry. Specific detail—“seventeen bottles, each half-full of harvested silence”—anchors abstraction in tactile reality. Transformation test fails if relocated: setting and object are inextricable from stakes.</comment>
