<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The lore-keeper’s interiority is atmospheric (“wisely adventurous” is label-speak) yet her final renunciation is felt: she gives up the throne and her chronoshawl dissolves. Contradictory impulses appear only in summary (“she paused, wisely adventurous to the last”) rather than dramatized tension under pressure. Embodied emotion is thin; the ruby flake’s pulse stands in for her own heartbeat. Cost is visible—her empty palm, dissolving shawl—but arrives more as elegiac image than character-specific wound.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: placing the ruby rewrites the orchard, the murals, and the throne’s status. Causality is elliptical (Accumulative/Textural lens) yet coherent—each peeled mural tightens the mental map and the sunrise clock supplies cost. Orientation is secured by ~120 words (acid rain, nano-tube, lunar citadel). One minor causality gap: the stairway “requires downward passage” rule is told, not dramatized, but the final image retrofits it as test, not loophole.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Selective, POV-filtered detail—“nano-tube transitway,” “compressed starlight steps”—grounds the surreal world without exposition dump. The orchard and observatory function as micro-settings that constrain final action: fruit falls, dome peels, murals shift. Spatial choreography is clean across the waterfall crossing and stair descent. Weather (acid rain, sunrise light) affects attire and tempo; sensory triangulation is mostly visual but moonlight spectra and static-charge tingle widen the palette.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: ready the throne before sunrise. Clock is explicit, tightening choices; “three hours until sunrise” is repeated but still bites. Escalation is textural—each mural deepens knowledge rather than narrows external options. Agency is present (descend, place flake, ascend) yet the peak decision is renunciation, not confrontation; cost is conceptual (she midwifes tomorrow, forfeits crown) rather than viscerally felt on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through recurrence of memory, stewardship, and renewal: murals, orchard fruit, ruby shards all reprice the imperial narrative from collapse to return. No overt moralizing; final image of “a child born under the double moons” invites future without prescribing it. Subtext is carried by objects more than dialogue or gesture. Emotional aftereffect is quiet awe rather than catharsis—appropriate to elegiac mode but stops short of deeper moral complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric voice sustains a consistent cadence—sentence lengths vary, clause stacks create forward tilt (“fractured dome…fractured spectra”). Diction stays within plausible lexicon for a lore-keeper (“chronoshawl,” “resonance blade”) yet avoids overwrought neologisms. Zero dialogue; no voice convergence issue. Filter verbs minimal; perception is concrete (“her bootsteps echoing”). Final line achieves Charged Poise: “Until sunrise came again” crystallizes cycle without exposition.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</question><comment>Strong information density: one sentence often layers world-fact, motion, and metaphor (“compressed starlight, each riser humming with stored data”). Metaphors are mixed but consistent with POV—kaleidoscopic waterfall, metallic flower dome—never break physics. Minor scaffold: “peel of paint layers” is repeated verbatim three times; register remains controlled. No paraphrase loops, no simultaneity errors; opening and closing lines are crisp, propulsive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Familiar tropes—fallen empire, hidden orchard, unclaimed throne—are re-framed through archival archaeology and stewardship rather than conquest. Specificity of mural-peeling as navigation method freshes the quest structure. Risk is moderate: elliptical causality and lyric accumulation over overt showdown. Emotional specificity (lore-keeper as midwife, not monarch) prevents template drift. No close echoes of famous scenes; transformation test passes.</comment>
