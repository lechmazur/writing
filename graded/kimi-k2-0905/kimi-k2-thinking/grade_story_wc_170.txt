<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The painter’s calm is vividly embodied (“borrowed heartbeat pulsed in time”), but her interior contradiction—yearning to coax mirrors past mere reflection—never sharpens into a visible micro-choice that costs her anything. The borrowed heartbeat motif grants texture yet behaves like a prop rather than a stake: we never feel it falter or press her tactics. Because her agency is purely ritual (sing, weave light, fade), the arc lands as graceful stasis, not earned renunciation. Still, the calm trait is specific and consistent, anchoring the middle band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure is a lyric Charged Poise: the mirrors retain a “faint glimmer,” reweighting the world’s reflective logic with conceptual cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each stanza layers prismatic color onto setting and motif until the final bell crystallizes the pattern. Causality is deliberately elliptical, but the piece teaches its lullaby-as-code rule early and pays it off in the mirrors’ shimmer; no orientation debt. The missing beat is a tangible price paid by the painter (she fades, but nothing is foreclosed for her), keeping the score just below the 9-gate.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The parapet’s prism droplets and the echoing terrace are returned to throughout, each re-description tightening the painter’s canvas; the final fading prism is the charged image. Micro-setting—stone veins, moss-softened floor—constrains her barefoot grace and channels the lullaby’s vibration. Weather remains causal: rain → droplets → prism → code medium. Spatial choreography is clean; no floating bodies. For 9-band, needed one tactile tool-prop whose loss or alteration stung the ending.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—coaxing mirrors beyond reflection—is signaled early and escalates through chromatic intensification under the Accumulative lens; the final shimmer reweights the stakes successfully. Yet pressure is ambient, not adversarial: no mirror resists, no heartbeat surge endangers the ritual, no clock-cost forces a trade-off. The bells arrive as external cadence, not consequence. Escalation is aesthetic, not tactical; cost is observably conceptual rather than felt, capping entry to the 8-band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges as the quiet subversion of passive reflection: the city’s mirrors briefly become generative, not merely mimetic. The lullaby code refracts childhood innocence into insurgent artistry, a subtle CR that reweights innocence as subversion. No moral is stated; the children’s unwitting chorus carries the code onward, a resonant non-literal coda. Ambiguity lingers—was she ghost, dream, or metaphor—without confusion, inviting re-reading.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person lyric achieves a consistent dusky cadence; long vowel-rich sentences mirror the lullaby’s hum without monotony. Perceptual signature is painterly—light trails, color eddies—anchoring POV inside an artist’s retina rather than omniscient canopy. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk is waived. Filter verbs are minimal; metaphor vehicles stay within optic physics (droplets, prisms, glimmers), preventing purple drift. Rhythm breathes with bell-cycles, accelerating just before each toll, a sophisticated control that nudges the 9-threshold.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm is musical; sentence openings vary across “She / The / Colors / Mirrors” to avoid template cadence. Figurative density is high but patterned (prism, heartbeat, echo) and paid off at closure; no coherence break. Occasional near-loop: “borrowed heartbeat pulsed… echoing terrace caught… air itself seemed to hum” share consonant echoes, but each adds sensory layer, not paraphrase. One pronoun slip: “the painter felt the borrowed heartbeat quicken” right after “heartbeat pulsed in time”—temporal simultaneity risk but readable; not closure-touching.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fusion of lullaby-as-hacking-code with rain-prism optics feels fresh and inevitable; no close literary echo. Children’s song carrying latent insurgent instructions transforms a pastoral trope into quiet resistance. Mirrors as slumbering agents that must be sung awake refracts standard mirror symbolism without retreating into allegory. Risk—lyric repetition, abstract stakes—heightens coherence rather than gimmickry. Could edge higher if the painter’s personal cost were sharpened, but within-band excellence is clear.</comment>
