<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Kaelin’s interiority is textured through bodily tremor, ink crystallising under stress, and childhood superstition re-purposed as grounding ritual; scars-to-stories motive threads every micro-choice, culminating in visible tear-offering that crystallises into luminous rune. Contradictory impulses—terror of reopening pain vs need to speak it—stay active in-scene, not summarised. Final renunciation of fear is earned: each crystal records a released memory, so stepping onto drifting rock feels like foreclosed path with cost already paid. Slight over-reliance on “felt” as filter keeps it from 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: shimmering ink-fractures tighten the stake iteratively until the rune glows, a visible repricing of grief. Orientation anchored by second paragraph; no teleporting props. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration—crystalline story-beacon reweights her past and future in one image; tear mingling with ink is the undeniable cost. Micro-turn (ink refuses line, then accepts tear) is the single required tightening. Could edge 9.0 if final rock-drift carried a persistent constraint beyond metaphor.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Floating rock, tea-stone, stormberry ink, and crow feather are not postcard décor: each constrains action—ink chemistry halts progress, platform’s polish resists mark until tear softens surface. Sensory hierarchy (hush so thick it “hums,” ink catching dim light) mirrors internal saturation. Spatial choreography clean: quill, vial, pouch tracked without drift. Object states evolve (liquid → crystal → glow), charging final image. Meets 9+ gate: the crystalline rune on tea-stone is the charged final object.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—turn scars into stories—signalled in third paragraph and escalates via ink’s refusal to flow cleanly; each crystallising shard is a visceral price that narrows options. No antagonist needed: pressure is material and emotional. Agency is renunciatory—she pays with tear, releases memories, forecloses old identity. Cost is legible on page (tear-ink fusion glow). Lacks a second tightening beat, so stays just below 8.8+ threshold.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges solely through image pattern: ink that hardens under grief → becomes literal beacon of resolved pain, enacting “scars into stories” without once moralising. Saturated hush recurs as collective breath, reweighted at closure when world “exhales” acceptance. Final smile and drifting rock offer Charged Poise—reader left holding expanded silence. No platitudes, no final thesis sentence; emotional aftereffect is concrete shimmering in pocket.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Lyric third-person hovers at intimate distance, matching scholar’s precision: “saturated hush,” “latent ink,” “library of light.” Rhythm modulates—long breath-held sentences under storm-silence, then shorter clauses as ink fractures. Crow-quill superstition is POV-bound childhood memory, not exposition. No dialogue, so voice must carry perceptual signature alone; it does. Purposeful repetition (“held her breath” twice) teaches pattern and pays off in final exhalation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density—“ink crystallized under weight of grief” does world, body, and metaphor in five words. Metaphors stay coherent (storm/cloud/ink share fluid→solid arc). Variation in sentence rhythm mirrors breath control. No register drift. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line releases with resonant image. Minor filter verbs (“seemed to pulse”) are voice-motivated, not clutter. Clean copy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Floating tea-ceremony rock as trauma-processing studio is fresh synthesis of fantasy & ritual; rune-ink chemistry grounded in berry biology gives internal logic. Youthful superstition repurposed as adult coping tool avoids nostalgia trap. Concept commits fully—no soft reset after transformation. Risky lyric compression taught early and paid off. Could push 9.0 if rune magic rules carried one more consequence beyond light-show.</comment>
