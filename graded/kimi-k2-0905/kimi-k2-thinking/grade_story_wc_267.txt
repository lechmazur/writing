<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s guilt-to-vigilance arc is embodied in every stair-climb; the bolt-in-palm micro-choice keeps self-punishment tactile. Interiority stays concrete (“nerve endings screamed”) and avoids diagnostic speak. The final renunciation—she will speak, not rejoin—costs her the choir identity she craves; causality earns the stance. Only minor lapse: Milo is referenced but never lived on-page, so the emotional halo feels second-hand.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a crisp Decisive Change: she descends to report before failure repeats. Lens is Causal: because she once stayed silent ➔ piano collapsed ➔ she is now wired to act. The bolt’s weight in pocket and the new rust spot tighten the therefore chain to an undeniable fork. Cost is legible in the final image—tools handed over, her silence finally broken in signed words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The fortress is sensed through Elara’s re-awakening nerves—cold iron, snow-light on blue stone—never tourist catalog. Micro-setting rule met: the staircase discoloration literally steers her present choice. Spatial choreography stays clean: she climbs, descends, enters study; no impossible jumps. Weather presses the windows “like a mourner’s hands,” charging the moral atmosphere without overwriting.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will she stay silent again?—is signaled by stair-discoloration echo of the original crime. One meaningful tightening: the thumbprint-sized rust spot forces an immediate now-or-never choice. Agency is pure: she could walk past (as before) but chooses descent to precentor. Cost is visible—she forfeits choir membership forever, accepting perpetual outsider vigilance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>“Unpardonable silence” is never sloganized; it emerges through catastrophe image (crushed boy, splintered piano) and final signed confession. The bolt motif recharges from shame token to repair instrument without thematic speech. Frostbitten hope lands as earned paradox: hope frozen yet alive at root, mirroring her regenerated nerves. No final-paragraph moralizing—theme stays implicit in the gesture toward tools.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person hovers at intimate distance; diction stays within Elara’s lexicon (“sacred signs,” “seraphically mundane”). Rhythm breathes with ascent/descent, tightening in the final tool-hand-over beat. No head-hopping; precentor remains opaque face, preserving her outsider stance. Filter verbs minimal; perceptions are nerve-sharp (“three shades darker”) rather than abstract.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies: long snow-mourner sentence vs clipped “She stopped. She could report it.” No scaffold loops; each sentence advances image or choice. Metaphors stay coherent (snow as mourner, bolt as relic) and don’t stack in high-pressure beat. Opening and closing lines bookend with blue/iron coldness, giving circular snap without forced symmetry.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: monastery-of-silence + nerve-regeneration thriller. Bolt-as-relic twist elevates mundane hardware to sacrament. Risk taken with almost zero dialogue; pressure carried by gesture and sensory recall. Slight familiarity in “guilt-ridden cowardice” arc keeps it from full 8.5+ originality, but specifics (signed choir, cobalt walls) prevent exchangability.</comment>
