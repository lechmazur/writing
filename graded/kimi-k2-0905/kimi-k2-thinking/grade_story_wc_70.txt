<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Mara’s involuntary honesty is dramatized in two beats—letting cars pass unpaid and blurting the riddle answer—each with visible micro-cost. The climb and honeycomb placement crystallize her value hierarchy (truth > protocol > safety) and earn the tower’s re-activation. Interiority stays concrete—“taste of nectar dusk on her tongue” anchors wonder without label-speak. Capped at 8.7 because no contradictory impulse is staged in scene; she moves from stoic to hopeful without interior friction shown.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the city doesn’t instantly relight, but the amber cascade reweights the premise—wonder becomes a harvestable current. Cost is legible in the empty lacquer box and Mara’s blunt admission “not yet” to the child, foreclosing easy triumph. Causal chain—riddle answer → honeycomb release → tower rekindling—holds without gaps. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no lens ambiguity at end.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The tower’s rusted stairs, dull copper receptors, and ambient amber emergency lights constrain every move; she must climb and place the comb physically. “Nectar dusk” reframes the sky’s color as both atmosphere and resource, charging the final image. Drone corpses and dead digital reader provide tactile evidence of collapse, never exposition. Micro-setting—the lacquer box’s weight paradox—guides her choice to open it immediately.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—restore wonder to a grid that has forgotten how to marvel—tightens when the honeycomb’s glow costs Mara her last match and her booth’s darkness. One meaningful escalation: the tower receptors drink the gentle current only after she vocalizes memory, linking personal truth to civic revival. No antagonist needed; pressure is situational and accumulative. Cost is felt, but the turnaround is slightly gentle; options narrow only in that she can’t repeat the ritual once the comb is spent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through pattern: static discharge, crystallized honey, and child’s laughter all refract wonder as renewable energy. Final line “the darkness tastes like honey now” reweights the blackout from terror to possibility without moralizing. Memory is repriced as infrastructure—an idea legible only because the tower’s physical re-activation dramatizes it. No thematic echo sentences; insight stays implicit.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays latched to Mara’s perceptual filter—“too heavy for empty, too light for anything ordinary”—delivering sensory paradox rather than abstract adjectives. Rhythm accelerates up the spiral stairs via clipped clauses, then exhales in the long final sentence that mirrors the honeyed cascade. No head-hopping; child’s voice arrives as external sound, not interiority. Diction stays within her plausible lexicon, edging lyrical only when wonder peaks.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty—description seeds causality: “ceramic spires still humming” foreshadows later re-activation. No paraphrase loops; each clause adds new sensory or causal information. Metaphor chain (honey, nectar, amber) stays coherent because it maps to one physical substance—crystallized lightning. Minor scaffold: “she struck another match, watching the flame write secrets on the air” edges purple but pays off the riddle’s earlier flame-writing, so forgiven.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Collapsing pollinator-drones into a blackout caused by existential boredom is a fresh synthesis of cli-fi and magical infrastructure. The matchbox-riddle mechanism feels inevitable because only truth-telling can unlock memory-as-power, tying character curse to world logic. Risky lyric compression—“nectar dusk light, the kind that turns ordinary wires into threads of honey”—lands without obscuring causality. Transformation test fails if swapped to generic wizard: the entire energy ecology depends on Mara’s specific honesty and the bees’ lost awe.</comment>
