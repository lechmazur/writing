<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Mara’s contradictory impulses—nostalgia vs. professional insulation—are enacted in the single beat of deciding to keep the cloth, but the interiority drifts into summary (“She wanted to discover purpose after loss”) rather than embodied contradiction at the precise moment of choice; the cost is felt yet not dramatized on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: pinning the cloth above her desk reconfigures meaning with visible cost—she forfeits pure detachment—under an Accumulative/Textural lens; causality is intact, but the beat is slightly under-escalated relative to the public failure stakes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The quarry valley and trailer interior are selectively sensed (rust, wind, echo) and filter through Mara’s sonic memory; the speaker cloth itself functions as micro-setting that constrains her final gesture, satisfying the 9+ gate for object-as-setting.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recovering self-worth after public humiliation—is signaled early; pressure tightens when the cloth forces a choice between nostalgia and detachment, but the escalation is a single micro-turn without an on-page price paid beyond the symbolic pin; barely misses the 7.0 threshold.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of repurposing echoes emerges organically from the cloth’s journey, but the final paragraph’s “every ending is a prelude” drifts toward explicit thesis-statement; the reader still feels an authentic aftereffect through the valley-as-canvas image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Third-limited voice stays coherent; perceptual signature is music-centric (echo, encore, rhythm) and syntax modulates with emotional crests; no dialogue to test subtext, but interior lyricism avoids filter-verb clutter.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, and image-dense; occasional echo-word repetition (“echo” itself) is pattern-taught and pays off, justifying the mild redundancy; no mixed metaphors or loops impair closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The ex-roadie antiques expert is fresh, yet the quarry-estate frame and phonograph-fail plot are recognizable; the speaker cloth’s repurposed encore gives a memorable inflection that lifts the score above mid-band.</comment>
