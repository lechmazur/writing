<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elena’s interior voice is poetically specific (“symphonically tuned mind”) and grief is rendered as polymer-chain imagery that re-enters later beats. The micro-choice to release the chrysalis crystallizes her hierarchy of values, but the sister remains off-stage; status/relationship crucible is therefore absent and the shift feels slightly abstract rather than interpersonal. Still, the contradictory pull between mourning and synthesis is dramatized through embodied perception of foam and river, avoiding label-speak. Cost is felt—she walks away humming—but the sister’s absence keeps the emotional price one notch below visceral.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: foam pattern → polymer insight → lab bridge; each image layer thickens meaning until the final “hummed harmonic” reweights the stake. Orientation is anchored by word 30 (“braided ravine”), well inside the 120-word window. Closure is a Charged Poise: the river’s merged ribbon reconfigures Elena’s stance and the polymer film literally sings the cost. Minor slack: the sister’s death is told more than shown, so the causal engine is the foam epiphany rather than a prior because/therefore chain; under Accumulative rules this is acceptable, but keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The ravine’s two channels and transient foam constrain both insight and metaphor; the empty chrysalis functions as micro-setting that charges the final image when released. Selective sensory hierarchy—sound of water, visual foam geometry, tactile grip on chrysalis—filters through polymer-chemist perception. Spatial choreography is clean: rim → current → downstream merge tracks without drift. Weather and topology affect choice (rapids → insight → release). Meets 9+ gate but capped at 8.3 because the urban lab coda is only sketched; environment there does not actively constrain tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“translate separation into connection”—is signaled early and re-anchored mid-scene. Pressure tightens once: foam pattern gives the polymer blueprint, foreclosing endless lab failure. Cost is visible (grief threads unwind into water, film hums) but borne by imagery more than by jeopardy or tangible loss; page-level price is legible yet mild. No second reversal, acceptable for <800 words under Accumulative track; still, the tightening is poetic rather than tactical, keeping it shy of 8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the iterative braid image: divergence → braided harmony → synthetic bridge. No explicit moral; final “symphonic embrace of all that is lost and found” is an image, not a thesis. Subtext operates through object return (chrysalis discarded, foam reclaimed) that reweights meaning without articulation. Complexity is honored—grief is not erased but woven—avoiding sentimental closure. Echo of “symphony” risks faint thematic echo, but cadence feels earned by river soundscape rather than prompt mimicry.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person lyric achieves consistent perceptual signature: polymer vocabulary refracted through water, music, and grief. Syntax lengthens and compresses with river rhythm; diction stays within a scientist-poet lexicon. No dialogue, hence no voice convergence issue. Filter verbs are minimal; when used (“she saw fleeting arabesques”) they serve POV camera. Final “hummed a tune only the river could answer” crystallizes voice without external ventriloquism. Hairline slip: “symphonically minded soul” is borderline label, but embedded early and re-cast as sensory beat, forgiven.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm is musical, mirroring subject; sentence openers vary, paragraph lengths breathe. Figurative density is high but pattern-taught (foam ≈ polymer) and pays off at closure; no mixed metaphors. One near-loop: “loosened her grip … grief begin to flow rather than constrict” borders paraphrase, but the second clause shifts to river causality, escaping scaffold penalty. No template cadence; technical terminology accurate. Closing line is crisp and propulsive. Artifacts remain below −0.3 threshold and do not touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Synthesis of polymer science, grief memoir, and river morphology feels fresh; no trope template matched. Chrysalis-as-catalyst and foam-as-blueprint invert familiar natural epiphany into materials innovation. Risk—lyric accumulative structure—heightens coherence without obscuring stakes. Specificity (PVA brush geometry, harmonic film) prevents universal swap. Only minor proximity to “river as healing” convention, but polymer frame transforms it. Lacks a second daring structural risk that would push 9.0, yet remains memorably idiosyncratic.</comment>
