<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is richly embodied—ash on palms, cedar ghost in nostrils—yet the contradictory impulses (“wants to crystallize safety / knows safety is a mirage”) are stated more than dramatized mid-scene; the final renunciation is earned but the cost feels conceptual rather than viscerally paid on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each return of the rocking chair, ash, and mask thickens the texture until the vanishing point swallows light; the closure is a Charged Poise—Elara walks out leaving the powder-coated relic—whose conceptual cost (grief accepted as illusion) lands cleanly and irreversibly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The gallery’s converging sight-lines and the mask’s broken mirrors function as micro-setting that literally constrains vision and choice; cedar scent, cold drizzle, and ash warmth are selectively filtered through Elara’s grief-biased perception, charging the final image of the façade dissolving into haze.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</question><comment>Dominant stake—capture the tremor of safety—tightens when the ash-sprinkled mask momentarily solidifies the mirage, then deepens as the gallery’s vanishing point reclaims it; protagonist agency is the deliberate act of scattering the last ash and walking away, accepting irreversible loss.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</question><comment>Theme emerges as the beauty of ungraspable safety; the mirage is not moralized but reweighted by the final image of ash mingling with rain—an earned conceptual repricing that invites reflection without stating a thesis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Third-person lyric voice sustains a charcoal-and-ash perceptual signature—burnt paper, cracked window, cedar ghost—without head-hopping; rhythmic compression (“gallery exhales,” “vanishing point swallows”) modulates under pressure, keeping psychic distance stable.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</question>
<comment>High-density lines (“each drop a tiny mirror of the gallery’s dim lights”) perform double duty; occasional soft repeats (“somber marvel” twice) dull momentum slightly but never loop in peak beats; closure image remains lucid and unmarred by scaffolding.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The porcelain-mask-as-grief-filter is a fresh inflection on the broken-mirror trope; converging gallery perspective plus scattered ash create a singular visual grammar that would collapse if swapped, though the rocking-chair lullaby drifts close to familiar nostalgia.</comment>
