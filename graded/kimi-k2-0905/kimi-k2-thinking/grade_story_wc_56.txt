<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s lone presence is vivid—palm-warmed brass, fingertip on moss—yet her interiority leans on abstract labels (“architecture of lies”) rather than contradictory impulse in the moment of lifting the latch. The earned cost is present: she trades the sundial’s guidance for a map that commits her to deeper danger, a credible renunciation. Still, the beat where she “smiled, her mind thoughtfully clear” edges into performed serenity instead of embodied tension. Competence is balanced with struggle, but the final smile feels slightly tidy for someone who just stepped into a phosphorescent trap.</comment>

<comment>Causal chain holds: sundial → shadow → arch → latch → map, each because/therefore link tightening her path. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—the map re-labels the city’s reality, undeniable social cost. Orientation is anchored by line 3; no penalty. One minor scaffold: “She recalled the day she first heard…” is told, not dramatized, slightly diluting the inciting memory’s force. Lens is consistently Causal; no ambiguity at end.</comment>

<comment>Canal, barge, moss, brass, and lantern light are filtered through Elara’s tracker-bias: she reads ripples like text. The sundial as micro-setting constrains her final move—its shadow literally points the way—satisfying 9+ gate. Twilight’s color progression mirrors her shift from amber uncertainty to violet conviction. Spatial choreography is flawless: deck → wall → chamber → back to deck, distances tracked by arm’s reach and footstep.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—“salvage truth from lies”—is signaled early and narrows to a single physical map whose ink rewrites the city. Sundial’s shadow is the visible price: she sacrifices its future use (it “lay quiet” thereafter) to gain the tunnel chart. Escalation is one-step but sufficient for 700-word scale; no false reversals. Pressure is coherent under Causal lens; luck never rescues.</comment>

<comment>Theme emerges from map-labels rewriting history—no exposition sermon. The radio-silence motif returns as “threshold between past and present,” re-weighted when she crosses it physically into the chamber. Ambiguity is preserved: we never learn who built the mosaic, keeping the city culpable but faceless. Final smile is earned stasis—she accepts endless labor ahead, a resonant refusal of easy victory.</comment>

<comment>Perceptual signature is precise: “liquid ribbon of amber and violet,” “windows dark as closed eyes.” Rhythm modulates—long sentences for drift, fragment-like repetitions for latch-click immediacy. No dialogue, so voice compression under stress appears in the staccato “She pressed the stone.” No head-hop; single POV holds. Register stays within Elara’s antiquarian lexicon; no corporate drift.</comment>

<comment>High density: “The canal’s water mirrored the fading light, a liquid ribbon of amber and violet” does three jobs (sensorial, temporal, metaphor). One mixed metaphor: “silence…pressed against her ears” is faintly physical nonsense, but forgivable at cadence peak. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances. Opening line anchors voice and quest instantly; final line “a promise” cleanly recharges sundial image.</comment>

<comment>Fresh synthesis: pocket sundial as lie-detector + radio silence as epistemic veil + canal infrastructure as palimpsest. Risk—quiet lyric escalation—pays off in the phosphorescent mosaic reveal. Transformation test fails: swap names and city still functions, but specificity of “morning-radio silence” as civic clock is memorable. No derivative premise penalty; legend-seeker trope is retooled through urban-infrastructure angle.</comment>
