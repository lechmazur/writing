<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Mara’s contradictory impulses—yearning for inspiration vs. fear of erasing the muse—play out in concrete bow-hover hesitation. Her embodied emotion (cold cello neck, pulp dissolving) and micro-choice to complete the aria renounce perpetual haunting, paying visible cost. Interiority stays specific to a musician who “traces code with her bow,” avoiding stock artist clichés. The flaw of exploitative curiosity is accepted, not balanced away, earning the ending’s solitude.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: because she finds the program → deciphers → plays the sequence → ghost departs, equilibrium breaks, and she inherits the song. Closure lands as Charged Poise: “between spaces remained, now filled with possibility rather than mourning,” reweighting meaning with undeniable conceptual cost—she forfeits haunting for uncertain artistry. Water-level imagery tracks spatially; lanterns, water, paper pulp evolve consistently. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive by line 4—no penalty.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Flooded pit, flickering lanterns, dissolving paper pulp are tactile and POV-filtered; water depth guides bow stroke height, seat numbers map cipher positions, constraining tactical choice. Sensory hierarchy narrows to touch (cold neck) and sight (ink bloom) under crisis, skipping tourist catalog. Final image of “possibility rather than mourning” reconfigures setting from mausoleum to studio. Single minor spatial slip—no impossible moves.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—complete or reject the diva’s code—tightens once: the third note forces choose-now pressure between muse-preservation and release. Disruptive playing is her agency; cost (ghost gone, program dissolved) manifests on page. Coincidence absent; escalation causal under chosen lens. One meaningful turn suffices at this length; option foreclosure clearly legible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the specific paradox of finishing another’s art by destroying her ghost; no moralizing statement required. Subtext operates in silence—bow hovering, lanterns flaring then dying—rather than exposition. Final reconfiguration reweights decay as generative, not tragic. Ambiguity lingers: is inspiration now self-sustaining or already fading? Complexity embraced.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Perceptual signature is a cellist’s: sound = touch, silence = pressure, space = score. Syntax mirrors musical phrasing—crescendo of gerunds, then abrupt fermata in “She played the last note, letting it linger until it became silence itself.” No head-hopping; psychic distance stays tight. Diction stays within musician lexicon; no corporate intrusion. Rhythm accelerates with bow strokes, breathes at rests.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>High density: “water lapped against music stands like a tide of forgotten melodies” does triple duty (sense, metaphor, theme). No loops or scaffold; sentence openings vary. One register spike—“conceptual repricing” level diction—reads earned by closure. Minor simultaneity hiccup (“She drew her bow… water began to move”) but action remains clear; no clarity break at climax.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: ghost-code as musical notation readable only via water-damaged ink, performed in a flooded pit. Stakes invert—solving the haunting means losing the muse. Specificity of cello-as-reader, paper-as-score makes trope feel inevitable. Risk of wordless narrative pays off; no close echoes detected.</comment>
