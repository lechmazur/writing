<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The undertaker’s “inadvertent stubbornness” is a vivid, embodied trait that drives every action, but interiority drifts toward label-speak (“weary in body and soul”). Micro-choices (gathering wire, offering blood) show value hierarchy, yet the climactic transformation into “librarian of the drowned” is asserted more than dramatized. Still, the refusal to abandon the dead is a credible, costly endurance that satisfies Earned Stasis.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the lens glows, the keeper’s silhouette becomes architecture, and stillness is forever deferred—cost felt in “a silence that would never quite catch them.” Causality holds: package → lens → signals → lens rebuilt → eternal sentence. The library’s paradoxical topology is taught early and pays off in the final image. One minor lapse: “they told themselves they would leave” is interior summary just before the decisive rebuild; a micro-choice on that beat would have nailed causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The drowned library is not backdrop but active constraint: air pockets dictate breath, shelves groan under waterlogged histories, the atrium’s neither-air-nor-water zone is where the lens is rebuilt. Sensory hierarchy favors touch and sound over sight, matching the undertaker’s silt-creased hands. Spatial choreography is clean; bodies and objects stay trackable. The lens itself becomes micro-setting that charges the final image—its glow mapping graves—fulfilling the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes are clear: give each soul proper rest. Pressure escalates via accumulative deepening: each corpse buried adds weight, each new arrival fractures promised silence. The protagonist’s agency is relentless assembly; cost is their own metamorphosis. One meaningful tightening occurs when the lens hums with voices, shifting task from burial to beacon—options narrowed, price visible.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges as the cruel paradox of caretaking: every act of peace multiplies demand. The lens’s final glow reweights earlier burials as mere waypoints, not endpoints—Conceptual Repricing with undeniable cost. No moralizing; the sentence is delivered by image alone. Subtext in “directions home” quietly indicts the living for forgetting.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is salt-silt, slowed syntax mirroring underwater lag; “silt and sorrow” internal rhyme recurs without monotony. Perceptual signature is tactile—wrinkles as road maps, lungs sipping air like misers—never generic. Compression in “not quite fish, not quite human” teaches the hybrid state early. No dialogue, so no convergence risk; internal diction stays consistent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Rhythm breathes with scene needs: long sentences for silt-dream languor, fragments for lens-click climax. No loops or synonym churn; “broken by design” vs “fractured by design” is intentional echo. One mixed metaphor—“silence chased like a minnow fleeing a shark that was also itself”—is earned by surreal logic. Line density high; each sentence advances image or stakes.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>“Post-apocalyptic undertaker becomes reverse-lighthouse” is fresh synthesis; trope inversion makes the beacon guide the dead, not ships. Specificity—pearl diver’s tear, blood binder—grounds the fantastical. Risk in paradoxical architecture pays off when the keeper becomes static fixture. If the lens’s seven-fold fracture had echoed an earlier seven-soul burial, inevitability would be total.</comment>
