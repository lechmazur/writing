<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Lira’s interiority is lyrical and vocation-specific, but her contradictory impulses stay theoretical ("she aimed to become the voice...") rather than enacted until the final song. The fossil-guided choice is sudden and lyrically framed—lovely, yet the cost of merging with the cave’s grief is asserted more than embodied. Still, her perceptual signature is consistent, and the endurance of carrying the fossil outward reads as earned stasis.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: the piece teaches its pattern early (heat-map colours, fossil pulse, cave echoes) and lets density snowball toward the choral closure. Orientation is swift; space/time anchors hold. The final image—fossil still floating beside her on the empty coast—delivers a Charged Poise that reweights the whole tapestry; the visible cost is the permanent fusion of her voice with the planet’s silence.</comment>

<comment>Sensory selection is biased by Lira’s mapper vocation—heat, mineral veins, salt scent—never tourist catalogue. The cave’s wet stone constrains her pace and later amplifies her song; the fossil’s mineralized leaf is micro-setting that literally steers her path. Final coastal horizon compresses the macro-world into a single breathing line, perfectly scaled to the thematic exit.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Single dominant stake: translate the world’s silence into a map humans can feel. Pressure escalates by accretion—each heat pulse, each grief vein, narrows her option to merely record vs. fully merge. The fossil’s hologram is the decisive tightening that forces the sung translation; cost is the irrevocable loss of solitary autonomy now bound to the fossil’s chorus.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the iterative reweighting of "transitional object": fossil as bridge between botanical past and emotional present, map as bridge between data and myth. No moral is stated; instead, the final coastal image lets the reader feel the conceptual price—when humans wake, they will inherit a world whose stories now live inside one woman’s irreversible song. Ambiguity is purposeful: will her voice heal or haunt?</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric voice sustains a consistent cadence of spondaic weight ("silent coastal caves," "salt and memory") that mirrors the slow drip of time. No dialogue, so the prose itself must carry subtext—achieved through perceptual compression ("leaf of stone that floated as if weightless"). Rhythmic control tightens into the final short declaratives on the breathing horizon, giving the exit a crystalline poise.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>High information density: single sentences often fuse tool, sensation, and metaphor ("heat signatures of feelings, a faint glow revealing lingering warmth"). No synonym loops; occasional elevated diction ("topography," "mineralized") is justified by mapper POV. One mixed-metaphor stub—"map of longing that pointed deeper into the cave's throat"—but it does not touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The "sensory map-maker in a post-human cave" premise is fresh, yet the execution grounds it in tactile process rather than concept alone. The fossil that floats and projects holographic grief transforms a familiar sf gadget into lyrical transitional object; risk is taken in refusing to dramatize the human awakening, opting instead for the eternal poise of waiting. That renunciation feels inevitable in hindsight, not gimmicky.</comment>
