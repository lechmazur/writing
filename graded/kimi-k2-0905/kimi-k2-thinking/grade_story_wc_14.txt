<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The stationer’s motivation—collecting textures of non-existent time—remains conceptually vivid, yet her interiority never cracks under pressure; contradictions are lyrically declared (“she felt the weight…”) rather than dramatized in scene. Micro-choices (cutting the ghostly map, pressing gold leaf) are tactile but too ritualistic to register as escalating risk; the absence of any visible setback or wavering commitment keeps the arc static. No genuine flaw or cost is foregrounded, so the final “quiet power” reads as graceful habit, not earned renunciation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: each dawn session adds density until the notepad swells into a codex, and closure lands as Charged Poise—the town’s silence re-weighted by the mosaic of invented histories gilded on the bonsai leaves. Orientation is complete by line 7; later spatial shifts stay coherent. The final image (“gold leaf caught the morning light…”) makes conceptual cost undeniable: the town’s real past is now overlaid with her fabulated palimpsest. Tightening is present but singular; no second turn escalates cost beyond the accumulating texture itself.</comment>

<comment>The fluorescent lamp becomes a micro-setting that actively constrains every beat: its dying-star flicker dictates the spectrum she can refract and therefore which “history” is harvested. Bonsai labyrinth geography stays coherent—branches lean, dew lenses refract, roots absorb spectral ink—each detail tethered to her immediate tactile goal. Sensory hierarchy matches her craft priorities: hum frequency before color before leaf texture. The final gilded shimmer on leaves is environment charging the image, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—assert control over vanished time—tightens only once, when the hum’s pattern “almost like a language” raises the possibility of comprehension; yet she makes no bid to decode it, so options do not narrow. Cost is present but diffuse: labor, dawn exposure, pages swelling, all cumulative rather than acute. Under Accumulative lens, the single intensification suffices, but without a visible trade-off or risk the escalation feels gentle, not urgent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: the consolatory fabrication of history as defiance against erasure. Subtext resides in material acts—gold leaf sealing lies—rather than any interpretive statement. The closing mosaic of spectral light on empty streets offers resonant reconfiguration: silence is no longer vacancy but receptive canvas. Complexity remains; no moral is pronounced, yet the reader feels the ethical hush of substituting art for memory.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric maintains consistent perceptual signature: precision of craft verbs (“charted,” “traced,” “pressed”) and synesthetic sliding between light, sound, texture. Rhythm modulates with breathless elongation during catalogues of refraction, then shortens to staccato beats at “She cut the map into strips.” No head-hop; distance stays close to her sensory filter. Register never drifts above the character’s artisan lexicon; metaphor is grounded in tools she actually handles.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty—e.g., “She traced the light’s journey with her pen, mapping how it kissed the bark and then dissolved into shadow”—propelling action while texturing metaphor. Only minor scaffold: “each page a world” repetitions could lose one instance; “invented histories” phrase recurs without new angle. Figurative coherence is high; vehicles stay optical/chemical, matching lamp physics. No loops obscure causality or dull the final shimmer.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: stationer + bonsai labyrinth + spectral ink from dying fluorescent hum transforms familiar post-apocalyptic quiet into tactile epistemological romance. Concept commits fully—no ironic pullback—and follows optical logic to gilded leaves. Specificity of craft detail (gold leaf breath-thin, handmade paper over glass) prevents template drift. Risk lies in lyric stasis yet the accumulative pattern pays off, recharging the initial motif at close.</comment>
