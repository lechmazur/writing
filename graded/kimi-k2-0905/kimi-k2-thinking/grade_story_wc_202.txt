<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interiority is lyrical and consistent; the narrator’s desire to “honor overlooked histories” is reiterated but never tested by an opposing force, so the micro-choice to pocket the fragment feels pre-ordained rather than costly. No contradictory impulse is dramatized in scene—risk is aesthetic, not personal. Still, the voice-specific perceptual signature keeps characterization above mid-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the narrator accepts keeper-guardianship, reweighting the premise with conceptual cost (“the light never dies; it only waits”). Causal chain is thin—fragment → painting → journal → self-appointment—but each link is on-page and irreversible. Orientation is swift; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Market, canvas, and fragment all filter through POV bias; the swaying rope bridges and sulfur smell constrain movement and mood. The fragment’s temperature shift from cool to warm against the chest charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate. Only the city below remains a postcard blur, but it never intersects choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recover erased keeper history—is signaled early and deepened when Elias’s map imposes future obligation. Escalation is accumulative: each artifact layers consequence rather than narrows tactical options. Cost is conceptual, not visceral, keeping pressure literary rather than urgent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through image pattern—light, glass, hidden figures—without sermon. Final line reweights “eternal instant” from mood to vocation, achieving Conceptual Repricing. No tidy moral; ambiguity lingers in what new keepership will demand.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>First-person lyric voice sustains rhythmic control and perceptual signature; compression like “elusively tangible” is taught early and paid off in tactile shift. No head-hop, no register drift. Syntax modulates with emotional crest without losing clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Sentence variety is high; information density strong—one line often does description, memory, and metaphor. Occasional poetic overlap (“shimmered into clarity”) flirts with redundancy but never loops. No artifact touches the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Fantasy trope of memory-imbued object is refreshed by lighthouse optics and archival erasure; the hidden-in-painting mechanic is taught and earned. Risk in blending alchemy, translation, and archival activism coheres without gimmickry. Specificity of keeper’s map and salt journal anchors novelty.</comment>
