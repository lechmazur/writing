<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Elara’s “closure seeker” motive is announced, but her interiority stays lyric-abstract (“meteor hush,” “verses in a poem of survival”) rather than dramatized contradiction. No micro-choice under pressure is visible: she passively notices, listens, kneels, rises, smiles—each reaction is reported, not tested. The plant-telepathy enables discovery but never constrains or costs her, so agency feels ornamental. Earned stasis is asserted in final lines, yet the causal chain is atmospheric, not behavioral.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: dawn light, frost, coffee rings, pebble-glow layer into a resonant reconfiguration—scars become readable text. Closure lands as Charged Poise: “the hourglass now measured the moments of her own healing” reweights all prior imagery with conceptual cost. Orientation is swift; single-scene default met. The tunnel reveal is coincidence, but under situational/accumulative rules coincidence may complicate, not resolve, so allowed. Cost is felt (“displaced miracle settle into her bones”), though causality between sedation → telepathy → insight is off-stage and convenient.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment> Tower, frost, coffee rings, glowing pebble, and scar-map form a micro-setting suite that literally constrains reading/interpretation and charges the final image. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: anesthesia fog narrows perception to temperature, smell, damp, then light. Spatial choreography is clean—tapestry pulled, spiral descent, pool center—no floating rooms. Environment is not backdrop but the tool with which she rewrites her story; meets 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“learn to read scars”—is signaled early; pressure deepens texturally as each object offers legibility. No narrowing of external options; tension is epistemic, not jeopardy-based. Single meaningful intensification occurs when glowing peblet makes scars shimmer into text; cost is conceptual rather than tactical. Sufficient for length under Accumulative lens but lacks visceral price that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: literacy of pain, translation of body into narrative. Subtext operates through tactile images—frosted glass, coffee spirals, moss breath—rather than exposition. Final image reweights “closure” from ending to ongoing reading; avoids moralizing. Ambiguity lingers: is the miracle inside her or in the tower? Invites reflection without confusion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lyric-accumulative voice is consistent: rhythmic parallelisms, syntactic echoes (“the quiet tower… the meteor hush… the frosted hourglass”) teach their own pattern. Perceptual signature is biased toward texture and slow geologic time—fitting plant-telepathy and stone-miracle. No dialogue, so voice evaluation rests on narrated interior; register stays within plausible post-sedation diction. Minor drift toward poetic generics (“stories in scars,” “poem of survival”) but sustained texture justifies height.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is fluid, with purposeful repetition that accretes meaning rather than loops. Occasional elevated phrasing (“displaced miracle,” “meteor hush”) edges toward lyric purple, but pattern is taught early and paid off. No mixed metaphors or simultaneity errors. High information density per sentence; clauses layer time, body, object. Final third remains clean, allowing 9+ eligibility elsewhere.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Premise—post-op plant-telepathy leading to scar-hermeneutics—is fresh, non-obvious synthesis. Trope of “hidden tower chamber” is reanimated through haptic specificity and botanical consciousness. Risk is taken with near-absence of external jeopardy, trusting lyric escalation; coherence holds. Transformation test fails only if scar-reading could transplant unchanged, but plant-telepathy and glowing pebble are idiosyncratic anchors that resist generic swap.</comment>
