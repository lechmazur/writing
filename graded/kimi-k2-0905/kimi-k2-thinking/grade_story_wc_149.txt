<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is atmospheric but generic—“breath hitched,” “tears burn”—and never particularized to her botanist training; the ghost bride’s “lovingly venomous” tone is asserted, not embodied. No contradictory impulse is dramatized in-scene; Elara simply obeys. The final stance is lyrically stated rather than earned by micro-choices that cost her anything visible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the fused bead glows, orchard saved, ghost gone. Causality is poetic rather than sequential—why Elara is the lifetime debtor is never motivated—so the lens is Accumulative/Textural. Cost is conceptual (“love as poison and cure”) but not felt on-page by Elara; the debt repayment is external to her stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Greenhouse, winter fields, and ancient tree are vividly sketched with cold-light imagery; the bead as micro-setting charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clean; frost, glass, and root are tactile. The “alchemical” rule-set is never tested or constrained, so environment is backdrop rather than choice-forcer.</question>
<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—orchard survival—is declared late and abstractly; pressure is atmospheric, not tactical. No resource is lost or path foreclosed; Elara’s single action is unopposed. Escalation is a smooth crescendo of luminescence rather than a narrowing of options; cost is ornamental.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of love as poison/cure emerges imagistically through bead and ghost; refrain is handled, not stated. Final image reweights the refrain with quiet irony—flourishing fruit now tastes of bitterness—achieving modest resonance without moralizing. Ambiguity is present but thin because Elara’s interior never complicates the thesis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Third-person lyric voice is consistent, with controlled cadence and winter-light diction; no head-hop. Filter verbs (“felt,” “seemed”) are poetic, not intrusive. Ghost’s diction is only differentiated by the tag “lovingly venomous,” which remains abstract; still, the overall texture is distinctive and readable.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong rhythmic variety and sensory specificity; metaphors stay coherent. Minor template cadence in “winter-cracked fields / hush of winter-cracked fields” loop, but it does not touch closure. No scaffold or overwriting; final line is crisp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Night-blooming orchard + ghost bride is fresh, yet the beat sequence is familiar spectral-helper arc. Bead-as-memory-talisman is elegant, but the lifetime-debt logic remains arbitrary. Emotional payoff is gentle rather than revelatory; risk is modest, execution solid.</comment>
