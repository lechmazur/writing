<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The guard’s dreamlessness, freight/guard duality, and lullaby-charm are vivid and embodied; the null-zone confrontation forces a sacrificial planting that costs voice and self, earning closure. Interior contradiction is present—“occasionally everywhere” vs final “nowhere”—but the archive’s thousand eyes and quantum steps remain abstract, muting micro-choice granularity. Still, the renunciation lands with felt price, satisfying the 9- gate for this length.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the guard dissolves into the charm, midnight becomes a visitable garden, and the clock strikes thirteen—undeniable reweighting of rules with cost (voice cracked to blood). Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each lyric shard adds density until the final cadence shift. Orientation is taught by deliberate disorientation early and pays off, so no penalty. One tightening—planting the archive—suffices; causality of quantum beats is lyrically coherent rather than literal.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setting is the body-archive, chess clock, and glowing dune; all constrain tactics (charm keeps archive coherent, dune provides unlit corner). Selective sensory detail—“sand remembered chlorophyll,” “static charge of a world stopped”—anchors the lyric world without exposition dump. Spatial choreography is intentionally fluid to match wave-function travel; the final garden-midnight is charged image. No environment violates its own lyric physics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake: preserve possibility against null-zone forgetting. Pressure escalates via accumulative lyric density: off-key dunes, black spot eating timelines, sparks dying. One decisive tightening—planting archive in never-burn corner—forecloses guard’s continued existence, cost paid on page. Coincidence is absent; erosion of options is felt through image-cascade rather than causal reversals, fitting the lyric lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges: memory as ecological act—seeds need dreamers, dreamers need unlit soil. Subtext in “fractured lullaby” and backward-moving clock reframes apocalypse as nursery. Final image of downward-growing star-forest reweights all prior ash without moralizing. Complexity lingers: guard’s erasure is both victory and loss, inviting counter-readings.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is crystalline lyric—compressed, rhythmic, quantum-tinged yet consistent: “wave functions干涉ed” keeps diction inside guard’s poetic lexicon. Perceptual signature filters world through archive-sense: timelines as sparks, midnight as weld-point. No dialogue, so no voice convergence. Under peak stress the syntax fragments precisely (“cracked and bled notes”), matching pressure without losing coherence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but propulsive; each sentence layers image or rule (“glowing dune grew legs and walked”) without scaffold. One paraphrase loop risk—“memory of a memory”—but it serves thematic echo rather than padding. Metaphors stay internally coherent (quantum foam, butter sun) and culminate in charged closure image. No artifact touches the final beat; rhythm modulates from long breaths to cracked fragments effectively.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fusion of quantum erasure & ecological grief feels inevitable yet fresh; “forest that grew downward from the sky” reconfigures both physics and myth. Risky lyric compression taught early and paid off at closure without clarity loss. No trope checklist—every image grows from guard’s body-archive conflict. Transformation test: swap names and the lyric physics collapse, confirming originality.</comment>
