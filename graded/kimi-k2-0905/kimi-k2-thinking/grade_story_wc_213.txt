<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s “credibly curious” trait is dramatized through the withheld siren pull and the microclimate readings; the final refusal costs her the safety of certainty and the village’s blind trust, a visible price that earns her Earned Stasis. Interiority stays concrete—fingers on cold plastic, the rope’s glue-stiffened curve—avoiding label-speak. The only drag is a touch of retrospective omniscience in “they would have fled,” slightly smoothing the contradiction that could have sharpened the stake.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the switch untouched, the bell silent, the storm bending away—cost is the credibility risk she now owns. Causal chain holds: glue → rope unusable → instruments stall → she refrains → silence becomes the warning. Orientation is anchored by word 80; no lens ambiguity. One tightening beat suffices for this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The bell rope itself functions as micro-setting: its glued stiffness literally prevents the obligatory act and reappears in the final test, charging the last image. Wind, frost, and pressure gauge readings are filtered through Elara’s professional eye, guiding her micro-choices. Spatial choreography is clean; no white-room moments. Meets 9+ gate: object constrains choice and closes image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—false alarm versus missed disaster—tightens when the pressure stall appears; the live clock is the curing glue. One meaningful deepening suffices: the hesitation reweights risk and forecloses the siren option. Cost is legible: she stakes her reputation on silence. Agency drives every beat; coincidence complicates but does not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme—“listening as the only true warning”—emerges through the withheld mechanical noise and the instruments’ quiet song; no final moralizing. The rope’s silence and the valley’s untroubled sleep reconfigure meaning without statement. Subtext in the un-pulled bell and the un-flipped switch carries the emotional aftereffect. Resonance is earned, not asserted.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Elara’s meteorologist gaze; perceptual signature is vivid—“pressure danced on the mountaintop’s rim.” Syntax lengthens during contemplation, shortens at the switch moment, mirroring breath. No filter-verb stacks; diction stays within her lexicon. Patterned elision (“zero hour approached”) is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances atmosphere, instrument reading, or interior calculus. Figurative language is sparse and coherent—“rope swayed like a heavy pendulum”—never muddling causality. Rhythm modulates with wind gusts and heartbeat of data. High information density without purple overload; closure image pristine.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The “storm siren tester who succeeds by silence” flips the expected disaster protocol; the microclimate stall feels fresh, not contrived. Specificity of glue curing as narrative clock personalizes the stakes. While the lone watcher on a mountain is familiar, the inversion of duty into restraint transforms the trope. Risk-taking is measured, coherence intact.</comment>
