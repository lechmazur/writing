<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Mara’s contradictory drives—protocol vs. empathy—are embodied in every beat: she pockets the shells instead of tagging evidence, then physically squeezes through the fracture, micro-choices that escalate to the pearl-crowning moment. Interiority stays concrete (“the pearl seemed to warm against her palm”) rather than diagnostic; competence (dosimeter, structural scan) is balanced by the genuine stumble when she hesitates. The final endurance—she stays silent, lets the caves broadcast—costs her career path and is foreshadowed by earlier rule-breaking. No safety-hedging: she is complicit in the illegal act that re-opens communal grief.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the townspeople suddenly hear inherited regrets through HVAC vents—undeniable social cost—while Mara’s own future is foreclosed by her unsanctioned act. The lens is Accumulative: each etched confession layers density until the crystal pillar re-broadcasts; causality is intact (she reads → she speaks → system sings). Orientation is clean by line 4 (“Bunker 7,” “quartz-dusted walls,” “thirty years”). The final image reweights the premise: bunkers are no longer tombs but amplifiers; cost is legible in the instant she forfeits official duty.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The crystal pillar literally constrains her final gesture—she must stand on tiptoe to crown it—and its refractive property enables the broadcast that reconfigures the town’s emotional circuitry. Body-tool-environment triad is fused: the pearl’s warmth guides her palm-level decision, the fracture aperture dictates the crawl, the stalactite geometry scatters her single beam into communal voice. Sensory hierarchy fits an inspector: she notices dosimeter clicks, air-flow direction, structural seams before aesthetics. Setting evolves causally—once the pearl crowns, the facet resonance physically alters the ventilation system above.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Single dominant stake: whether to seal or liberate the buried hopes. Escalation is a single deepening—each confession spoken intensifies the pearl’s glow, narrowing her options until demolition becomes unconscionable. Agency sits entirely with her; no external antagonist, no lucky rescue. Visible price: she breaches inspection protocol, forfeiting career and inviting potential legal consequence—cost named on-page (“protocol demanded she report… Instead, she did something inspectors were never trained to do”). The tightening satisfies the 600-word scale: one pressure arc, one irreversible choice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme—suppressed longing as structural grout—emerges through the pearl’s shift from serene object to transmitter; no explicit thesis is stated. Subtext is encoded in gesture: nesting shells inside a footlocker = emotional smuggling; placing pearl atop pillar = public unsealing. The ending’s non-literal answer: the caves “sing” the unsaid, re-pricing silence as communal risk. Emotional aftereffect is concrete—readers imagine their own vents whispering ancestral regrets—avoiding sentimentality by staying in sensory image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Mara’s perceptual signature: technical diction (“dosimeter,” “structural scan”) collides with tactile metaphor (“bunk frames sagged like ribs”). No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens under pressure—syntax fragments during crawl (“her breath forming clouds”). Patterned repetition (“resonant hush”) is taught early and paid off at closure when the caves literally resonate. Filter verbs are voice-motivated (“seemed to warm”) reflecting instrument-trained caution.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies: long clause clusters build cathedral image, then clipped fragments mimic heartbeat. Information density high—“velvet box containing a single cultivated pearl—perfect, lustrous, and impossibly serene against the surrounding decay” does four jobs in twenty words. No mixed metaphors; all vehicles (ribs, braille, lens) stay within corporeal/optical family. Scaffolding is minimal; only two near-filter adverbs (“seemingly,” “barely”) and both serve voice. Final line cadence lands on monosyllabic punch—“they deserve”—recharging prior motifs without artifice.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade>
<comment>Fusion of post-apocalyptic inspection manual with lyric grief-cave is non-obvious and inevitable in hindsight. Pearl-as-amplifier rewrites Chekhov’s gun as Chekhov’s transmitter: technique taught by grandmother’s shell-carving is payoff, not ornament. Risk-taking—eschewing antagonist, overt dialogue, or physical peril—pays off in conceptual stakes larger than survival. Specific detail (“quartz-dusted walls,” “thumb-sized spirals”) prevents template drift; remove any molecule and the emotional resonance collapses.</comment>
