<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Kael’s quiet obsession with mapping what others fear is embodied in every beat—she handles the cracked whistle, studies the calcium swirls, climbs alone at dawn. The interior contradiction—knowing the watchers catalogue death yet still carving a new gate—peaks when she smiles back at the silhouettes, paying the cost of irreversible knowledge. Mother’s absence is never psychologized; it lives in the fracture Kael fingers. One omission: we never feel the bodily toll of her weeks of study, so the final carve feels slightly weightless.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative lens: each shell pattern, map overlay, and whistle fracture adds density until the harmonic frequency rewrites the city’s breathing. The decisive conceptual re-pricing lands in the last three lines—“the question had finally been heard”—with the new gate’s question-mark carving forever visible to the watchers. Causality is clean: because mother cracked the language, Kael can choose to speak it anyway. No orientation drift; who/where/when settled by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The turtle-shell city is never described in panorama; instead we feel Old Merra creak under Kael’s feet, taste salt in the whistle’s note, see sun-hot rust on the gate. The spiral pattern on the shell constrains every cartographic move—Kael literally follows its ridges to discover the harmonic. Micro-setting triumph: the cracked whistle becomes map, tool, and history in one object. Spatial choreography flawless—no impossible distances during dawn climb.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can curiosity survive the watchers’ silence?—tightens when Kael realizes the crack is an invitation, not a warning. The meaningful deepening occurs at the midpoint: the growth patterns on the shells match the expedition path, turning archival obsession into live endangerment. Cost is conceptual but undeniable—once she blows the shell-whistle, she can never return to the citizens who stare at their feet. No reversal, but the cadence shift from private study to public carving suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges via spiral recursion: every map is also a grave, every answer spawns a harder question. Subtext lives in the watchers’ raised hand—acknowledgment or beckoning?—left resolutely ambiguous. The final image of the question-mark carving reweights the entire premise: curiosity is not extinguished but transmuted into perpetual inquiry. No moralizing, only the cost of irreversible sight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Voice is crystalline, compressed, slightly salt-tinged—“a note that tasted of salt and forgotten language.” Perceptual signature never drifts: Kael notices calcium swirls the way a sailor notices wind. Rhythm accelerates across the single long paragraph, mirroring her climb. One micro-slippage: “quietly driven” is repeated verbatim from prompt; the phrase already lives in her gesture, so the label feels redundant.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence advances. Figurative control tight—“spirals within spirals, a cartography of madness”—without metaphor sprawl. Information density high: one sentence can stage, describe, and emotional-rotate (“She brought it to her lips anyway…”). Occasional Latinate elevation (“catalogued,” “calcium geometries”) fits cartographer mind. Final carve line lands clean with no syntactic drag.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise—city on turtles—risks whimsy yet becomes existential via shell-as-archive. Fresh inflection: the watchers are historians, not guardians, recording the death of wonder in literal calcium. The harmonic frequency hidden in living shell is a conceptual coup that feels inevitable once revealed. Risk taken: no dialogue, no other characters, still grips. Transformation test passed—swap turtles for asteroids and the emotional logic collapses.</comment>
