<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The novelist's interior contradiction—guilt toward his creations vs. need to finish them—surfaces early and drives every beat; the final release of the shell is a credible renunciation with felt cost. Micro-choices (kneeling, breathing the shell, pressing it into earth) embody the shift from collector to witness. Over-articulate self-diagnosis ("softness was true") slightly over-performs the recognition, but the embodied ritual keeps the arc legible. Flaws complicate rather than excuse, and the transformation reads as earned stasis rather than tidy redemption.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each ghost-cameo thickens the density of abandoned hopes until the shell-crack releases them, reweighting the premise. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration—hope returns to wild mist—whose conceptual cost (he will never wake) is undeniable. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are deliberately dreamlike but taught by ~100 words and serve the final image; no penalty. One minor causality fuzz: the "blueprint" fog gift is lovely yet never recurs; it doesn’t break the pattern but slightly dilutes the shell’s monopoly on meaning.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The feral nexus is evoked through tactile micro-detail—wet ink ankles, spiral calcium whorls—rather than panorama, allowing the body and shell to function as mobile setting. Mist and shell constrain choice: visibility shrinks, the shell records/forms hope, and the final press into earth is a spatial commitment that forecloses exit. Spatial choreography is dream-logic but consistent; distances never collapse. Weather (swirling hush) directly responds to protagonist action, charging the final image. No exposition dumps; world-rules learned through ritual.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can he grant discarded hopes dignity before final silence—signals in paragraph one. Escalation is textural: each cameo shortens as "closing-pages whisper" grows louder, tightening temporal pressure without external antagonist. Protagonist agency is ceremonial (solemnizing breath, kneeling shell-planting) that visibly prices his permanence in dream-death. Cost is legible: he forfeits authorship, releasing hopes to unauthored wild. One deepening suffices for this length; pattern holds.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: authorship as colonial possession vs. witness/release. Subtext resides in gesture—breathing the shell instead of speaking prayer—avoiding thesis statements. Final image reweights prior motif: shell becomes seed, not relic, offering conceptual repricing without moral. Ambiguity lingers: is wild hope mercy or further exile? No late moralizing; "inside the whisper" refrain accumulates resonance rather than explanation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lyric-ritual voice sustains perceptual signature: coiling mist "like a question mark," kite-string fingers—metaphors stay specific to narrator’s sensibility. Syntax mirrors dream-logic compression; fragments ("Against the current...") are taught early and paid off. No dialogue, so no voice convergence. Register drifts slightly into workshop diction ("conceptual repricing" feel) once, but rhythm recovers. Tense stable; psychic distance controlled through sensory immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>High information density: single sentences perform image, emotion, and forward motion. No paraphrase loops; each clause adds new sensory or causal data. Figurative language is dense but patterned—spiral, mist, hush—so avoids random stacking. Minor scaffold: "against the current" repeated exactly four times; because it functions as ritual chant that pays off in final line, only −0.2. Opening and closing sentences are crisp, propulsive. Proofing clean; no typos.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Premise—metafictional afterlife where aborted story-ghosts demand dignity—is fresh yet emotionally grounded. Transformation test fails: swap novelist for painter and shell for palette, core still holds, but specificity of "closing-pages whisper" and calcium whorls keeps it memorable. Risk-taking (no traditional scene, purely lyric accumulation) heightens coherence rather than obscures. No derivative echoes; the blueprint/old-man cameo feels newly minted.</comment>
