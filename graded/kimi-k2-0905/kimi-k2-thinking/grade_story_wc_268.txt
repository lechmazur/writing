<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Sylvar’s guardian identity and quiet thunder presence are vividly embodied; his micro-choice to inscribe rather than confront shows a credible hierarchy of values. The moment he places hand on rune crystallizes his stance with visible cost—his ink spent, vigil resumed. No interior contradiction or alternating summary weakens him; the only lack is a second layer of internal conflict that would push him to 9-band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Closure lands cleanly: glamour shatters, throne stands empty, library exhales—an earned Resonant Reconfiguration with conceptual cost. Causal chain holds: inscribed riddle → Vael’s finger trace → glamour fray → Sylvar’s will completes sundering. Lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern taught early via slow-time imagery and ink beats, paid off in collapsing stones and fading rune. Slight cap remains: cost is felt but not persistent—no constraint carries forward into next vigil.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Silvered starlight vines and crumbling pillars are filtered through Sylvar’s aged-gaze POV, never tourist catalog. The library’s temporal drift acts as micro-setting: constellations dandelion-seed outside, pages yellowed by “thousand sunsets” inside—details that guide access (slow time lets ink messages age into truth). Environment directly enables tactic: slow time = slow read = glamour unravels at readable pace. Final collapsing stones mirror unweaving illusion, charging closure image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—unmask pretender—signaled in paragraph four; pressure tightens once when riddle-read becomes irreversible glamour fray. Agency sits with Sylvar via inscription; Vael’s finger-trace is the visible tightening that narrows options to exposure. Cost legible: ink spent, library falls, pretender revealed. Missing a second beat of escalating risk or resource loss keeps it below 8.8.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme of truth-through-time emerges from ink seeping like “secrets into memory” and library exhaling “dust in a graceful collapse”; no abstract thesis stated. Subtext in riddle line “drift that pulls the mask from the moon” reweights moon imagery at closure when glamour dissolves. Ambiguity lingers: throne still empty, worthy heir unnamed—complexity embraced. Only minus: final smile could flirt with profundity if read as authorial nudge.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice carries distinct lyric texture: “quiet thunder,” “slow lung of eternity,” syntax elongates then compresses with reveal. Perceptual signature is Sylvar’s—aged, patient, star-worn diction never drifts into committee voice. No dialogue to judge; interiority stays concrete (“ink seeping like secrets”) rather than diagnostic. Register stable; patterned metaphor taught early and paid off at collapse, keeping elision legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies: long anaphoric clauses mirror slow time, then short beats (“A gasp escaped his lips”) accelerate unraveling. Information density high—each sentence layers image, stakes, or causality. One mixed-metaphor risk: “threads of silver unraveling like a worn tapestry” beside “divine hammer” but physical logic stays intact (glamour ≠ cloth). No loops, scaffold, or synonym churn; final third clean, allowing 9-band approach.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: titan-as-quiet-librarian, ink-as-weapon, rune-of-drift as anti-glamour tech—specific to this world. Risk taken with slow-time lyrical collapse instead of duel; coherence retained. Could swap “rune of drift” for “sigil of unbinding” with minor edits, so not fully irreplicable. Emotional specificity in “regally unpretentious smile” keeps it above template zone.</comment>
