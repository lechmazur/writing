<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The keeper’s interiority is evocative—"felt the weight of a thousand vanished voices"—but her contradictory impulses (risk vs. dread) are summarized rather than dramatized in a single moment; the final act of copying/erasing lands as a label-only epiphany without embodied cost. No second character appears, so status/relationship crucible is N/A. Micro-choice under pressure is present (forging token) yet the heat of that beat is compressed into one clause, muting the visible trade-off. Still, her perceptual signature (archive hum, silver thread) is consistent and character-specific, lifting her above stereotype.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The text teaches an Accumulative/Textural pattern early—numbers threading through logs—and closure lands as Charged Poise: the mirror-upload reweights the stake ("a beacon for anyone searching") while the patch-in-sleeve images the cost of her new vigil. Causality is lyric rather than tight because/therefore, but the density increase of the digits and songs legitimately reconfigure meaning. Orientation is anchored inside 120 words; no teleporting props. The persistent constraint (corporate power to erase) shapes her tactics throughout. Cost is felt in the final "rare brightness" that acknowledges perpetual endangerment.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The archive is rendered through micro-setting: "humming" servers, "mournful hum" of tapes, the vault’s sealed chill—details that constrain her route and charge the final image when she slips the patch into a "protective sleeve." Sensory layering (sound dominant, tactile patch warmth) is selective and POV-colored. Spatial choreography is clean across the single continuous scene. The silver-thread patch recurs with shifting charge (ghost → clue → talisman) and thus satisfies the 9+ gate by constraining her final stance. Weather is irrelevant and correctly omitted.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—recover truth about vanished engineers—is signaled in line 4. Pressure escalates via pattern-density: numbers surfacing in songs, timestamps, metadata; each return tightens the sense of a hidden trail. Agency is present—forge token, copy video, erase logs—but the on-page price (being caught? guilt?) is only implied through the final "rare brightness," so cost clarity is present yet soft. No coincidence resolves; the mirror-upload is a deliberate renunciation that forecloses corporate silence. One meaningful deepening suffices for length; it delivers.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: digital ghosts vs. corporate erasure, voiced through recurring numbers and songs rather than thesis. The final image—numbers whispered into dark—offers a non-literal answer: memory persists through illicit repetition. Subtext in gesture (patch warmth, sleeve protection) is strong; no overt moralizing. The concept of "sensed absence" permeates every byte and note, reweighting the premise at closure. Minor slip: final paragraph edges toward explicit statement ("nothing truly disappears") but pulls back into image quickly enough.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Voice is distinctively textured: archivist precision ("corrupted data blocks") collides with lyric cadence ("stranded star," "chorus of absence"). Perceptual signature is consistent—sound-centric, data-metaphor—and rhythm modulates with pressure, tightening into shorter clauses at the vault breach. No dialogue to test; free-indirect style is clean. Filter verbs appear but are voice-motivated ("she noticed," "she realized") and serve the obsessive-attentive persona. The elevated diction fits the keeper’s arcane expertise without drifting into corporate jargon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: "each byte a ghost of a voice" layers metaphor without muddle. Sentence variety is strong; no template cadence or synonym loops. One paraphrase-adjacent moment—"the numbers continued to surface, now in the beat of forgotten songs"—echoes prior beat but adds new location, so allowed. Opening and closing lines anchor and recharge motifs. No scaffolding, no mixed metaphors. Read-aloud ear test passes: rhythm breathes with emotional crests.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>The premise—corporate archivist vs. erased astronauts—feels fresh, but the "numbers everywhere" device openly borrows LOST, reducing novelty. Transformation arrives via integration with data-archive specifics (timestamps, metadata) and the keeper’s occupational lens. The patch re-purposes a generic mission emblem into a tactile conscience. Risk is moderate: lyric accumulation over plot twists. Insight—deletion as colonial violence against memory—emerges from particulars, not abstraction. Sufficient specificity prevents the story from being a template reskin.</comment>
