<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Alia’s tactile, oil-stained interiority and the embodied micro-choice of “whispered a promise to the mountain” give credible, contradictory agency; the absence of any second on-page character keeps relationship/status bullets idle, capping the band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: water sings over stone while the mountain’s exhalation reweights meaning; cost is felt in the council’s earlier tremor of doubt and Alia’s slyly heartfelt vow, all under a coherent Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The surveyor’s chain and basalt blocks act as micro-setting, constraining the decryption choice and returning in the ceremonial guide; volcanic breath and sulfurous sigh integrate environment into the final charged image, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve vs. profit—is signaled early and tightens when the council’s doubt ripples; Alia’s hybrid design forecloses pure preservation, with visible price in the groaning floodgates and her own tremble of triumph.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of encrypted compassion emerges concretely through chain-to-adhesive decryption rather than assertion; final image of “shared heartbeat” reweights the premise without moralizing, though the phrase itself skirts thematic echo penalty.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Alia’s perceptual signature—callused hands, magnifying lens, volcanic haze—without head-hop; rhythm modulates from slow exhalations to quickened heartbeats under pressure, maintaining coherent distance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong nouns and verbs carry density, but occasional stacked epithets (“dappled resolve of her spirit now burned steady”) flirt with purple; no loops or scaffold, yet figurative slight overload in closure beat keeps it sub-8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Floodgate-machinist POV inside a lava amphitheater feels fresh; decryption via adhesive film is a specific, non-obvious method that crystallizes the hybrid plan, transforming familiar preservation-versus-profit trope into lived ingenuity.</comment>
