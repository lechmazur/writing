<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira’s contradictory impulses—survival instinct vs mission duty—are embodied in the micro-choices of cracking her own helmet and pouring the hush. The moment her scanner locks the core while water enters her lungs, her prior dismissal of the vial flips into self-sacrifice; the cost is visceral and scaled to the length. The one flaw: “tell them it was beautiful” drifts toward diagnostic summary, a hairline slip that keeps the score sub-9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the quantum core stabilizes only because Lira becomes the silence, her flatline the price that reweights the premise. Causal chain holds: vial → corridor realignment → core capture; the transmitter’s data burst is the irreversible Decisive Change. Lens is pure Causal; every beat tightens options until breath is forfeited. Cost is legible in the cracked helmet line—no hand-waving.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Underwater temple as micro-setting constrains every move: oxygen gauge, crushing walls, knotted architecture that literally re-knots when the hush dissolves. The crystal vial recurs as tactile object, cool in the captain’s quarters, charging the final image. Sensory selection narrows to pressure, pulse, salt—never tourist catalog. Spatial choreography is flawless; the corridor re-alignment is the spatial payoff.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—capture the ephemeral core—tightens from red-zone oxygen to cracked helmet; each beat forecloses retreat. Agency is relentless: she overrides the seal protocol, programs the transmitter instead of self-rescue. Cost escalates from breath to life; the quantum core exists only while she pays. One meaningful turn is sufficient; no reversals needed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: knowledge purchased by vanishing. The vial’s journey from superstition to conduit re-prices silence itself as the only currency. Final image—empty crystal cool with “the weight of all it had witnessed”—delivers Conceptual Repricing without moralizing. Ambiguity is purposeful: the core’s data will revolutionize, yet the temple keeps its secret.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person POV keeps modest distance, yet perceptual signature is Lira’s: “temple’s pulsating wall,” “pressure that touched memories not her own.” Syntax tightens under pressure—fragmented clauses mirror heartbeat collapse. No head-hopping; captain’s coda stays external, maintaining lens. Filter verbs appear only when voice-motivated (“felt the temple singing”).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is compressed poetry: “water met stone met void” triple-monosyllable enacts the knot dissolving. No loops, no scaffold; every sentence advances. Figurative language is sparse but precise—no mixed metaphors. Final line cadence mirrors the lonesome tone without syntactic uniformity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Quantum-dive sacrifice is familiar, yet the silence-as-substance mechanic and “gathered hush” ritual feel fresh. Risky lyric compression pays off: the temple re-architects itself rather than offering cliched monster or treasure. Specificity anchors novelty: the vial’s memory, the captain tasting salt and starlight. Transformation test fails—swap names and concept still works—so capped sub-9.</comment>
