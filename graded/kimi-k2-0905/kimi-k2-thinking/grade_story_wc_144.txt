<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Miren’s interior contradiction—blind yet “seeing” through refraction—remains embodied and active in every solder bead; the apprentice’s awe never tilts her status, keeping the artisan’s calm magnetic. The final shrug-cost (“listening to what was broken”) is earned by the mercury-and-water method dramatized throughout. Only mild deduction: Kael stays a functional mirror rather than a second crucible, so relationship pressure never spikes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the repaired drone’s true-north chirp reweights the whole depot into a compass the blind artisan can read. Causal chain intact—crack → refraction diagnosis → platinum patch → harmonic test → silver coins—each step tightening under the clock of the *Prospect*’s horn. Cost is visible in her exhausted fingertips still on cool metal; lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds from first shattered feather to last.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Micro-setting triumph: the mercury pool and suspended glass sphere literally let a blind woman “see” circuitry, so setting constrains every decision. Depot mist, salt-air taste, and gaslight refraction are filtered through Miren’s bias toward vibration and temperature, never tourist catalog. Spatial choreography clean: drone, tools, lantern, apprentice tracked without drift. Could edge higher if the depot’s social texture (other workers, ticket counter) pressed back, but the isolated bay suffices.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—restore navigation before dawn—signals early and tightens with each horn blast. One meaningful deepening: the hairline fracture is revealed only after refraction test, shifting tactics from tactile to crystalline repair. Cost (lost night, tremor of failure if drone crashes expedition) is legible; agency resides in her micro-choices under mist-lamped pressure. No second reversal, but single escalation satisfies Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: perception > vision; navigation as life-metaphor. Subtext in the apprentice’s steamed breath and silver coins shows trust paid for invisible sight, never preached. Final image of “listening to what was broken” offers resonant non-literal answer. No moralizing, no echo of the prompt’s keyword “feedback,” keeping emergence clean.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Perceptual signature is laser-specific: Miren feels “weight alone” of tools, tastes salt/oil, hears wingbeats as compass points. Syntax grows shorter under deadline—‘Bring me the platinum patch’—mirroring pressure. No head-hopping; Kael’s awe stays external, preserving blind POV modesty. Rhythm and diction remain artisan-technical yet lyrical, a voice unlikely to be mistaken for another story.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>High information density: single line “shallow basin of mercury caught the depot’s dim gaslight, bending it into patterns her trained mind could translate into circuitry” delivers setting, method, character skill, and plot advancement. Metaphors stay physically coherent (star chart torn along folds). One minor loop: “each connection a prayer whispered into the machine” adjacent to “her fingers dancing with solder” could tighten, but does not touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: blind drone-smith who literalizes navigation by repairing navigation crystal. Risk of sentimentality avoided via metallurgical specificity and cold mercury. Not a mere disability-lit trope—the blindness enables the technical method that solves the plot. Final reconfiguration feels inevitable yet non-obvious, earning the high band without gimmickry.</comment>
