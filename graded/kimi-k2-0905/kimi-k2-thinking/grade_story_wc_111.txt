<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Silas’s interiority is concrete—gnarled hands, dry rustle voice—and his bond to the garden is shown through the polishing ritual. The final renunciation (revealing the deception) is earned and carries visible cost: the garden mirrors his fatigue. Micro-choices under pressure are present but compressed; the heirs’ on-page pressure is thin, keeping this just below the 8+ gate.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the spiral of marbles reweights the contract between gardener and garden with undeniable conceptual cost. Causal linkage holds—garden wilts because Silas wanes; heirs accept the living contract because the marbles make the bond legible. One minor scaffold: “polishing not just the marbles, but the bond” is abstract paraphrase within the climax beat, preventing 9.0.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The maze is more than postcard: its paths constrain where the heirs can meet Silas, the central stone table serves as ritual altar, and the wilted rosebush literalizes his fatigue. Firefly-lit hedges in the final paragraph charge the closure image. Spatial choreography stays clean; only the “sprawling” descriptor feels generic, a hairline slip.</question>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</question><comment>Dominant stake—garden vs. replacement by machine—is signaled early and tightens when the wilted rosebush forces Silas to risk exposure. The reversal (deciding to reveal) narrows his options and carries social cost. Escalation is single-cycle but sufficient for 700-word span; cost is legible in the garden’s mirrored decay and the heirs’ live response.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges without sermon: gardens as living contracts, luck as unquantifiable devotion. The cracked-marble motif shifts from shame to testament, reweighted in the final spiral. One soft echo: “the true measure of luck was not in numbers” borders thematic statement, but is saved by preceding embodied proof.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</question><comment>Third-person focalization stays tight to Silas; perceptual signature is consistent—light through hedges, marble-glint synesthesia. Rhythm modulates: short declaratives under dawn pressure, longer lyrical cadence at twilight. No head-hopping; heirs’ interiority is kept at gesture level, preserving distance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</question><comment>Prose is clean, high-density; figurative language is selective (“cracked surface caught the light like a tiny star”). One template hiccup: three successive “each” anaphora lines in the spiral paragraph create mechanical cadence, dulling the climax. No loops or register drift; minor scaffold prevents 9.0.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>“Measurable luck” is familiar speculative premise, but the inversion—garden responds to unmeasured gardener’s care—feels fresh. Marbles as memory-currency and the polishing ritual give specific cultural texture. Risk is moderate; the story commits fully to quiet stakes rather than world-scale rebellion, earning +0.2 within band.</comment>
