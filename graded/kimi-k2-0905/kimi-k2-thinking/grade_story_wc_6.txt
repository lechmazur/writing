<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Maya’s contradiction—arsonist’s daughter turned firefighter—drives every action; the bird rescue literalizes her need to “quench.” Interiority is concrete (“scars traced her forearms, silver lines where fire had written its story”) and her micro-choice to bind the wing with the coin-thread is character-specific. The final image of scars that “sing” is earned because the song has been dramatized, not asserted. The only gap is absence of visible cost to her body or future—she leaves lighter, unscathed beyond memory.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: pressing the coin into the black sand re-weights her father’s legacy as protective talisman rather than inherited guilt. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern taught early (black sand, coin, scars) returns in altered form. Cloud migration supplies cadence shift rather than causal chain, sufficient for this lyric design. Cost is felt—she relinquishes the coin—but could be sharper if the bird’s survival remained uncertain.</comment>

<comment>The obsidian lagoon is anchored by word 30, its mirror-surface doubling clouds and scars; micro-setting (the coin, the driftwood log) constrains the graft. Black sand’s heat and volcanic ash imagery reappear at closure, fused to the coin. Sensory hierarchy favors touch (warm sand, thread tension) over visual catalog. Spatial choreography is flawless: kneel, cup, bind, scatter, trace circle—each motion tracked without drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“prove scars can sing”—is signaled early; pressure tightens when the broken bird forces her to test that claim. The graft act is the single meaningful escalation; it narrows options from symbolic song to physical repair. Coin-splint and sand-circle are visible prices that alter tactics. Luck does not resolve; the bird’s chirp is plausible outcome of her agency, not gift from tide.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the returning triad of fire-scars, black sand, and coin: legacy can be re-forged into tenderness. Final image of coin buried in sand reweights “dark legacy into light” without moralizing. Subtext resides in the red thread—once a symbol of her father’s wanderlust, now ligature of healing. The kelp-drift peace tone keeps sentimentality at bay; ambiguity remains—will the bird truly fly?—inviting reflection beyond the page.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Maya’s perceptual filter: she notices heat, scent, scar-silver, not tourist vistas. Syntax lengthens during song, compresses during binding, mirroring breath. No filter-verb stacks; metaphor vehicles (“mirror of migrating clouds”) remain consistent with water imagery. Voice never explains itself; “scars can sing” is first spoken by action, last by image.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>High information density: one sentence often carries image, emotion, and backstory (“Maya stood…arsonist’s daughter, yet she chose to quench”). No synonym loops or template cadence; sentence openings vary. Figurative language is sparse and coherent—no mixed metaphors in peak beat. Final line “carrying the coin, the thread, and the song” is crisp propulsion, no scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Premise is familiar—daughter outlives father’s sin through rescue—but synthesis with volcanic black sand and coin-as-splint feels fresh. Risk lies in lyric accumulative structure rather than plot reversal; pattern is taught early and reconfigured at end. Specificity of firefighter skill (thread tension, splint placement) keeps it from generic redemption tale. Could edge higher if cost to her own safety or reputation were dramatized.</comment>
