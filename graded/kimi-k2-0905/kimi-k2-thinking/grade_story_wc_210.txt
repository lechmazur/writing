<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kael’s refusal of nostalgia and turn toward imagination is vividly embodied in his pacing, sand-sketching, and lantern-crafting; the final smile is earned. Interiority stays concrete (“mind a clear slate,” “steady breath”) and avoids diagnostic labels. His flaw—lonely rigidity—drives the choice to keep the bottle sealed, paying visible cost in perpetual solitude. No contradictory impulse undercuts him; the only limit is that no second character tests status dynamics.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens is declared and held: each lantern-lit image thickens meaning until the sealed bottle’s final shimmer reweights memory itself. Closure is a Charged Poise—lanterns glow, bottle intact, cost felt in the chorus that fades to silence. Causality is lyric but coherent: memory-training → sand blueprints → settlers arrive. No orientation debt; who/where/when are anchored in the first clause.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The cove’s black water, charred ribbons, and amber reflections are filtered through Kael’s grief, guiding every choice. The bottle-as-micro-setting constrains action—its unopenable surface literally forecloses nostalgia. Lanterns built from old maps tactilely link past to future. Spatial choreography is clean: bottle centered, Kael at edge, settlers later; no floating props.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake: can memory generate a living future without reopening loss? Pressure tightens as Kael’s mind-holding of the bottle’s shape becomes the literal scaffold that draws settlers. The sealed bottle forecloses the easier path of resurrection, forcing reimagining; cost is his ongoing solitude until others arrive. One micro-turn suffices; escalation is accumulative density, not causal reversal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme—collective memory as creative seed—emerges from sand sketches and map-lanterns, never sermonized. The sealed bottle’s conceptual repricing (whole past → new creation) lands in the final shimmer. Subtext in “lanterns never went out” rumor shows how myth operates. Emotional aftereffect is wonder laced with melancholy, earned not asserted.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person lyric voice stays close to Kael’s perceptual bias: resin “that had trapped something inside,” lanterns “danced on the water like the town’s resurrected spirit.” Rhythm swells and contracts with emotional beats; no filter-verb stacks. No dialogue, so no convergence risk. Compression like “mind a clear slate” is pattern-taught early and pays off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence or synonym loops. Figurative language is sparse, selective—amber reflections “danced,” bottle “a solid piece of resin”—and never muddies causality. High information density: each sentence advances image or motive. Final line’s “lantern of memory” crystallizes without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The “ghost town revived by sealed memory” premise is fresh; refusal to open the bottle subverts standard resurrection tropes. Map-lanterns and working-memory alchemy are particularized inventions. Risk is quiet lyric structure, but it heightens rather than obscures meaning. Could not swap bottle for generic relic without breaking closure.</comment>
