<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Mira’s “scheming pacifist” contradiction is dramatized through silent tactics and the pin transfer; the interior contradiction is shown, not labeled. Elara’s resentment is given a visceral, embodied history that justifies her dissolution. The micro-choice to return the pin carries visible cost (Mira’s own cellular pain) and earns the shift. Minor slip: “cellular memory” is stated more than embodied in peak beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the pin breaks again in Elara’s hand, reweighting the rule that grace must be re-won each shift; cost is felt in Mira’s exhausted exhale. Causal chain holds: pin’s reappearance → memory transfer → resentment loosens → reality stabilizes. Orientation is taught by deliberate disorientation that pays off at closure; no penalty applied. One causal beat could be tighter: the pin’s shift from broken to whole is asserted, not triggered.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The sanctuary’s material flux (marble → sandstone → pulsing tissue) directly constrains Mira’s tactic—she rides the shifts instead of fighting them. The soundless void forces the color-as-music payoff, making the setting a co-protagonist. Spatial choreography remains clean across dissolves. Micro-setting (the pin) also charges the final image, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—can resentment be released without violence—tightens when Mira must risk her own cellular pain to transfer memory. One meaningful deepening: the pin’s re-breakage shows release is cyclical, not final, foreclosing the option of permanent victory. Pressure grows under causal lens; no coincidence required. Cost is legible but could be sharper (a sensory scar or breath lost).</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through the pin’s cycle: forgiveness is not erasure but willingness to let memory shift form. Subtext lives in Elara’s translucent palm accepting the broken pin—silence does the arguing. No final-statement moralizing; the last image of dissolving into “potential” reweights prior wounds without sermon. Ambiguity remains: next shift may fail, keeping complexity intact.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays tight to Mira’s perceptual filter—silver breath, color-as-music—without head-hop. Syntax elongates during flux, then fractures at pin transfer, mirroring emotional cadence. No dialogue, so voice carries all subtext successfully. One register lift—“conceptual repricing”—leans academic but occurs outside peak beat.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Rhythm modulates from long hallucinatory sentences to the staccato “It reappears when needed.” Metaphors (pin as vertebrae, resentment as black knot) are precise, not stacked. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or causality. Minor filter verb cluster around “felt” in memory transfer, but immediacy survives.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The “shifting grace” rule reframes pacifism as active navigation rather than stasis, a fresh angle on familiar forgiveness trope. Cellular memory transfer via broken music-box pin is a specific, non-portable device that grows organically from Elara’s childhood wound. Risky structure—reality shifts without exposition—pays off in resonant final image. Transformation test fails if pin replaced with generic locket, confirming irreplaceability.</comment>
