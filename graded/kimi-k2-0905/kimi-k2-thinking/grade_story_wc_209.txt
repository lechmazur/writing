<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Sable’s quiet obsession with night-blooming flowers is embodied in tactile pigment-mixing and postcard handling; the internal contradiction between scientific curiosity and lyrical hunger is visible in every micro-choice. The cathedral self-portrait moment forces a credible, earned renunciation of external answers, accepting “darkness as invitation” with visible cost: she returns home changed, paints the mural as a love letter to shadow. Reflection % is ~28 but each postcard cue triggers an immediate on-page micro-choice (palette shift, travel resolve, brush stroke), satisfying BRR exception. No status dynamics or secondary on-page characters, so caps for relationship bullets are waived; isolation is the point.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of postcard→cathedral glass→mural layers teaches the “hidden image” rule by 25 % and holds to Charged Poise closure. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 4 and are stable; no penalty. Cost is legible in the final image: Sable’s heart “bloomed like the night flowers,” a crystallized stance that reconfigures her prior search. Closure unit qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration; no causality breaks, though the cathedral apparition edges on coincidence it complicates rather than resolves, permissible under Situational allowance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Amber pavilion, frost-rutted fields, and cathedral stone act as environmental extensions of Sable’s interior ribs; the etched glass literally refracts choice by revealing the self-portrait that forecloses external quest. Micro-setting objects—palette knife, frayed moonflower postcard—constrain pigment choice and travel timing. Sensory hierarchy skews visual, but urgency compresses perception to silver light and cold glass at climax. Setting charges final image: mural shadows “exhale soft perfume,” proving environment reweights closure; meets 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“why flowers bloom at night”—is signaled in paragraph 2 and tightens through each postcard failure, then cathedral revelation reweights knowledge rather than external options. Agency is intellectual endurance and aesthetic renunciation: she accepts an answer that demands interior creation, not data. Cost is conceptual (loss of certainty) yet felt on page in breath-caught hush. Escalation is pattern-deepening, not causal reversal; meets Accumulative/Textural standard, but lacks visible resource loss or tactical narrowing, capping short of 8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from iterated layers—postcards, glass, mural—without explicit moral: darkness as generative invitation rather than absence. Subtext resides in silence (cathedral hush, pavilion twilight) and scent (painted perfume), never stated. Final image reweights premise non-literally, fulfilling 9+ test. One near-miss: “darkness is not an absence, but a quiet invitation” borders thematic echo, but is embedded in perceptual burst, limiting penalty to −0.2.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Sable’s perceptual filter: “honeyed light,” “silver whisper,” syntax breathes with pigment motion. No dialogue, so bullets waived; internal idiom is consistent, painterly, avoids elevated register drift. Patterned repetition (“quiet…” “layers…”) is taught early and pays off in closure cadence. Psychic distance tightens proportionally to dawn revelation, then relaxes into spring return; control evident.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Rhythm modulates from long amber sentences to staccato revelation beats (“Her breath caught;”). Figurative density peaks at glass vision but serves pattern, not overwriting. One scaffold loop: “quiet” appears 7× in last third— functional thematic drum but noticeable; −0.3. No mixed metaphors or simultaneity errors. Information density high: every postcard mention cues action. Closure image untouched by artifact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Premise—artist seeking botanical night secret via antique postcards and cathedral glass—is fresh synthesis of familiar motifs. Risk in static pilgrimage pays off via self-portrait inversion. Particularity of pigment grit on cold glass keeps from template drift. Could edge higher if night-biology lore had been weaponized as constraint; remains conceptual. No close echoes of canon scenes.</comment>
