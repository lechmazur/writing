<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The ghost’s hunger for applause is vivid and embodied (“restless hunger for one more ovation”), and his final act—flicking the coin to weave his memory into the actress—constitutes a credible, earned renunciation with visible cost (his own dissolution). Interiority is concrete, never diagnostic; the synesthetic color-hearing is shown, not labeled. No second on-page character, so relationship crucible is N/A; head-count stays clean. Micro-choice (the coin flip) directly forecloses his lingering presence, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the final echo fuses ghost and actress across the splintered timeline, re-configuring both their futures with undeniable conceptual cost (“she would carry his echo in every standing ovation”). Causal linkage holds: each clap produces echo-ripples that selectively reach the actress, tightening until the coin’s spin crystallizes the transfer. Lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of color-echoes intensifies rather than plot-reverses—and the pattern is taught early (“synesthetic shimmer of applause painted the darkness”). No orientation debt; who/where/when anchored by sentence 3.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The orchard-garden’s glowing fruit and chiming petals function as micro-setting that directly enables the echo-transfer: the ghost’s claps are amplified by the glass-bell petals, a tactile constraint that charges the final image. Spatial choreography is immaculate—ghost “brushing” petals, coin “clinked softly against a stone.” Selective sensory economy (moon-silvered leaves, soft lanterns) mirrors the ghost’s color-hearing without crowding. Hedge maze is more postcard than crucible, but the orchard itself satisfies the 9+ gate by altering the acoustic tactic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“one more ovation”—is signaled in line 2; pressure escalates via density of echo-colors that narrow the ghost’s options to transfer rather than receive. The actress’s despair provides externalized stakes; the ghost’s agency (coin flip) pays the visible price of self-extinction. One meaningful tightening suffices at this length; no reversals needed. Cost is felt: “the garden folded back… its secret safe” implies perpetual erasure of the ghost’s identity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of artistic immortality emerges organically from the ghost’s sacrifice; no explicit thesis stated. The tarot coin’s shifting symbols reweight from memento to conduit, re-pricing memory as transferable art. Final image—“she would carry his echo in every standing ovation”—offers non-literal answer: legacy is the only afterlife. Ambiguity lingers: is the actress brilliant now, or forever haunted? Complexity embraced.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person ghost POV remains stable; no dialogue, so voice tests apply to narrative texture. Sentence rhythm mimics breathless curtain-call cadence—“luminous path,” “synesthetic shimmer”—without monotony. Synesthetic perception supplies a distinct perceptual signature that colors every beat. No filter-verb clusters; diction stays within ghost’s romantic-theatrical lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or causality. Figurative language is patterned and taught early (“applause that painted the darkness”) and paid off in the final “rising nostalgia that healed.” High information density: “petals that chimed like glass bells” fuses sound-touch-visual in one stroke. No mixed metaphors; cadence accelerates then softens to mirror echo fade.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Fusing synesthetic ghost with tarot-coin temporal fracture feels fresh; not a stock after-school-special. Orchard-as-acoustic-amplifier is a novel micro-mechanics twist. Conceptual risk—lyric accumulative structure over plotted reversal—paid off by charged poise closure. Specificity (“moonlight silvered the leaves”) prevents abstract drift.</comment>
