<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Lira’s sensory-mapper trait is vivid—tasting rust, mapping unseen textures—yet her interiority stays abstract: “weight of a withheld truth” is repeated, not embodied. No contradictory impulse is staged in scene; she simply decides to redirect. The predecessor’s failure is told as memory, not dramatized pressure, so the inherited burden feels intellectual, not visceral. Micro-choices (touch shard, close eyes, weave) are present but low-cost; the climactic “deep breath” is the only visible price, barely scaled to a universe-level stake.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the shard’s vanishing reweights her life into perpetual guardianship, cost legible in “compass” image. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pulse, murmur, ripple, echo—pattern taught early and held to last line. Causality is soft: shard “demands” action, rift “would swallow,” but no concrete rule explains why multiversal weave works; we accept via lyric contract. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) satisfied by line 4; no disorientation serves closure, so no penalty.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Repair-bay as micro-setting succeeds: rusted hull plates, cracked concrete, distant-radio static all filter through sensory mapper POV. Spatial choreography stays clean—shadowed corner, half-buried shard, exit door—bodies and objects track. Environment does not constrain tactics (no locked door, no tool shortage) so gate for 9+ missed, but atmosphere is integral. Green glass shard functions as mobile setting fragment that charges final image when it vanishes.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prevent rift from swallowing bay—signaled early; escalation is textural: murmur grows, concrete trembles, air shimmers. One meaningful tightening occurs when she realizes predecessor’s spirit is inside shard; knowledge deepens, options narrow to “redirect or repeat failure.” Cost is conceptual—lifelong guardianship—but not dramatized as tangible loss (no injury, no forfeited desire). Agency is present but low-res: the shard impels, she obeys; no resistance or trade-off staged on page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme of inherited duty emerges through image-chain: shard as fragmented predecessor, compass as burden, cycle as dream-murmur. No explicit moral; resonance comes from final reprise of “murmur” now clarified as call to guardianship. Withheld truth motif evolves from abstract weight to concrete vocation, satisfying CR. Avoids sermon until final sentence, and even that is image-driven (“compass”), earning its profundity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Voice is distinctive: sensory verbs (taste, ripple, shimmer), cyclically spontaneous cadence that mirrors shard pulse. Perceptual signature stays consistent—“sensory map maker” notices texture, metallic memory, heartbeat out of time. No dialogue, so no register clash; free-indirect style clean. Minor filter-verb clusters (“she realized,” “she understood”) dull immediality in two spots, not enough to breach 8-band.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Lyric compression is purposeful, but three adjacent sentences open with “She…” creating template cadence; one paraphrase loop (“weight of the withheld truth” echoed twice). Metaphors stay coherent—rift as tear, shard as heartbeat—no mixed vehicles. Information density high; no scaffolding or synonym churn in climax. Final line ear test strong; rhythm modulates from long breath to clipped “next cycle.”</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: sensory mapper + cyclically spontaneous shard + multiverse rift repair is not stock. Predecessor-becomes-object twist feels inevitable only after reveal, not beforehand, so transformation is partial. Dream-murmur framing and accumulative texture give artistic coherence. Risk is moderate—lyric sci-fi hybrid—but not structurally radical; still, specifics feel memorably idiosyncratic.</comment>
