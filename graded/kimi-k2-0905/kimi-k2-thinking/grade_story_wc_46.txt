<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Mira’s longing is palpable, but interiority drifts into lyrical summary (“pearl of stillness” repeated) rather than contradictory impulse in scene. The final gesture is gentle, yet no micro-choice on the page risks failure or forfeiture; cost is only asserted. Still, her embodied attention to glass and tide keeps the arc credible within lyric bounds.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the square’s constellation of pearls reweights the premise with conceptual cost—light without fire now communal property. Causality is lyric-accumulative rather than tight because/therefore, but the pattern is taught early and holds. Orientation is clear by line 4; no lens ambiguity at end.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Grotto, cliff, mist, and glass function as micro-setting: the shard’s changing surface directly constrains the polishing tactic and charges the final image. Selective sensory triage—salt scent, wet sand, zephyr bloom—mirrors Mira’s filtered attention. Spatial choreography remains clean across the climb and square placement.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Single dominant stake—share light without flame—is signaled early and tightened once when the polished pearl becomes a public beacon. Pressure is situational-lyric: no antagonist, but the village’s need for safe guidance crystallizes her stance. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral; a tangible forfeiture would deepen the 8+ band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: reflection as communal stillness versus solitary stargazing. The pearl’s shift from private memory to shared constellation reweights meaning without moralizing. Final image invites multiple readings—gift, surveillance, or fragile hope—yet avoids forced ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Mira’s perceptual filter: tide-whisper, glass-heft, zephyr-bloom diction is consistent and purposeful. Rhythm modulates between long breath and short pulse, mirroring polishing patience vs. climb urgency. No dialogue, so voice distinction clause is N/A; internal voice remains singular.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, vivid, and loop-free; figurative layering is dense but pattern-taught early (“pearl of stillness” refrain) and pays off at closure. Occasional softeners—“seemed to hold,” “whispered of tides”—slightly dull immediacy in high-pressure beats. No artifact touches the final image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Sea-glass beacon repurposes a familiar eco-lyric trope, but the accretive village constellation and causal link between polishing patience and communal safety feel specific. Risk is moderate—quiet lyric rather than bold structural gamble—yet the synthesis is coherent and memorable.</comment>
