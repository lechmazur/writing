<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Maya’s interiority remains consistent and embodied—her breath “turning to silver mist,” her gloved hands holding the warped globe—yet the emotional arc is somewhat static. She arrives already resolved, so the “pure memory” she seeks never collides with a contradictory impulse that would force a costlier choice. The final beat is gentle catharsis rather than earned renunciation; Elias dissolves without testing her commitment. Still, her perceptual signature is sharp enough to keep the score in the high band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: each shard (shrine, dream analysis, wreck dive) layers density until the pristine globe delivers the resonant reconfiguration. Causality is poetic rather than strictly because/therefore, but the pattern is taught early via the “windows of connection” refrain and lands with undeniable conceptual cost—Elias’s peace is purchased by Maya’s lifelong vigil of listening to strangers’ dreams. The melted globe → intact globe reprise reweights meaning without a hard plot turn, satisfying Charged Poise. Orientation is anchored by line 3; no penalty applied.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The glacier shrine is tactile—ice ribs, rusted door, candle gutter—yet never stalls momentum. The melted snow globe functions as micro-setting: its distorted glass literally refracts choice when Maya decides to leave the pristine twin on the altar, charging the final image. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: a wreck-diver notices “ribs jutting like broken promises,” not tourist landmarks. Environment constrains access—ice cracking like glass—so the setting beats the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“salvage something pure”—is signaled in paragraph 4 and tightens when the pristine globe is revealed as the uncontaminated twin. No live option is foreclosed; the cost is conceptual (she will keep dreaming for others), visible in the final echo of the lullaby. Escalation is textural: each shard adds weight to the idea that memory can be both corrupted and whole. Sufficient for this length, but lacks a visceral trade-off that would push higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the pairing of distorted/intact globes: purity is not unbrokenness but deliberate preservation amid wreckage. Subtext lives in gesture—Elias’s hand passing through rusted metal—rather than exposition. The final image refrains from moralizing; the lullaby echo is the non-literal answer. Minor deduction for the repeated “borrowed starlight” refrain that edges toward motif-declaration rather than resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays tightly attached to Maya’s perceptual filter: she notices “galley rivets like old bruises,” a diver’s gaze. Rhythm modulates—long sentences for breath-hold calm, fragments when ice cracks. No dialogue, so voice is carried by curbed metaphor (“starlight” pattern taught early and reprised at closure). Distinct texture holds under pressure, meeting the 9+ quick test; only the refrain’s slight over-milk keeps it just below the top band.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Strong information density—“candle-lit shrine carved into glacier ice glowed like borrowed starlight” does three jobs in eleven words. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or knowledge. Metaphors stay coherent within glacial/starlight lexicon. A few near-adjacent “starlight” repetitions flirt with over-patterning but do not obscure closure, so remain within −0.2 tolerance.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The snow globe as both corrupted and pristine is a fresh inflection on salvage tropes; the idea that ghosts appear only in “cameo” corners of strangers’ dreams is genuinely new. Risk is taken with accumulative structure rather than plotted reversal, and it pays off in a final image that reweights the premise. Specific detail—“warped glass catching candlelight like a star”—prevents generic transfer; remove the globe and the story collapses. Slight proximity to familiar ice-shrine imagery holds it shy of 9.0.</comment>
