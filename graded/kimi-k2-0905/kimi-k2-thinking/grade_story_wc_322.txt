<comment>Interiority is rich and embodied—Mira’s “fever-hot fingers” and silent steps anchor her obsessive architect mind. The contradiction between control-hungry weaving and her final surrender is dramatized, not declared. No secondary character on-page, so relationship crucible unused. The earned renunciation—“connection is a medium to inhabit”—lands with visible cost (empty hands, broken fever), satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>

<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Closure is a crisp Charged Poise: Mira’s empty hands reweight the premise that connection cannot be grasped, only felt. Causal linkage holds—every knot she ties tightens until the false splice triggers the upward flood; her release is therefore inevitable and costly. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) is taught early via sinew density and pattern cadence, held to final image. No orientation debt; spatial anchors (marble floors, mirror frame) appear within 120 words.</comment>

<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The gallery is not postcard scenery—its breathing walls and gravity-defying water actively constrain tactics. The mirror-as-tool charges the final image by becoming depth-without-reflection, literalizing the story’s conceptual flip. Sensory hierarchy obeys Mira’s architect gaze: she notices geometries, thread tension, pulse in teeth. Micro-setting qualifies; no occupational accuracy required.</comment>

<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—map the texture of connection—tightens when the forced splice triggers the flood, turning her method into the very medium she must surrender to. One meaningful deepening: thread dissolves into water, reweighting the stake from control to immersion. Cost is legible on-page—fever breaks, hands empty, gallery silence restored. Escalation is textural/accumulative, not causal-reversal, fulfilling the lens.</comment>

<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from specific particulars: sinew → water, grasp → inhabit. No final-paragraph moralizing; the last image of audible footsteps implies the new weight of unheld connection. Ambiguity is purposeful—gallery resets, next architect looms—inviting reflection without thesis. Thematic echo absent; no character utters a prompt-like thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is architect-perceptual: “synaptic firing,” “rational enchantment,” “phosphorescence mapping.” Rhythm accelerates under pressure—short pulses mirror thread vibration, then widens into aqueous cadence. No dialogue, so naturalism/subtext bullets N/A. Free-indirect style stays clean; no POV leakage or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>High information density: “sinew thread harvested from dreams of running animals” does world, character, and metaphor in one stroke. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn; figurative language is patterned (water/upward/gravity) and pays off. Mixed metaphors avoided—water becomes thread becomes medium, a single sustained vehicle. Artifacts absent from closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: architectural dream-weaving + upward flood yields a non-obvious metaphor for connection as inhabitable medium. Transformation test passed—swap any detail and the conceptual engine collapses. Risk (gravity-defying water) heightens rather than obscures stakes. No recognizable template or pop-culture echo.</comment>
