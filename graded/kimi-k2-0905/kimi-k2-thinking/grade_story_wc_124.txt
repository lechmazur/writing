<comment>Interiority is lush and embodied (“each breath measured against ghosts of forgotten fragrances”), but the emotional arc is almost entirely retrospective; the present-scene micro-choices are limited to lifting the vial and uncorking it. The contradiction between archival stoicism and necessary mourning is present but not dramatized in real-time until the final beat, so the renunciation feels slightly under-causal. Still, the compressed elegy form justifies the reflective dominance at this length.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>The accumulative pattern (scent → memory → grief → release) is taught by the third sentence and tightens through each aromatic return; closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the opened vial reweights both her future work and the reader’s sense of extinction itself. The “ultraviolet truth” line supplies the conceptual cost (she can never again seal grief away). No因果 turns are required under the lyric-accumulative lens; the final image crystallizes stakes without exposition.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The greenhouse is not backdrop but active pressure cooker: ventilation system, UV lamp, petal-locking mechanics all constrain the moment she uncorks. The crystal vial doubles as micro-setting; its facets cast literal shadows on her cheeks, marrying object to body. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true—lantern broker notices light spectra before botany. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from overhead lights-off to UV halo to exit at dawn.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—will she open the vial and survive the memories?—is signaled early; the Nightshade’s bloom acts as a live clock tightening the air with invisible pollen. Escalation is textural: each extinct scent molecule increases emotional density until the sealed grief becomes unbearable; the UV lamp provides the one visible micro-turn that makes the final choice inevitable. Cost is the permanent loss of her aromatic cage; future “broker of light” identity is foreclosed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges entirely through pattern: scent as archive, tears as respiration for the dead. No abstract statement until the penultimate line, and even that is an imagic inversion (“tears…exhalation”). The final image reweights extinction from loss to stewardship without moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture—uncorking is both surrender and inheritance—creating genuine ambiguity about whether release is triumph or wound.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Voice is unmistakably wistful: syntactic elongation, perfume lexicon, lantern-light metaphors. Compressed lyric diction (“aromatically cautious”) is taught early and sustained. POV distance remains tight-third; no filter-verb stacks. Rhythm modulates—long sentences swell with scent, then fracture at climax (“She finally grieved”). Perceptual signature is consistent: light spectra, glass refraction, molecular ghosts.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud cadence is deliberate and musical; sentence variety is high, with almost no repeated stems. Figurative density is high but patterned—every scent metaphor is paid off by the uncorking. One minor scaffold: “the scent became…” used twice in adjacent sentences mid-story (−0.1). Otherwise information-dense lines carry triple duty (e.g., “compressed elegy for erased species” condenses backstory, theme, and object history).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Premise—perfume as molecular archive of extinction—is non-obvious and fully committed to. Synthesis of lantern-broker profession with grief work feels inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric compression could have collapsed into perfume-ad pastiche, but specificity of extinct species names and UV pollen choreography keeps it fresh. Minor deduction for reliance on elegiac trope train (grief via scent) without subverting the convention further.</comment>
