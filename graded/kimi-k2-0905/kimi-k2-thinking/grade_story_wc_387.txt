<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The philosopher’s quiet endurance is consistent, but Kael’s shift from skeptic to adept happens in a single paragraph of summarized instruction; no contradictory impulse or visible cost is dramatized on the page, so the arc reads as conferred rather than earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a gentle CR—village culture reweighted toward valuing invisible labor—yet the causal chain is loose: Kael’s sudden competence and the villagers’ wordless adoption arrive without setbacks or price, so the “before/after” feels more asserted than forced.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Parapet, moonlit nets, and whisk form a tight micro-setting whose textures (slick stone, silver thread, tines cupping fireflies) directly enable the moon-path method; the final image of whisk-on-stone recharges the earlier tactile cues, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Stake—learning to see hidden effort—escalates once via Kael’s sip of “night-brew,” but no obstacle or trade-off complicates the transfer of skill; pressure plateaus rather than tightens, keeping the conflict in the mild instructional register.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme of invisible labor emerges through recurrent net and firefly imagery rather than exposition; the final whistle-thread tapestry offers a resonant, non-moralizing reconfiguration, though the absence of counter-argument keeps complexity shy of the top band.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lyric third-person hovers at a stable psychic distance, filtering perception through the philosopher’s moon-biased attention; rhythmic repetition (“whispering,” “scintillatingly somber”) functions as patterned elision that pays off in the closing cadence, no head-hopping or register drift detected.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Figurative layering is dense but purposeful—moon paths, firefly constellations, tea-stirred air—each image advances atmosphere or method; occasional adjectival stacks (“scintillatingly somber”) flirt with purple yet stay in character, no loops or scaffold found.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Moonlit net-mending as mystical pedagogy feels fresh, and the bamboo-whisk scepter literalizes quiet rebellion without slipping into quirk; the concept does not radically transform genre expectations, but specificity of firefly-season parapet keeps it clear of template drift.</comment>
