<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The narrator’s interiority is concrete and character-specific—“the rhythm of clandestine footsteps and the whisper of corked bottles” roots her in sensory memory. Contradictory impulses (loyalty to silence vs. need to break it) play out in two visible micro-choices: inserting the fob and rewiring the recorder. The final endurance—vanishing while carrying the captured betrayal—carries felt cost, but the “curiously steadfast” trait is declared rather than embodied in earlier beats, keeping her just shy of 8+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the recorder locked back in the beam and the fob’s tick crystallize a new, fragile stasis—trust broken yet truce preserved. Causal chain holds: fob→compartment→rewire→capture; each step forecloses alternatives. The sunrise deadline tightens the final moment, and the cost (perpetual unease, silence she must now carry) is legible in the last line. Minor drift: the “sound of trust breaking” is conceptually repeated without new inflection at peak.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The rotting pier’s salt-slick timbers, lantern-lit moonshine stalls, and hidden lock in the beam are not backdrop but tactical terrain: the compartment literally enables the plot turn. Sensory hierarchy mirrors urgency—lantern flame, singed sleeve, ticking fob—each filtered through the runner-daughter’s trained ear for hush. Spatial choreography is flawless: we track her crawl, reach, withdrawal, vanish. Environment charges the final image—sunrise spilling over water while unease hums beneath—meeting the 9- gate requirement.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“truce of hush” vs. stranger’s ledger—signals early and tightens through sunrise deadline. Single meaningful escalation: rewiring the recorder narrows options from physical sabotage to covert evidence, forcing stance crystallization. Cost is visible—she must swallow betrayal and live with the uneasy silence she preserves. Agency stays protagonist-driven; coincidence only complicates (wind relights lantern).</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges inductively: silence as both sanctuary and prison. The captured recording becomes a tangible shard of broken trust, reweighting the value of hush without moralizing. Subtextual tension between preservation and exposure threads through lantern imagery and ticking brass. Final image—“lullaby that hums just before a storm”—offers resonant ambiguity, though a touch of explanatory echo (“trust, once broken, can be measured…”) slightly dilutes implicit power.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>First-person voice carries distinct perceptual signature: salt-memory, cork-whisper, singed sleeve—sensorium of a clandestine childhood. Syntax tightens under pressure—fragments like “Time pressed against my ribs” mimic heartbeat cadence. No dialogue, so evaluation focuses on internal coherence; no head-hop or filter clutter. Patterned elision (“the truce of hush”) is taught early and paid off in the final tick, satisfying lyric mode.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Line-level craft is lean and propulsive: concrete nouns (“splintered boards,” “brass gears”) anchor every sentence. Mixed metaphors avoided; “forgotten promise” is singular and apt. No scaffold loops; each sentence advances image or causality. Minor register lift (“conceptual repricing”) sits outside POV lexicon but appears only once and does not touch closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Familiar tropes—pirate market, hidden compartment, sunrise deadline—are refreshed through sensory specificity and the inversion of smuggled sound rather than goods. The “truce of hush” converts silence itself into negotiable currency, a non-obvious conceptual twist. Risk is taken in the quiet, lyric closure rather than violent confrontation, and it pays off in earned unease. Could edge higher if the stranger’s betrayal carried an equally original angle beyond ledger-and-gold.</comment>
