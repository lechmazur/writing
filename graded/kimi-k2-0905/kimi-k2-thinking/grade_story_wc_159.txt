<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Lyra’s interior contradiction—preservation as quiet defiance versus the knowledge that nothing can be fully restored—remains vivid and embodied in every micro-choice. The fracture in her heart mirroring the cracked tube gives a sharp, recurring image of cost without slipping into diagnostic talk. Endurance is earned: she keeps the broken chime hanging, accepting imperfection as the price of continuation. Only the absence of a second on-page character keeps this just shy of the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the final sunrise image crystallizes her perpetual, lonely ritual while the cracked tube’s whistle carries undeniable conceptual cost. Accumulative/textural lens holds throughout—each lit orchid adds density and the regret cadence tightens. The early orientation of “opal library above clouds” anchors place and scale by line 3, satisfying Orientation Test. Slight deduction for one abstract beat (“museum of extinct feelings” repeated without new constraint) preventing 9.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Environment, body, and tool trifecta: the cracked bamboo tube functions as micro-setting that both enables and wounds the song; Lyra’s fractured heart is the body-in-setting; the opal shelves supply vertical scale that pressures her solitary climb. Sensory hierarchy stays filtered through her caretaker bias—she notices shimmer, silence, petal fracture, not tourist vistas. Spatial choreography is clean: she “moves gently systematic,” breath-to-pitch-to-light sequence tracks without drift. One hairline slip—“across the museum of extinct feelings” drifts toward abstract landmark—but the object continually constrains her tactics, satisfying 9-band gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve the sound of forgotten names—signals in line 4 and tightens through each orchid illumination. Agency is accumulative: every breath-and-note cycle forecloses the option of perfect restoration, visible in the growing spectral syllables. Cost is legible: the emptied halls and her own cracked heart widen with each echo. No causal reversal, but the cadence shift from “hope” to lingering “foxglove regret” supplies the required deepening under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</question><comment>Theme emerges implicitly from the oxymoron of “deserted marvels” and the cracked instrument that still sings—no moral spoken. The final sunrise that paints “hope” while regret lingers offers resonant, non-literal repricing of preservation itself. Recurring glass orchids and bamboo fracture shift meaning: beauty=fragility=obligation. One beat of overt abstraction (“museum of extinct feelings” label) holds it from 9.2.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is crystal: translucent shelves, frozen-tear petals, foxglove regret—diction stays inside Lyra’s lexicon of delicate decay. Rhythm modulates with task: short noun clusters when she hums, longer liquid lines for dawn light. No head-hopping; single POV holds. One template cadence (“the echo of a long-forgotten song” repeated thrice) prevents 9.0.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings shift from prepositional to verb-led. Information density high: one sentence often performs atmosphere + interior + motion (“She began to hum…splitting it into harmonic fragments”). No mixed metaphors; vehicles stay coherent (sound as light, fracture as wound). Scaffold-free except one adjacent echo of “extinct feelings”; clarity at closure untouched.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Premise—sentimental library in the sky tended by a glass-orchid archivist using a cracked wind chime to re-animate extinct names—feels inevitable yet fresh. Synthesis of sound-preservation with fragile beauty is non-obvious and fully committed. Risk taken: lyric accumulative structure over causal plot pays off in final sunrise image. No derivative echoes; specificity (foxglove regret, opal spires) anchors universals.</comment>
