<question>1</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Interiority is lyrically specific (“stretched muscle contracting”) but drifts toward abstract self-labeling (“her claustrophobia remained”). The silence-collecting obsession motivates every beat, yet the inversion-hour decision is driven by external cosmology rather than an interior choice that alters stakes. Micro-choices (climb, seal the doll) are present, but no contradictory impulse complicates the ascent; fear is announced, not embodied mid-air. Closure image reweights the bunker as “garden,” a credible conceptual renunciation, yet the cost feels conceptual rather than viscerally felt on her body.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: silence flavors accrue in patterned refrains until the high-altitude “flavorless” break reweights the gilded hush. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive late (~150 w) but the delay is purposeful, mirking claustrophobia; payoff at closure waives penalty. Closure lands as Charged Poise: “prison could hold a garden” crystallizes options with undeniable conceptual cost. Persistent constraint—daily sealing ritual—shapes tactics, but the inversion hour is external machinery, not because/therefore linkage; causality is soft, acceptable under chosen lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Bunker concrete, ventilation metallic tang, and porcelain tactile chill are filtered through child-biased perception. Trellis micro-setting functions as bridge and altitude constraint, charging the final image. Spatial choreography is clean: fall returns her to bunker roof, no impossible positions. World rule (gravity inversion) is taught early and remains consistent; altitude silence is causal, not ornamental.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake: harvest the unattainable gilded hush. Escalation occurs through density increase—each silence sampled heightens the missing golden note—until altitude-quiet supplies the reweighting. No visible price is paid (no injury, lost tool, social cost); the cost is conceptual, legible but not visceral. External inversion drives climax, not her agency, yet the pattern-break suffices for Accumulative design; tightening is present but gentle.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges: silence as cultivable, paradoxically alive substance. Subtext operates in gesture—doll raised to “drink the quiet”—rather than exposition. Final image reweights bunker from tomb to garden without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers: is silence preservation liberation or new captivity? Complexity is invited, not tidied.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person lyric achieves a consistent hush-texture: sibilants and soft consonants echo theme. Sentence rhythm modulates—long breathless climbs vs clipped bunker sealing—mirroring pressure. Perceptual signature is child-particular: air “flavor,” doll “humming.” No dialogue, so no voice convergence; register remains within plausible child lexicon save for occasional elevated “xenial,” which reads as inherited storybook diction rather than error.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm is deliberate; patterned anaphora (“She tasted…”) teaches cadence yet risks template monotony. Metaphors are coherent—threads, garden, echo—no mixed vehicles. Scaffolding minimal; no paraphrase loops. Information density high: single sentences layer silence-flavor with emotional shift. Occasional elevated diction (“intangibly tangible”) is earned concept-neologism, not register drift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Premise fusion: anti-gravity hour + silence sommelier is non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Tropes (claustrophobic child, doll talisman) are re-inflected through sensory alchemy. Specific detail—“metallic quiet of the ventilation shaft”—anchors freshness. Risk in compressed lyric pays off: closure reconfigures bunker as garden without retreating from darkness. Could tip into higher band with one more irreplaceable causal hinge.</comment>
