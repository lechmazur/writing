<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Kael’s interiority stays concrete—maps as scars, solder joints bearing loss—so grief never abstracts into cliché. The censer foot’s tug translates desire into micro-choices (midnight activations, circuit soldering) that visibly foreclose retreat. Final stasis—phone silent, foot now anchor—pays the earned cost of irrevocable reunion. Minor slip: “dust-streaked face” drifts toward stock image, but embodied tension elsewhere holds.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative lens: each midnight call layers density until the seventh “Now” collapses possibility into a single resonator pulse. Closure is a Charged Poise—bridge open, sister’s voice audible, cost crystallized in the bronze dimming. Orientation clean before 120 words; causal chain (moon → weight → circuit → bridge) never breaks. No off-stage teleportation; every new frequency is soldered on-page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Starlit signal station functions as micro-setting: frozen dish gears, salvage shelves, lone handset—all constrain what can be built. Bronze censer foot operates as portable setting-extension, its warming/cooling guiding hand placement under the dish. Spatial choreography holds across soldering beats; no floating props. Final image—station groaning yet resonator stable—mirrors internal state without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reverse-migrate the lost before full moon—tightens with each waxing night; censer weight is visible countdown. One meaningful escalation: seventh-night “Now” forces activation, narrowing options to now-or-never. Cost legible in station shudder and bronze dimming. Agency resides in Kael’s soldering decisions; coincidence complicates (hydraulic failure) but does not resolve.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of re-navigation emerges from solder, starlight, and bronze pulse—never stated. Sister’s voice returned as star reframes loss from barren map to traversible field. Final image reweights prior motifs (map, foot, phone) without moralizing. Raw solace feels earned because the price (irreversible bridge, station strain) is on-page.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Perceptual signature strong: “black tide lapping,” “rust tongues of old speakers,” diction metallic yet grief-laden. Rhythm compresses under deadline—“midnight call, seventh night, Now”—then lengthens into quiet final sentence. No head-hopping; psychic distance stays tight to Kael. Filter verbs minimal; syntax mirrors solder-flick precision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>High information density: single sentence can solder, signal, and emotion (“Each solder joint hummed with the memory of his sister’s laughter”). No paraphrase loops; metaphors stay consistent (tide, scream, pulse). Read-aloud rhythm breathes with moon phases. Minor alliteration clusters (“silent scream”) but do not obscure causality or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: bronze censer foot as lunar compass plus reverse-migration signal bridge feels inevitable yet unvisited. Risky accumulative structure pays off in Charged Poise rather than set-piece fight. Specificity of salvage-wire, patina, dish gears roots concept in tactile world. Transformation test fails if sister generic—here her laughter haunts solder, so story is non-transferable.</comment>
