<comment>Kael’s shame-to-resolve arc is legible, but interiority drifts into therapeutic self-labeling (“quiet resolve,” “dark pressure into bright gems”) instead of embodied contradiction. Micro-choices (turning the bolt, collecting dust) are present yet feel pre-explained by the cosmic rule-set rather than revealing new facets of him. The parallel-Kael irony is asserted, not dramatized, so the cost feels conceptual, not personal. Meets baseline change; misses the sharper internal split that would lift the arc to high band.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands cleanly: the crystalline crackle reweights the premise (pressure → diamonds) with visible cost (illicit bolt-turn, communal fund). Causal chain is pseudo-scientific—rule introduced ad-hoc—yet internally consistent; lens is Hybrid (causal bolt act + accumulative lyric reprise) and holds to final image. Orientation is swift; no prop teleporting. Escalation is one-step, not tightening spiral, so pressure plateaus before snap; still satisfies single-turn requirement at this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Submarine bolt, pressure gauge, sapphire spore-light, and cavern choreography are tactile and trackable; bolt reprise charges closure image. Sensory hierarchy reflects Kael’s tunnel-focused guilt—glow, hiss, grain of crystal—never catalogued. World rule (“pressure = diamonds”) is learned through action, not dump. Setting functions as micro-lab that literally constrains the final tactic; qualifies for 9+ gate but slight over-adornment in “threads that held that seam taut” keeps it just below.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—repay community, redeem self—signaled early; pressure crystallizes in single decisive surge. Agency is present: Kael reprograms timer, turns bolt, shoulders risk of owner’s wrath. Cost is visible (illicit act, communal fund) yet feels low because external jeopardy (owner, law, physics) never threatens back; tension is conceptual. Sufficient tightening for 600-word scope but lacks a mid-course option narrowing that would push into 8.8+ band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Theme of “broken promises reforged under pressure” emerges through bolt, diamonds, and glitch-text without sermon. Final line reweights glow as “seam between shadows and wonder,” offering conceptual repricing. Avoids tidy moral; ambiguity lingers on parallel-Kael’s intent. One thematic echo (“pressure is a promise”) is repeated rather than evolved; keeps it shy of 8.5 resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays close to Kael’s perceptual filter—flicker of phone, grain of bolt, hiss of air. Rhythm modulates: longer clauses for cavern awe, staccato for glitch texts. Diction skews slightly literary for a volunteer mycologist (“virtuously mischievous,” “shadowseam wonder”) but consistent within mythic tone. No head-hop; voice coherence maintained under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm is fluid; sentence lengths vary. Some metaphor stacks (“exhaling oxygen and secrets,” “stardust, small stars”) border purple yet support lyric tone. No scaffold loops; information density high. One mixed metaphor (“world split into parallel lines” then “threads tightened”) slightly muddies physics but does not obscure causality at closure. Minor register creep toward grandeur keeps it from 8.0+.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Fusion of bioluminescent farm + submarine bolt + quantum text is fresh; diamond alchemy trope is revived through mycelium pressure, not magic wand. Risk taken with parallel-dimension rule-set pays off in conceptual repricing. Specificity of salvaged submarine gauge anchors improbable science. Could edge higher if midpoint revealed an unforeseen constraint born from same elements.</comment>
