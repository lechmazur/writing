<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Kaelen’s interiority is concrete and embodied—her perceptual filter (“fractured light dancing across walls,” “golden shadows thickening the air”) stays specific to her synesthetic science-artist mind. Contradictory impulses are shown in the same beat: she clings to imperfection while chasing measurable truth, crystallized when she tilts the lens “one degree off-center.” The micro-choice charges the closing image: she accepts dismissal of her data as “corrupted,” a visible cost that earns the resonant stance. Mara's function is thin—her skepticism acts as a foil, but her sudden trembling on the lens feels more plot servant than crucible pressure; still, the primary arc holds.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the final bell-ring reweights the premise—connection needs flaw, not fidelity. The “golden shadows pulsing like a remembered heartbeat” crystallizes the cost under Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality is clean: each spin of the lens and bell-tilt because/therefore reveals new overtones, culminating in the deliberate imperfection that redefines success. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) appear within 60 words; no ambiguity or disorientation persists.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The carbide lens serves as micro-setting that constrains tactics: its scarred curvature is the active variable Kaelen manipulates to produce the new harmonics. Spatial choreography is faultless—light, lens, and centrifuge tracked across every micro-move. Sensory hierarchy mirrors POV bias: Kaelen notices acoustic decay times, dust motes, breath-frequency, never visual tourist catalog. The lab’s lost-sounds premise is learned through action (ringing, spinning, recording) rather than exposition, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—the 0.3 % “missing” texture—signals early and tightens when Kaelen introduces the deliberate flaw, foreclosing the option of perfect data. Cost is visible: she knowingly records “corrupted” files, forfeiting institutional acceptance. Pressure escalates because/therefore under Causal lens: each harmonic layer revealed demands the next manipulative tilt. Mara’s youth-certainty supplies external pressure, but the true antagonist is the epistemic system that privileges 99.7 % accuracy; the protagonist’s agency directly confronts that rule-set.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: imperfection as the conduit of communion. The final image of “golden shadows pulsing like a remembered heartbeat” reweights prior material—what was called corruption is now the sacred residue. Subtext operates in gesture: Mara’s trembling fingertip on the breathing lens confesses conversion the dialogue never utters. No final-paragraph moralizing; the bell’s last overtone is the non-literal answer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person close maintains consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature is distinctively Kaelen’s (sound as tactile landscape, light as molasses). Syntax lengthens and breathes during harmonic discovery, then compresses into sharp declaratives under Mara's challenge, showing pressure-responsive modulation. No dialogue contamination; when Mara speaks, her cadence is clipped, youthful certainty contrasting Kaelen’s sonorous interior monologue. Free indirect style stays clean: “she suspected its irregular curvature might bend...echo” reads as internal inference, not authorial intrusion.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally; sentences open with participial clauses, concrete nouns, or prepositional coils, avoiding template cadence. Information density is high: “golden shadows pooled beneath it like molasses, thickening the air until she could almost grasp the silence between heartbeats” does triple sensory/figurative/emotional duty. One mixed-metaphor risk—“handhold leading deeper into the architecture of memory”—is minor and does not touch closure. No scaffold, loops, or filter-verb clusters; every paragraph advances knowledge, intention, or charge.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The premise—sound as physical memory recoverable through flawed optics—is fresh synthesis; no genre template dictates centrifugal breath-matched lens + prism-song. Risky choice to hinge climax on a 1-degree tilt pays off: imperfection becomes sacred instrument, not flaw. Specificity anchors novelty: scarred carbide glass, bauxite-miner grandfather, 0.3 % “error” reweighted as totality. If names and places changed, the emotional arc would collapse—proof of non-generic integration.</comment>
