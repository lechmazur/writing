<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The lone narrator’s motives—survival, ancestral tether, and the need to keep moving—stay legible throughout; the compass-pull micro-choice that swings him toward the hatch is an embodied beat. Interiority is concrete (“each heartbeat echoing twice as long”) and avoids stock therapy-speak. The only minor drag is a slight over-cranked lyricism that can edge toward performed awe rather than fresh perception. Still, the endurancecost of stepping into the void is felt and earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the hatch opens, the station silhouette is left behind, and the compass-rose halo re-weights “true north” as internal resolve—conceptual cost is unmistakable. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern builds through silence-sketch-silence iterations, then snaps to departure. Orientation is anchored by word ~80; no causal or prop jumps. A hairline slip: “stretched time” is asserted more than demonstrated, but it never breaks the logic of the exit window.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The deck’s slow spin, glass ribs, and star ribbons are filtered through an astronomer’s trained eye; selective sensory economy (sound of absent footfalls, graphite scritch) mirrors isolation. The gilded compass doubles as micro-setting and tool, constraining the final orienting twist of the wrist. Spatial choreography stays coherent as the protagonist steps from inner dome to outer catwalk to void. No credibility stumbles; station physics stays self-consistent.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes are simple but sharp: stay = fossilized echo, leave = uncharted black. One meaningful tightening—the unexplained glimmer at Andromeda’s edge—flips confusion into urgent choice under the Accumulative lens. The price paid is the station’s certainty, abandoned; cost is visible in the silhouette fade. No off-stage rescue or coincidence; escalation is internal but sufficient for this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of self-directed navigation emerges organically: “true north was not a place but a decision.” No explicit moralizing; the reweighted compass image in the last line lets silence speak. Motif of anniversary sketching returns only to be transformed into a live star-chart of hope, avoiding token symbolism. The reader is left to feel that mapping one’s own void is endless labor—an unsettling, honest resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>First-person voice carries a stargazer’s precise lexicon (“Andromeda field,” “graphite stick”) salted with maritime ancestry; rhythm swells and thins like breath in a helmet. No head-hop; distance stable. Occasional elevated cadence (“blessed pariah,” “cathedral”) risks liturgical perfume but stays intentional to the hush. Line-level lyricism is controlled and serves the echoed-silence texture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Sentence music varies; no scaffold loops or filter-verb stacks. Metaphors stay physical—“drop of ink in water,” “ribbons of light”—and don’t tangle. One paraphrase ripple: “silence was not empty; it carried the ghost…” is immediately echoed two sentences later; minor. Opening and final lines anchor stakes and image cleanly. Peak beat at hatch is uncluttered, propelling exit.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Found-family-heirloom-in-void is familiar, but the compass-rose as orienting heart rather than magnetic pole supplies fresh spin. Ritual sky-sketching on anniversaries is a lovely, specific cultural graft onto survival narrative. Risk is moderate—quiet interior SF—but execution commits fully; no retreat to safer tropes. Lacks a truly startling conceptual leap, hence stops just short of the 8.5+ band.</comment>
