<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The archivist’s drive to protect the archives is declared rather than dramatized; we never see a concrete stake erased or threatened, so the “latent blaze” reads as abstract motto. Interiority is atmospheric (“purpose ignite within her chest”) but lacks contradictory impulse under pressure; she glides from beat to beat without error or self-doubt. The only micro-choice—leaping back through the threshold—happens once the inversion is already ending, so the cost feels environmental rather than character-forced. Competence is total, struggle is nil, so change is muted; the ending stasis is more exit than renunciation.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands cleanly: she secures the combinations and escapes as gravity rights, a decisive change with felt time-pressure. Causality is mostly because/therefore (prism reveals → she goes → records → flees), but the grotto’s “only when gravity inverts” rule is asserted, not earned by prior world-logic. Orientation is swift and spatial choreography tracks. The lens holds as situational-pressure; no retro-patching, but luck (the hour arrives tonight) rather than agency triggers entry.</comment>

<comment>Setting is vivid and selective: candle flicker, slick serpentine walls, mist that clings to skin; sensory hierarchy obeys POV urgency. The prism itself steps in as micro-setting/tool that constrains action—without it the doodle stays invisible and the quest fails, so it charges the final rainbow image. No white-room syndrome; distance and drift under reversed gravity are tactile. World rule (inversion window) is learned through action, not exposition.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>Stakes are abstract—“protect archives from erasure” is named but never dramatized by an on-page threat, so pressure stays conceptual. Escalation is purely temporal: the hour slips toward reset, forcing exit; no option is foreclosed or traded off by protagonist choice. The tightening is situational, not moral or tactical; she merely finishes the task and leaves. Cost is the squeeze of time, but because the combinations’ future use remains hypothetical, the price feels deferred.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of vigilance emerges through the prism’s refracted light and the copied glyphs, avoiding explicit sermon. The final rainbow splash on the empty margin reweights the doodle as spent but the archivist as living sentinel—an image that invites reflection without moral tag. Subtext stays in objects rather than assertion. Complexity is limited by the absence of any counter-argument or visible consequence; vigilance is celebrated, never tested.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited maintains consistent perceptual filter: archivist’s professional notice of condensation, glyph faintness, threshold flicker. Syntax is controlled, rhythm flexes with weightless drift vs. pounding exit. No head-hopping or register drift; diction stays within scholarly yet urgent range. Voice is serviceable, not idiosyncratic—could swap for another competent archivist voice without loss.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, scaffold-free; openings vary, no template cadence. Metaphors are coherent (threshold “flickering like heat haze”) and kept sparse under pressure. Information density is good—each sentence advances motion or image. Minor near-duplicates (“the mist clung… the mist thickening”) but not looped; no artifact obscures causality or closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>The gravity-invertible grotto and prism-readable ink synthesize familiar tropes into a fresh retrieval quest. Specificity of the “clandestinely luminous doodle” and the “seeds of vigilance” gives the magic system a scholarly rather than heroic tilt. No close echoes of famous scenes; premise is recognizable yet personalized through archival stakes. Risk is moderate: structure is linear, but inversion-window mechanic feels novel in this context.</comment>
