<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Engineer’s interior contradiction—guild-trained logic vs. tear-salted empathy—animates every beat; the 7.8-hertz hum is felt in ribs and tongue, not just declared. Micro-choice chain (key strike → coat buttons → vocal match) visibly prices her body. The closure image of her altered heartbeat keeps the change corporeal. Still, the “logically emotional” tag is repeated rather than freshly tested in the final third, capping perfection.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: locked ice → key strike → vibrational duel → dissolution of guardian → self-reconfiguration. Each therefore-link narrows options until the ice bridge of sound becomes the only path. The guardian’s release and her re-tuned heart are on-page Decisive Change with felt cost. No teleporting props or soft resets; the crypt key’s earlier clang pays off in the coat-button harmonic.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Drift-ice marina is never backdrop: it locks boats, sings under boots, and finally glass-mirrors the sky—environment actively constrains and rewards tactics. Bronze key, whale-bone flute, and wool coat act as micro-settings whose material properties (conductivity, resonance, weight) dictate usable moves. Sensory hierarchy obeys her engineer bias: frequency first, colour second. The rose-gold mirror at closure reprises sunset colour and sonic stillness, charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—free the guardian or remain ice-locked—tightens when boats are crystallized shut. Mid-scene reversal: instead of fleeing by skiff, she must weaponize the very ice that imprisons her. Price is visceral: frozen tears, rib-vibrations, coat heavy with salt-sound. Escalation is cleanly sonic: each frequency step strips away one escape option until only the duet remains.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of absolution-as-resonance emerges from the concrete duel of hertz values, never sermonized. The whale-bone flute’s ancient prayers and the drowned keeper’s gratitude reweight “grief” from abstract to audible, making the final silence a moral reckoning. Final image—engineer walking toward lamp-kindling—carries Charged Poise: duty renewed, frequency altered, cost unpaid but fully felt. No tidy moral, only a re-tuned life.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Violet-stained lyric third-person stays close inside her perceptual filter: “tasting bronze and winter,” “sound as ethereal hand.” Syntax compresses under stress—“Adapt or surrender: no third option”—then elongates during sonic duel, mirroring breath control. No head-hopping; focalization remains strict. Occasional elevated diction (“sonic absolution,” “sorrow’s geometry”) reads as guild jargon she would internalize, so register holds.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm modulates from ice-crisp fragments to sustained musical clauses, echoing the key’s sustained note. No scaffold loops; each sentence advances frequency, body, or stakes. Metaphors stay coherent within sonic physics—no mixed vehicles. Only minor density in the “molten coin” sunset line, but it pays off in the mirrored ice, so forgivable.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Fusion of maritime gothic with spectral acoustics feels inevitable yet unseen before: lighthouse engineer vs. frequency parasite via bronze tuning fork. Whale-bone flute, crypt key, and 7.8-hertz grief are not quirky ornaments but operational tools. Risky lyric compression teaches its pattern early and lands cleanly. The drowned keeper’s star-scatter reprices every prior mention of “unburied grief,” making the concept freshly legible.</comment>
