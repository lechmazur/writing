<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid—grief “pooled like dark water,” the bouquet whispered to—but the performer’s contradictory impulses (informing vs. carving) are asserted rather than enacted in a single pressured moment; the final stance is credible yet the cost feels diffuse because the dog report is only foreshadowed, not dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the performer accepts the remade hush as survival canvas, cost felt in “fragile, fleeting lightness.” Accumulative lens holds—each whittling/narration beat thickens texture until the dawn placement crystallizes the stance—though the dog beat is a soft tangent that slightly dilutes the final tightening.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Farmhouse window, turbine shadows, shavings on floorboards—selective sensory triad anchors every beat; the turbines’ “phantom limbs” mirror the performer’s emotional amputation and charge the final windowsill offering. Micro-setting (knife, bouquet, pine block) constrains the only possible rebellion, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—lightness inside mandated blankness—tightens through pattern break: nightly whittling/narration accumulates until the dog intrusion tests whether complicity will expand; the refusal to change tactics (reporting the dog tomorrow) forecloses mercy and makes the cost legible. One meaningful deepening suffices under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme—art as clandestine affect inside forced affectlessness—emerges from the performer’s dual rituals; the final image of a wooden figurine offered to turbine-cut sky reweights the “remade hush” from oppression to medium, avoiding moralizing. Complexity survives because complicity remains unpunished yet un-erased.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person hovers at performer’s shoulder, filtering perception through theatre idiom—“voice borrowed from the theatre,” “soliloquy of steam”—and compresses time into lyric loops without losing clarity; turbine groans and petal crunch carry distinct sonic texture. No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens credibly under bulb-lit hush.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Rhythm breathes with task: long sentences for narration, clipped fragments for knife strokes; no scaffold loops, only one paraphrase overlap (“remade hush” / “hush that would never be the same”) that serves thematic reprise. Metaphors stay coherent—turbines as scissors, shavings as confessions—without crowding the final image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Fusing happiness-police dystopia with miniature wood-carving theatre feels fresh; the accretive lyric structure mirrors the whittling act itself. Risk is moderate—quiet ending, no twist—but specificity of turbine-shadow choreography and bouquet dust lifts the concept above standard oppression templates.</comment>
