<comment>Mira’s interior contradiction—self-effacing crone vs. astute spy—embodies every micro-choice; the moment she folds the tapestry into her cloak the renunciation of safety is earned and costly. Embodied emotion (“weight of unheard stories pressing against her chest”) keeps diagnostic speak at bay. Flaws (frailty, secrecy) directly complicate her gambit, not merely decorate her. The only bar to 9+ is that the external world stays largely off-stage, so status shifts remain implied rather than staged.</comment>

<comment>Accumulative lens: each stitch-layer thickens tension until the fabric itself glows, delivering a Charged Poise—Mira steps into darkness carrying the hidden star, options re-ordered, risk now inevitable. The script message (“The coup will rise with the harvest moon”) is the single causal pivot that re-weights all prior texture; cost is legible in her snapped breath and the corridor swallowing her. One silent transition (observatory → hall) is taught by echoed footfalls; orientation anchored by word 40. No plot amnesia, no soft reset—static threat remains. Closure lands on-page with conceptual cost: silence itself is now a weapon she must wield.</comment>

<comment>Cobalt walls “absorb light” and the eternal candle’s blue-white heart are not backdrop but tactical constraints—only that flame can reveal the hidden star, hence the tapestry must be folded under its glow before flight. Autumn leaves scraping stone fuse auditory texture with thematic hush, charging the final image of Mira vanishing into the same echoed silence. Spatial choreography holds: frame, stand, corridor, cloak pocket—no drifting landmarks. Micro-settings (flame, cloth, pocket) literally guide her choices; setting therefore passes the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—prevent the coup—tightens through textile density: each new stitch forecloses the option to remain apolitical. The harvest-moon deadline introduces a living clock; adjacent possibilities narrow from infinite futures to one hidden star. Agency is intellectual (decoding flame-flicker) but still active; cost is social exposure—she abandons the safety of “foolish old woman.” Escalation is textural, not explosive, fitting the accumulative lens; a sharper visible price (e.g., dropped thread, burned finger) would have pushed higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from pattern: listening in silence → stitching invisible maps → weaponizing hush itself. No moral is stated; the final image of flame-led footfalls reweights silence as both shield and trigger. Subtext operates through object—flame as syllabic voice, cloth as covert archive—avoiding thematic lecture. The refusal to moralize keeps ambiguity alive: is she savior or provocateur? Resonance lingers in the reader’s newly suspicious ear.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Lyrical third-person hovers at psychic distance that still preserves Mira’s idiom—“galaxy-chart embroiderer,” “adjacent possibilities”—syntax grows shorter under pressure (“She stitched faster, the needle a blur”). Filter verbs avoided; perception is tactile (silver thread, cobalt absorption). No dialogue to corrupt voice; narrative diction stays consistent, poetic yet precise. The quiet ear motif threads every sentence, proving prose as character.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentences perform double duty: “autumn leaves scraped the stone floor like whispered secrets” seeds both soundscape and conspiracy. No loops, no scaffold; information density high—each paragraph either advances stitch, flame, or threat. Figurative language is controlled: only one metaphor per beat, never stacked; physical logic intact. Opening and closing lines echo without self-plagiarism, creating cadence bookends that tighten the whole.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Combines star cartography, textile espionage, and monastic silence into a synthesis that feels brand-new yet inevitable. The eternal candle as silent phonograph is an image I’ve not seen, and its rule—only flame can read the hidden star—drives the entire climax. Risk: climax is a quiet fold-and-walk rather than set-piece, but coherence holds. Specificity of craft (silver thread, spiral galaxy arms as “grasping hands”) prevents abstract allegory.</comment>
