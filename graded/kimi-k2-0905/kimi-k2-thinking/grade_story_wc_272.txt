<comment>Elara’s painterly eye and physical tremor are embodied in every tactile beat; her refusal to paint “what people showed her” becomes the micro-choice that re-threads the lighthouse. The interior contradiction—yearning for light yet embracing darkness—remains alive in scene, not summary. Closure’s cost is felt: she abandons the safety of surfaces, nails humming with un-lived lives, a credible renunciation scaled to 700 words.</comment>

<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each silk thread layers density until the pattern ruptures into the final re-weaving. Orientation is taught early—“salt and silverfish devour forgotten atlases”—and pays off when mortar weeps salt at climax. The decisive reconfiguration lands in the charged image of an eye-weeping box lid; the price is the permanent ache she elects to keep. Causality is internal—thread-touch → vision → re-stitch—but coherent under the lyric drive.</comment>

<comment>Micro-setting triumph: the splintered tarot box becomes the pivot-object that constrains every tactical choice; its vibrating silk literally directs her fingers. Lighthouse geometry breathes—walls exhale, floor tilts—without ever losing spatial track. Salt, dust, and spindle-starved darkness are filtered through a painter’s sensory hierarchy; visual collapses into haptic. The weeping-eye carving on the restored box recharges every prior mention of glassy eyes and weeping mortar.</comment>

<comment>Single dominant stake—can she endure the necessary darkness to paint again—tightens when each untangled thread deletes a possible life. Agency is continuous: she decides to touch, to untangle, to weave; no coincidence intervenes. Escalation is textural: the hum under her nails grows louder, the walls press closer, the ink of time pools in her palms. Cost is visible—“her fingertips thrummed with new memory”—and forecloses the path of luminous surfaces.</comment>

<comment>Theme emerges from the inversion of light = knowledge: the only honest light is the cold ache living in darkness. Motif of “painting what is concealed” reweights from portrait to fate-weaving without meta-commentary. Final image—shadow and light as collaborators—reprises the eye motif and offers conceptual repricing: art must embrace the unshown. No moralizing sentence; the resonance is imagistic and earned.</comment>

<comment>Voice is painterly synesthesia—glassy eyes, salt weeping, ink-flowing time—yet stays within a bereaved artist’s lexicon. Rhythm accelerates into breathless fragmentation during thread-visions, then relaxes into the final declarative calm. No head-hopping; third-person hovers at a distance that still permits embodied tremor. Filter verbs (“she saw,” “she felt”) are minimal and voice-motivated, retaining immediacy.</comment>

<comment>Line-level craft is dense yet lucid: “dust motes became stars, then dust again” compresses cosmic scale into a blink. No mixed metaphors; lighthouse = needle, thread = timeline, ache = light—all cohere. Scaffolding absent; no paraphrase loops. Occasional elevated diction (“luminescent exhaustion”) is justified by Elara’s artistic register and does not obscure causality.</comment>

<comment>Fresh synthesis: tarot box as multiverse card-deck made of silk threads collapses metaphysics into tactile craft. Lighthouse-as-library is not a quirky backdrop but a literal pivot-point that redefines maritime space. The necessary-darkness trope is inverted—descent is not doom but studio. Risk-taking (lyric accumulative structure, non-human antagonist) heightens meaning without gimmickry.</comment>
