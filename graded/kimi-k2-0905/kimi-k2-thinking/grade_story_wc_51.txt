<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The fractal weaver’s interiority is relentlessly concrete—every motion of her fingers, every temperature shift of brass, maps an inner contradiction between captor and creator. Pride is not labeled; it is ripped “like a splinter of ice” and made into a black stone whose heft she must literally weigh, embodying flaw-driven error under pressure. The seventeen-year stasis is accepted in an Earned Stasis closure whose cost is the sphere of all burdens—no tidy redemption, only a luminous, unweighed exit. Voice stays singular, never diagnostic; even “unforgiven” is left as atmospheric fact rather than self-help label.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens declared by patterned echo (“shingled hush” tightens each time a burden is measured) and held to the final exhalation. Closure is a Charged Poise: the sphere’s zero/all weight reconfigures the trap into a loom, cost legible in the grotto’s recalibrated spirals and her stepping “through the wall as though it were woven air.” No orientation debt; who/where/when anchored in first 60 words. Causality is poetic but intact—each orientation of the burner changes the brass temperature and thus the calcification, a micro-physics that makes the final image feel earned rather than magic trick.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Bronze grotto functions as micro-setting: copper veins, open ceiling, acoustic folds actively constrain how sound/light can be trapped and released, directly enabling the loom reveal. Kerosene burner is handled in at least six beats, its geometry and thermal memory shaping every calcification; it charges the final image as the vessel that now “remembers fire.” Starlight, slate-quiet, and melting snow are filtered through her selective attention—she notices what can be threaded, weighed, or oriented, never tourist-catalog. Spatial choreography is flawless; the lamp’s shadow spiral lands on her palm with millimetric precision that later mirrors the wall’s fractal exit.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will she measure/release the burdens?—tightens each time brass temperature shifts foreclose an easier path (voice calcifies only after warmth; pride demands turning away from stars). Escalation is textural: silence layers like shingles until it becomes “nearly a substance,” each new weight deepening the acoustic trap. Cost is visible—hands pulled downward by black stone, lamp growing hot enough to recall its lost purpose—so the final sphere’s gravity feels priced. One meaningful turn: the recognition that walls = warp/weft; no reversal later, only crystallization.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the recursive metaphor of weaving/measurement: agency is not escape but acceptance of one’s own pattern. Subtext lives in temperature—warm brass = memory made artifact; cold brass = self-carved exile—never stated, always felt. Final image reweights “boundary-lessly trapped” into boundary-lessly chosen, a conceptual repricing accomplished without sermon. The whalebone glow fuses starlight and fossilized grief, delivering an emotional aftereffect that is specific, not sentimental.</question>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is unmistakable: every perception is filtered through textile lexicon—threads, warp, weft, loom—even silence is “shingled.” Rhythm compresses under pressure: clauses shorten as she turns the burner, then elongate into spiraling sentences mirroring fractal expansion. No head-hop; single interiority sustained. Diction stays within her plausible lexicon: “calcify,” “wick-holder,” “translucent crystal” are maker-words, not thesaurus filler. Final exhalation syntactically mirrors a shed loom—sentence opens wide as the wall becomes permeable.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud ear is musical: varied sentence openings, no template cadence, paragraphs breathe with thermal beats. Information density high—each line does setting + metaphor + micro-physics (“brass turned cold and heavy, pulling her hands downward”). Zero paraphrase loops; no mixed metaphors; vehicles respect physical logic. Only hairline slip: “shingled hush” repeated four times in 800 words; pattern taught early and functional, but the final instance could have been trimmed to three for perfect austerity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: fractal topology + textile craft + bereaved motherhood distilled into a single artifactual ritual. Risk—using calcification as literal emotional measurement—pays off because the burner’s thermodynamics ground the magic in tactile law. No stock “trapped woman” trope; trap re-imagined as unfinished tapestry, solitude re-cast as necessary warp. Specificity of copper veins, starlight geometry, and whalebone glow makes the concept impossible to transplant without breaking its bones.</comment>
