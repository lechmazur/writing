<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The alchemist’s grief is embodied through tactile ritual—spiral-building, vial-uncorking, palm-pressing—each micro-choice externalizing the stakes of recovery. Interior contradiction is present but soft: the tension between haste and stillness is named more than felt. The final smile is too sudden; no prior beat shows her allowing hope, so the emotional arc feels tidier than the crater stillness promised. Still, her silence, patience, and tool-use mark her as an individual, not a type.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the star-chart plate becomes a lullaby, reweighting loss into geometry with visible cost—the flare scars the copper. Causality is accumulative/textural: each pattern-placement thickens meaning until the flare crystallizes it. The “Great Silence” is anchored by word 40, satisfying orientation. The only causality wobble: why the child is reachable only after starlight sealing is unexplained, but the emotional logic holds under lyric lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The orchard’s skeletal trees, rusted fence wire, and brittle leaves are filtered through the alchemist’s fingers, becoming map-material; the crater’s hush acts as acoustic wall, forcing stillness to press on skin. The copper plate’s engraved tale is the micro-setting that finally charges the image when starlight fuses into heartbeat dots. Sensory hierarchy is biased to touch and hush, matching the patience concept. No spatial drift; every shard and spiral is trackable.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recover the child—signals early. Escalation is textural: each discarded item added to the spiral tightens the ritual stakes; the flare costs light and secrecy. Agency is ritual patience rather than overt reversal; the protagonist does not adapt tactics, she deepens them. Cost is visible—the silent flare burns oxygen and grief into metal—but no live option is foreclosed, keeping pressure just shy of high-band punch.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: grief can be translated but never erased; geometry is love’s residue. The copper plate’s shift from static map to pulsing star-chart reweights the concept of “home” as resonance, not place. No moralizing—final lullaby image lets silence speak. Ambiguity lingers: does the map lead to the child or to acceptance? Both readings coexist, satisfying complexity requirement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person lyric voice sustains a frost-brittle cadence; clauses break like twigs, mirroring orchard desiccation. Diction stays within alchemist’s mythic register—no slang, no modern leakage. Compression is purposeful: elided travel, elided backstory, but pattern ritual is fully rendered. No dialogue, so voice coherence is internal; perceptual signature is the hush-pressed skin, a tactile synesthesia that individuates the narrator.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Rhythm modulates between long frost-sentence inhalations and short flare-exhalations. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances ritual or atmosphere. Metaphors are sparse and coherent—starlight as mercury, stillness as tide—no mixed vehicles. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image (lullaby) without exposition. Minor hedge: “the stillness seemed to move” uses seeming filter, but the poetic license is earned.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Familiar rescue arc is re-framed through alchemical cartography and meteoric starlight, a fresh synthesis. The heartbeat-into-constellation translation feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Risk lies in the near-mythic tone—could tip into ornament—but restraint keeps it grounded. Specificity of cider shards, rusted wire, and flash-paper flare lifts the piece above generic lost-child templates.</comment>
