<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Adrian’s calligrapher identity, obsession with ethical storytelling, and the stick he wields are vivid, but his interiority is delivered in editorial summary rather than contradictory impulse under pressure; the “quiet obsession” is told, never dramatized as a live dilemma while he performs. The audience’s micro-epiphanies are sketched, yet Adrian’s own moment of risk or cost is missing—he leaves unchanged, pockets the stick, and no path is foreclosed for him. The story’s engine is their reversal, not his.</comment>

<comment>The reversed-puppet structure delivers a crisp Conceptual Repricing: the final image of the stick-as-question reweights narrative morality itself, with undeniable social cost legible in the patrons’ silent dispersion. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens: each backward tale strips justification until silence condenses. Orientation is swift and payoff earned; only the absence of any price boomeranging onto Adrian keeps this from the top band.</comment>

<comment>The cracked parabolic dish above the bar functions as a charged micro-setting: it concentrates the meteor hush and literally amplifies the silence that becomes the story’s final currency. Selective sensory detail—rusted girders, static-blue CRT glare, reclaimed parachute silk—fuels the seed-bar seediness and mirrors the stripping of moral varnish. Every noticed object is filtered through Adrian’s urbane eye, giving the world tactile specificity without tourist clutter.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</question>
<comment>Dominant stake—can stories be ethically un-told?—is signaled early and deepened as each reversed puppet peels away moral certainty. Escalation is textural: the accumulation of stripped justifications tightens the communal silence to an almost physical pressure. While the audience pays visible cost, Adrian’s personal risk remains off-stage, so the peak price is felt vicariously; still, the final hush forecloses the option of telling stories the old way.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically from the puppet-process: narrative reversals expose what usually gets erased, refusing tidy morals. The meteor hush acts as a resonant, non-verbal answer—silence becomes the new ethical space—without authorial sermon. Subtext lives in gesture (paper king un-dying) and in the woman ordering another drink to keep un-becoming. Complexity is honored; no side is sentimentalized.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The third-person camera stays locked to Adrian with disciplined psychic distance; perceptual signature—the calligrapher who “traced phantom serifs in the air”—threads urbane diction (“gilt letters,” “counterfeit reality”) into every observation. Syntax flexes with pressure: longer, ink-smooth sentences collapse into staccato puppet directions, mirroring the tightening noose of silence. No head-hopping; even audience realizations are filtered through Adrian’s sensing of their stillness.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</question>
<comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, sentences often double-jobbing (“The patrons called it The Dish, this Cold War relic now serving watered gin beneath its cracked parabolic ceiling”). Occasional purple flourishes (“meteor hush,” “bruised with dawn”) flirt with overwriting but stay justified by the bar’s cosmic ceiling and the ending’s conceptual burn. No loops or scaffolds; information is packed without synonym churn. Final line’s “signature in negative space” lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Puppet-show-as-ethical-laboratory, set inside a derelict radar dome bar, is a fresh synthesis that feels inevitable in hindsight. Backward narrative stripping is not a gimmick; it grows from Adrian’s calligrapher past and the dome’s literal signal-reversal history. Risk is taken—quiet, conceptual, no violence or twist—yet coherence is never sacrificed. Specificity of invisible-ink waistcoat and ancestral stick keeps the concept grounded.</comment>
