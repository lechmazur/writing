<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The caster’s “technically gentle” hands and guilt-scarred interiority stay specific and embodied; the forgiveness/self-worth arc tightens across aurora-lit braiding beats. Micro-choices—threading the card, touching the glowing rope—externalize thaw with visible cost, earning the final smile. Occasional soft-serve phrasing (“her heart…beat with the rhythm of a thousand names”) drifts toward performed emotion, but contradictions stay in play. Motivation anchors every action; the cracked-bell shame never vanishes, it is re-cast into listening labor.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the rope’s constellation of voices reweights her exile from punishment to vocation, cost paid in the tearful circle of names. Accumulative lens holds: punched card → braid pattern → aurora-fed glow → sonic resurrection, each layer adding density rather than causal reversals. Orientation anchored by word 50; no disorientation served at end, so no penalty. One scaffold loop—“She began…, she pulled…, she touched…”—dulls final cadence slightly but does not obscure the reconfiguration image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Frozen dome, shifting aurora hues, and rope-as-filament are tactile, selective, and bias-filtered through a caster’s eye for negative space. The sanctum’s acoustic properties literally shape the climax—sound is the tool—so micro-setting constrains the final choice. Ice, brass scent, and cardboard soot are balanced across senses without checklist溢出. Spatial choreography stays clean; only the aurora’s “drip like melting snow” risks mixed metaphor but pays off thematically.</question>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve vanishing names—signals early; pressure tightens when card grid matches rope, forcing a single irrevocable act: reconfigure braids or let voices die. Escalation is textural/accumulative: each newly-lit fiber adds sonic density, narrowing her stance from exile to keeper. Cost is visible aurora energy and emotional thaw; no coincidence resolves. One meaningful intensification suffices under Accumulative lens;agency resides in the deliberate threading.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through negative-space metaphor: absence = voice, void = resonance; no character sermonizes the moral. The final constellation of braids re-prices “perfection” as a living, flawed archive rather than uncracked bronze. Subtext lives in aurora light—public spectacle repurposed as private darkroom for memory. Insight is earned: forgiveness equals release of perfect replication, not absolution; complexity lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lyrical third-person hovers at intimate distance; syntax grows longer under aurora awe, shorter under tactile threading—rhythm mirrors attention. “Technically gentle” becomes a percussive refrain, welding vocation to identity. No head-hop; perceptual signature stays caster-centric—she notices grain of cardboard, choke of frozen soot. One register drift—“conceptual repricing” diction in interior line—feels academic but appears outside peak beat.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong read-aloud ear; sentence openings vary, paragraphs breathe. High density: aurora light “painting” bench, card “clogged with frozen soot” do double duty for mood + backstory. Three near-repetitions of “she began/ she touched/ she pulled” create template cadence; penalty −0.3. No mixed metaphors in climax; vehicles stay thermal/optical. Proofing clean; only minor scaffold noted.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fusing lost-wax metallurgy with aurora-powered phonetic resurrection is fresh, non-obvious, and inevitable in hindsight. Risk—lyric accumulative instead of causal plot—heightens meaning without gimmickry. Specificity of punched-card phonemes as “last breath” rescues device from steampunk cliché. Transformation complete: exile becomes archive, bell bronze becomes braided light.</comment>
