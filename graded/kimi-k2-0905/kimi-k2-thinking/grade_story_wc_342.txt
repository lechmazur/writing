<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kael’s face-blindness and fractal coin-seeing are vivid, but his interior contradictions stay static; no micro-choice under the demolition clock changes his tactics—he paints the wall, then simply leaves. The promised “limits discovered by trying to surpass them” is told, not dramatized in a beat where he risks or forfeits anything. The endurance is lyrical, but the cost is off-page; we witness no visible failure or renunciation that forecloses future art. Still, the perceptual signature is strong enough to satisfy the 9- gate for this length.</question>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a textbook Conceptual Repricing: the mirrored sky is demolished yet already “escaped,” reweighting the premise that art can outlast its physical support. The because/therefore chain (coin → wall → sky inside → scatter of dust) is fractally legible and lands with felt cost: “the sky, now free, expanded beyond any wall.” Lens is cleanly Causal; every beat narrows time and options until the final image flips loss into limitlessness. No orientation debt; transitions are seamless.</question>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</question><comment>The hollowed yew-library is not postcard scenery; its cracking bark and spiraling shelves physically constrain Kael’s reach and set the ticking clock. The coin’s warm ridges function as micro-setting, guiding fingertip sightlines that transfer sky to plaster; this tactile tool charges the final scatter of “fractal dust.” Spatial choreography stays clean as Kael moves from anatomy shelf to wall to exit. Environment directly shapes tactics and final image, satisfying the 9+ gate.</question>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single dominant stake—mirror sky before bulldozers—tightens once: dawn light creeps, siren wails, wall shimmers, then falls. Protagonist agency is present but low-burn; the meaningful turn is conceptual (sky escapes) rather than a decisive physical gamble. Cost is visible in the demolished wall and the felt scar on the city, but Kael personally pays no tangible forfeiture beyond walking away. Still, the escalation under causal lens is coherent and sufficient for 600-800 words.</question>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the inverse of limits: attempt to cage infinity and infinity evades. Final image of sky “already escaped” reweights every prior fractal brushstroke without moralizing. No abstract thesis statements; meaning resides in the reversal of containment. The resonance lingers because the price is the building itself, not an articulated lesson.</question>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric voice is fractally patterned—sentence rhythms mirror branching lines, diction stays within painterly lexicon. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is Kael’s fingertip-seeing world. Filter verbs are minimal and voice-driven (“he could feel the geometry”). The heightened stillness modulates into drum-beat demolition without register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</question>
<comment>Figurative language is dense but disciplined—each metaphor (tree-heart, lightning-in-plaster) returns to the fractal motif, paid off at closure. No synonym loops or template cadence; sentence openings vary. One paraphrase loop mid-text: “the library held its breath, the hush deepening” could be tightened, but it does not touch the final image. High information density with clean grammar and prop tracking.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</question>
<comment>Premise fusion of face-blind artist + tactile coin + dying tree-library is fresh; transformation test fails if names swap, because the coin-indentation sight method is specific. Fractal craft as limit-discovery avoids pseudo-profundity by anchoring in sensory process. Risk-taking (lyric escalation instead of physical reversal) heightens meaning without gimmickry. Slight deduction for echoing the “sky inside walls” concept recently seen in other cli-fi fabulism, but execution remains singular.</comment>
