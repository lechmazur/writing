<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Mara’s gentle persistence is shown, but her interior contradiction never crystallizes in a single high-pressure beat; the boy’s fear is named, not embodied. The elders’ memories and the bell are sketched collectively, so no individual secondary character exerts pressure that changes Mara’s tactics. Closure is communal mood, not a personal renunciation that costs her on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as communal Charged Poise: the bell’s promise reweights the ridge into a sanctuary, and the cost—perpetual nightly risk under sanctions—is felt. Causal chain is light (bell → gather → story) but coherent under Accumulative lens; no prop or geography break. Orientation clear by 120 words; transitions legible in mosaic montage. Persistent constraint (sanctions) shapes every beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Terra-cotta arbor, bell patina, vine-laced roof, secret knock—tactile micro-setting anchors every beat. Night storms force route changes and a soaked tea scene, proving environment alters tactics. Sensory hierarchy privileges sound (bell) over visual clutter. Final image of rain-polished bell charging “promise of tomorrow” satisfies 9+ gate for object-as-setting that reweights meaning.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake: keep communal memory alive while smuggling food under tightening sanctions. Escalation is accretive: each bell chime adds story-sharing as non-negotiable ritual, narrowing future nights. Visible price—storm-soaked volunteers, nightly exposure—legible on page. No single reversal, but cumulative deepening suffices for 600-word Accumulative design.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges: memory as underground resistance. Bell’s shift from signal to vessel of memory reweights earlier parcels into narrative seeds. Subtext carried in silence of anonymous donors, children’s wide eyes. Final image avoids moralizing; resonance is sonic aftertaste of bell, not statement. Complexity kept: solidarity praised yet remains fragile.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Third-person lyric collective sustains distance appropriate to communal ritual. Perceptual signature favors auditory detail (chime, rustle) over visual; diction stays within rural-exile lexicon. No dialogue to test voice split, yet narrative rhythm modulates—short clauses for storm, long breaths for storytelling. Filter verbs minimal, taught pattern of bell cadence paid off in final line.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm varied; sentence openings avoid templates despite heavy anaphora (“the bell… the ridge…”). Information density high—single sentences deliver food bundle contents, weather, and emotional charge. No synonym loops; metaphors organic (“patina a map of memories”). Proofing clean. One paraphrase loop “gentle/quiet/soft” around Mara recurs; not enough to obscure closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Familiar sanctions/exile frame refreshed by pairing food runs with mandated storytelling; synthesis feels inevitable. Bell transformed from alarm to archive—specific, non-generic twist. Risk taken: collective POV, quiet ending; coherence kept. Details ( dates, pomegranate gardens) particularize memory, resisting anywhere/nowhere. Slight deduction for communal lens that could swap names without breakage.</comment>
