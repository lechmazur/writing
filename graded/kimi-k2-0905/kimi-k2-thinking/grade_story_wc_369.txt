<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is concrete—her fingers brushing the sextant, the scar that aches—yet her motives stay stable: learn what the trees saw. The micro-choice to climb and place the instrument on the sill crystallizes values; the earned cost is the moment her own scar “begins to heal,” a visible internal shift. No contradictory impulses act simultaneously, so the 9+ quick test isn’t met, but the renunciation of silence for mapped hope feels proportionate to length.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: the map’s reveal is the Decisive Change, the sorrow threads visibly rewoven into light that opens the garden door. Causality is lyric—moonlight heals glass, light draws map—but each step is anchored in prior image (salt-stink brass, cracked lens). Orientation is clear by line 6; no teleporting props. Closure cost is the foreclosure of endless corridors: she can now sweep toward revelation, not mere dust.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The tower corridor, body, and sextant together function as micro-setting; the sill’s moonbeam literally constrains the repair and subsequently the map’s projection. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven—salt and stardust noticed because she tends stone. Spatial choreography holds from flagstones to spiral stairs to garden gate. Final image of moon-washed oaks glowing charges the closure under the inferred lens.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—does the labyrinth hold only grief or also resilience?—is signaled in paragraph four. Escalation is textural: each thread she traces adds density until the sum overwhelms, then the moonlight reweights it. Decision to deconstruct sorrow into key-light is on-page with visible cost: the map dissolves, door opens, foreclosing her former detachment. No coincidence; pressure is coherent under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete pattern: sorrow quantified → sorrow refracted → hope mapped. No moralizing; final image of “new dream scattering” reweights premise without thesis. Mundane miracles (lullaby, laugh) are particularized, not abstract. Ambiguity lingers: labyrinth will collect more dreams, so transformation is cyclical, not terminal.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person close maintains consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature is tactile and custodial—“sweeping dust,” “smelled of salt and stardust.” Diction stays within Elara’s lexicon; no filter-verb stacks. Rhythm modulates: longer sentences for spiral ascent, clipped fragments at map reveal. No dialogue, so voice purity is judged on narration alone and passes.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lines are dense: “quantified sorrow” marries concept to image; no paraphrase loops. Metaphors (labyrinth exhales, stones absorb rain) stay internally consistent. Final paragraph avoids scaffold; each sentence advances afterimage. One hairline slip—“somewhere…already scattering” edges toward template cadence but doesn’t dull closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Familiar grief-as-place trope is refreshed by custodial POV and sextant-as-reader. Moon-healing rule is cued early, paid off in map-beam. Synthesis of arborology + quantified grief feels specific to this voice. Risk—the lyric accumulative structure—heightens meaning without obscuring clarity.</comment>
