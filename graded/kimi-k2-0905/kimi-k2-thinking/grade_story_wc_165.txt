<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Ezra’s interior contradiction—algorithmic control vs. hunger for wonder—drives every micro-choice; the “lightly attentive” refrain embodies his calibrated detachment. Embodied emotion is lean but precise: the bishop warming against his palm crystallizes cost. The final stance (renouncing the piece) forecloses no future stunt yet carries the earned cost of permanent self-objectification—he is now an instrument of his own formula. No secondary relationship pressure on page, so relationship bullets waived.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: bishop diagonal → each encounter reboots with visible ripple, tightening until the token is surrendered. Closure is a Charged Poise: the warm bishop in his palm reweights the entire algorithm—wildness now owns the engineer. Cost is legible in the final line: “wilderness had been tamed by calculation” now applies to Ezra himself. Orientation, lens, and scope all meet Track A defaults without waiver need.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The tidal arcade is rendered through Ezra’s tactical gaze: salt-worn railing, coin-return slot, mirror-timed star-glint all become playable squares. Sensory hierarchy obeys his performer's priorities—sound of 8-bit thunder, plankton glow timed to guard patrol. The bishop operates as micro-setting that constrains the final choice; environment directly enables each manipulation. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly across four engineered encounters plus perch returns.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—proving monotony can be hacked—escalates with each successful intervention, tightening until the tool itself warps, signaling the algorithm’s bleed into self. Every reversal is authored by Ezra’s on-page decisions; coincidence only complicates (guard’s arrival pre-planted). Visible price: loss of the bishop/token and irreversible self-instrumentalization. One meaningful deepening suffices and lands.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges implicitly: art as engineered accident vs. accidental artifice within the artist. Subtext lives in gesture—dropping the bishop interrupts a marital stalemate more effectively than any spoken counsel. Final image reconfigures premise: wilderness tames the mapper. No moralizing; resonance lingers through the paradox of controlled randomness devouring its controller.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is crystalline, analytical, yet lyrical—“serenade monotony with creativity” rings as personal credo, not slogan. Syntax mirrors tactical rhythm: long accumulative clauses build schemes, then fracture into staccato confirmations (“It happened now”). Perceptual signature is distinctively Ezra’s—geometry overlays emotion, starlight becomes data. No dialogue to test, yet internal diction stays consistent and pressured.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense, rhythmic, and propulsive; metaphor systems (chess, tide, star algorithm) interlock without mixed collisions. Occasional elevated latinate diction (“calculated wilderness,” “conceptual repricing”) is motivated by Ezra’s performative intellect. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances tactic or image. Final third remains clean, allowing high-band entry.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Premise—street performer reverse-engineering fate with a driftwood bishop—feels fresh yet inevitable. Synthesis of math, arcade nostalgia, and tidal liminality produces a singular atmosphere. Risky second-person-plankton-glint timing succeeds because pattern is taught early and repaid. High specificity prevents trope recycling; removing arcade or chess conceit collapses entire architecture.</comment>
