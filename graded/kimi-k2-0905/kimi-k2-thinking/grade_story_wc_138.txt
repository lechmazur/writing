<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Althea’s interior contradiction—yearning for an ending she once escaped—remains vivid and embodied; the micro-choice to release the fragment is earned by three hundred millennia of accumulated boredom. The amulet’s hunger gives her flaw an external voice, turning abstract immortality-weariness into tactile risk. No secondary character on page, so status/relationship bullets waived; single-POV interiority sustains pressure throughout. Closure’s cost is palpable: she trades omniscience for beautiful ignorance—an irrevocable stance crystallized in the final image.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each refractive shard thickens the pattern of endings rather than causal chain. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 3 and re-anchor at each shard break; disorientation serves closure payoff. The decisive change lands on-page—“exquisite release of uncertainty”—with conceptual cost legible in the final line. No meaningful accumulation caps triggered; closure is clean under inferred lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prismatic escondite functions as micro-setting: its fracturing geometry literally supplies the tactical means for scattering consciousness. Sensory hierarchy skews visual, but light/memory synesthesia is POV-justified for a dimensionally aware immortal. Spatial choreography remains coherent across the implosion sequence; no floating bodies or teleporting props. The environment constrains the final choice—only within this crystalline trap can the mutiny be consummated—meeting 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“what happens after goodbye”—is signaled in paragraph two and tightened by each refracted ending. Escalation is textural: density of possible afters increases until the single irrevocable choice to scatter. Protagonist agency drives the turn; no coincidence resolves tension. Cost is visible (loss of omniscience) but could be sharper on the final beat; hence withheld from 9-band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the inverse of mortality tales: the horror of unbreakable continuance. The final reweighting—ignorance as gift—reverberates without moralizing. No echoing of prompt language; the story’s thesis is enacted, not stated. Image of “beautiful farewell” offers resonant non-literal answer to the central question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice maintains cerebral, crystalline texture true to an immortal mind that parses timelines like facets. Syntax elongates then fragments under storm pressure, mirroring the mutiny’s chaos without obscuring clarity. Diction stays within POV’s cosmic lexicon; no register drift. Perceptual signature—light as memory, darkness as palpable—remains consistent and character-specific.</comment>

<comment>Prose is dense but readable; high information-to-word ratio. Occasional stacked modifiers (“liquid rainbows,” “infinite refractions”) flirt with purple, yet pattern is taught early and servesaccumulative lens. No loops, scaffold, or paraphrase churn detected. Final image is sharp and uncluttered, sustaining closure impact.</comment>

<comment>Reverse-immortality premise—suicide by distributed endings—feels inevitable in hindsight. Specificity of escondite physics and amulet hunger transforms abstract concept into lived dilemma. Risky lyric structure paid off by resonant closure. No derivative echoes; the synthesis is singular.</comment>
