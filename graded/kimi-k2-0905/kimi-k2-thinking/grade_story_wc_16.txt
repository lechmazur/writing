<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid—her “cautious exuberance” while waiting and her decision to chain seven promises crystallize her arc. The silence-as-fear beat (“I stopped speaking because I was afraid you were right”) gives Kess a parallel flaw, though Kess is off-page until the final shard; status shift happens in the glyph note. Micro-choices (emptying the well, packing it) embody cost. No ethical chasm remains, but the earned reconciliation forecloses further silence with felt loss of time and ego.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: because Elara proves the ink binding, therefore she writes, therefore Kess answers, therefore they meet. Orientation anchored by word 60 (“subterranean extinct language archive”). Closure is Earned Stasis: the empty well beside two new ones visually reweights trust as a living grammar outside the archive, with conceptual cost (archive sealed, paths diverge). No soft resets; every beat advances knowledge or option narrowing.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The glass ink well functions as micro-setting: its depletion constrains the mid-scene choice to stop writing and launch the tube, then charges the final image when empty beside Kess’s fresh wells. Sensory selection—“quicksilver ink that shimmered with trapped starlight”—filters through Elara’s professional awe. Spatial choreography is clean: desk → pneumatic tube → central chamber. Archive stays off tourist-catalog detail; pressure is linguistic, not architectural.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</question><comment>Dominant stake: restore trust before bureaucratic seal. One visible tightening: ink well nears empty, forcing final promise dispatch. Cost is time lost (30 h → 6 h) and the irreversible archive seal that externalizes their reconciliation deadline. Agency sits with Elara’s gamble; coincidence only delays reply, never resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges without sermon: “language as living trust” rather than magical bondage. Subtext in the silence glyph that fuses ‘understood/accepted’ reprises the motif of dual meanings. Final image of empty well + new wells conceptually reweights premise—truth now travels inside them, not ink. No tidy moral; ambiguity lingers in diverging roads.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lyric, slightly elevated diction suits arcane linguist POV and is sustained (“symphonies of truth,” “cathedral halls of memory”). No head-hopping; single POV holds. Crow-quill dip and pneumatic whoosh supply tactile rhythm. Dialogue minimal but voice-distinct: Kess’s cracked disuse versus Elara’s precise clauses. No filter-verb stacks; immediacy intact.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>High information density—“harmonic resurrection theory,” “Jorvik verb conjugations”—yet always welded to emotional stakes. Rhythm modulates: long breathless cadence during promise writing, shorter beats at tube whoosh and reply clatter. No mixed metaphors or loops; “quicksilver ink” recurs with accruing meaning. Proofing clean; only minor scaffold (“she wrote until…”) but propels momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fusion of linguistics + binding magic feels fresh; not a trope checklist. The seven-loop promise chain is an inventive procedural that could only exist in this world. Risk of overt metaphor avoided by grounding in Elara’s scholarly process. Emotional core—fear of being understood—transcends genre ornament.</comment>
