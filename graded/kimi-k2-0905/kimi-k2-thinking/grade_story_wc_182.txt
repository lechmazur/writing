<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s “carefully resourceful” trait is shown through concrete micro-choices—copying unfinished clauses, reading the reassembled phrases aloud—so motive stays legible. Yet the botanist is a passive parcel once found; his silence denies relationship-as-crucible pressure and blunts the cost she pays. The interior contradiction promised by the cipher never sharpens into a visible flaw that endangers her. Still, her steady voice against the warden supplies enough embodied resolve to earn the new pact.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the diary’s once-blank pages become a “completed song,” the mountain sings louder, and the library is re-opened with conceptual cost—knowledge now carries audible risk. Causal linkage holds: gaps → key → stairway → rescue → completed diary. Orientation is swift; “the mountain bookstore rose like a forgotten organ” anchors who/where inside 25 words. One minor slack: the time traveler’s departure adds no constraint or price, but the warden’s continued presence supplies the persistent brake needed for 8+.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The mountain-bookstore-as-organ metaphor is sustained through “stone chambers humming,” “unheard symphony,” and the glass-pane ceiling that “recharges” the final image, so environment constrains and rewards. Spatial choreography is clean: doors → shelves → catacombs → glass mosaic; bodies and distances track. Sensory hierarchy favors sound and tactility, matching the linguist POV. A hairline slip: “golden chords” at dawn is a touch painterly, but the prior sonic architecture keeps the final image charged.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reach the lost botanist—signals early and tightens once: the warden’s decree must be renegotiated or passage dies. Elara’s agency drives every beat: she copies, reads aloud, proposes the new pact, and later whispers the healing phrase. Cost is visible—she risks memory-feeding and permanently surrenders the diary’s song—but the price feels moderate, not irreversible. Still, the single meaningful tightening satisfies the 600-word escalative bar.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: knowledge is not hoarded text but negotiated silence—what we choose not to say can save or doom. The diary’s blank spaces literalize this; their completion reweights the mountain’s song without moralizing. Subtext lives in gesture—warden’s “heavy chord” of silence answers her spoken offer. Final image of “golden chords” audible only to listeners supplies resonant non-literal answer, though the phrasing flirts with prettiness.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-limited stays locked to Elara; perceptual signature is sonic-tactile—“brittle pages,” “perfume of forgotten herbs,” “muted brass” eyes. Syntax lengthens under pressure—“Together they navigated the labyrinth, following the subtle harmonies”—mirroring cautious descent. No dialogue to test, yet internal diction stays within plausible linguist lexicon. One micro-loop: “unheard symphony” is repeated four times; because the pattern is taught early and reprised at closure, it reads as intentional motif, not artifact.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty—description advances stakes (“stone warden stirred, its eyes glowing like muted brass” cues danger). Rhythm modulates: longer cadence for descent, clipped “She plucked a volume” for arrival. Figurative density is high but patterned; vehicles stay sonic/organic, avoiding mixed-metaphor crashes. Only minor scaffold: “Together they navigated the labyrinth, following the subtle harmonies that echoed off the walls” could lose “that echoed off the walls” without loss.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The “library of unlearned lessons” could feel meta, yet the ciphered diary and memory-eating warden ground it in specific peril. Sonic-architecture setting, botanist-as-silent-chord, and renegotiation of stone decree synthesize into a fresh angle on forbidden-knowledge tropes. Risk is taken—mythic tone, no villain—and coherence holds. The concept feels inevitable in hindsight: of course silence would be currency in a mountain organ made of books.</comment>
