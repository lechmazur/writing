<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mira’s pacifist ethic is named, not dramatized—no moment forces her to choose between violence and empathy—so the “eclectic” label stays ornamental. Interiority is vivid (“Silence of anticipation, metallic, cold”) and the micro-choice to leave the clasp unlocked costs her the safety of ignorance, earning a credible shift. Still, the lack of external opposition keeps pressure interior and stakes modest.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the unlocked diary and neighbor’s arrival reconfigure solitude into shared stillness; cost is the father’s revealed absence and Mira’s renunciation of secrecy. Causality holds under Accumulative lens—each frequency shift thickens pattern until the clasp yields. Orientation is swift; no lens drift. Slight slack: fireworks’ coincidence doesn’t tighten further, capping high band.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Workshop, radio dial, and clasp function as micro-setting: the radio’s hum and the clasp’s spring physically constrain her tuning choices and deliver the final click. Starlight and ink-shadows mirror internal hush without overwriting. Spatial anchors stay consistent; no object teleporting. Environment could exert sharper pressure (cold, risk of discovery) to reach top band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“recover the memory sealed by silence”—is signaled early and tightens through each dial adjustment; the clasp’s click forecloses the option to leave the past locked. Pressure is internal and accumulative; no external antagonist escalates. Cost is emotional (grief re-awakened) but not vis-à-vis another will, keeping escalation lyrical rather than acute.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme of empathy-through-silence emerges from pattern: catalogued silences, radio static, and fireworks after-hush accumulate into the father’s line “Silence is the shape of love.” No moralizing summary; the neighbor’s entrance embodies the theme without stating it. Final image of “shared stillness” reweights earlier solitude effectively.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited maintains steady psychic distance; perceptual signature is auditorial (“thin as starlight,” “static sang with meaning”). Syntax modulates—long lyrical coils contract into short notations—mirroring tuning precision. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping. Voice could risk higher if diction carried more idiosyncratic dents.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is rhythmic and dense: “shadows pooled like ink,” “silence that held its breath.” No mixed metaphors or loops; each image advances atmosphere or stakes. Occasional elevated register (“varieties of silence,” “conceptual repricing”) fits Mira’s cataloguer mind. Momentum breathes with scene tempo; final line lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Father’s voice hidden in radio static is fresh; coupling lock-picking with tuning a carrier wave gives the diary trope new muscle. Concept of “cataloguing silence” provides specific intellectual lens. Risk is moderate—lyric accumulation over plot—but execution stays coherent. Could push further if pacifism or workshop craft collided with external stakes.</comment>
