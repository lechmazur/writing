<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elias’s quiet obsession with scent and stillness is concrete and embodied; the mortar-and-dew beat shows micro-choice under pressure. Yet the interior contradiction never sharpens—he wants serenity, gets it, shares it, smiles: no real flaw or cost complicates him. The minstrel’s arrival supplies external pressure but Elias remains unchanged, so the “bridge between still and swift” feels declared, not earned. Still, the olfactory specificity and ritual doodling keep him individual, not archetype.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the seed’s foul lesson reweights the premise—serenity is born of decay—and the village’s new gait is the visible cost. Causal chain is lean: grind seed → tincture → drink → shared calm; no teleporting props. The “tide’s thought” moon-phase rule is taught early and returns to frame the final whisper, so lens holds. One soft spot: the elders’ mass sipping is summarized, not dramatized, blunting the final tightening.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Perpetual mist, petrified-wood mortar, acorn vial: each object is tactile and stakes the ritual. Spatial tracking stays clean—treetop bridges, hammocks, harp beside journal. The village never becomes a postcard because scent-wind and sap-direction keep it lived-in. Final image of “wildflower hush” reuses the opening hush, recharging atmosphere without new detail, just missing the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—can Elias transmute decay into living calm?—is signaled early and tightens once: the glowing amber heartbeat forces the choice to share, not hoard. Cost is present but gentle: the seed is gone, its wisdom now communal, yet Elias loses nothing he valued. No reversal or trade-off complicates the arc; pressure plateaus after the tincture succeeds. Sufficient for lyric mode, but not piercing.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of serenity within motion emerges from scent-contrasts and the final swaying elders, never sermonized. The seed’s stench-as-teacher subverts tidy “beauty good, rot bad” binaries. Subtext whispers in doodled spirals: warding decay while embracing it. Final line’s “scented possibility” offers resonant reconfiguration without moral tag.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person stays close to Elias’s olfactory brain; perceptual signature is consistent—every noticed smell tilts his mood or recipe. Syntax lengthens and softens during the hush moments, mirroring the calm he seeks. No dialogue to test voice distinction, yet the journal’s compressed clauses (“stillness is not absence”) sound like a herbalist’s field notes. Only nit: “wildflower hush” is repeated thrice with identical cadence, risking mantra over music.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose breathes: long sentences for mist, staccato for seed-grind, then open cadence for communal calm. Metaphors stay vegetal and coherent—no mixed vehicles. Occasional modifier stacks (“soft amber light, pulsing like a heartbeat”) flirt with purple but serve the ritual tempo. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or action.</comment>

<comment>Corpse-flower serenity tonic feels fresh, not gimmick, because the olfactory logic is followed through village bodies. Doodled wards against decay invert typical protective runes—art drawn on disposable wrappers. Risk is quiet: no violent twist, just communal shift, which suits the hush tone. Could edge higher if Elias faced a personal cost that tested his own “calm within motion.”</comment>
