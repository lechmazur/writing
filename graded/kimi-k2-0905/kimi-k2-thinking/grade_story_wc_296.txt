<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete—his hand slipping into the pouch, the taste of ash, warlike serenity as blade-before-strike. Contradictory impulses (duty vs guilt) coexist in scene, not summary. Final renunciation lands because the prior beat shows him planting the seed he once feared; cost is visible. Only nit: “guard the world once more” drifts toward abstract mission-statement, muting the felt personal price.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: failed trick → therefore seed → therefore confession released. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—mirror line reweights the premise with undeniable personal cost. Orientation is anchored by word 30; vortex, druid, night. One tightening beat—ice groans under circles—forecloses retreat. Cost is legible in the final image: berries harmless because his guilt is not.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Micro-setting (seed, cloak hem, ash-tongue) constrains tactics; seed’s hunger literally eats the curse that blocks him. Lake, orchard, vortex are sketched with sensory economy—hiss, chill, malevolent shimmer—yet remain coherent across moves. Final sky reflection is charged by prior mirror motif, satisfying 9+ gate. Spatial track clean: no impossible positions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—unlock his own confession—signaled in paragraph 1 and tightens when the ice cracks reveal his reflection. Agency drives escalation: he chooses the flesh-seed after fire fails, narrowing options and raising bodily risk. Visible price: plant wilts, guilt exposed, vortex calms—cost is on-page. Slight reserve: external antagonist (curse) is abstract, so pressure is more conceptual than visceral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme—mirrors reveal shells, scars hide beneath—emerges through image chain: lake surface → ice mirror → memory surface. No explicit moral; final “some truths remain hidden” keeps ambiguity. Subtext operates in gesture: planting a seed that eats curses = feeding on self-made evil. Recurrent orchard/fruit rot deepens rather than décor. Only tic: “warlike serenity” leans toward slogan if read in isolation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person close maintains consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature is druidic—circles, ash taste, seed whisper—without ventriloquism. Syntax flexes with pressure: clipped cadence at seed-planting, longer coils during chant. No head-hop; knowledge stays character-bound. One micro distance slip—“confession tasting of bitter betrayal” momentarily abstracts taste into metaphor, but recovers immediately.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>High density: each sentence advances image or causality—no loops, no scaffold. Rhythm modulates from liquid spirals to hard cracks, mirroring ice fracture. Metaphors stay internally coherent (maelstrom of dead fruit, blade-before-strike). Minor register bump—“malevolent light” is familiar diction—but does not obscure closure. Clean grammar, zero paraphrase churn.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Frozen-confession-as-ice is fresh twist on memory-as-object; flesh-eating plant that devours curses rather than flesh twists monster-botany trope. Specificity anchors magic: chant-circles, ash taste, berry aftermath feel discovered, not catalogued. Transformation test passes—swap druid for wizard and the emotional arc collapses. Risk in lyric compression is rewarded because closure stays legible.</comment>
