<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The exile, skepticism, and scientific ambition are cleanly established; her interiority is concrete (“chemistry of homecoming… haunted her research”). Micro-choices—pocketing the amber, kneeling to sample—embody motive. No contradictory impulse is staged in-scene, so the 9+ test misses; cost is present but generalized, not scaled to a single sharp beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each new sensory layer tightens the same question (“why return?”). Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the molecular map rewrites exile into homecoming for her. Orientation is secure by line 4; the amber-pulse linkage is slightly convenient but pattern-taught. Cost is felt but not persistent—no tool breaks, no social loss on-stage.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Selective sensory detail—bronze quiet, wet-metal scent, fly-amber warmth—filters through scientific gaze. The tower’s spiral staircase and converging circle constrain her sampling action, satisfying 9+ gate. Sculptures-half-swallowed-by-moss is a single vivid stroke; no geography drift. Weather is used (“rain began to patter”) to time the final cadence, charging the exit image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—decode the alien return—remains coherent; pressure deepens when readings reveal memory-binding polymer. Escalation is accumulative: each footprint layer and chemical trace thickens the same mystery rather than narrows live options. No external antagonist or resource loss; the tightening is intellectual, not tactical. Cost is conceptual (paradigm shift) rather than viscerally felt on-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through inversion: artificial pilgrimage → natural truth. The amber micro-cosmos reweights from curio to kin-signal without authorial nudge. Final smile at irony lands as earned reconfiguration, not moralizing. Subtext in “bronze resolve” quietly fuses metal imagery with personal mettle—subtle, not assertive.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Scientist POV stays tight: “portable analyzer… data streams” preserves lexicon. Rhythm modulates—long breath for morning light, clipped clauses during sampling. No head-hop; “luminous skeptic” third-person maintains perceptual signature of measurable phenomena. Lyric compression (“bronze quiet”) is patterned early and repaid in exit line.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Strong read-aloud cadence; sentence lengths vary naturally. High density—“muted hues of a bronze quiet morning” packs color, material, and stillness in one stroke. Occasional poetic overlap (“quiet promise of discovery”) is minor purple; no loop or scaffold detected. Closing line’s “bronze resolve” avoids cliché by echoing established palette.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Fuses first-contact trope with pheromone cartography; pilgrim path as chemical breadcrumb trail feels fresh. The fossil fly vibrating with alien code is a specific, memorable image. Conceptual rather than plot risk; emotional stakes stay safe. Transformation test passes—exile-to-home shift depends on exact molecular premise.</comment>
