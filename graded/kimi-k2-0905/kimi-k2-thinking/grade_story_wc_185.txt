<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Lira’s interior contradiction—devotion to silence yet compelled to act—remains embodied in micro-choices (tracing cracks, hum-intoning). Her flaws (isolation, acoustic obsession) directly complicate the tactic chain, and the final renunciation—stone dimmed, path reopened—carries visible cost in bodily fatigue and future uncertainty.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of acoustic imagery builds to a Resonant Reconfiguration—Charged Poise in the final eye-of-silence image—where the cost is felt as perpetual vigilance. Orientation anchored by word 50; one soft “then” transition inside continuous scene; no causality breaks; bloom arrival reweights all prior crack-tracing labor.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Harmonic caves function as active instrument: ice lattice, pedal-note hum, and stone pedestal directly constrain tactics and shape the final image. Selective sensory economy—breath-frost, glow-pulse—mirrors Lira’s narrowed perception under acoustic siege; no exposition dumps.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Single dominant stake—“find the quiet”—tightens through two acoustic deepenings: first bloom fails, mandala realignment succeeds. Agency remains Lira’s at every beat; price paid is bodily strain and the knowledge storms will return; cost is on-page in shaking hands and dimmed stone.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of cyclical silence emerges from acoustic patterning rather than statement; final smile re-weights earlier scrolls as communal promise, avoiding moralizing. “Hammered repose” motif accumulates contradictory texture, resolved in charged final image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lira’s perceptual signature—ripple-reading, chest-cavity resonance—remains distinct and rhythmic; diction stays within her lexicon. Compression is purposeful (“bloom of hush” taught early); no head-hopping; lyric fragments serve acoustic pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>High density: one sentence often delivers sensory data, emotional register, and causal push (“stone’s glow now a pulsing heartbeat”). No loops, mixed metaphor, or scaffold; rhythm accelerates with shorter clauses during bloom release, then lengthens into repose.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: acoustic cartography + living cave instrument. Energy beings left opaque to keep focus on internal silence mechanics; risk pays off without clarity loss. Ripple-mark maps and echo-stone feel native, not grafted.</comment>
