<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Kael’s interiority is concrete—his breath pluming, the heartbeat echo in droplets, the shard against his chest—yet the murder-attempt trauma is summarized rather than embodied mid-scene, muting the contradictory impulse that could have sharpened the pivot from vengeance to art. His micro-choice to melt the shard into a new vessel is visible and costly, but the adaptive trait is asserted more than dramatized under pressure. Still, the glass-as-light legacy feels character-specific and the final stance is earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the fused vessel glows, reweighting “purpose in the pauses” from abstract wish to tangible artifact. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—frost patterns and furnace echo layer until meaning crystallizes. Causality is intact: ledger → canyon → frost code → furnace → new vessel, each step because/therefore. Cost is felt—he leaves the furnace behind, carrying only the shard’s glow—yet the murder-attempt stakes evaporate once he reaches the canyon, trimming the highest band.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The canyon is never a postcard; its frost veins, stone cold, furnace glow, and star-echoed silence constrain every move. Spatial choreography is flawless—ashes near the fire, furnace chamber reachable only by retraced frost lines. The glass itself becomes micro-setting, its captured starlight charging the final image. Weather (frost) directly shapes the code he must read, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—expose traffickers via ledger—yields to emergent stake: forge legacy glass that redeems the charcoal crime. Escalation is textural: frost pattern densifies until it replaces the ledger as map, narrowing options to furnace. The price—he physically melts his father’s shard—lands on-page, but the trafficking threat never re-enters to test the new resolve, capping tension below 8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges quietly: art transmutes criminal residue into light. The scorched testament’s brittle pages recode into molten glass, refusing a moral and letting the vessel’s glow answer the pause-driven quest. No final-period sermon, only image. Frost/ledger polarity offers plausible counter-readings—justice versus beauty—without equivalence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric distances like camera glass: “breath a faint plume,” “molten glass flowed like a river of light.” Rhythm modulates—long breathless clauses mirror melt, then short declaratives cool. Perceptual signature owns glass craft lexis: shard, furnace, starlight captured. No dialogue, so voice remains pure, consistent, and textured.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>High density: “frost traced lines that matched the ledger’s numbers” packs map, code, and causality into ten words. Metaphors are coherent—glass as river of light—and vanish before muddling. Occasional template cadence (“He... then he...”) appears but never in closure beat. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with melt/cool cycle. No loops or scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Fusing charcoal-smuggling ledger with starlight glass is fresh synthesis; frost as living cipher rather than mere décor is inventive. Canyon-as-lab and glass-as-witness feel inevitable yet non-obvious. Risk is moderate—lyric accumulation over plot reversal—but lands cleanly. Could tip higher if trafficking threat had echoed into the final image to charge social cost.</comment>
