<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Kai’s calm, tactile interiority—clay under nails, thrum in palms—stays embodied and particular; the contradiction between her scientific curiosity and reverent care is shown, not told. The final renunciation—leaving bowl and glass—costs her the literal lens that first revealed the oasis’s secret, so the gesture is earned. Yet her “motivation humb[ing] beneath her ribs” skirts diagnostic shorthand; once that shorthand is uttered, the moment never regains full sensory immediacy.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the bowl-and-glass offering crystallizes the discovered rule—kindness as architecture—while the lingering thrum in her palms makes the conceptual cost bodily. Causality holds: lantern glass → thrum → bowl → departure; each beat is legibly because/therefore. The only micro-slip is “Kai understood that resistance wasn’t defiance…” summarizing what the reader already sees dramatized; since the next sentence re-grounds us in wheel and fire, the linkage stays intact.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Rosemary kindling, portable wheel, and silvered hive wood are all handled, not catalogued; each constrains her next move (what she can burn, what she can carry, where she can wedge clay). The micro-setting of her own palms finally becomes the charged “environment” that stores the thrum, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography stays clean: bowl on central stone, footprints behind, smoke plume ahead—no floating props.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—why some places resist entropy—signposts early and tightens once: the lantern-glass vision turns abstract curiosity into tactile obligation to reciprocate. The price is visible: she relinquishes the glass that made the discovery possible, foreclosing future visions. No secondary reversals are needed at 700 words; a single meaningful deepening is sufficient, but the beat could sharpen still further if the relinquishing cost were felt as psychic loss rather than serene gift.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the recursive image chain: glass → memory → clay → vessel → gift, all enacting “love as architecture” without once moralizing. The final line’s “wasteland listened, patient as clay” re-prices the premise, implying the same kiln-time could act on the larger world—conceptual cost made legible. Only a whisper of echo-drift: “sharp gentleness” is openly labeled twice; the second iteration nudges toward thesis-statement territory.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person lyric remains tightly focalized through Kai’s potter-senses: syntax slows to wheel-speed, diction stays within her lexicon (“wedged,” “kindling,” “glazes”). Patterned repetition (“step, and the next”) is taught early and paid off in the closing cadence. No register drift, no filter-verb bloat; even the single bee’s vanishing is rendered as percept, not symbol slapped on from above.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary from long clay-smooth flows to em-dash flickers; no template cadence. Figurative layering—“sun patterns as mantras,” “hive boxes slumped like exhausted pilgrims”—remains tethered to Kai’s worldview, not decorative. One paraphrase loop: “survival isn’t just endurance, but the active practice of care” restates the already-shown bowl offering; a −0.2 ding is enough, leaving propulsion intact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The fusion of post-apocalyptic wasteland with memory-storing beekeeping oasis is fresh, yet the true innovation is conceptual: kindness treated as literal photosynthetic resource that warps time. The quiet ending refuses triumphalist bloom, choosing conceptual re-pricing over twist. Risky lyric accumulation could have collapsed into mossy sentiment; instead, concrete pottery mechanics and sensory thrift keep the premise grounded and memorable.</comment>
