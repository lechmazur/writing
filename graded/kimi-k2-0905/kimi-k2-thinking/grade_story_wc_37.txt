<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elias’s amnesiac caretaker identity is vivid—his body listens to trunks for “the faintest hum.” Interior contradiction is missing: he never doubts the worth of sacrifice, so the climax feels pre-decided. The memory-loss cost is declared (“his own memory would scatter again”) rather than shown mid-beat, softening the final renunciation. Still, his perceptual signature—fermenting apples, copper scent—keeps the voice particular and embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the orchard basks in perpetual dawn while Elias becomes “a whisper,” a felt conceptual cost. Causal chain is lyric-accumulative: each sung note pulls memory away, tightening until the mica shatters; the pattern is taught early (“each leaf a fragment”). Orientation is clear by line 4; no penalty. The lens holds without contradiction, though the dawn-thread mechanic is slightly convenient; the image of fractured glass letting in true sunrise reweights meaning cleanly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The greenhouse operates as a living alchemist that transmutes sorrow into fruit—this constraint directly shapes Elias’s tactic of singing into the trees. Sensory hierarchy is biased toward taste/scent (fermenting apples, copper) which mirrors the internal corruption of memory. Spatial choreography is clean: mica pressed against obsidian glass, fracture pattern tracked. Micro-setting (mica sheet) charges the final image; without it the dawn-sliver fails, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“rekindle the dying realm before its last ember faded”—is signaled early. One meaningful tightening: each sung note costs memory, narrowing options until the mica fractures. Cost is visible on-page: “each note pulled a piece of his own memory away.” Agency is renunciation rather than victory, fitting lyric-accumulative lens. No reversal, but the steady attrition creates coherent pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through image, not statement: dawn stitched from songs, orchard as alchemist of sorrow. The final image—perpetual dawn bought by Elias’s dissolution—reweights earlier motifs without moralizing. Subtext resides in silence: no deliberation about the sacrifice, implying memory-keepers are born to surrender. Ambiguity lingers: is dawn eternal or just a longer twilight? Complexity is embraced rather than resolved.</question>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person lyric voice carries a consistent perceptual signature: silver-leaved trees “chiming like bells,” copper-scented air. Syntax modulates with intensity—short clauses at climax (“The mica window cracked”). No dialogue, so no voice convergence. Filter verbs are minimal; immediacy preserved. Compressed diction under pressure (“He began to sing, his voice raw”) stays within POV lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is lush but disciplined: no adjacent paraphrase loops, metaphor vehicles stay coherent (“woven dawns” remains textile-rooted). One mixed image—“jigsaw of stars that had forgotten their constellations”—is fleeting. Rhythm varies: long clause for orchard description, fragment for fracture climax. Information density high; each sentence adds sensory or causal data. No artifacts in final third; closure image remains crisp.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Premise fuses alchemy + memory + orchard + mirror-world night; synthesis feels organic. Dawn-as-textile and sorrow-to-fruit transmutation are fresh inflections. Risk taken: lyric-accumulative structure instead of causal plot; coherence holds. Proximity check: no familiar story echo. Specific detail—mica mined from “the heart of the world”—anchors originality. Transformation test: could not swap orchard for generic forest without breaking logic.</comment>
