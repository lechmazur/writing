<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Seren’s lock-sentinel obsession is embodied in tactile micro-choices (oil scent, pick-trace) and drives every beat; the final “never close again” renunciation costs her lifetime role, earned by prior gear/sundial causality. Interiority never drifts into diagnostic labels; contradictions (duty vs revolt) act in-scene. Competence is balanced by genuine blackout disorientation and risk. One decimal off 8.8 only because the fort’s social fabric (guards, commandant) stays off-page, muting crucible pressure from status dynamics.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal chain locks in at “sundial angle → gear ratio → powder keg → pneumatic signal → every lock opens”; each because/therefore tightens options. Closure is a Charged Poise: dawn will expose irreversible liberation with no shot fired; cost is her erased sentinel identity. Orientation taught by line 4; blackout disorientation is functional at closure. Accumulation of gear/sundial/powder images reweights meaning; no plot amnesia.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Micro-setting rule satisfied: bronze gear-base and half-painted sundial act as portable settings that constrain decoding tactics and charge the final image. Limestone walls glow amber—selective visual; oil scent anchors POV; spatial choreography clean as she moves armory→study→magazine→parade ground. Twilight/blackout narrow sensory focus to immediacies. No geographical drift; world rules (pneumatic tubes, powder kegs) learned through action. Environment does not merely mirror mood; it supplies the literal powder and tube network that enable the silent coup.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—liberate fort without blood—signaled early; tightening occurs when powder location translates into precise charge calculation that will unlock every door, foreclosing secrecy. Agency is hers; coincidence (blackout) complicates but does not resolve. Cost legible: she forfeits sentinel purpose and risks execution. One decimal off 8.8 because the external antagonist (commandant) remains abstract; pressure is architectural rather than human in final beats.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme—locks exist to be opened—emerges from concrete gear/sundial decoding, not assertion. Final image of well-oiled but useless lock reconfigures meaning with conceptual cost: security systems breed their own collapse. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers (will populace choose freedom?). Motif recurrence (oil, sparks, angles) constrains tactics; not token. Wisdom is earned: “every shadow to be read” arises from lived decade of latch-tending, not platitude.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays fused to Seren’s perceptual signature: mechanical numeracy, grease scent, sound of tumblers. No head-hop. Rhythm modulates—short staccato during lock-pick, longer cadence at twilight glow. Diction (“cradle of sparks,” “winking hush”) feels idiosyncratic yet within lexicon of a technician-poet. No filter-verb stacks; metaphors consistent (light/dark, spark/lock). Compression taught early (“coded angles whispered”) and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentence openings diversify. Information density high: one sentence often layers sensory detail, backstory snippet, and forward momentum (“She had cleaned it weekly, noting how each gear's tooth count matched the fort's forgotten schematics”). Zero paraphrase loops; no mixed metaphors. Peak beat (powder chamber reveal) uses spare, concrete nouns, no purple. Minor −0.1 for two near-simultaneous participle openers mid-story; clarity intact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: locksmith + sundial cipher + pneumatic-tube revolution in a blackout fort. Transformation test fails if any element swapped; gear-tooth/angle mapping is non-generic. Risk in silent-coup via mechanical leak is bold yet coherent. Trope of “underdog revolt” is re-angled through non-violent unlocking rather than explosion. Specificity of oil, phosphor light, and wax-seal betrayal anchors novelty. No derivative premise guardrail needed; premise feels inevitable only in hindsight.</comment>
