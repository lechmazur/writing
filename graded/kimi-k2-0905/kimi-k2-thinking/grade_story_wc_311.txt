<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The reaper’s ache is vividly embodied—hand on cold brass, pocketed mirror that reflect a heart still able to ache—and her contradictory need to name every fear except her own keeps pressure alive. Her final refusal to name her own fear is a credible, earned renunciation with cost visible in the mirror shard. No secondary character appears, so relationship crucible is N/A.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the unnamed fear crystallizes into a mirror that refracts her own face, reweighting the premise that naming saves others but never her. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each cylinder/beast adds density until the atlas page becomes a ledger of traded griefs. Persistent constraint (her surrendered name) shapes every prior choice, and the cost is unmistakable in the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The observatory’s brass instruments, prism light, and wax cylinders are tactile tools that constrain her method; the atlas page itself functions as micro-setting whose blank corner forces the final mirror. Spatial choreography is clean—light angles, lens tilts, shard drops—and the environment mirrors her narrowing interior focus. Dusk-to-starlight progression is economical and purposeful.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—naming fears for others while remaining unnamed—tightens when the final blank beast refuses label and becomes her own reflection. One meaningful deepening occurs: the realization that some fears inhabit the space between souls, not inside them. Cost is legible as she pockets the mirror, accepting eternal unnamed dread.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the atlas ledger: naming grants dignity but also immortalizes distance between reaper and reaped. The void-beast turned mirror offers resonant, non-literal answer—her fear is the unnamed distance itself—without moralizing. Subtext in the wax fragments (“the thing beneath—”) implies civilization’s unspoken substrate. The emotional aftereffect lingers as readers confront their own unmapped beasts.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Voice carries a hush-of-death cadence, syntax elongating like dusk shadows, then compressing under each crystallized fear. Perceptual signature—brass cold, wax hiss, light broken gold—remains consistent and character-bound. No dialogue, so no convergence risk. Register stays within a centuries-old reaper’s elegiac lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is rhythmically varied, information-dense; sentences layer wax, light, and grief without scaffold. Occasional poetic stacking (“patterns of broken gold”) is justified by atmospheric beat. No mixed metaphors or loops; pronouns and tense stable. Opening anchors voice and stakes, final line recharges mirror motif.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Familiar “death guide” trope is inverted by her inability to guide herself; atlas sea monsters as unnamed fears feels fresh, and the void-beast mirror payoff is non-obvious. Specificity—wax cylinders, meridian circle—anchors concept. Risk in lyric fragmentation is paid off by coherent closure.</comment>
