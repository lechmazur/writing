<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Evers’s bewilderment is not a label but a lived, embodied state—his trembling palm, the way memory arrives “out of order,” the micro-choice to retreat to the bathroom. The nonlinear inheritance forces genuine cognitive dissonance that compounds across beats; his final acceptance of mourner-identity costs him the illusion of curator-agency. Interior contradiction is sustained: curiosity vs terror, duty vs transgression. The only minor slip is the slightly abstract “hierarchy of values” in the final bite—still, the price is felt on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the orchard is a cemetery, the fruit is a tombstone, and Evers’s tending is now a funeral rite—cost is the irreversible loss of innocence. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each luminous image layers density until the sigil-bearing shell rewrites the rule-set. Orientation is taught early via crystalline paths and weak gravity; the bathroom shard is a single, legible transition. No causality break; the tree’s gift is earned by the carved shell.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The astral orchard is never backdrop: branches “knit starlight,” bark rearranges constellations, fruit tastes of “shattered symmetries”—each descriptor constrains Evers’s perception and final choice. Micro-setting inside the bathroom compresses thought into clarity, literally enabling the philosophical breakthrough. Spatial choreography is clean: shell pressed to forehead → sigil → trunk → bite. One minor over-adjective (“luminous fruit that hummed…”) but it pays off in the closing reprise.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—curiosity vs prohibition—signaled in paragraph four; pressure tightens when the shell warms and the tree offers fruit that can’t be un-bitten. Escalation is Accumulative: each sensory layer (silver branches, glowing sigil, blue-gold pulse) reweights the cost of knowledge. The final bite forecloses the option to remain merely a curator; the price is the weight of universal grief. No coincidence; the orchard’s response is triggered by Evers’s deliberate memory-carving.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges as the impossibility of innocent stewardship: gardening is grieving, knowledge is mourning. Subtext lives in the shell—initially “unspoken potential,” finally a grave-offering—never explained, only enacted. The ending image of “terrible beauty” refuses moral balancing; the story lets the reader feel the sacrilege of continuing to harvest memories. No final-paragraph thesis; resonance is carried by the taste of dead universes.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Evers’s perceptual filters: “his steps echoing,” “fragments whispered.” Syntax lengthens under wonder, fragments under shock; diction remains within his curator lexicon yet stretches to cosmic scale without register drift. No head-hopping; surveillance drones are externalized only as privacy rationale. The lyric pattern (“simply complicated,” “between first and last page”) is taught early and paid off in the final line.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Rhythm modulates from long breathless sentences to staccato fragments at the bite. Metaphors are coherent: starlight as thread, fruit as tombstone, no mixed vehicles. One scaffold paraphrase (“nonlinear inheritance meant wisdom arrived…”) is immediately grounded in the bead-stringing image. No loops, no filter-verb stacks; every clause advances image or stakes. The final sentence’s “nonlinear and perfect and endlessly unfolding” triad is earned cadence, not template.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Combines cosmic orchard, pistachio-shell mnemonics, and bathroom metaphysics into an inevitable synthesis: grief agriculture. The nonlinear memory-bequest subverts the chosen-one trope by making remembrance a burden, not a power-up. Risky second-person intimacy with dead universes could slide into gimmickry, but the specificity of taste and sigil keeps it grounded. The piece would collapse if any element were swapped—no generic stand-ins possible.</comment>
