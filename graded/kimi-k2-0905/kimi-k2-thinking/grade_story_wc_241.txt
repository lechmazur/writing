<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lila’s contradictory drives—academic rigor vs. inherited superstition—are dramatized in embodied beats (fingers on lantern, overlaying transparencies). The final vow to teach “without the pain of loss” crystallizes an earned renunciation, though the interiority occasionally drifts toward abstract self-diagnosis (“lucid contradictions were not puzzles…”) that lightly blunts emotional immediacy.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: lantern scrawls → subway hunt → sealed alcove → hidden deck, each step narrowing options. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the lantern becomes a pedagogical beacon whose cost is the irreversibility of her father’s death and her vow to repurpose risk. The Orientation Test is waived: late disorientation (false panel, corridor) is taught early by the lantern-map and pays off in the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The lantern’s mica pane functions as micro-setting that literally constrains perception (coded light projection) and charges the final image. Rain-washed midsummer library and subway scars are filtered through Lila’s probability eye—every scratch is a data point—so sensory detail never sprawls; it accumulates pattern. Spatial choreography is clean: corner table → train seat → sealed corridor → circular chamber, bodies and objects tracked without drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: reconcile randomness with certainty. Escalation is textural—each new scrawl thickens the pattern rather than flipping the plot—but the deepening reweights cost: the final deck proves her father’s life was already a textbook in loss. One meaningful tightening: the map points to a room that was always there, foreclosing the option to dismiss superstition as noise.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: chance vs. certainty is lived, not lectured. The lantern’s glow reframes the father’s compulsive scribbles into a curriculum, a non-literal answer that avoids moralizing. Subtext in subway graffiti (“Chance is a circle with no edge”) is left to resonate; no closing thesis spells out the paradox, preserving ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tightly anchored to Lila’s perceptual filter—probability ratios surface in everyday graffiti—without head-hop. Syntax flexes under pressure: longer, hypotactic sentences in the library yield to fragment-like jolts on the train. Diction stays within a mathematician’s lexicon; “hidden Markov chain” is used, not explained, trusting context.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with scene tempo: languid clauses for library humidity, staccato for subway lurches. No scaffold loops; each sentence either advances hunt or deepens atmosphere. One mixed metaphor—“the city’s arteries held a secret map of chance”—survives because it’s framed as the father’s superstitious idiom, not narrator excess. Information density high: a single sentence links lantern, father, heart attack, and thematic question.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Freshest synthesis: treating urban graffiti as marginalia in a living textbook on probability. The lantern-as-projector and deck-as-textbook fuse luck and logic without feels-like-a-prompt checkboxes. Risk taken—sealed alcove reveal—pays off by making the library itself a rigged roulette wheel. Could shave 0.2 if subway codes felt too conveniently authored, but the text frames them as desperate gambler palimpsest, not treasure map.</comment>
