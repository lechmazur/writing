<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The son’s inherited shame and need to “thread a labyrinth with his own story” give a clear, personal motor; his quiet, embodied pacing and the final renunciation of speech for silence show interior contradiction. Yet the father remains a legend rather than a lived memory, so the emotional calculus never sharpens to a visible wound on the page; the cost is implied rather than felt in body or choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the lattice stays behind, the door seals, and “chasing hush” becomes an eternal, conceptual price—an Earned Stasis that forecloses any return. Causality is lyric-accumulative rather than tight because/therefore; the pattern is taught early and the final image reweights the whole myth. One minor slack: the “before they find the bodies” ticking clock is declared but never visibly tightens tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The lighthouse-prison, reef, and copperlit stone are tactile, selective, and filtered through the POV’s obsession with silence; the lattice’s grain and the scuffed door constrain the only possible path. Spatial choreography is clean; the spiral descent and final sealed chamber track without drift. The copper glow charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate for environment-as-constraint.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—will he manage to silence the paternal echo before discovery—tightens once, at the staircase descent, but the “before they find the bodies” threat stays abstract; no visible resource (time, breath, tool) is forfeited on the page. Agency is present—he speaks faster, seals the door—but the cost is conceptual rather than viscerally felt, keeping escalation just shy of high-band charge.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly: inherited shame transmuted into self-inflicted silence, the impossibility of ever outrunning a lie. The copperlit lattice and the sealed chamber reprice “truth” as a living hush rather than speech. No moral is stated; the final image of eternal whispering lighthouse invites ambiguous reflection without forced profundity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person lyric voice sustains a consistent perceptual signature—salt-tinged copperlight, spiral echoes, wood grain—without head-hop or register drift. Sentence rhythm mirrors the descent: long winding clauses tighten into shorter, breath-held fragments at the altar. The diction stays within plausible keeper lexicon; no filter-verb stacks dull immediacy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense, rhythmic, and largely loop-free; metaphor strings (“copperlight repose,” “sustaining impossibilities”) are patterned early and repay in the final glow. One paraphrase loop (“the hush he chased became the lighthouse’s breath… the hush lingered”) lightly dulls the exit beat. Otherwise, high information density and vivid specificity carry momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The inversion of the wolf-cry fable into a quest for absolute silence is fresh; the lattice as confessional relic that literally “sustains impossibilities” offers a concrete, non-obvious mechanism. Copper-lit carceral lighthouse fuses symbols without checklist feel. Risky lyric structure stays coherent under accumulative lens, elevating stakes rather than obscuring them.</comment>
