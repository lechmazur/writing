<comment>Mira’s withdrawn-medicine fragility and river-chronicler eye stay concrete—her breath-counting, frayed-map ritual, ivy-whispers all embody her need to measure and memorialize. Contradictory impulse (guilt vs. survivor-urge) surfaces early but is told more than dramatized until the accordion touch; interiority flirts with therapy-speak (“path to self-forgiveness”). Micro-choices (tracing graffiti, leaving the bellows) show hierarchy of values yet the climactic relinquishment is lightly motivated—no prior beat shows why leaving the bellows equals absolution. Still, the specificity of her perceptual lens and the visible cost of enduring memory keep her credible and individual.</comment>

<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: station ivy, bellows, graffiti, and map circles accrue associative weight until the final “song you learn to play again” reconfigures meaning. Orientation is swift; spatial logic holds as Mira moves platform → waiting room → bathroom → bench → tracks. Closure is a Charged Poise: she walks into night carrying “map references…imprinted,” a stasis that forecloses the old guilt-loop and costs her the bellows talisman. Causal linkage is thin—graffiti coincidence is the main turn, not an earned reversal—so escalation feels atmospheric, not consequential, keeping the score shy of 8.8.</comment>

<comment>Ivy-choked station is tactile and lived-in: rusted bench cools palms, dust muffles footfalls, decay scents the air; environment mirrors mental overgrowth. Accordion bellows functions as micro-setting, constraining her ritual and later charging the exit image. Selective sensory hierarchy—sound-as-needle, paint still tacky—filters through medicated-heightened perception. Spatial choreography across platform, waiting room, bathroom is flawless; no impossible prop leaps.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—self-forgiveness for the bridge-night—is signaled early; pressure intensifies atmospherically via sensory overload rather than narrowing options. No concrete trade-off is dramatized; graffiti advice arrives as coincidence, not earned reversal. Cost is conceptual (she lets the bellows stand as “silent testament”) but not viscerally felt on the page. Thus escalation remains evocative, not tactical.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Theme of healing-as-river emerges organically via recurring water/flow imagery; final line reweights “truth” as current, avoiding moral tag. Subtext rests in gesture—leaving the bellows speaks louder than any apology. Ambiguity lingers: is silence music or surrender? Insight is earned through sensory particulars, not sermonizing, though the graffiti tag edges toward prompt-echo.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Lyrical third-person hovers close to Mira’s medicated hyper-perception: “every sound felt like a needle,” “red ink like wounds.” Rhythm pulses with clause-variation and breath-length fragments that mimic accordion draw. No dialogue, hence no voice convergence; perceptual signature stays consistent. Occasional elevated phrasing (“raw solace,” “conceptual repricing”) slightly exceeds POV lexicon but reads as intentional incantatory heightening.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Generally high density: sentences layer sensory, metaphoric, and emotional work. Filter-verb clusters (“felt,” “seemed”) appear but are voice-motivated under drug-heightened uncertainty. Mixed metaphor watch: “stain of a night” beside “river swallowed the bridge” stays coherent within water idiom. Repetitive construction “each…each…” is limited to one cadence and serves ritual effect; no paraphrase loops or synonym churn obscure causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Fusion of medicated-perception study with abandoned-station forgiveness rite feels fresh; accordion-bellows-as-absolution is an unlikely talisman. River-chronicler occupation is specific, not generic survivor. Synthesis of ivy, map, and musical ruin creates new symbolic grammar. However, the core arc—guilt seeker finds cryptic graffiti advice—flirts with familiar literary trope, limiting higher band.</comment>
