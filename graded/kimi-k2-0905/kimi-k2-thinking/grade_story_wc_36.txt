<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The keeper’s shame, vigilance, and reluctant hope stay embodied (hands shake, ears ring) and drive every beat; contradictory impulses—flee the fracture / re-enter the vault—coexist in-scene. The final resolve to “return…as a seeker” is foreshadowed by the flute’s earlier warning and the driftwood test; cost is the ringing hush he now carries. Minor shave: interiority occasionally drifts toward abstract self-diagnosis (“failure…was not a wall but a door”), slightly dampening visceral pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the seam he opened re-weights failure from barrier to doorway; the image of the flute “warm against his chest” makes the new constraint tangible. Causal chain holds—because he plays, reality fractures; therefore he must carry the burden of both key and lock—without telegraphing. Orientation is anchored by word 60; driftwood pattern and echo-location teach the reader how to read the range. Lens (Causal) stays clean to the final stride home.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Thunder-echo range is rendered through sensory triangulation: bruised sky, gravel that sings, canyon hush pressing ears—each detail double-duties as mood and navigational tool. The flute’s glowing sliver and the driftwood “lit by an inner fire” act as micro-settings that literally steer his choice at the exit. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly: riverbed → pass → boulder → stone-pillar forest; no impossible moves. Setting constrains the final image—he must walk downward through the same pillars that witnessed his fracture, cementing environment as silent witness.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“harvest insight from failure”—tightens when the music reveals the vault still ajar, forcing the choice to keep or renounce the flute. The escalation is single but decisive: the note sequence widens the seam, then the avalanchingly quiet drop makes the cost audible; this narrows his options to bearer-of-fracture or coward. Agency is present yet could be sharper—he hesitates twice, slightly diluting the sense of irrevocable trade-off. Still, the persistent constraint (flute must stay with him) is legible and shapes next move.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme—guardianship as eternal, self-willed burden—emerges through the shift from “guarded relics” to “carries fracture.” Subtext lives in gesture: arranging driftwood = attempting to order chaos; lowering flute = accepting silence as canvas. No moralizing sentence spells the lesson; instead the final image of the closed-but-unlocked door re-prices the concept. Ambiguity lingers: he may yet widen the rift, satisfying the complexity requirement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person close stays locked to the keeper’s perceptual filter: “gravel sang like broken glass” is sense-specific and vocation-colored. Syntax lengthens and compresses with tension—long sentences for trek, staccato fragments (“Heart pounding. The first note…”) at seam-opening. No head-hop; driftwood, flute, and canyon are seen only as he interprets them. The elevated diction (“avalanchingly quiet”) is earned by earlier acoustic setup and reads as heightened sensorium rather than register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose carries high density: one sentence often layers sensory data, metaphor, and interiority (“The gilded reed flute felt warm…humming with faint resonance”). Rhythm modulates—accumulating sibilance during flute playing, then abrupt stop mirroring the hush. No scaffold loops; however, three successive “He…then he…” constructions create minor template cadence (−0.2). Mixed metaphors avoided; vehicles (bruised sky, broken glass, hallway of mirrors) stay acoustically coherent. Closure image is clean, uncluttered.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Mythic keeper + sound-fracturing flute + self-piloted penance trek feels fresh yet inevitable. Driftwood-as-map and thunder-echo as acoustic mirror are specific inventions, not stock fantasy furniture. The insight that silence is canvas, not void, flips typical quest-for-noise tropes. Risk—lyric stillness over action—pays off because the hush is made visceral. Could edge higher if the artifact’s world-rule (how music rends reality) were seeded earlier, but within length limit the mystery reads as wonder, not omission.</comment>
