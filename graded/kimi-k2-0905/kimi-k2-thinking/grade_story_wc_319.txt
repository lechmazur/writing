<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The guardian’s interior contradiction—guardian instinct vs exile-ache—surfaces in every lick of ice, giving a concrete micro-choice that digests the world into memory. Emotion stays embodied in frost-bit tongue and matted fur; no diagnostic labels. The final smile is earned: centuries of waiting crystallize into a stance that costs the last warmth. What keeps it from 8+ is the absence of a second, sharper external pressure that forces a forked decision with visible fallout.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a textbook Conceptual Repricing: “home was a way of waiting” re-weights exile as self-chosen poetics; cost is the pendant’s cold weight against flesh. Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout—pattern of licking/reading/folding intensifies until meaning itself is redefined. No orientation debt; who-where-when is anchored by “single, snow-locked courtyard” at 60 words. The only drag is a touch of loop-phrase (“waiting was no longer…” thrice) but it does not obscure the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Frozen garden is not backdrop but prosthetic extension: ice glyphs force the guardian to read by tongue, mist curtails vision so navigation must be mnemonic. Pendant’s impossible geometry is re-handled three times, each state altering what can be perceived. Micro-setting (the pendant lens) literally bends light and choice. Falls short of 8.5 because no environmental detail directly forecloses a live alternate path—garden never offers thaw vs eternal cold fork.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—make friends with uncertainty—tightens via accretion: each lick dissolves one more certainty into memory. Pendant’s cold pulse is the single escalating beat that re-weights perception. Guardian’s agency is interiorized; no external antagonist, so pressure is lyric not tactical. Cost is felt but diffuse (nostalgia as chronic ache); lacks a corporeal price that would push it to 8+ band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges entirely through imagistic returns—pendant, ice, waiting—never named as thesis. Final line re-prices exile into elective poetics without moralising. Ambiguity is productive: reader must decide whether “home” is defeat or transcendence. The inversion of light-boundary from visual limit to epistemic humility is a fresh conceptual turn that lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to guardian’s alien sensorium: syntax elongates like breath in frost, verbs favor tongue-touch and claw-scrape. No head-hop; cultist remains a silhouette outside veil. Patterned elision (“a light that belonged to no sky it remembered”) is taught early and paid off in final door-from-mist. Only micro-slip: one near-philosophic noun string (“the boundary of light…where vision itself became meaningless”) momentarily lifts register above beast-voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>High information density—each sentence layers frost, memory, metaphysics without scaffold. Metaphors stay physically coherent (ice = unreadable glyphs). Rhythm modulates: longer clauses mirror mist-thickened perception; end-stopped fragments mimic claw taps. Minor loop “waiting was…” appears three times; because it is clustered in closing paragraph it blunts the final punch, preventing 8.5.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Takes trope of exiled guardian and reframes exile as voluntary epistemic stance; inversion feels inevitable in hindsight. Pendant-as-lens that shows “what light could never reach” is a fresh cosmological object. Risk taken: 700-word lyric accumulation without external plot, yet coherence holds. Loses 0.4 because frozen-garden imagery faintly echoes popular “library in winter” Tumblr vignettes; not fully shakeable.</comment>
