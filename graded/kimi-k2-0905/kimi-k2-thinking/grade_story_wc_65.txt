<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Kaelen’s interiority is concrete—her fingers ache, the quill trembles—but the “ignorance cartographer” premise is asserted more than dramatized; we watch her *perform* mapping rather than feel ignorance as lived stakes. The elders’ nod is too frictionless; skepticism evaporates without a micro-choice that shows Kaelen paying social coin. Still, the kingfisher nib as an extension of her tactile mind keeps the portrait above the middle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The causal spine is legible: data-gathering → lattice-models → angled-borehole plan → council assent. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the warm spire above intact ice reweights every prior risk. A −0.2 slip because the elders’ yes feels outline-easy; the visible cost is deferred to future winters rather than paid on this page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Obsidian that drinks light, a lake that refuses reflection, a nib carrying “blue-green memory of open water”—each detail is filtered through Kaelen’s need to *see* heat hidden in stone. The spire’s thermal flexion becomes literal leverage for drilling angles; setting is not backdrop but tool. Final image of thaw *beneath* preserved bridge satisfies 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stakes are survival vs. collapse; one tightening occurs when elders’ fear of cracked ice could still veto the plan. Escalation is modest—no reversal—yet the cost is conceptually legible: any miscalculation will fracture their only trade artery. Agency stays with Kaelen; her lattice-modeling *is* the beat that narrows possibility.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme—maps as futures, futures as fragile infrastructure—emerges through the kingfisher nib, the unrolled vellum, the phased boreholes rather than thesis lines. Final image of “pen poised forever above the blank page” reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext stays in negative space: what remains unmapped is still lethal.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person hovers at Kaelen’s shoulder, anchored to her perceptual bias toward thermal gradients and fracture angles. Syntax lengthens during modeling, then shortens to hammer the elders’ verdict. No head-hop, no filter-verb glut; “ignorance cartographer” is the sole jargon coin and it is paid off by method.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies: long anaphoric clauses mimic lattice-branching, then clipped declaratives mirror council release. No paraphrase loops; “obsidian spire rose like a cracked black tooth” is the only simile and it earns its place. One mixed metaphor risk—“pen poised forever above the blank page of tomorrow”—but the conceptual twist rescues it.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The fusion of geothermal engineering with cartographic mysticism feels non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. “Ignorance cartographer” could have read as clever sticker; here it is grounded in freeze-thaw data threads and borehole trigonometry. Risk of council veto keeps the concept from sliding into TED-talk allegory.</comment>
