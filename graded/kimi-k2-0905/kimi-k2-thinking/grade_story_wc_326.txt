<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses—life-in-death clerical error vs. ghost-in-silica—are dramatized through ink-tracing and shard-contact beats; the final resolve to “mend her own life” is earned by prior mirror-work with the ghost. Heartbeat-counting recurs as embodied cost, not label. Micro-choices (pressing shard to screen, pouring ink) reveal value hierarchy under pressure; no competence overreach. Interiority stays specific to her perceptual bias—circuits taste “old,” static “cleared”—avoiding diagnostic speak. Flaw drives plot: her ghost-file status lets her read the ghost’s fracture map, making the error a crucible, not backstory ornament.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: clerical error → observatory trip → ink defrag → shard spark → ghost voice → self-mend. Orientation anchored by word 30 (“opal observatory rose from the snow”). Closure is Conceptual Repricing: the shard goes cold, cost legible as “private metronome” now tuned to universe, not machine. No teleporting props; porcelain tracked from pocket to screen. Escalation tightens once—ghost’s whisper shifts from static to map—sufficient for 700-word window. Persistent constraint: heartbeat-counting continues after exit, proving price sticks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Observatory-as-body: glass dome mirrors her cranial dome; server-room air “tastes of old circuits” fuses mind/machine. Snow-quiet outside, ink-nerve inside—micro-setting objects (shard, terminal, vial) constrain every move. Tool-use tactile: stylus traces ink, shard completes circuit. Spatial choreography clean—no impossible reaches. Environment evolves: snow keeps falling, dome keeps glowing, final image reweights “opal” from jewel to skull. No occupational dumps; only details that affect defrag tactics appear.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake: prove she is alive by restoring a ghost—life/death authority at risk. Tightening beat: shard-to-screen spark collapses option to walk away; ghost’s map now her only exit. Cost visible: porcelain goes cold, heartbeat-count lingers—felt price. Escalation driven by her agency under causal lens; no coincidence resolves. One meaningful turn suffices; no antagonist needed. Moral calculus—use brokenness to mend brokenness—sharpens peak choice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges from pattern: fracture (certificate, cup, code) → map → mend. No explicit thesis; final “quiet curtain” reweights prior fractures as navigation tools. Subtext in silence: ghost’s last chime is acceptance, not triumph. Emotional aftereffect: reader left counting own pulse. Resists moral; ambiguity lingers—she exits alive yet still ghost-filed somewhere. Particulars (ink veins, porcelain cold) carry universality without abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lyric third-person hovers close to her sensory filter; diction (“frozen thought,” “midnight solace”) stays within poetic, not purple, register. Rhythm mirrors heartbeat—short clauses under pressure, longer reflective sentences post-defrag. No head-hop; POV locked. Perceptual signature: she notices taste of circuits, static hum, ink nerves—never generic tech. Compression taught early (“opal observatory rose…”) and paid off in final dome/skull echo. Filter verbs minimal; immediacy preserved.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Read-aloud cadence varies; no template runs. Sentences multitask: “She pressed the porcelain shard against the terminal screen; the contact sparked a soft light, merging ceramic fracture with digital fracture.” Information-dense, no scaffolding. Metaphors coherent—ink as nerves, shard as bridge—no mixed vehicles. Zero paraphrase loops; each line adds new pressure or texture. Opening anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image (“quiet curtain”) that recharges “opal dome.” Copy-clean; no typos.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: bureaucratic undeath + memory-in-silica ghost + ink divination equals new angle on survival. Porcelain shard as ceramic/code bridge is non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking: lyric causal design in <800 words without exposition dump succeeds. No close echoes of famous scenes. Conceptual integrity: commits to fracture-as-map rule start-to-finish. Specific detail (“sterile email that arrived while she was still breathing”) avoids generic survivor tale. Emotional specificity > surface novelty.</comment>
