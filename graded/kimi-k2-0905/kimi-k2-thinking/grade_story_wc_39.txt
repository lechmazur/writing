<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The poet’s hunger to bottle memory is vivid—her stained hands, the paperclip key, the nightly ritual—but the climactic “open all jars” choice feels slightly abstract; the cost (weight on chest, dawn whistle) is named more than embodied. Interior contradiction is strong: she both hoards and releases, yet the pivot from merchant to communal librarian skips one visible beat of internal resistance. Still, her flawed, salt-ink compulsion carries the piece.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the loft becomes a singing library, the pennies replaced by wind-carried verses—cost is the irrevocable exposure of her private archive. Causality holds: each jar originates in a concrete prior action (wax seal, paperclip wind-up) and the final release is the sum of those choices. Lens is accumulative/textural; pattern of collected sound-drops tightens until the solstice symphony reweights meaning. No orientation debt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The feral loft breathes sand, the rotting ladder splinters underfoot, and the glass jars glow like captive stars—each detail is tactile, lived-in, and later constrains the climax (wax seals must be broken to free sound). Dunes, salt-stained shutters, and tourist-basement geography stay consistent and purposeful. Micro-setting (music box varnish “like old sunburn”) charges the final image when the same surface becomes the page she writes on with condensed notes.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—translate loss into spendable memory—tightens when she realizes pennies are worthless against forgetting; the meaningful deepening is the shift from selling to gifting, foreclosing her prior livelihood. Pressure grows accumulatively: each jar adds literal weight and social risk (library ostracism). Cost is visible: her chest bruised by glass-pressed sleep, her solitude exposed at dawn release. No causal escalation break.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: memory as communal honey rather than private currency. Subtext lives in gesture—wax scraped from abandoned candles becomes the seal that later must be broken, enacting the theme of necessary loss. Final image of wind carrying singable verses offers conceptual repricing without moralizing. The refusal to tidy grief into fortune-cookie comfort sustains complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet grounded: “sand and memory,” “honey and rust,” “invisible architecture of sound” all stay within the poet’s plausible lexicon while forging a distinct rhythmic signature. Perceptual signature is consistent—she notices varnish like sunburn, labels jars with dates she never lived—never drifts into tourist-catalog. Compression (“air itself thickened with notes”) is taught early and paid off when she dips pen into that thickened air.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Sentences vary from sinuous accumulation to short declarative labels (“Grandmother’s Monday, 1947”), creating tidal rhythm that mimics jarred sound-waves. Figurative density is high yet purposeful; only one mixed metaphor risk (“currency of loss into something spendable”) but it is saved by subsequent concrete payoff. No loops, scaffold, or synonym churn; information density remains high with every line doing dual work (image + motive).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The sound-in-jars conceit freshens the well-worn “artist vs. oblivion” trope by literalizing preservation as distillation of droplets of light. Risk of twee is averted through grit: paperclip keys, salt-stained hands, vagrant poverty. Synthesis feels inevitable—of course a penny poet would hoard sound once coins fail her. Specificity of the honey-rust taste of the melody makes the device memorable rather than gimmick.</comment>
