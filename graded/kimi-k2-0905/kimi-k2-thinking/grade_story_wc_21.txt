<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara’s solemn-archivist identity is vividly anchored (three decades, encrypted diary, zeppelin library). Retro-cognitive entrapment dramatizes internal contradiction—she wakes with sand in sheets—yet the Under-Minister pivot feels abrupt; his inherited silence is told more than embodied. Final renunciation (“finally slept without sand”) lands as earned stasis, cost legible. Interior texture strong; secondary-character pressure thinner.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: joint disclosure crystallizes new equilibrium with social cost (grandfather’s reputation bargained). Causal lattice holds—diary cipher → debris key → grandfather’s vault photo—each because/therefore tightens options. Lens is causal throughout. One micro-turn suffices; no orientation debt; cost unmistakable in final image of dunes “silent and shifting.” Minor slack: Under-Minister motivation shift summarized, not dramatized.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Zeppelin-library micro-setting constrains every move (tilt, reinforced windows, hologram map table); obsidian lagoon memory recharges final image. Sensory hierarchy follows archivist priorities—leather, glass, tide charts—rather than tourist catalog. Spatial choreography clean across map-room parley. Weather and coastal topography subtly guide debris-cipher logic. No excess breadth; each detail either pressures choice or reappears at closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—truth vs. erasure—signaled in diary’s first line. Escalation driven by her debris demonstration inside the zeppelin; that act forecloses denial option for Under-Minister, narrows to negotiation. Retro-cognitive cost (sand in sheets, lost sleep) is visible price. Premeditation reveal intensifies moral stakes without external coincidence. One meaningful tightening sufficient; agency legible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from specific binaries: archive vs. erasure, driftwood testimony vs. tide, grandfather as betrayer/whistleblower. Final image of dunes “silent and shifting” offers conceptual repricing—landscape itself becomes complicit archive. No moralizing line; resonance carried by object return. Ambiguity preserved: villains/victims share uniform. Emotional aftereffect concrete: “whispers no longer demanding she bear them alone.”</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice fuses archival precision with coastal lyricism—“searing reverie,” “obsidian lagoon,” “saltwater taste of survival.” Perceptual signature consistent: Elara notices encryption, catalog angles, tide tables. Rhythm modulates: longer clauses for retro-cognitive bleed, clipped fragments during parley. No head-hopping; Under-Minister’s interior surfaced only through flinch and family-vault cue. Experimental compression (“sand in her throat”) taught early and paid off at close.</answer>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>High information density: single sentences twin debris grammar with emotional stakes—“seven white pebbles, a crossed stick, three shells—‘seven killed, betrayed, three survivors.’” Metaphors disciplined; no mixed vehicles. Sentence variety supports cadence; no template cadence detected. Minor filter verbs in retro-cognition summaries but justified by lyric mode. Closure line clean, propulsion unbroken.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Premise synthesizes cold-case archive, retro-cognition, and zeppelin library—fresh yet inevitable. Debris-as-cipher transforms familiar Holocaust-code trope into coastal idiom. Grandfather complication flips expected villain arc without absolution. Structural risk—mosaic of memory shards—paid off by taught pattern and coherent closure. Emotional specificity (“sand in sheets”) prevents abstraction. Risk enhances stakes; no gimmickry.</comment>
