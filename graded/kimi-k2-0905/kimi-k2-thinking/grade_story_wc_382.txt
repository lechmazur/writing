<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mrs. Voss’s calmly subversive stewardship and Alex’s hunger to “speak” the building are sharply embodied; the patiently-nimble trait shows in micro-choices (chipping plaster, pressing the seal) that cost her cover. Interior contradiction—preservation vs. exposure—drives every beat, and her final hand-on-shoulder transfer of guardianship lands as earned renunciation. Alex’s motivation stays concrete: first curiosity, then custodianship, sealed by the brass imprint. No label-speak; even “dead languages” is spoken over bergamot steam and concrete graffiti.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the seal’s fresh imprint rewrites the ward’s erased text, reconfiguring Alex’s role from visitor to scribe while the building “shivers.” Causality is clean—weekly tea → hidden history → Mrs. Voss chips plaster → meteor cue → basement act—each because/therefore link tightening options. Orientation anchors (7B, Tuesday November move-in, rooftop garden) arrive by line 5 and hold. Cost is visible in wet plaster and in Mrs. Voss’s exposure of her life’s covert work; the lens stays causal throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The antique desk seal functions as micro-setting: its brass floor-plan face literally shapes the final choice when pressed into wet plaster over nurses’ graffiti. Rooftop chimney-pot tomatoes and asymmetrical stairwells are filtered through Alex’s architectural ear, guiding movement toward the basement reveal. Weather—meteor shower as “burning letters”—supplies the ticking celestial page that forces immediate action. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from 7B to rooftop to sealed basement without drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“will the building’s authentic grammar survive renovation?”—is signaled in paragraph 3 and escalates when new owners seek “truth” via fabrication. The midpoint tightening occurs when Mrs. Voss confesses demolition plans; options narrow to clandestine inscription or total erasure. Alex’s agency drives the final beat: they carry the seal downstairs and imprint the wall, paying the social risk of trespass and the irreversible exposure of the ward’s ghosts. Cost is legible in fresh plaster and the shiver felt “through the brass.”</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme—memory as negotiated palimpsest—emerges through limestone grammar, meteor punctuation, and the seal’s promise “what is hidden remains.” No explicit thesis; subtext lives in chipped plaster and bergamot steam. Final image reweights every prior “agreed-upon lie” by turning the basement wall into a manuscript no future renovator can unread. Complexity is honored: preservation requires new falsification, Alex becomes both archivist and conspirator.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Third-person stays tight to Alex’s architectural sensorium—walls “conjugate verbs,” water damage is “a lament”—creating a consistent perceptual signature. Mrs. Voss’s diction—“dead languages were my trade”—is distinct without caricature; her cadence is measured, theatrical, aligning with her ex-professor status. No head-hopping; psychic distance compresses under meteor shower urgency yet retains lyric pulse. Prose rhythm modulates from patient tea cadences to staccato basement beats, mirroring rising stakes.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sentences carry double duty: “Borrowing sugar becomes tea becomes truth” advances plot while echoing alchemical transformation. Figurative language is selective—meteor shower as “burning letters,” stairwell as “question mark”—never clogging high-pressure beats. No loops or synonym churn; each image extends the architectural grammar motif. Opening and closing lines act as brackets: Tuesday move-in vs. “next Tuesday” knock, creating circular propulsion without scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: tuberculosis ward hidden inside art-deco apartments, linguistics of limestone, meteor shower as editorial deadline—elements feel inevitable yet unexampled. The antique seal repurposed as printing press for ghosts transforms a static prop into an agent of historiography. Risky second-person invitation—“someone new knocked”—widens mythic resonance without breaking POV. Specificity (bergamot, jade comb, chimney-pot tomatoes) prevents abstract allegory; insight could not survive relocation to another city or era.</comment>
