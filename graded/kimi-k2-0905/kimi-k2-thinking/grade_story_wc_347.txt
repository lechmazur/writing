<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is concrete and consistent—her reluctant duty, the tactile memory of her grandmother’s voice, the way she “cursed softly” while still placing the nut within a millimeter. The renunciation at the end (gathering the nuts, retreating unheard) is an earned stasis that costs her the travelers’ gratitude and any hope of relief from the curse. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in a single beat, so the 9+ bar is missed, but the characterization is strong, specific, and fate-bound.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The causal chain is clean: three travelers appear → Elara must act → each nut-shadow shifts bird patrols → frost deadline → safe exit. Closure is a Charged Poise: the final image of her gathering the worn-smooth nut reweights every prior act of reluctant grace, showing the perpetual cost of inherited duty. Orientation is anchored by line 3 (orchard on cliff, dusk), well inside the 120-word window. No lens ambiguity; causality holds.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The cliffside labyrinth is not backdrop—it actively patrols, freezes, and kills. The mechanical birds’ gear-frost transition is taught early and charges the final frost seal. The sundial stone and poisoned orchard constrain Elara’s motions and moral space. Spatial choreography is flawless: torchlight depth, nut-shadow angles, frost fingers climbing the wall all track cleanly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—get strangers out before nightfall—is signaled in paragraph 4 and tightens with every nut placement. Each shadow is an on-page trade-off that costs her anonymity and emotional energy; the final worn nut embodies years of handled hope. Escalation is causal under the frost clock; no coincidence rescues them. Cost is visible: she forfeits acknowledgement and perpetuates her exile.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the tension between poisoned inheritance and anonymous mercy—no moral is stated, only enacted. The orchard’s curse and the nut’s grace are inseparable, reweighted by the final image of her solitary retreat. Subtext lives in gesture: the nut’s shadow is a wordless signature she can never claim. Complexity is honored—she both resents and fulfills the duty.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric-cinematic, compressed but never generic: “whispering grove,” “clockwork birds whose bronze wings caught the last light.” Syntax mirrors Elara’s offhand precision—long sensorial sentences that snap into tight placement clauses. No head-hopping; POV stays interior to Elara. Non-standard compression (“graceless beauty”) is taught early and paid off in the final tone.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with the scene—long airborne sentences for dusk, staccato clauses for frost threat. Mixed metaphors are controlled (“frost formed on their gears” keeps physical logic). No synonym loops; each nut placement uses fresh kinetic verbs. Information density is high: one sentence often layers sensory detail, world rule, and emotional tilt. Minor over-adornment in the opening paragraph keeps it from 9.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The cursed-orchard-mechanism-labyrinth fusion is fresh, yet the emotional engine—reluctant guardian saving strangers she’ll never meet—feels inevitable. Specificity of the nut-shadow-code and gear-frost transition prevents template drift. Risk is taken: no dialogue, no traveler POV, yet tension holds. Transformation test passes: swap nut for amulet and the whole shadow-logic collapses.</comment>
