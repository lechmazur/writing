<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is concrete—her “trained eye,” the hush she breathes in—but her contradictory impulses stay off-stage; we see resolve, not friction. The moment she decides to enter the manager’s office carries no visible cost to her personally (no risk of job loss, social rupture), so the change feels administrative rather than crucible-forged. Competence outweighs struggle; quiet diligence is shown but never genuinely tested against self-interest.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Causal chain is clean: lens → doodles → numbers → timestamps → confession. Closure lands as Decisive Change with social cost (stagehand’s tears, audit promise). One slack link: the doodles’ “ambiguously clear” trait is asserted, never demonstrated blocking or enabling action, so the final beat relies on announced rather than dramatized clarity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Crystal forecourt, rain-sheen stone, and ticket stub as micro-setting filter through Elara’s registrar eye; the glass lens is tactile, weighted, and re-used. Spatial choreography stays coherent—stage door, lobby, office—without white-room drift. The lens charges the final image (rests on desk as emblem), satisfying the 9+ gate for object-as-setting constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—thaw mistrust via transparency—is signaled early and tightens once when Elara chooses to eavesdrop/project, narrowing her ethical stance. Pressure is coherent but external: missing funds, staff glances; her personal risk remains abstract, so the cost is felt by others (stagehand, team) more than by her. Sufficient for 600-word scale but not acutely priced on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme of transparency-as-liberation emerges through dramatized revelation, not sermon. Final image of the lens on her desk reweights earlier “see beyond the surface” etching into quiet covenant. No moralizing sentence mars closure; ambiguity lingers in the “resonant hush.” Could sharpen if Elara paid a private price for honesty.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Third-limited voice stays stable; perceptual signature is registrar-precise (“timestamps she had meticulously kept”). Rhythm modulates—long breaths for hush, clipped beats for discovery. No dialogue to test distinction, yet narrative idiom remains consistent. Filter verbs (“she noticed,” “she realized”) are occasional but not clustered under peak pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose is clean, read-aloud rhythmic, with purposeful repetition (“resonant hush”) that accumulates meaning. No mixed metaphors or scaffold loops; information density is high. Minor slack: two adjacent “she felt” phrases could compress, yet they do not obscure causality or dull the closing image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>The lens-as-revelation device is familiar; freshness comes from the registrar’s bureaucratic gaze turning ticket serial numbers into evidence. Crystals whispering secrets edges toward lyric trope but is grounded in post-rain acoustics. Story feels particular to Elara’s vocation; removing her registrar habits would collapse the logic. Risk level is moderate, execution competent rather than startling.</comment>
