<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses—scientific skepticism vs. magnetic grief—are alive in every beat; the seashell pressed to her ribs, her knees collapsing into velvet, show embodied cost without diagnostic label. Micro-choice hierarchy peaks when she abandons equations and speaks through the garden; the renunciation closes the independence-isolation loop with visible, felt price. Voice remains character-bound; “charmed skeptic” diction never slips into editorial certainty. One hairline slip: “ghostly resolve settled like a shroud” is a touch atmospheric-generic amid otherwise specific interiority.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each velvet petal, phosphorescent moss flake, and shell echo thickens the membrane until the final cadence shift releases the archive without a causal twist. The orientation anchor (who/where/when) is taught in the first 25 words and paid off when the same garden at dawn reconfigures meaning. Closure is a Charged Poise: “She was still alone, but the ghostly resolve had become her own” crystallizes options—bridge crossed, path foreclosed—cost felt in the cold, silent shell. No causality breaks; resonance structures obey their own taught pattern.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Garden as micro-setting constrains every tactical move: petals brush ankles to reproach, moss glows to deny her equations, soil vibrates to accept her relinquished words. Velvet/ phosphorescence/ dawn color progression evolves with events; spatial choreography tracks her crawl, kneel, stand, exit without drift. Sensory hierarchy skews tactile-auditory, mirroring her need to “listen” through ribs; visual purples layer rather than catalogue. The shell’s jagged edge as tool-anchor charges the final cold keepsake image; irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—translate isolation into independence while archiving the sister—tightens when the garden demands surrender of the very equations that define her independence. One deepening: realizing quarantine is cocoon, not prison, reweights the cost of relinquishing silence. Agency remains hers; no coincidence resolves the tension. Felt price is the shell’s silence and the permanent solitude she now elects to carry; escalation plateaus rather than spikes, so ceiling stops at 8.4.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the iterated inversion of isolation: quarantine → cocoon → bridge, never sermonized. Final image of dawn garden holding “both of them” reweights every prior purple petal into dual citizenship of memory and freedom. Subtext operates in hush: shell falls silent, garden stops whispering—meaning conveyed by cessation. Avoids tidy moral; “true independence is not absence of connection” is earned through visceral surrender, not asserted.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical-accumulative voice teaches its pattern early: sentence fragments (“Each petal heavy…”) mirror the staccato of fragmented sister-voice. Syntax tightens under pressure—final paragraph uses parataxis, no subordinate clutter, rhythm breathes with sunrise. Diction stays within a science-leaning skeptic’s lexicon yet admits impossible verbs (“listened through resonance structures”). No filter-verb stacks; every perception is bone-deep. Distinct perceptual signature sustained.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Read-aloud ear: cadence varies from velvet long sentences to clipped shell-edge fragments; no template cadence detected. Information density high—one sentence often layers sensory, emotional, conceptual work. Metaphors remain coherent within garden physics; no contradictory vehicles. Only micro-loop: “tragically radiant” appears twice; second instance feels decorative, not accumulative, docking 0.2. Otherwise zero scaffold, zero paraphrase.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Familiar grief-to-sister-transformation trope is re-angled through quantum-garden resonance and archival surrender rather than reunion. Specificity of phosphorescent moss equations, shell-edge rib vibration, and dawn-color clock makes the impossible feel inevitable. Risk taken: lyrical accumulative structure over plot reversals, paid off by legible Charged Poise. Slight proximity to “vanished loved one in liminal garden” motif keeps it from 9.0.</comment>
