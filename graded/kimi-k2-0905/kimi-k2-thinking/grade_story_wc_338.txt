<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elena’s interiority is granular and profession-specific—she “touches the rain-scoured fresco vault above, feeling the textured history under her fingertips,” a tactile beat that marries curiosity to reverence. Her contradictory impulses (methodical vs. empathetic) coexist in the same moment of reopening the chapel, not in alternating abstracts. The final choice—documenting quietly rather than proclaiming—carries visible cost: she threads the tear with silver, forever marking her own cartography with vulnerability. No diagnostic speak; every emotion is embodied in glue-scented air and silver filament.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the silver thread across the tear reweights the whole premise—maps now carry audible silence. Causal lens holds throughout: because the tear intersects the henge, therefore Elena investigates; because she compares silent videos, therefore she detects the seam; because she presses, the chapel reopens. Cost is legible in the final image—the map is forever bifurc yet re-bound, a conceptual repricing of knowledge vs. reverence. No orientation debt; anchors (who/where/when) are fixed within 40 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The rain-scoured fresco vault is not backdrop but tool: its cracked plaster guides her finger to the seam, then reappears as the ceiling she touches inside the chapel, recharging the same texture with new devotional weight. Micro-setting (the torn map on her worktable) literally constrains her next move—she must travel. Sensory hierarchy obeys Elena’s parchment-and-glue vocation: scent of old parchment arrives first, sound of rain last. No static catalog; every stone is noticed because it might be a door.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake is epistemic: will the unknown stay mute? Pressure tightens once—frame-by-frame comparison reveals the seam, foreclosing the possibility that the tear is accidental. Escalation is accumulative: decades of silent footage compress into one visible shift, a cadence jump that reweights the stake from restoration to revelation. Cost is felt in the final beat: she renounces loud discovery, threads the tear, forfeits professional triumph for guarded reverence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: silence is not absence but palimpsest, a canvas of erased stories that still press against the present. The silver thread literalizes the theme—history’s wound can be mended only if its fracture remains visible. Subtext operates in gesture: her palm on cool stone is both knock and caress, curiosity vying with reverence. Final image reconfigures the premise—maps are no longer barriers but stitches between heard and unheard.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Perceptual signature is map-maker precise: “each brushstroke a quiet question,” “cracked plaster” read like shoreline. Rhythm clusters soften under empathy—long vowels in “vaulted silence” mirror the chapel’s hush. No head-hopping; single POV stays inside Elena’s fingertip-level attention. Compression taught early—“whispered chapel” is oxymoron that pays off when she literally hears nothing yet feels addressed.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Zero loops; no two adjacent sentences repeat content. Figurative language is sparse, each metaphor load-bearing: “torn edge where known kingdoms gave way to blank, uncharted space” fuses geography and psyche. Syntax modulates—short clauses for video comparison, longer breathy lines for interior silence. No filter-verb stacks; “she felt” appears once and is justified as tactile verification.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Fusion of cartographer + silent chapel + forensic video comparison feels non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Fresh inflection: a map’s deliberate tear as invitation rather than damage. Risk—quiet lyric closure in a genre that often defaults to triumphal discovery—heightens coherence without gimmick. Transformation test fails: swap map restorer for generic explorer and the emotional calculus collapses.</comment>
