<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Maya’s contradictory impulses—clinging to the rose’s memory while choosing horizontal abandonment—are dramatized in the tactile shift from trellis to asphalt. The bitting-gauge’s re-purposing embodies her grandfather’s precision turned into horticultural defiance, and the final “letting go” costs her the vertical garden she once defended. Interiority stays concrete (“gauge fit her palm like prayer beads”), never drifting into label-speak. One hairline slip: the phrase “geometry of grief” flirts with abstraction, but the next sentence grounds it in asphalt scoring.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the gauge becomes invitation, not entry, reweighting legacy into liberation. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each moonflower seed and scored notch layers density until the final image reconfigures meaning. Causality is intact: petal-drop triggers trek; gauge-tooth enables furrows; moonlight consecrates. Cost is legible in the forfeited fire-escape garden and the gauge left gleaming in dirt—an unrecoverable surrender of the old vertical hold.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The harbor’s salt breath and moon-shattered water constrain timing—only night blooming seeds will survive this salt-lot. The gauge-tooth functions as micro-setting, its steel notches dictating furrow depth and seed spacing. Warm concrete under knees anchors body, while the collapsed cannery bricks “drinking darkness” mirror Maya’s absorption of loss. Environment directly shapes the final image: moonlight across seeded asphalt charges the closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—translate private grief into public light—tightens when the rose dies and the only path is outward to the harbor lot. One meaningful deepening: the gauge shifts from key-master’s tool to soil scalpel, narrowing options (she can’t re-lock the past). No antagonist is needed; pressure is situational and accumulative. Cost is visible: the gauge abandoned in dirt and the vertical garden relinquished.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the gauge’s repurposing: measurement as both memory and invitation. Moonflowers blooming “while the city slept” reweight night from threat to cathedral, a non-literal answer to “how does one reflect light into dark corners.” No moral is stated; the final image of seeded asphalt under moonlight invites multiple readings—restoration, trespass, or ephemeral graffiti. Subtext resides in silence: the city’s “held breath” and the horn-harbor harmony echo her private exhale.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Perceptual signature is precise yet lyrical—Maya notices “millimeters,” “notches,” “shards of silver,” never drifting into generic awe. Rhythm modulates: long cadences mimic “oars in water,” then tighten into single-sentence beats at planting. No head-hopping; interiority stays strictly bounded. The diction remains within her locksmith-grandchild lexicon—no elevated register intrudes.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty: “The gauge’s tooth had once traced the depths of keys, but now it scored soil” advances both backstory and present action. Metaphors stay coherent—moonlight as cathedral, asphalt as canvas—without mixed vehicles. One near-loop: “rhythm of oars in water” repeats; because it is taught early and echoed at closure as earned stasis, it reads as pattern, not scaffold. Zero filter-verb clusters; props track cleanly from pocket to dirt.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The locksmith-to-gardener transmutation of a bitting gauge is fresh, specific, and inevitable in hindsight. Moonflowers as nocturnal graffiti on broken asphalt reframes urban decay without sermon. Risk is taken in the lyric accumulative structure, yet closure remains legible. Slight proximity to “guerrilla gardener” trope keeps it just under 9.0.</comment>
