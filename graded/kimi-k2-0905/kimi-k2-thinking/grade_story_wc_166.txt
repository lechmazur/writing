<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Lyra’s interiority is lyrical but loops on “cosmic verse” abstractions rather than concrete contradiction. Anchor-to-soil moment is a strong embodied choice; later beats merely re-describe her skin-map rather than test it under new pressure, so change feels declared not earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: moon-dust → pigment → skin-map forms a legible chain that lands in a Charged-Poise closure. Orientation is quick; causality wobbles once—“spontaneous anchor” is vivid but never explained why the garden chooses her, a hairline break that keeps the score sub-8.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The garden is rendered through motion, dew, starlight and the dancer’s proprioception; “moonstone dust on petal” is a crisp micro-setting that later constrains her tattoo pigment, meeting the 9+ gate. Spatial logic clean; no environmental choice alters tactics beyond the initial anchor, so just shy of top band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—illicit memory vs. ban—is lyrical but abstract; escalation arrives as repeated declarations of “cosmic verse” rather than tightening options. Cosmic-skin climax does reweight meaning under accumulative lens, giving a visible conceptual cost, satisfying minimal closure for this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of memory-as-tide emerges through motif of lunar dust and skin-ink, never sermonized. Final image of dancer whose body “gleams with cosmic verse” offers resonant reconfiguration without moral, fulfilling the 9+ quick test for quiet endings.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Third-person lyric voice maintains tidal cadence and starlit lexicon without register drift; “salt of forgotten seas,” “obsidian grace” are POV-plausible. Rhythm modulates—short pulsations under peak tattoo scene—without algorithmic repetition; perceptual signature stays specific to dancer’s kinesthetic attention.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong information density—each sentence layers image, motion, and metaphysics. Occasional “cosmic”/“celestial” synonym adjacencies and three instances of “elective exile” restatement pull a −0.3 loop penalty; no muddle in closure line, so artifact cap stays above 7.0.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fusing memory-prohibition with tide-dance and skin-manuscript feels non-obvious; lunar dust → tattoo ink repurposes fantasy trope as bodily poetics. Risky accumulative structure paid off by Charged-Poise closure; not transformative but fresh enough for upper band.</comment>
