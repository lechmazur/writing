<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elias’s solitary occupation and re-purposing of it into a private mission gives a credible, embodied arc: the moment he presses his own brass declaration under the cornerstone dramatizes contradictory stoicism and tenderness. Interiority stays concrete—inkwell weight, tear-tinted mortar—never drifting into self-help labels. The only retreat option is physically removed early, tightening every later choice; his final request for a one-year delay visibly costs him institutional trust. No second character on page means relationship crucible and status bullets are N/A; single-POV interiority and micro-choice pressure are cleanly met.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal lens governs: drawbridge rising → three-day trap → discovery of relics → invention of capsule ritual → personal manifesto sealed with tear-tinted mortar. Each beat narrows Elias’s options while escalating emotional stake; the bridge-lowering council scene crystallizes earned stasis—he forecloses careerist safety by asking for delay. Closure carries undeniable cost: Authority ignorance of his clandestine archive, his grandfather’s inkwell emptied, body salt-raw. Orientation is anchored by line 3; no lens ambiguity or teleporting props.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The drowned pavilion is not backdrop but tool: coral-fingered tiles collapse under his crowbar, salt-eaten mortar decides where capsules can be rammed in. Waterproof ledger, crowbar, and inkwell function as micro-setting, their weight and limits guiding every beat. Sensory selection is filtered through surveyor habit—measure, test integrity, catalog fractures. Final image of tide rising against his departing silhouette recharges the submerged architecture as both site and symbol without overt allegory.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—time-locked survival of forgotten dreams—tightens once the drawbridge seals; no off-island escape possible. Protagonist agency escalates via capsule invention; each mortared note forecloses stealth and risks Authority censure. Visible price: bodily exhaustion, tear-tainted mortar, empty inkwell, professional credibility wagered on the one-year delay. Coincidence absent; pressure coils under Causal lens until stoic report masks private arson of memory.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme—memory as infrastructural repair—emerges through gesture, not thesis: capsules of names rammed into limestone ribs. Subtext in the blank locket and bleached toy forces reader to supply erased lives. Final brass declaration reframes earlier “interlaced absence” as present responsibility. No moralizing line; resonance surfaces in image of tide pulling past a man who now archives loss instead of merely recording decay.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays lashed to Elias’s surveyor diction—precise spatial verbs, mineral nouns, no lyric overflow. Rhythm modulates: short hammer-blow sentences during stone lifting, longer silt-cloud clauses when memory billows. Perceptual signature clear—he measures first, feels second. No dialogue to judge; narrative voice confident, modest, salt-stained.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty—e.g., “Salt water had dissolved the mortar, but not the ambition that had raised these arches” advances both setting and theme. Figurative layer resists purple drift; every metaphor (barnacles blooming where dancers spun) stays physically rooted. No filter-verb clusters, loops, or paraphrase stacks; opening and closing lines are propulsive. Minor repetition of “interlaced absence” twice but cadence justifies thematic threading.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fusing coastal-survey procedural with underwater reliquary is fresh; capsule-archive conceit turns mundane repair into archival liturgy. Tropes of drowned city and lone surveyor are reanimated through specific, occupational detail. Risk in quiet ending pays off: refusal to demolish immediately becomes the decisive, costing act. Conceptual integrity intact—no late rule inventions.</comment>
