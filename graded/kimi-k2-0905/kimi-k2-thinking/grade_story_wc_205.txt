<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Kael’s contradiction between defeated revolutionary and still-burning poet is embodied in every beat—he fondles the shard like a wound, chooses the black cloth of the fallen, and the final traced fracture carries the cost of irreconcilable memory. Interiority stays concrete (“burnished sorrow,” “poet’s heart ached with the weight”) without diagnostic shorthand. The earned stasis—he keeps writing, keeps covering the mirror—rings credible because the prior storm scene has already paid the price in shattered illusions.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the covered mirror now shows a poem, not a lie, and the conceptual cost—truth can only live under cloth—reweights every prior sepia filter. Because/therefore causality holds: shard → storm inscription → Voss’s nod → Kael’s ongoing chronicle; no beat resets or convenient amnesia. Persistent constraint (the cloth, the shard, the covered mirror) shapes tactics from midpoint through last line.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The baroque asteroid is not backdrop but pressure source: storms force the cloth ritual, spires supply ghostlight, and the cracked marble boulevard literally trips memory. Micro-setting inside the grand hall—mirror, cloth, shard—constrains every choice and charges the final covered image. Spatial choreography is immaculate; no floating furniture or impossible sightlines.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“whose past owns the future?”—tightens when the storm inscription burns Voss’s composure, narrowing options to silent assent or open suppression. Agency is Kael’s: he times the storm, presses the shard, reclaims the archive’s truth; luck complicates but does not resolve. Cost is visible in Voss’s cracked mask and the shard’s continued heaviness in pocket.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as the cost of remembering: every image (shard, cloth, covered mirror) reprises the question of whether preservation equals concealment. No moralizing line spells this out; the final poem-on-cloth image reweights prior sepia nostalgia into an unspoken ethical bill. Ambiguity lingers—Voss’s nod is neither conversion nor capitulation—yet feels complete.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is poet-scholar baroque: “ghostlight of bygone eras,” “burnished sorrow,” “gilded skull,” each phrase idiosyncratic to Kael’s diction. Rhythm swells and contracts with storm tempo; no template cadence or synonym loops. Perceptual signature—he sees metaphors in weather and ritual—stays consistent under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm alternates between long breathy accumulations and clipped fragment beats that mimic temporal shatter. Metaphors are dense yet internally coherent; no contradictory vehicles. One minor paraphrase pocket (“the shard was its only honest relic” echoes earlier “fragment of truth”) but it lands outside the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: time-storms + archaeology-of-power + poet-revolutionary turns the familiar “archive vs insurgent” trope into a ritual of mirror-covering as historiography. Specificity—gilded skull asteroid, sepia bureaucratic filter—anchors the concept so it could not swap names and survive. Risk in lyric density pays off because closure image still reads cleanly.</comment>
