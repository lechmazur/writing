<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Interiority is lyrical and consistent; the scribe’s contradictory impulse—writing herself absent while clinging to the thread—peaks in the final offering. Yet the absence of on-page opposition or secondary pressure keeps the arc more mood than crucible; the cost is felt but not fully dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the released thread reframes the entire geography-of-healing premise under Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality is interior and recursive—each obituary beat tightens her stance—so the final renunciation carries legible conceptual cost. Orientation is swift; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Garden, fountain, moss statues, and the thread-as-micro-setting are filtered through scribe-perception; autumn decay mirrors emotional soil. The thread finally charges the image by becoming the compass she relinquishes—environment constrains and releases in one motion.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—map healing through absence—is signaled early; pressure deepens via accumulative pattern of named departures. One meaningful tightening: writing her own absence forecloses retreat. Cost is conceptual (she gives up the thread/record), visible on page, but external stakes remain muted.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of healing-as-practice emerges from iterated ritual, not statement. Final image reweights “geography” from place to ongoing weave, offering resonant ambiguity. No moralizing; the silence after the ship answers the central question.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays tight to scribe’s perceptual signature—selective attention to scent, colour, echo. Syntax lengthens and contracts with emotional breath; no head-hop. Compression (“explained absences”) is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is textured yet disciplined; figurative layering rarely stalls momentum. Occasional soft echo (“lonesome splendor” repeated) nicks perfection but never breaks pattern. Read-aloud rhythm supports the accumulative cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Obituarist-of-the-living + carpet-weft compass gives fresh mythic texture; familiar autumn/departure tropes are transmuted through scribe craft. Risk lies in quiet renunciation rather than external twist; synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
