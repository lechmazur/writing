<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interiority is lyrically embodied—“unearthed silence,” “quietly inspired”—but her contradictory impulse (obedience vs release) is asserted more than dramatized; the final relinquishment of glass prisons is earned by decades of catalogued labor, so renunciation carries cost. Still, the micro-choice that tips her is off-stage; we are told she “began to understand,” not shown the beat where the shift crystallizes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens intact: button density, sand, amber, and canyon echo layer until the final question reweights time itself. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—sand through open hands—that makes the cost legible without sentimental gloss. Orientation is taught early via warehouse geography; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Warehouse, cliffs, and petrified sap wall are tactile, biased through her cataloguing fingers; the jar constrains the climax when pressed to buttons, fulfilling the 9+ gate. Selective sensory economy—resin scent, ticking rafters—mirrors her narrowed attention. Spatial track stays clean; bodies never float.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</question>
<comment>Dominant stake—will she free the prophecy or hoard it—tightens once when the final button clicks; options narrow from archival duty to communal release. Cost is conceptual but unmistakable: centuries of hoarded sand must flow away. Coincidence absent; escalation is density-driven under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</question>
<comment>Theme emerges from concrete accumulation: scattered seeds vs sealed glass. Final question mark is an earned, non-moralizing answer. No prompt-echo thesis; resonance is imagistic. Ambiguity lingers—will anyone listen?—without confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</question>
<comment>Third-person lyric voice sustains rhythmic compression—“time pooled like resin”—without algorithmic pattern. Perceptual signature is consistent: wind, sand, insect-rattle metaphors filter through her cataloguer’s ear. No dialogue, so no voice convergence risk.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</question>
<comment>High density: each sentence layers metaphor that accrues rather than decorates. No scaffold loops; metaphor vehicles stay coherent—glass, sand, resin, canyon. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with escalating pressure. Minor register lift in “syntax of possibility” but justified by conceptual climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</question>
<comment>Premise fuses time-keeper + badland echo-catcher in a way that feels inevitable post-read. Button-as-phoneme is fresh and grows from world logic; risk of lyric sprawl is accepted and paid off. Transformation test passed: swap any noun and the fabric tears.</comment>
