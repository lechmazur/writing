<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Kael’s motive is legible and constant; his centuries of listening give him credible patience. Yet we never see an interior contradiction or momentary doubt that would make the final walk feel costly to him personally—he is more mythic than conflicted. The seven townspeople remain gait-mannequins; none push back or complicate his plan, so the relational crucible is absent. Still, his embodied ritual of matching steps supplies enough micro-choice to keep the arc from freezing.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: each footfall adds density until the cobblestone pattern “exhales” and the town re-tunes. Closure is a Charged Poise—the archway’s wild hush now holds possibility rather than doom, and the cost is the centuries Kael has already paid. Orientation is swift: archway, ghost town, immortal tuner all land by line 5. No causal reversal is required; the gradual cadence shift from death-frequency to life-frequency satisfies the lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Thornhaven is sketched with corpse-sharp specificity—“moss grew in its cracks like old blood,” “streets were a graveyard of abandoned hopes.” The archway functions as both setting and tuning chamber, its geometry literally shaping the final chord. Micro-setting (the tuning fork carved from fallen bell-tower heartwood) constrains the method and reappears at closure. Sensory hierarchy favors touch and subsonic hearing, matching Kael’s profession.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake is declared early: prevent final collapse by restoring vibrational balance. Pressure escalates texturally—each remembered gait layers a new note onto the silence; the cobblestones’ millimeter shift is the tightening. No external antagonist is needed; entropy is the opponent, and the fork’s low note is the visible price paid. The ending does not reverse the stakes but crystallizes them: the town now “breathes,” foreclosing Kael’s centuries-long vigil yet committing him to centuries more walking.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges as resonance versus erasure: memory kept in stone and step can outlast physical decay. Subtext lives in the hush—what is felt in the teeth rather than spoken. The final image of seven hearts beating at one frequency offers a non-literal answer: shared rhythm is survival. No moral is stated; the concept reweights itself from funeral dirge to quiet chord of possibility.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays welded to Kael’s sensorium—only he hears the hum, feels the fork’s impossible weight. Syntax lengthens and softens during the tuning walk, mimicking wave-form; diction stays archaic-minimal (“wild hush,” “held breath”) without tourist gloss. No dialogue appears, so voice contamination risk is zero. The perceptual signature—vibration over sight—remains distinct and unwavering.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is lyric yet propulsive; every sentence either advances the tuning or deepens the acoustic metaphor. Mixed metaphors are avoided—vehicles stay sonic or geological. One minor scaffold: “the town had not collapsed yet, and now—perhaps—it never would” restates the same binary, but it occurs after closure so momentum is already spent. Otherwise density is high, rhythm varied, and no filter-verb clusters dull the immediacy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The “ghost town revived by walking its true footsteps” premise is fresh, and the execution commits fully to acoustic magic without explanatory hand-waving. Risk is taken by eschewing conflicted human opposition, yet the concept’s integrity and the sonic choreography feel inevitable in hindsight. Specific detail (ebony fork from bell-tower heartwood, cobbler’s limp as architectural note) prevents abstraction. The synthesis of musicology and masonry lingers past the page.</comment>
