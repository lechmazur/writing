<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The mender’s guilt and maternal ache are vivid and embodied; every hammer stroke carries her need to “bridge generational wisdom.” The ribbon micro-choice—tying it round the graft—crystallizes her contradictory urge to bind and to release. Interiority stays concrete (“tongue as sharp as her chisels”) and her laugh at the squirrel shows feisty warmth under pressure. Only her daughter’s sudden forgiveness feels abrupt; the apology is earned, the daughter’s internal cost less so, keeping the score sub-9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the ribbon around the mender’s wrist reweights vows as deciduous, with palpable cost in the cathedral’s renewed breath. Causal chain intact—neglect → breach → return → ribbon graft → daughter’s emergence—each beat a because/therefore step. Orientation given inside 60 words; no prop teleporting; lens (Causal) holds. Only the daughter’s appearance is lightly lucky, but it complicates rather than solves, satisfying coincidence guardrail.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Raftered orchard is tactile: rotting ladder groans, resin scent, quartz glint, sun-shaft through roof hole. Cathedral spine split by roots functions as environmental antagonist; ribbon’s color against gray bark becomes the charged final image. Spatial choreography is spotless—bag, squirrel, locket, beam nest all tracked. One minor overgloss: “thousand new leaves” edges toward poetic excess, not enough to dull the lens.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—win back orchard and daughter—tightens when she laces the statue’s quartz eye with silver wire, foreclosing retreat. Each beat raises cost: diminishing resin, height risk, squirrel theft, confronting cracked Saint Althea. The ribbon graft is the visible price. Escalation is steady but single-arc; no secondary reversal keeps it shy of 9.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Theme of deciduous vows emerges through the ribbon’s metamorphosis: childhood bond → living bandage → wrist talisman. Mother’s pressed-leaf note (“let them fall”) conceptually re-prices the pact without sermon. Subtext in squirrel’s apple-catch mirrors generational hand-off. Final smile is ambiguity—accepting fall and regrowth—earned through concrete graft, not aphorism.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person hovers at middle distance, filtering perception through mender’s tool-sight and wiry humor. Syntax stays lean, then flowers only at climax (“soft splash of color against the gray bark”). Dialogue is minimal yet distinct: daughter’s “Why do you still carry that old thing?” sounds adolescent; mother’s reply is proverb-coining. No head-hopping; distance tightens naturally as crisis crests.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose carries muscular rhythm: varied sentence openings, tactile verbs (“coaxed,” “twitched,” “scampered”). No filter-verb stacks; information density high—single sentence often does description, interiority, and causal push (“she climbed higher… to the oldest tree, where the roots had split the cathedral’s spine”). One paraphrase loop on “leaves yellowing / orchard that had once thrived” costs −0.2, but artifact does not touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fantasy orchard sprouting in a cathedral rafters is fresh, yet grounded in horticultural realism (grafting, resin, silver wire). The deciduous-vow concept reconfigures familiar mother-daughter rift into living arboreal contract. Ribbon’s shift from keepsake to structural bandage feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk of magical setting is balanced by tactile specificity; not quite 9 only because squirrel comic beat slightly softens stakes.</comment>
