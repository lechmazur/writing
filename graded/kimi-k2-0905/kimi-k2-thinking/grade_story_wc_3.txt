<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s haunted ambition is dramatized through tactile micro-choices—palming the seed, carving with star-iron—each carrying palpable cost. Interiority is concrete and occupation-specific; “the wedge-shaped signs that might have anchored the spirit’s departure” marries craft to longing. The final renunciation (carving her name as witness, letting the fruit fall) is foreshadowed by her patient mentor voice, earning the closure stasis.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the city steadies while Elara’s ambition is re-priced from exact proof to braided witness. Causality is causal-track clean: each carved wedge re-directs the arbor’s field; the seed warms in proportion, making the final hum legible. The cost—her ambition permanently re-shaped—is visible when she “let the fruit fall into the clouds” and names herself witness, not author.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The magnetic arbor is more than backdrop; its trembling bark, refracted starlight, and field pathways constrain every beat. Micro-setting—the seed pulsing against her fingers—functions as pivot object. Final image of root “seeking not earth but the analogical space” re-weights the whole architecture; environment and closure are inseparable.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“city falls within the week”—is signaled early and tightened by each carved sign that redirects the magnetic field. One meaningful reversal: understanding transition as field, not moment, forecloses her dream of capturing an instant. Cost is visible: she forfeits the fruit and her role as author, accepting witness-hood.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of translation-as-continuance emerges through pattern: cuneiform signs, carved wedges, seed petals inscribed with “final signs” all refract the same insight—meaning persists beyond speaker. No thematic statement is pronounced; resonance lands in the image of root seeking “analogical space.” Counter-readings (ambition vs humility) are plausible yet not forced.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is stable lyric-third distant, filtered through Elara’s translator mind: “a missing tooth in the city’s hum,” “wedge into the question itself.” Syntax mirrors magnetic curvature—long sentences bend, then snap in short carved beats. No head-hopping; perceptual signature remains her tactile-linguistic prioritization throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is almost loop-free; “trembling bark / trembling branches” is deliberate echo, not churn. High density per line: “knowledge fruit seed, pulsing with copper light against her methodical fingers” does world, object, character in one stroke. Metaphors (magnetic attraction ≈ gravity of memory) are consistent with arbor physics; no mixed vehicles.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Floating magnetic city maintained by distributed spirit is fresh, yet grounded in tactile cuneiform craft. Risk—writing transition as field rather than event—pays off: closure reweights ambition into witness stance. Synthesis feels inevitable: translator’s life prepares her to read absence as presence. No close echoes to famous scenes.</comment>
