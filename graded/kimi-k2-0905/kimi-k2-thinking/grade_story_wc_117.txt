<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mira’s quietly stubborn tenderness is embodied in every micro-action (tuning by breath, pocketing the curl). The eclipse-linked memory breach is a credible, earned alteration that leaves her “heart full of cautious exuberance,” a visible cost. Interiority stays concrete—no label-speak—even at the lyric peak. The only minus: Eleanor’s agency is purely receptive, so relationship-as-crucible weight lands solely on Mira; still, that asymmetry is thematically apt.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Amber twilight at 120-word mark cleanly anchors who/where/when; eclipse timetable supplies a built-in causal clock. The curl’s “pulse” and Eleanor’s spontaneous utterance of Mira’s mother’s name create a Decisive Change that reweights both women’s pasts with undeniable conceptual cost. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each image (cedar, A-minor, roots) layers density until the final cadence reconfigures meaning. Closure beat—“every life begins with a curl of wonder, and ends best when that wonder is returned”—lands the Conceptual Repricing with felt price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Cedar-scented hallway, linoleum underfoot, and the curl as micro-setting all constrain Mira’s ritual choices. Eclipse light is used tactically: it darkens the room, forcing the music to become the sole bridge. Sensory hierarchy mirrors Mira’s therapist priorities—sound over sight—integrating setting into action. The dreaming roots beneath the foundation evolve from metaphor to lived pressure, charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—revive Eleanor’s submerged identity via music—signaled early. Escalation is the moon-shadow itself, tightening from “first bite” to “totality,” narrowing options to ninety seconds of shared memory. Mira’s agency is her choice of the generational lullaby under eclipse light, not a new tactic but a timed acceleration of her existing method. Cost is Eleanor’s post-eclipse sleep and Mira’s irreversible knowledge that wonder outlives memory.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: memory is portable wonder, passed like music or a curl. The curl’s reprise at closure reweights its earlier role from talisman to completed circuit. Subtext lives in Eleanor’s whispered name—an entire mother-daughter history Mira never disclosed. Final image of “dreaming roots” offers resonant non-literal answer: identity persists underground, nourished by shared sound.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person intimate stays latched to Mira’s perceptual signature: “time measured in breaths,” “cedar-scented halls.” Rhythm modulates—long sentences pre-eclipse, clipped fragments at totality—mirroring cardiac pacing. No dialogue needed; voice carries subtext through sensory filtration. Diction never exceeds a music therapist’s plausible lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud ear test passes: sentence cadence rises and falls with eclipse tempo, no algorithmic pattern. Information density high—each line advances tone, setting, or emotional stakes. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; figurative language is spare and precise (“hands folded like dried flowers”). Only micro-flaw: occasional adjectival stack (“weathered steps,” “amber twilight”) but these serve compression, not padding.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Combining eclipse, dementia ward, and baby-hair curl feels fresh yet inevitable; the synthesis grows from Mira’s occupation rather than premise gimmick. Tropes of memory loss and cosmic spectacle are subverted: miracle is quiet, unwitnessed, unverifiable. Risk—the lyric suspension during totality—pays off by reconfiguring both women’s histories without external validation. Specificity of the generational lullaby prevents template drift.</comment>
