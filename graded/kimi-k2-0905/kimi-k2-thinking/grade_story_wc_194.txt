<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interiority is rich—“his presence eloquently silent,” “his heart a drum”—and the final renunciation (“his role was not to end… but to remember”) is earned by the standing-wave reveal. Yet the crucial turn relies on abstract ancestral testimony rather than an on-page contradiction he must physically test; the flaw never complicates his body or choice in real time, so the cost is felt conceptually, not viscerally. Still, the silent-language motif individualizes him and the memory-burden he assumes is specific to this lineage.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the final image of “standing waves of time” re-weights the dynasty premise, making remembrance the new obligation with undeniable conceptual cost. Causal linkage holds under Accumulative/Textural lens—each crank rotation thickens sonic density until the erased heir’s name surfaces, foreclosing the assassin-option. No orientation debt; who/where/when anchored by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The sepia room, gramophone, and crank form a micro-setting that literally channels the ancestor’s voice, constraining the only possible victory into listening rather than destroying. Golden-shadow lighting is reweighted at exit, now a duty rather than a tomb. Selective sensory detail—tarnished bronze, dust motes—stays purposive and filtered through his hush-biased attention.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—sever the lineage vs. remember it—tightens exactly once when the standing wave reveals the expunged heir, flipping his mission. Cost is legible: he forfeits the murder-path and accepts eternal custodianship of a song that will haunt him. Agency is present (he keeps turning the crank), but externalized onto physics; the pressure feels accumulative rather than causally adversarial.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without thesis: remembrance as the only immortality, sounded through literal waves. Subtext lives in silence—his grandmother’s “eloquently silent” language becomes his own. Final star-hum reconfigures the entire motif-set without moralizing. No platitudes; even “bridge of intuition” is left as lived paradox rather than explained.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric全程稳定; perceptual signature is hush-attentive—sound of dust, metallic cold, visual echo crest—all filtered through a man whose native tongue is silence. Rhythmic control mirrors gramophone tension: long breathy sentences that tighten into drum-beat fragments at climax. No filter-verb clutter; diction stays within a scholar-antiquarian lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm is musical, sentence variance high; no scaffold loops. Figurative layering (“sepia swallowed the yawn,” “golden shadows”) is dense yet patterned, taught early and paid off in final “golden shadows whisper farewell.” One microscopic mixed image—“the world outside seemed to listen”—but it does not touch closure. Info density strong; each line advances tone or knowledge.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Freshened trope: dynastic-curse story converted into acoustic archaeology. Standing-wave mechanics are grounded, not technobabble, and tie literally to erased ancestry. Risky lyric repetition of “golden shadows” becomes thematic instrument, not ornament. Could tip toward over-familiar antique-library vibe, but specificity of sound-as-genealogy keeps it singular.</comment>
