<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The narrator’s “featherly determined” stance is repeatedly named but never tested; no micro-choice risks failure or forfeiture, so the resolve stays ornamental. Interior contradiction is asserted (“light as down yet unyielding as stone”) yet never dramatized in a visible trade-off. The father’s voice is evoked as atmospheric cue rather than pressure that forces a costly decision. What keeps the score above mid-line is the tight perceptual filter—every observation is routed through the child’s maze-sense—so the persona feels singular even while remaining static.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: the piece teaches its pattern early—wood-grain map ↔ weather-code ↔ counted steps—and layers density until the final prism image reweights the stake. Closure is a Charged Poise: the threshold dissolves behind the narrator, crystallizing the idea that “distances were not just steps but moments of reverence.” The cost is conceptual but legible: the narrator now carries an unending duty of measured reverence, foreclosing casual movement. One minor loop artifact (“the story ends in a breath…”) does not touch the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The drifting prism terrace functions as both macro-setting and psychic mirror; its fractured light literally refracts the narrator’s memory, charging the final image. The wooden table’s grain is micro-setting that constrains choice: every line dictates a precise step-count before the threshold will open. Weather-code symbols and corn-silk scent are anchored in maze-architect lore, giving the world internal consistency without exposition dump. Spatial choreography is ghostly but coherent—no impossible positions—so the surreal frame stays navigable.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—thresholds demand reverent distance—is signaled in line 1 and deepened through each grain-line “prayer.” Escalation is textural: each mirrored facet adds weight to the idea that every future step must now be ritual. The single reversal—threshold opens only after the exact count—is micro, not causal, but under the Accumulative lens the density shift suffices. Cost is felt solely as conceptual burden (perpetual vigilance), not tangible loss; this caps the score below 8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The sacredness-of-distance theme emerges organically from the maze-architect lineage and the wood-grain cartography; no character ever articulates a thesis. The final prism garden reprises the “necessary distances” idea in visual form, letting theme resonate without moral tag. Subtext runs through silence: the absent father’s whisper is loudest when unheard, creating dramatic irony—reader sees the trap of eternal measurement before the narrator names it. The refusal to resolve into tidy wisdom keeps the aftereffect charged.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>First-person lyric voice sustains a hypnotic, prism-slanted cadence that mirrors the terrace’s slow drift. Diction stays within the narrator’s plausible lexicon—corn silk, grain, brittle pages—avoiding register drift. Patterned repetition (“the threshold… the threshold…”) is taught early and paid off in the shimmer-dissolve, so it reads as ritual pulse, not template churn. Perceptual signature is unmistakable: every object is filtered through maze-geometry and weather-code star charts.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>High information density: single sentences often syncretize setting, memory, and rule (“Each line corresponds to a distance measured in steps, a sacred count”). Rhythm modulates from long breathy clauses to fractured fragments that mimic light-splinter. No synonym churn or paraphrase loops; each “fractured hush” recurrence adds semantic layer. Minor overwrought moment—“my resolve is featherly determined, light as down yet unyielding as stone”—is isolated; it does not contaminate the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The corn-maze-as-cosmos metaphor is fresh, and the fusion of weather-code with carpentry grain feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk is taken: a lyric, recursive structure instead of causal plot, but the pattern is taught early and closure reconfigures meaning. Familiar trope (“lost child seeks parent wisdom”) is re-angled through spatialized ritual rather than emotional reunion. The prism terrace’s light-refracted threshold map offers a specific, non-portable image that would collapse if transplanted to another story.</comment>
