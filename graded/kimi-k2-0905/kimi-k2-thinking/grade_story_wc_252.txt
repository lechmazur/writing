<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira’s contradictory impulses—duty-bound dockworker vs. dancer—are embodied in every beat; the scrimshaw glow and guardian dissolution externalize the internal lock. The final renunciation of the pier-rope is earned by the whale-call summoning her hidden skiff and her micro-choice to sway rather than lift. Visible cost: she forfeits the safety of the docks and the social identity they gave her. Voice stays particular, never drifts into label-speak; the dancer’s kinetic diction is consistent.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the island sinks while Mira dances atop the crest, foreclosing return and repricing her identity without a sword raised. Causal lens holds: whale-call → scrimshaw glow → rope released → guardian dissolved → island retreat, each because/therefore link legible. Orientation anchored by word 60; no prop or knowledge teleport. Cost crystallized in the final image—“bound for a horizon without chains”—felt on-page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Sublittoral fringe functions as micro-setting: the tide-slick rocks constrain her barefoot footing and force the dancer’s balance; the skiff’s hull and scrimshaw are tactile tools. Salt scent and silver ribbons are selective, POV-filtered, never tourist-catalog. The disappearing island’s rules are taught through action—sand warm, guardian salt-made—no exposition dump. Spatial choreography clean: crate maze → dock planks → skiff → fringe → vanishing shore, bodies trackable.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—freedom to dance vs. dock-duty—tightens when the whale-call converts the scrimshaw into a key that literally unlocks the guardian’s heart, eliminating violent opposition. One meaningful deepening: combative tenderness disarms the guardian without weapon, narrowing options to dance or die, then dissolving threat into mist. Price legible: she loses the island sanctuary yet gains the horizon—an open-ended cost. Agency remains hers at every pivot; coincidence complicates but does not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the dancer’s kinetic images rather than assertion: softness as strength, rhythm as resistance. The disappearing island reconfigures the post-war premise—peace does not equal stasis; bodies still yearn for motion. Final image of dancer on crest reweights earlier crate-lifting as mere rehearsal for this stage. No moralizing; gratitude whispered to whale is character-bound, not authorial thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person lyric close-in stays consistently filtered through Mira’s dancer-perception: verbs pirouette, light “traces arcs,” horizon “shimmers.” Syntax mirrors breath and wave rhythm; no head-hop. Diction within lexicon of a dockworker who secretly names the world in choreography. No filter-verb stacks; immediacy maintained even in guardian dissolution. Whale-call and brine scent operate as sensory signature rather than exposition.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies: long cadence for tide rise, staccato for crate clash, then fluid sweep for dance paragraphs. Metaphors (whalebone glow, salt-made guardian) remain internally coherent; no mixed vehicles. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or choice. High information density: “sublittoral fringe where the tide painted silver ribbons” does world-building, stakes, and body in eight words. Copy-clean; no typos or tense drift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: post-violence world + disappearing island + dancer dockworker + whale-summoned scrimshaw key feels inevitable in hindsight. Trope of “magic item unlocks heart” is retooled into non-violent disarm via dance gesture. Risk taken with lyric guardian dissolution pays off in conceptual cost rather than fight scene. Specificity of whalebone etched with “waves and whales” anchors myth in tactile object. Transformation test passes: rename or relocate and the emotional arc collapses.</comment>
