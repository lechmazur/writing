<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kael’s interiority is layered—stone-dust on orchid leaves, his fingers tracing absent butterflies—embodied and specific. The spiral metaphor of grief reframes his carving micro-choices; the decision to abandon seven-names-in-a-row for a ribbon-spiral text is earned through nightly retracing and ghost-mentor pressure. Grandmother’s spectral guidance is less a second character than embodied conscience, so relationship crucible is waived. Flaw: the “fiercely meditative” trait is announced but never complicates a choice under pressure; it stays decorative.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each dusk loop adds density to the ribbon-map until the spiral stone becomes Conceptual Repricing of communal grief. Closure—spiral inscription by river—pays off the greenhouse pattern with visible social cost: villagers recognize their own dinner-table poems. Causality is interior but coherent; no prop or memory teleports. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive before 120 words and hold.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Ancient greenhouse at dusk is lived-in: potting bench, corpse-flower stench, monarchs clustering until glass bends light into prayer—details filter through Kael’s grave-carver eye for texture and negative space. Micro-setting objects—woven ribbon roll, stone chisels—constrain tactics directly: only their embroidered fragments can become the spiral text. Spatial choreography stays clean nightly; no impossible butterfly weight. Final image of empty flight paths reweights the setting as echoing absence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—discover the form of collective grief—tightens through each dusk retracing; options narrow from generic lambs to communal ribbon fragments. One meaningful intensification: realization that “grief is a spiral” forces final carving choice with felt aesthetic cost. No antagonist needed; pressure is iterative pattern vs failure to honor seven drowned villagers. Cost is legible—Kael forsakes conventional memorial for risky unproven form—but not viscerally personal; hence shy of 9.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from iterative ribbon text: communal mourning is cooperative weaving, not individual lament. Subtext rests in unspoken dinner-table silences and orchid dust settling on chisels—collective labor made visible. Final spiral stone is Conceptual Repricing that reweights prior motifs without moralizing. No sentimental closure; ambiguity lingers in migrating absence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lyrical third-person adheres to Kael’s perceptual filter: stone-dust, butterfly-wing syntax, ribbon-stitch diction. Rhythm modulates—long clauses for dusk meditation, clipped fragments for ghost dialogue—taught early and paid off at empty-flight-path coda. No head-hopping; grandmother’s voice is wind-through-panes, not interior invasion. Filter verbs (“he felt”) rare and voice-motivated.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Sentences multi-task: “stone dust settled on orchid leaves and chisels rang against silence” shows setting, sound, mood. Metaphors stay coherent—spiral, ribbon, weaving—no mixed vehicle crashes. Minor scaffold: “retraced another loop” repeats stem twice but within accumulative lens; does not obscure closure. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with dusk cadence; paragraph cuts are purposeful.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: butterfly migration + grave-carver + family poem-ribbon custom = new take on communal grief. Spectral mentorship as iterative craft lesson rather than horror trope. Spiral memorial form feels inevitable yet non-obvious; risk of formal experimentation justified by emotional payoff. No derivative echoes; imagery is specific to Kael’s greenhouse workshop.</comment>
