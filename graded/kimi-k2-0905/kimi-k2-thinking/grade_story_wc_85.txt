<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Interiority stays lyrically charged (“the weight of unspoken words press against his chest”) but leans abstract; we feel guilt yet see few micro-choices beyond kneeling and clenching. The final renunciation is seeded only by metaphor, not by an earlier dramatized failure that would sharpen cost. Still, the occupation-derived perceptual filter (time/memory as malleable) is consistent and specific.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: he swears off forgery, pockets the broken hand—tangible renunciation with conceptual cost. Causal chain is thin; plaque discovery is luck, not tactics, so the decisive change feels fated rather than earned. Accumulative lens holds: repeated “sieved hush” and “manufactured memories” patterns tighten until the final image reweights them.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Cobalt terrace and driftwood shore are sketched with painterly economy; salt-worn key-carving constrains his literal search and later symbolism. Micro-setting success: the watch hand in pocket becomes the final “mended clock.” Sensory hierarchy favors touch and temperature, mirroring emotional numbness. No orientation drift; anchors clear by line 20.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—truth vs. self-erasure—announced early, but pressure escalates only imagistically; no live consequence (client, law, lost income) surfaces to raise cost. The single tightening is the plaque reveal; it changes knowledge, not immediate options. Agency is reactive; tension is tonal, not tactical. Fits Accumulative model but stays at moderate voltage.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through recurrence of falsified time/memory: “each forgery left a scar on his own timeline.” Final image—broken hand ticking soft—performs Conceptual Repricing, equating mending time with accepting unedited past. No moralizing sentence; insight stays implicit. Complexity acknowledged: peace is dust, not redemption.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays close to sensory filter; diction (“sieved hush,” “manufactured false memories”) is patterned and repayed at closure. Rhythm modulates: longer clauses for brooding, fragments for discoveries. No dialogue, hence no voice contamination. Filter verbs minimal; metaphors organic to narrator’s metal-and-wood workspace.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elegant density: “tide-polished driftwood lay scattered like broken sentences” performs three jobs—image, character metaphor, setting. Sparse scaffolding; only minor echo (“weight” used thrice). One mixed metaphor (“guilt rose like a tide” alongside “weight of silence”) but does not occlude closure. No loops in final third; read-aloud cadence varies.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: black-market genealogist + broken watch hand = memory forgery as trade. Conceptual risk—quiet lyric resolution instead of thriller payoff—pays off via CR. Specificity of driftwood “carvings that spell out a simple truth” avoids generic ocean scene. Could swap terrace color, but occupational fusion feels novel and inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
