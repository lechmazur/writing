<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s “haunting optimism” is repeatedly named but never embodied in a costly micro-choice; the sleepwalking is shown, yet the waking decision to follow the copper plate into the canyon is narrated as fait accompli rather than a tense escalation of her trait. Interiority drifts into lyrical summary (“whispering verses”) instead of concrete contradiction under pressure. The final orchid discovery reads as gift rather than earned renunciation, so the change feels bestowed, not wrested from flaw.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens: the repeating sleep-tracings and silver stitches thicken until the tapestry mirrors stone, producing a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) when the alcove orchids glow—cost is conceptual (village hope re-priced). Orientation anchor (wharf, dusk-after-empty-tide) arrives within 60 words; transitions are single night-to-dawn cycles, legible. Closure is on-page: “the tapestry now a map that others could follow” crystallizes new options with undeniable social cost—broken nets stay broken, but meaning has shifted.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Red canyon walls, tide-pool dusk, loom-creak, dust-footprints—selective sensory triangulation keeps attention tight; the copper plate acts as micro-setting that constrains the final walk. Place names stay spare (“the wharf,” “the labyrinth”) yet accumulate texture through synesthetic loom-sound and moon-rust color. Spatial choreography clean: Elara’s footprints → tapestry → canyon grooves track without drift. The orchid alcove is the charged environmental rebate that reweights precedent—setting literally “carved into reverence.”</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can the village renegotiate its broken covenant with the sea—remains abstract; on-page pressure is Elara’s private race to decode her own feet. Escalation is textural: each silver stitch adds density, not risk. No credible loss (time, material, social credit) is dramatized; the orchids appear as gift, not trade-off. Hence the tightening is felt as aesthetic completion rather than foreclosed option—sufficient for accumulative design but thin for causal thresholds.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of “ruin into reverence” emerges through iterated images—empty nets, silver thread, orchid glow—without sermon. The copper plate’s labyrinth picture re-prices from curiosity to communal map, a Conceptual Repricing that invites reflection on how myth is remade. No final-paragraph thesis line; last image of “orchid dreams” lingers in purposeful ambiguity. Counter-reading allowed: optimism may still be folly—complexity intact.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lyrical third-person hovers at mid-psychic distance, consistent with folkloric tone; diction (“ghost-light,” “orchid solace”) is poetic yet anchored to perceptual bias of a weaver who thinks in thread and tide. Rhythm modulates: long anaphoric sentences for loom-work, clipped fragments for dawn reveal—no syntactic monotony. No dialogue, so voice convergence risk waived. Patterned elision (sleepwalking blanks) is taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong read-aloud cadence; sentences vary in length and opening. Information density high—single lines deliver image + emotional tilt. Minor template cadence in “each night…each morning” triad, but it mirrors loom repetition so reads intentional. One metaphor muddle: “sun rose like a pale orchid” conflates flower and celestial body, yet the slip is brief and does not touch closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Folkloric sleep-map that re-codes a dying fishing village is fresh angle on collapse-and-hope trope. Copper plate → tapestry → canyon groove synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk taken with lyric accumulative structure rather than causal plot; coherence maintained. Deduction for near-echo of “silver thread” trope from classic myth; not fully transformed.</comment>
