<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Malach’s “rationally rebellious” trait is etched into every micro-choice—filing brass instead of shouting slogans, risking execution for stratigraphic truth. His body is present: brick dust in the throat, abrasive calm that keeps filing even when lantern light hits his face. Interior contradiction pulses—he both loathes and needs the Council’s plague myth because it gives him a datum to disprove. The final renunciation—comfort for method—pays a felt cost: he slips deeper into silence, lungs scarred, name erased, while the cog remains as future testimony.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the filed cog reweights the city’s mythology from martyr parable to data archive; the patrol’s lowered weapon shows the new price—truth without sentiment buys survival. Causal chain holds: sediment maps → filing calculus → patrol witness → myth shift. Orientation is anchored within 60 words by sewer, fungus lamp, Council lie. Cost is legible in the final image—“dust and the faint ghost of filed metal”—method paid for with the philosopher’s erasure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Micro-setting dominates: the bronze cog’s worn teeth, brick dust, phosphorescent fungus—objects handled and altered, not catalogued. Sewer acoustics (drips, splashes) constrain stealth choices; hammock 200 ft below basilica sets vertical stakes. Thermal fracture patterns in granite become tactile evidence, not décor. Final image—cog sealed behind loose bricks—crystallizes both setting and theme: truth buried in sediment waiting future discovery.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether the city’s collapse will be myth or record—tightens when filing begins; each notch forecloses one official lie. Escalation is accumulative: sediment map, fire scar, saltwater line compress into one brass register. Patrol arrival externalizes cost; lowered weapon signals the tightening has worked—truth now carries its own deterrence. No reversal, but a deepening that reweights survival itself.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: knowledge is a craft that demands corporeal payment—lungs, name, future. Subtext lives in gesture—filing sparks fly like shortened lives; “Tempus edax rerum” worn to ghosts mocks Council’s edible propaganda. Final image reframes earlier library-burning: memory can survive if transferred to metal, not paper. Complexity upheld—all three collapse causes remain possible, but method is preserved.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is chiseled, latinate yet mud-spattered—“tempus edax rerum,” “tidal table,” “stratigraphic maps”—perfect for sewer philosopher. Syntax mirrors filing motion: short declarative cuts, then longer sedimentary clauses. No dialogue; silence becomes tactical. Free indirect style clean; no head-hop. Under patrol lantern, diction compresses to single metallic verbs—file, score, tuck—rhythm as precise as the cog itself.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense but propulsive: each sentence layers evidence—“ash falls above, saltwater below.” No scaffold; no synonym loops. Metaphors are few, exact: “human teeth doing the devouring” marries time and genocide. Filter verbs absent; action verbs drive. Read-aloud cadence accelerates during filing, then subsides into dripping echo—rhythm matches stakes. Closure line is lean, unadorned, unforgettable.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Flood-as-method vs. flood-as-myth is freshly reframed through archaeological vandalism—truth carved into maritime brass. Synthesis of Aristotle, tidal calculus, and sewer survival feels inevitable, not stitched. Risk lies in quiet ending—no martyr spectacle—yet earns resonance: future reader must decode pattern. Specificity triumphs: sediment compression rates replace generic catastrophe. Conceptual integrity intact—story commits to epistemic rebellion unto silence.</comment>
