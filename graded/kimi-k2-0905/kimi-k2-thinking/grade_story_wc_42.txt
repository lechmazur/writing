<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Kael’s interior contradiction—lens-mender who must mend time—drives every beat; his embodied tremor against the clock’s hiss and his tweezer micro-choice under pressure feel specific. The flaw (listening addiction) compounds the crisis and is accepted in earned stasis: he smiles, knowing ache will stay. No status dynamics or second character on page, so relationship bullets waived. Reflection is anchored to present stimuli (leaf, gears) and tilts choice—meets BRR test.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the leaf’s cadence reweights the clock and steady observatory, cost is the luminous ache Kael now carries. Causal lens holds—each gear adjustment is a because/therefore tied to the earlier leaf capture. Orientation (lunar observatory above clouds, who/when) is clear by line 4; no penalty. Escape-velocity concept is thematic echo only; it never narrows tactical options, so escalation is mild, not high-band.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Micro-setting dominates: camera sensor plate, crystal lattice, and exposed chronometer gears function as terrain—each constrains Kael’s tweezer choices and charges the final image. Lunar location supplies motive (dying starlight) but spatial choreography stays inside the workshop; environment mirrors internal spin-to-stillness arc. Sensory hierarchy obeys sage repairer bias—optic metaphors, metallic hiss, faint rustle. Meets 9+ gate: tool (clock) and lattice constrain tactics and close the image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve starlight before observatory tears free—is signaled early; pressure tightens once when the leaf’s fall becomes the new escapement cadence, foreclosing the “stop time” option and accepting eternal ache. Cost is felt: Kael smiles bittersweet, knowing light will still fade. Agency is attention/renunciation rather than physical combat; sufficient for 600-word scale. Escape-velocity concept stays thematic, never threatens new concrete obstacle, capping escalation below 8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: ephemeral captured by listening, not force. Subtext lives in the leaf’s whisper versus the gear’s frozen starlight—silence and shimmer carry the argument. Final image of next leaf falling reweights prior material without sermon. No thematic echo line; ache stays implicit. Conceptual cost—time remains un-stopped, observatory ache eternal—is undeniable in last smile.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person POV stays tight to Kael’s perceptual signature: optic vocabulary, tactile gear gleam, auditory leaf tick. Rhythm modulates—short clauses under clock-spin pressure, longer breath after cadence locks. No dialogue, so voice purity rests on diction and syntax; no head-hop. Filter verbs ("he knew") are voice-motivated, not intrusive. Distinctive compression: “luminous ache” recurs with accruing weight; pattern taught early, paid off in final whisper.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>High density: “metallic hiss of a broken chronometer” does world, tone, and obstacle in one sniff. Metaphors stay consistent—starlight frozen in gears, leaf whisper slices hum—no mixed vehicles. Minor template cadence in “He waited…He adjusted…He opened” sequence (−0.2). Read-aloud ear varies sentence openings; paragraph cuts are clean. No scaffolding loops or synonym churn; no artifact touches closure. Final line lands with crystalline brevity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Premise—lunar watchmaker restructures time via leaf fall—feels fresh yet inevitable. Trope of stopping time is subverted: he only synchronizes to natural cadence, accepting ache. Specificity: camera-lattice star-trap is new image; sage career merges with horologist micro-skill. Risk in lyric repetition of “luminous ache” pays off by reweighting ending. Not quite 8.5 because escape-velocity physics remains ornamental, not transformational.</comment>
