<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The cartomancer’s contradictory mix of ritual mastery and maternal disorientation is palpably embodied; her ink-tracing and hair-unfastening are micro-choices that externalize the interior split between caretaker and self. The “crack in the saucer = her own body” realization crystallizes a credible, earned shift—she ends in poised acceptance rather than tidy cure—so the arc lands with visible cost. No second character on page, so relationship bullets are waived; head-count stays coherent. Minor hitch: a few abstractions (“cloudbound repentance”) flirt with diagnostic-speak, but they’re immediately re-anchored in flesh and ritual, so the slip is hair-line, not clause-breaking.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the unfastened hair threads weave into the saucer-crack, re-weighting “lost time” as embodied motherhood; cost is the irreversible bodily archive she now bears. Accumulative/lyric lens is taught early (“clouds pooled like liquid obsidian”) and held to the final image; density increases via returning motifs (ink, crack, tracing) rather than causal chains, satisfying the lens guardrail. Orientation anchors who/where crystallize by line 40—well under the 120-word safety window—so no penalty applies. One transition (glade dissolving at dawn) is clean and signaled by environmental shift; no ellipsis or timeline break.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The midnight cloud-glade is evoked with tactile economy—“liquid obsidian,” “trees of mist and starlight”—and doubles as a spatial timer: dawn’s “pink fingers” physically force her descent, constraining ritual duration. The saucer’s fracture and onyx-ink serve as micro-setting/objects that literally guide hand motion and final repair, hitting the 9+ gate for environmental constraint on choice. Sensory hierarchy skews visual/thermal, justifiable under nocturnal ritual urgency where moonlight is the working lamp. Spatial choreography stays crisp—cloud-floor, invisible tablecloth, lap-level props track without drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“where does lost time accumulate?”—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens through iterative ink-tracings that fail to recover hours until the body itself is revealed as archive. Escalation is textural: each return of the cracked saucer gains luminescent weight, re-pricing the stakes from external search to internal acceptance; this satisfies the single intensification required at this length. Cost is legible in the final image—her palm now permanently ink-mapped—showing forfeiture of pre-maternal identity. No causal antagonist is needed; pressure is situational and accumulative, coherent under chosen lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</question>
<comment>Theme emerges through iterated concrete particulars—ink, crack, tracing—rather than thesis statements; the final image re-channels prior motifs into a quiet but undeniable reconfiguration of motherhood’s cost. Subtext operates in gesture: unfastening hair = surrendering linear time; cracked saucer = body opened by birth. No overt moral is imposed; the reader is left to feel the contradiction of theft/bequest. Final whispered voice avoids meta-commentary, preserving earned ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lush yet disciplined, wielding long vowel-rich sentences that mirror incantatory ritual without slipping into purple drift. Perceptual signature is consistent—moon-as-mirror, ink-as-memory—anchored in cartomancer’s vocation. No dialogue appears; therefore dialogue bullets are waived. Free-indirect compression (“She watched, willingly perplexed…”) stays inside her lexicon, and psych-distance tightens believably under wonder.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies strategically—caesura created by semicolons mirrors breath of mist; no template cadence detected. Figurative density is high but patterned early (“liquid obsidian”) and paid off in closure, so −0.0 under overwrite checks. No synonym loops or scaffolding; each sentence advances image or knowledge. One micro “choking beauty” echo appears twice—acceptable as deliberate motif reprise, not artifact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fusion of cartomancy, post-partum body-horror, and cloud-ritual is refreshingly specific; premise feels inevitable in hindsight yet novel in field. The “tracing hands on birthday tablecloth” custom particularizes universal maternal grief without slipping into trope. Risky lyrical accumulation could have collapsed into abstraction, but grounded body imagery keeps stakes visceral. Fresh inflection: cracked saucer as biological stigmata charging final acceptance.</comment>
