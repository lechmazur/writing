<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara’s synesthetic gift and rebel lineage give her a sharp, embodied interiority; every snip of the shears is a micro-choice that risks the Order’s wrath while tasting ancestral rain. The contradiction between gentleness and rebellion is lived in her fingertips, not declared. Cost is palpable: she kneels on rusted ribs, forfeits legal safety, and swallows the collective grief of twenty lost harvests. Final stance—sharing seeds—cements a credibly flawed, irreversible commitment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: illegal pruning → silver light trigger → seed sprouts → fruit of memory. Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the greenhouse turns from ossuary to living library, the price being perpetual outlaw status. Lens stays causal throughout; no teleporting props or convenient amnesia. Alignment clock is announced early, tracked, and paid off at the exact bud burst.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Rusted ribs, corroded orange bleeding into silver starlight—visual chemistry is precise and plot-functional: corrosion gives purchase for new vines. Composted memories as soil amendment bridges metaphor and world rule without exposition dump. Greenhouse geometry stays consistent; spatial choreography of kneeling, clipping, watering is step-tracked. Final image of translucent bud pulsing against cracked glass recharges every earlier shard of metal decay.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—outlaw gardening under celestial surveillance—tightens with each cut; pruning shears become contraband. One meaningful escalation: the bud forms only after she baptizes soil with pruned-vine tea, fusing rebel method to cosmic key. Cost is double: legal peril + ingestion of collective trauma. No off-stage rescue; her agency alone unlocks the fruit.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges from action: memory as regenerative compost, not archival dust. Subtext in the taste of laughter inside grief refuses moral binaries. Final image reframes “ruins” as crucible rather than grave—an answer articulated without sermon. Ambiguity lingers: will sharers become new Order or keep pruning power? Question feels earned, not tacked on.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Lyric third-person stays close to Mara’s tongue and retinas; diction of “chlorophyll ghost” and “synaptic rebirth” belongs to a chef-neuroscience hybrid mind. Rhythm accelerates with short pulse clauses during alignment peak, then exhales into bench-sitting vigil. No head-hopping; celestial vibration is felt through her marrow filter. Voice sustains authority without veering into textbook plasticity jargon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Metaphors are disciplined: corrosion→bleeding orange, vines→dormant synapses, no mixed vehicles. Sentence density multi-tasks: “silver light poured through cracked glass, illuminating freshly turned soil” does setting, plot-clock, and symbolism in one sweep. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence adds new sensory or causal data. Read-aloud rhythm varies cadence to mirror bud-burst crescendo then quiet satiety.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Memory-fruit grown from pruned neural vines is a fresh synthesis of climate-SF and herbal magic. Stakes stay garden-level, avoiding cosmic-save-the-world inflation. Transformation of greenhouse into living library feels inevitable yet non-derivative. Risk is moderate: outlaw horticulture is familiar, but taste-as-archive and synaptic compost elevate it.</comment>
