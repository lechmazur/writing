<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dr. Kael’s interior contradiction—rigid logician who arranges shells to feel her way through the multiverse—drives every beat; the mandala micro-choices tighten until the 9,847-ft coefficient crystallizes her renunciation of endless rescue, foreclosing the balloon launches with luminous cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Tight causal lattice: each balloon flight → gauge flicker → shell pattern → equation refinement. The final spiral mandala is a decisive change that fuses altitude number and frequency, paying off the 3-yr setup with conceptual cost: she surrenders omnipotence and trusts worlds to self-lift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</gauge><comment>Micro-setting triumph: the brass gauge and salt-slick grotto floor constrain every tactical move; the rose-quartz fragment’s tidal polish literally clicks into place at the mandala’s center, recharging the entire pattern and making the 9,847 coefficient legible as environment-forged choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single dominant stake—can mathematics transfuse hope to dying timelines?—tightens via gauge oscillation, shell scarcity, and the final impossible midpoint; the price is her exit from intervention, a visible forfeiture that reweights all seventeen realities into self-sustaining lift.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from shell calculus alone: hope is not imported but resonance-farmed from within. The closing image of empty balloons teaching worlds to generate their own lift reconfigures the premise without moralizing, delivering conceptual repricing that lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</question><comment>Third-person lyric compressions (“lucidly watchful,” “salt spray taught her”) stay inside Kael’s perceptual signature; rhythmic control peaks in the mandala sequence where calcium-fibonacci cadence mirrors tide pulse, no head-hops, diction anchored to marine lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High-density lines (“gauge now singing a steady hum”) advance both atmosphere and causality; one paraphrase loop (“lucidly watchful” x2) but never in closure beat, so artifact stays minor and momentum intact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Quantum-transfusion via nautilus-mandala is a non-obvious synthesis; the risk of math-as-magic pays off because shell geometry and altitude gauge cohere into irreplaceable apparatus—remove any fragment and the 9,847 coefficient collapses.</comment>
