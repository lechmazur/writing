<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Vesper’s gently-inventive, secretive conjurer identity is shown through tactile ritual, but interiority drifts toward thematic slogan (“mathematics of emotion”). No live contradiction under pressure; the glass-eye placement is a single micro-choice rather than escalating stakes. Loss remains abstract until the final CR image, so the emotional cost feels conceptual rather than embodied. Characterisation stays vivid, yet the absence of a second on-page character limits relational crucible pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: each droplet, tile crack, and glass-eye reflection thickens ambient grief until the mosaic doorway offers a Charged Poise. Causality is loose but coherent—pattern recognition substitutes for because/therefore linkage. Closure lands on-page: the half-open doorway reweights the premise with undeniable conceptual cost (loss can be held, not solved). No orientation debt; cavern anchors arrive by line 3 and stay stable.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Environment functions as micro-setting: the mosaic stepping-stone literally constrains Vesper’s kneeling body and dictates the only possible ritual. Stalactite drip cadence times the beats, cavern darkness supplies the only light source for glass-eye reflection. Sensory selection is POV-filtered (“silver droplets into silent music”). Final image—doorway etched in light—charges the setting itself with conceptual cost. World rules remain consistent; no spatial drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can ambiguous loss be rendered legible?—is signaled early. Escalation is textural: each droplet, crack, and reflection narrows the emotional aperture until the doorway offers the single reconfiguration. No visible resource cost (time, tool, stamina) is dramatized; pressure is atmospheric rather than tactical. Still, the final image makes the conceptual price undeniable, satisfying the 8.0+ threshold for a lyric short.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from pattern: grief as geometry whose variables can be mapped but never solved. Subtext lives in gesture—glass eyes meet across stone, a mute accusation. Final image reframes prior material without moralising: love persists inside an unsolved equation. No thematic echo line; risk of pseudo-profundity is skirted by concrete particulars (obsidian fruit, velvet pouch).</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lyric third-person maintains hypnotic cadence; diction stays within conjurer’s symbolic lexicon. No dialogue, so voice purity is high. Sentence rhythm mirrors drip cadence; compression taught early (“cavern orchard breathed”). Filter verbs minimal; perception skewed toward visual geometry. Slight risk of syntactic monotony in repeated participle openers, but pattern serves accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Metaphors are selective and internally consistent (moonlight as liquid silver, grief as fracture). No mixed-vehicle accidents. Loops absent; no synonym churn. Information density high: one sentence often sets scene, advances mood, and anchors body. Opening and closing lines carry image-propulsion. Minor scaffold: “gentle, inventive motion” appears twice; does not touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Premise—emotional mathematics rendered in subterranean orchard—feels fresh yet inevitable. Stalactite-fed obsidian fruit is specific to this world. Risk taken with lyric accumulative structure rather than causal plot; payoff is the charged doorway. Not quite transformative enough for 8.5+ because the core insight (grief persists) is familiar; freshness lies in sensory geometry rather than conceptual surprise.</comment>
