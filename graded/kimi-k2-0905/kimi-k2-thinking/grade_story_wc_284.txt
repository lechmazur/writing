<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Kael’s interior contradiction—guilt over betrayal vs. need to repair—remains concrete and embodied in the pillbox rub. Micro-choice to dig is credible, but the courier is a blank: no status tension, no idiom, no secondary pressure. Final relief is earned yet slightly tidy; Elena payoff undercuts the cost Kael just paid. Still, the flaw-compels-mistake test is met: his earlier betrayal created the snow-burden he must now excavate.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: because he buried codes, therefore he must dig them up; because he chose mercy, therefore exile; because he brings the key, therefore courier grants passport. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—empty pocket, full heart—cost is the years of exile and the literal frostbite of excavation. Lens is causal throughout; no ambiguity. Minor slack: courier’s motive off-stage, but that is acceptable at this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mist, bluff, layered snow are not backdrop but tactical obstacles: snow hides codes, mist hides courier, dawn exposes both. Spatial choreography is clean—feet, hands, drift face, wind direction all tracked. The “tilt of earth toward spring” line is the sole weather cliché, but it is forgiven because melt threatens exposure. Setting constrains the dig and charges the final thaw image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—return from the cold or permanent burial—signalled in first paragraph. Single tightening: courier demands proof, Kael must dig, no fallback. Cost is visceral: frozen fingers, five lost years, risk of summary execution. Escalation is modest but sufficient for 700 words; stakes stay personal and sharp rather than abstract.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: redemption is not absolution but service—network rebuilt, northern corridor offered. Subtext is carried in the pillbox (not suicide but key) and in silence about Elena until final beat. Avoids moral statement; lets thawing earth reconfigure meaning. Slight deduction for “his choice five years ago—it didn’t break her” which edges toward thematic echo.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Kael; perceptual signature is weathered, tactile, cold-synesthetic. Diction—“silver hush,” “wind-carved stone,” “ghosting breath”—is consistent and un-showy. Courier’s dialogue is spare, goal-driven; no info-dump. No head-hop, no filter-verb clutter. Voice modulates: clipped when digging, expansive at dawn release.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Rhythm varies: opening lyrical cadence yields to short shovel sentences, final paragraph lengthens into release. One paraphrase loop—“five years of constant touch / five years of accumulated silence”—but it is thematic refrain, not artifact. No mixed metaphors, no thesaurus drift. Minor scaffold: “the means to fix what he’d shattered” states what excavation shows.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Snow-as-dead-drop is fresh; spy-thaw redemption less so, but grounded in sensory specifics. Pillbox-turned-key-holder reverses expected cyanide beat. Risk is moderate—quiet ending, no gunplay—but coherence is high. Transformation test fails: rename items and plot still functions, yet idiosyncratic detail keeps it memorable.</comment>
