<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The keeper’s interiority is consistent: her loosened grip on reality is shown through drifting, folding, floating the swan; contradiction is implied but never dramatized in scene. Motivation is clear, but the story never tightens into a high-stakes choice; she simply returns to watch again. The result is a credible, static endurance rather than an earned shift, limiting upper-band entry.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: she accepts the crumbling peace, the swan’s release is the visible cost. Causality is lyric-accumulative rather than strict because/therefore; pattern holds. Orientation anchors early; no penalty. The lens is coherent, yet the lack of a tightening beat keeps the score sub-8.8.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The obsidian refuge, river, and origami swan function as micro-setting that constrains her only path to silence; their return in the final image recharges the stake. Sensory detail is selective, filtered through her attenuated attention. No spatial confusion; world rules remain consistent. Meets 9+ gate for object-as-setting that charges closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—witness without judgment—signaled early. Pressure is situational: decay creeps, silence offers temporary reprieve, but no option is foreclosed. No meaningful tightening or price is dramatized; the swan’s release is symbolic rather than tactical. Escalation is atmospheric, not agentive, capping score below 8.0.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through images of moss, ink, paper decay, and the floating swan; no explicit thesis. Final image of “crumbling peace” reweights silence from refuge to inevitable erosion. Ambiguity is purposeful: decay is neither tragic nor triumphant. Resonance is earned through particulars, not assertion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric voice sustains a hushed, elegiac cadence; diction stays within keeper’s perceptual lexicon. Repetition of “regenerative silence” and “drift of untold seasons” is patterned, paid off in closing line. No dialogue to test. Syntax modulates with breath-length clauses that mirror her loosened grip. Minor filter-verb clusters hold at line level, keeping just under 9.0.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is rhythmically controlled, sentence variety mirrors tidal ebb. Figurative language is sparse but precise: “silence pooled like water,” “paper thin as memory.” No mixed metaphors or loops. Occasional scaffold (“the world outside pressed in...”) is brief and does not dull closure. Clean copy; opening and closing lines anchor and resolve.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Premise—librarian of decay using origami map—feels fresh yet inevitable. Swans-as-map and regenerative silence synthesize mundane objects into mythic tools without gimmickry. Risk is moderate; voice commits fully to lyric accretion. Could tip higher with a sharper micro-turn; still, specifics feel particular to this keeper and this library.</comment>
