<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The keeper’s contradictory need for solitude yet readiness to re-teach breathing is embodied in her scar-checked grip and the ring she both hoards and offers; the final smile is earned. The visitor’s knuckle-scars externalise shared history, but his interiority is thin—he never resists or complicates her method, so the relationship crucible cools. Micro-choices (ring on altar, hand-link) carry cost, yet the story repeats the same pedagogical beat for each new shadow, blunting individual stakes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the ring on the altar reweights the premise—thresholds can be reforged, but only at the cost of perpetual guardianship. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each exhaled shadow adds density until the sanctuary itself breathes, a resonant reconfiguration paid for by her eternal vigil. Causality is sound; no orientation debt. The waning threshold is felt, not explained, keeping cost legible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The ashen walls, starlight seams, and iron ring function as micro-setting: the ring’s weight and the walls’ texture constrain whether she offers return or refuses. Sensory selection is POV-filtered—charcoal dust on calloused palms, thin air that cramps lungs—mirroring internal suffocation. Spatial choreography is clean; bodies move from threshold to altar to corridor without drift. Environment evolves: the sanctuary’s pulse quickens as shared breath accrues, charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can she risk reopening a door she burned—is signaled early and tightens when the first scarred hand appears. One meaningful deepening: she shifts from hoarding the ring to placing it on the altar, foreclosing permanent isolation. Cost is visible: each new pupil dilutes her own oxygen, a persistent constraint. Agency is hers; the visitor merely requests, but her decision to teach alters the sanctuary’s atmosphere irrevocably.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: ash is not end-state but substrate for breath. Subtext lives in gesture—ring passed palm-to-palm like a lungful of shared air—never sermonized. The final image of successive shadows queuing reframes solitude as stewardship, avoiding tidy moral. Loaded emptiness is felt, not labeled, yet the refrain edges toward echo; one less articulation would sharpen resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Voice is lyric-accumulative, taught by the first sentence’s compressed metaphor and sustained through patterned breath cadences without drumbeat monotony. Perceptual signature is distinct: the keeper notices texture of absence—blurring threshold, weight of silence—never expository. POV remains tight single; no head-hop. Compression like “loaded emptiness” is reweighted at closure, paying off elision. Dialogue is sparse, indirect, voice-true.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Rhythm modulates with pulmonary rise-fall; sentences shorten under breath-teaching beats, lengthen in starlit reflection. Figurative language is selective—shadows as exhaled grief—never stacked to blur. No paraphrase loops or scaffold. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image. One near-misstep: “breathing is a bridge we build” flirts with aphorism, but context of scarred hands keeps it embodied.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Premise—sanctuary where shadows are literal breath—feels fresh, yet inherits recognizable trauma-healing tropes. Specificity of scar-link and iron ring transforms generic wound-sharing into tactile ritual. Risk is taken: no antagonist, no escape, only iterative teaching; coherence under lyric mode succeeds. Could edge higher if a single shadow-pupil deviated from pattern, proving rule elasticity.</comment>
