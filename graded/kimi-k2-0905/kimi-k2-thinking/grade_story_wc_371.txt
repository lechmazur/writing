<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Mara’s quiet, dogged refusal to forget is embodied in tactile micro-choices (breaking the petrified loaf, pressing soil with the veteran). Her contradictory impulse—grief for the lost bakery vs. hope in a seed—remains active throughout. The final “earned stasis” of continuing to tend the courtyard is visible and costly: she forfeits any chance of official restoration. Only the caretaker’s daughter and veteran acquire brief interiority; their reactions enlarge Mara’s motives without stealing focalization.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the story tightens by density and cadence: each vanished object (gates, bakery, sourdough) accrues into a pattern of communal surrender. The breadcrumb-soil scattering is a decisive micro-turn that reweights the stake from private memory to shared witness; the cost is the irrevocable consumption of the last relic. Transitions are legible within the single-scene window; spatial anchors (ivy-choked fountain, yew-shadowed tea house) are fixed by word 120. No causality break; the final image crystallizes options: perpetual tending is now the only viable future.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The palace courtyard functions as both macro-setting and micro-tool: cracked flagstones receive seeds, mossy fountains supply water, the yew shelters the tea table. These details constrain tactics—officials never penetrate the overgrowth, giving Mara tactical freedom. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: Mara notices rust, yeast ghosts, frost-nipped air because they signal erasure. The breadcrumb-soil mixture charges the final image, making environment and ritual inseparable.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—refuse unnoticed forgetting—is signaled early and escalates by accretion: each lost ordinary thing (rye taste, fountain flow) heightens the cost of inattention. Guerrilla gardening is the visible tactic that narrows options: every seedling is a public wager that could be uprooted. The tightening beat is the communal scattering of breadcrumbs; by consuming the last evidence they foreclose retreat into private nostalgia. Price is legible: the loaf is gone forever, their ritual now the only residue.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</question>
<comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: bread, seeds, mismatched cups. The sacred is located not in cathedral but in shared noticing—subtext delivered via gesture (kneeling veteran, silent tears) rather than thesis. Final image of people continuing to leave autumn bread re-prices the premise: remembrance becomes civic liturgy without sermonizing. No abstract moralizing; the resonance is harvested from the breadcrumb-soil benediction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays latched to Mara’s perceptual signature: “ghost of yeast,” “yew that kept its own counsel.” Syntax lengthens with rue, contracts when she scoops soil—rhythmic control mirrors emotional cadence. No head-hopping; when the veteran kneels, we read his action through Mara’s watching, not his feelings. Dialogue is absent by design; voice coherence is carried through selective sensory diction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero filter-verb stacks or synonym loops. Figurative language is sparse, precise: “wax paper that crinkled like dried leaves” condenses time and brittleness in one stroke. Sentence rhythm varies naturally; paragraph cuts are surgical—each advances knowledge (loaf found → ritual invented → congregation formed). Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image that recharges “creeping beauty” motif. No scaffold; high information density.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: dystopia of incremental forgetting countered not by revolution but by gardening and tea rituals. Risk-taking—using guerrilla botany as insurgency—pays off without gimmickry. Conceptual integrity holds: the story commits to the premise that attention is sacrament. If transplanted to another city, the emotional engine collapses; specificity is inseparable from stakes.</comment>
