<comment>Mira’s “desperately jocular” mask is embodied in every beat—she laughs at crumbling walls, trades jokes for stories, and the contradiction feels lived-in. The interior cost is visible when her laughter “softens into something genuine,” showing a micro-choice that forecloses her exit before dawn. No stock labels; even the blind ticket-puncher’s status shift (murmuring the rock-glow rumor) is staged through action. The final renunciation—leaving the fragment, slipping away—pays off the prior causality; loneliness is confronted, not cured, so the cost lands.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the moon fragment, once memento, becomes communal cornerstone, reweighting the station’s social contract. Causality holds under Accumulative lens—each whispered memory tightens the silver glow until shared hope crystallizes; Mira’s exit is the visible price. Orientation is anchored by word 30 (“ivy-veined platforms”), no debt. The final image (“polite anarchy of shared stories”) makes conceptual cost undeniable: isolation is foreclosed, reciprocity is the new rule.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Station, ivy, rusted clock, moon fragment—all handled, handed off, embedded; the fragment’s shifting locus (pocket→Gus→children→cornerstone) tracks the social arc. Micro-setting doubles as social map: each platform edge, ticket punch, ivy curtain guides who can overhear whom, constraining rumor flow. Sensory hierarchy favors sound (whispers, lullaby, chime) fitting the blind resident’s authority. Final embedding of the rock in the cornerstone literalizes “tangible promise,” charging the last image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“cure for loneliness” —is signaled in paragraph 2 and tightens when each resident must pay a memory to feed the rock’s glow. One meaningful deepening suffices: the communal confession of warm memories narrows Mira’s options—she can no longer keep the fragment. Cost is visible: she forfeits her talisman and her anonymity. Agency is collective rather than solo, fitting the accumulative design; pressure coheres without need for external antagonist.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges entirely through particulates: rock as currency, stories as oxygen, ivy as living audience. No character articulates “loneliness is cured by reciprocity”; the final lullaby hummed by Elara is the silent thesis. The moon fragment’s re-pricing—from private charm to public hearth—offers conceptual cost that reweights every prior tale. Ambiguity lingers: Mira may be rumor, yet the glow is real, inviting counter-readings without confusion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Narrative voice carries a lyrical, slightly elevated diction (“polite anarchy,” “harmonious resonance”) that remains internally consistent for an omniscient teller. Rhythm modulates: long sentences for ivy-draped exposition, staccato triplets for rumor propagation, gentle cadence for lullaby closure. No head-hopping; focalization stays panoramic yet anchored to Mira’s exit. Filter verbs are few and purposeful; perceptual signature favors sound over sight, matching the blind resident’s authority.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Sentence variety is high, scaffolding minimal; information density strong (“crackling fire on a winter’s eve” does triple duty—sense, nostalgia, cost). No mixed metaphors; ivy “shimmering” is single, coherent image. Loop screen clean—no synonym churn, no template cadence in final third. Opening line anchors tone and stakes; final line (“gentle rebellion against the silence of isolation”) resolves by image that recharges earlier motifs.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Fusion of moon rock + rumor economy + disused station feels fresh; the healing trope is inverted—community heals the rock, not vice versa. Specifics resist swap: blind ticket-puncher as first amplifier, ivy as acoustic curtain, midnight-frozen clock as stage. Risk taken with collective agency instead of single-hero arc, and it pays off under Accumulative lens. No detectable echoes of famous scenes; the “polite anarchy” coinage is memorable without gimmickry.</comment>
