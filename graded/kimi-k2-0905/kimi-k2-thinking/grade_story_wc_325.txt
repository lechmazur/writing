<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Marek’s claustrophobia and survivor-guilt are embodied in every breath and tremor; the augments, codex, and tide clock externalize contradictory urges without therapy-speak. One clear micro-choice—hand flat to the terminal—pulls all prior motives into a visible cost. Interiority stays concrete and oceanic, though “their own name…dark and cold” edges toward convenient emblem.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each beat moves because/therefore from hatch seal to terminal touch; the 47-minute tide window is taught early and narrows options to the final seven-second sync. The climactic renunciation (no data stolen, only witness paid) lands with conceptual cost as the gold flecks dim—an earned stasis that forecloses retrieval. Minor waver: facility map remains skeletal, but spatial drift never muddies the terminal beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The moon pool, narrowing rust corridors, and server cradle with water at knees act as micro-settings that literally squeeze choice; the codex’s bloated leather and the gold flecks that warm then cool track the emotional thermometer. Phase-transition acoustics (“sound like glaciers calving”) marry environment to Marek’s chest cavity. All anchors appear by line 60; no orientation debt.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—witness the unremembered—is signaled in paragraph 3 and tightens as oxygen and tide dwindle; the codex’s warming/cooling provides a visible price gauge. One decisive narrowing: hand-to-terminal sync costs Marek seven seconds ofMerged consciousness, after which retreat is the only option. Pressure escalates under causal logic; no coincidence resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges electro-poetic: corporate erasure vs. quantum persistence of self. The undersea cable metaphor—cat videos upstairs, ghosts below—re-prices our casual data flow without sermon. Final image of cold gold beside Marek’s name offers resonant reconfiguration: remembrance is not data recovery but embodied attention. No moralizing sentence mars the close.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person close keeps perceptual signature oceanic: “crashing hush,” “compressed spaces…closing fists,” prose rhythms that mimic internal pressure. No head-hopping; augments filter sensory input consistently. Compression and elision (“seven seconds”) are taught early and paid off. Occasional elevated register (“neural pattern overwritten”) risks academic drift but stays within Marek’s tech memory.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>High information density: one sentence often layers tech, body, and metaphor (“water became breathable medium became memory”). No filter-verb clusters or paraphrase loops; metaphors stay physically coherent. Rhythm accelerates with rising water without syntactic monotony. One mixed metaphor (“ghostprints wash through augments”) lightly muddies the close but does not break causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fusion of spelunking + data-ghost + tide-locked heist feels fresh yet inevitable; premise squeezes two normally distant genres into one lung-tight space. Corporate erasure via cable-cutting offers a non-obvious moral calculus. Risky second-person hallucinatory sync pays off by making witness visceral. Could edge higher if facility rules were seeded even earlier.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Claustrophobia drives descent speed, corridor hesitation, and final bolt for the sub; panic is the live clock that forces the seven-second sync to double as exposure therapy. Removing it collapses both escalation and Marek’s uniquely oceanic spelunking identity.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Gold flecks seeded in line 7, warm to guide ghost-map, then cool to signal witness complete; their temperature is the story’s emotional barometer and literal compass. Final dimming in the submersible mirrors the cost of sync—irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Cables are not backdrop but the afterlife itself—Petrov’s laughter turns to static inside the fiber; Marek’s hand closes the circuit. Cutting them erases the dead, so the return trip is literally a rewiring of memory. Without this medium, the ghost-witness concept evaporates.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Tracking trait enables the entire plot: codex, flecks, augments, and the terminal sync are useless without Marek’s ability to parse electromagnetic ghosts. Trait costs seven seconds of self-dissolution—highest visible price on the page.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>10.0</grade>
<comment>Return is the inciting action, midpoint escalation (entry), climax (sync), and denouement (escape); every beat is a phase transition of the same physical return. Remove it and zero story remains.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Phase transitions are the facility’s operating system and Marek’s panic metaphor—liquid-to-gas-to-data governs hatch sigh, moon pool calving sound, and neural merge. Mechanics are referenced early and decide breathable moments vs. drowning, so they shape tactics, not just ambience.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Forgotten facility supplies the claustrophobic crush, the reversed drainage miracle, the quantum server cradle, and the isolation that makes witness meaningful; its rusted fist corridors literally narrow choices. Any other locale would relax the stakes.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Between tidal changes is taught in sentence one and sets the 47-minute doomsday clock; rising water forces faster phase transitions and Marek’s final sprint. Time is environment and antagonist.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>Motive to stand witness is stated early, resisted by claustrophobia, and crystallized when Marek sees their own cold gold fleck—an unarguable call to stay present. Renouncing data theft for pure attention is the story’s ethical pivot.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Crashing hush is established in line 1 and modulates from entry sigh to pressure silence to post-sync vacuum; the final sub ascent restores ordinary data roar, re-weighting the earlier hush as sacred silence. Tone carries the thematic flip from noise to witness.</comment>
