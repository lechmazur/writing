<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Iyana’s exile backstory and obsessive map-making give her a sharp, particular interior voice; the burnt-feather tool externalizes her mindset and steers every beat. The final renunciation is seeded early (“she hoped to find proof”) and paid with the oxygen clock, so the cost is legible. Flaw: no second character on-page, so status/relationship crucible is absent, and the interior turn is slightly over-articulated (“she saw it: the rhythm…”) rather than left to image.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: she stays, submersible leaves empty, oxygen debt becomes permanent—cost is visible. Causal chain holds: feather maps → plaza discovery → breath-sync → renunciation. One minor scaffold: “she hoped to find proof…” is told twice in adjacent sentences; trimming would tighten. Orientation is taught by word 70, well under the 120-word ceiling.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Flooded corridors, coral-crusted instruments, and pressure-wave dawn are selective, sensorily balanced, and always filtered through Iyana’s astrologer gaze. The plaza-as-open-courtyard and the feather’s projected ghost-maps constrain her final choice; environment literally shows her the pattern she must join. No static cataloging—each detail either escalates pressure (oxygen countdown) or charges the final image (firefly bacteria as nebulae).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</question><comment>Dominant stake—“learn the rhythm of belonging”—is signaled in paragraph 2 and narrows to a live either/or: surface exile versus drowned transformation. Escalation is single but meaningful: oxygen clock shrinks from six hours to ninety minutes, forcing the final sync/renunciation. Cost is visible (she forfeits rescue), though the beat could be sharper if we felt one physical symptom of hypoxia.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Theme emerges from concrete pattern-hunt rather than assertion: belonging = frequency match, proven by microbe constellations and her synchronized exhale. Final image reweights exile into homecoming without moralizing. One soft echo: “luminous respite” is named twice—second mention edges toward thesis-statement, but the prior image (feather glowing against dark) mostly earns it.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</question><comment>Astrologer-POV diction (“terrestrial zodiac,” “fossil-memory,” “galactic formations”) is consistent, compressed, and rhythmically varied; no filter-verb clutter. Short, tidal fragments under final pressure (“She became part…”) mirror the oceanic pulse. Orpheus AI voice is cleanly distinct—tide-cadence without human ventriloquism. No head-hop; psychic distance shortens precisely at breath-sync moment.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</question><comment>Read-aloud rhythm alternates between long, liquid sentences and sharp, oxygen-starved fragments; no template cadence. Metaphors stay internally coherent (city as leviathan, microbes as nebulae) and serve the astrologer lens. One mixed vehicle: “breathing shadow and phosphorescence in equal measure” barely slips toward contradiction, but the image is brief and functional. High density—each sentence layers map, body, and clock.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</question><comment>Underwater astrology + fossilized non-bird feather + bioluminescent microbe “fireflies” synthesize into a fresh, inevitable mythos. transformation-of-people-into-city-light avoids clichéd Atlantis tropes. Risk: lyric surrender to drowned home is quietly radical and pays off. The premise is inseparable from this setting and voice—swap any element and the whole collapses.</comment>
