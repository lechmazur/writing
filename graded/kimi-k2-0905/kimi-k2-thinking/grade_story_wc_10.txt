<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Mara’s interior contradiction—needing to “rectify” silence yet having no voice—stays present, but the embodied emotion thins to label-speak (“sorrow a deep blue”) and none of her micro-choices after the first fork-strike alters tactics; the final renunciation is graceful but cost is asserted rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The accumulative pattern (silent fork → frost bloom → shared gaze) teaches itself by 30 % and lands a clean Charged Poise: Mara’s refusal to force sound crystallizes options with felt cost. Orientation is anchored early; only minor causality gap—how heat-mapping mechanics travel from her retina to glass—is waved away by lyric premise and does not rupture closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Winterglass conservatory functions as micro-setting that literally transmits vibration; frost patterns and heating hum evolve across beats and charge the final image. Sensory selection stays urgent—glass, breath, fork, frost—creating lived-in texture without tourist catalog.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</question><comment>Dominant stake—“fill silence without sound”—is signaled early; escalation arrives via three fork strikes that deepen rather than widen stakes. Each strike visibly reweights the room’s emotional palette, but the cost (energy, risk of fracture, social exposure) is implied not tactile, keeping pressure vivid yet not quite visceral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of silence-as-canvas emerges through repeated frost images and fork vibrations; no moralizing caps the piece. The final breath-fogged reflection reprises brother motif and reconfigures silence from void to cathedral—an earned Conceptual Repricing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person lyric voice sustains a hushed, resonant cadence that mirrors subject; diction (“winterglass,” “heat-mapped”) is specific yet transparent. No dialogue to judge; perceptual signature—color-temperature emotion—remains consistent and character-bound.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Rhythm breathes with scene needs—short fragments for fork strikes, longer coils for contemplation—without algorithmic pattern. Only minor scaffold: “silent weight of memory” and “silent expression” recycled stem; no mixed metaphors or register drift. Information density high; each sentence layers frost, vibration, and emotion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The tuning-fork-as-instrument for synesthetic grief is a fresh synthesis; “heat-mapping emotions” avoids gimmick by anchoring in physical glass vibration. Risk is quiet—no plot pyrotechnics—but coherence and specificity lift it above template. Could swap conservatory for another resonant shell, so not quite indispensable.</comment>
