<comment>Elara’s interiority is textured—her attention to “dust motes” and the “weight of unspoken words” is character-specific—but her contradictory impulses are asserted more than dramatized; the moment she resolves to mend the covenant is summarized rather than shown. The cost of her vow is implied, not embodied; we are told the weight “burned brighter” but never see her body register the price. Still, the quiet endurance at the end feels consistent with her perceptive stillness, earning a modest Earned Stasis.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens is declared early and held: each image adds density to the dominant stake—preserving unspoken words—until the stained-glass box crystallizes the covenant. Closure is a Charged Poise: the box glowing on the altar reweights all prior dust-and-silence imagery with undeniable conceptual cost. A single causal micro-turn—realizing the hives are hollow—legibly narrows her option to restoration. No orientation debt; spatial anchors (collapsed hive, stone altar) track cleanly.</comment>

<comment>The oasis is not mere postcard backdrop; its barren hives and fractured light actively constrain Elara’s choices—she can’t speak the words, only shelter them. The stained-glass box functions as micro-setting: its colored panes literally refract the ghost’s face, charging the final image. Sensory economy is sharp—”brittle light,” “paper thin as a whisper”—never drifting into catalogue. Environment, tool, and recurring object all intersect to pressurize the covenant, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<comment>Pressure accumulates through pattern intensification: each mention of “unspoken words” adds weight until the hollow-hive realization breaks the pattern and forces restoration. The visible price is the recognition that the bees—and thus the soul-carrier—are gone; this deepens the stake but is still conceptual rather than viscerally felt. Agency is present—she lifts the box, places it on the altar—but the tactical cost (sweat, thirst, physical risk) remains off-page. Sufficient for a meaningful tightening, but not the full 8.8+ band.</comment>

<comment>Theme emerges organically: the silence of bees equals the silence of the dead; no character articulates a thesis. The final image—colored light dissolving the ghost’s face—offers a non-literal answer: remembrance is the only afterlife. Ambiguity is purposeful; the covenant is “remembered, not undone,” resisting moralizing. Subtext in the mute eloquence motif deepens with each beat, culminating in conceptual repricing.</comment>

<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric, compressed, and pattern-taught: the repeated noun-epithet pairs (“tranquilly perceptive,” “mute eloquence”) create liturgical cadence that justifies itself. Perceptual signature is distinct—Elara notices “dust motes” and “fractured light” in ways that refract her own splintered voice. No head-hopping; ghost’s interiority is only inferred through flickers she interprets. Syntax tightens under pressure—final paragraph shifts to shorter clauses mirroring dissipation—without obscuring closure.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>High information density: single sentences do triple duty (“The weight of his unspoken words pressed against the glass, a silent vow kept”). No paraphrase loops or synonym churn; metaphors stay coherent (glass/veil/light). Occasional elevated diction (“conceptual repricing”) is justified by the lyric register. Rhythm modulates—long breathless clauses yield to fragmentary final lines—without artifact. Clean proofing; no tense drift.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses drought, beekeeping, and post-veil ghosts in a synthesis that feels inevitable rather than gimmicky. The stained-glass box as soul-archive is a fresh inflection on memory-objects. Risk taken: lyric repetition and mute ghost could verge on precious, but disciplined cadence and grounded sensory detail keep it from abstract whimsy. Specificity—“paper thin as a whisper”—anchors the concept; swap bees for birds and the story collapses.</comment>
