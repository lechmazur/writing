<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Kael’s insomnia and calligrapher’s mission are consistent, but interior contradiction is only asserted (“methodically hopeful” tells). Embodied emotion is vivid in greenhouse strokes, yet no micro-choice under pressure tests his hope; he merely paints the same phrase again. Mira’s brief presence supplies the only external pressure, so the relationship crucible is absent. Closure is Earned Stasis—he keeps painting—but cost is ambient, not personal, so the beat feels observational rather than transformative.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Single-scene orientation is clear by line 3; greenhouse, city, and moon are anchored early. Accumulative/Textural lens taught via repeated moonlight-in-ink imagery; closure (tokens accumulate, kindness remembered) lands as Resonant Reconfiguration with ambient cost. No teleporting props; moon-tipped brush state is tracked. One scaffold loop—“quiet” thrice in final paragraph—blunts cadence but does not obscure causality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Rooftop greenhouse as micro-setting constrains access (ladder, glass, city smog below) and directly enables the luminous mural via moon angle. Sensory triage favors aroma of crushed starlight-herbs and saffron haze—details filtered through insomniac painter’s selective attention. Spatial choreography holds: canvas carried down, pasted on factory wall, herbs placed at foot. Tool-as-setting (brush) charges final image with pale hum, meeting 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“will strangers remember kindness?”—is signaled early but never faces credible risk; success arrives with first responder. No option narrows: Kael repeats the same action, merely scaling it. Accumulation of tokens deepens texture rather than tightening pressure, so escalation stays lyric, not stakes-driven. Cost is societal, not personal; brush never falters, insomnia never punished.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Kindness-as-virus theme emerges via herbal ripple; no character states the moral. Final image of “lost languages… lived in the breath of strangers” reweights prior cataloguing without sermon. Subtext operates in gesture—Mira’s herbs stand in for spoken thanks—avoiding sentimental directness. Ambiguity lingers: city still choking, kindness fragile, theme not tidily resolved.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays tight to Kael’s perceptual bias: moonlight “spills,” ink “dreams,” smog “chokes.” Sentence rhythm lengthens during brush stroke, contracts at dawn fade, mirroring insomnia’s ebb. No head-hopping; Mira’s interiority is implied through action only. Diction remains within painterly lexicon; occasional flourish (“moon-singers”) is pattern-taught early and paid off.</comment>

<comment>Prose is dense yet breathable: “smog-choked city… saffron quiet” carries two sensory jobs. One paraphrase loop on “quiet” in closing paragraph costs −0.2; otherwise no scaffold. Figurative vehicles stay coherent—moonlight as lantern, ink as starlight—without mixed metaphors. Strong verbs (“catalogued,” “crushed,” “roused”) reduce need for adverbs.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Combines insomnia, dead scripts, and urban graffiti into fresh synthesis; moon-tipped brush as jade heirloom feels specific而非borrowed. Risk is lyrical accumulation rather than twist, but pattern holds. Could swap cities or languages with minor edits, so not fully irreplicable. Still, emotional specificity of rooftop greenhouse under waxing moon lingers.</comment>
