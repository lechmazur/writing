<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The skimmer’s historically reverent nature is shown through tactile ritual (arrowhead, quartz disc) and her refusal to move, but the interior contradiction—yearning for travel while immobile—never sharpens into a scene-level choice that costs her anything. The mentor-chain backstory is compressed yet efficient, and the final beat of becoming teacher crystallizes a soft arc, yet the emotional stakes feel abstract because no external test forces her to risk her creed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the wandering pulse becomes an internal compass, reweighting stillness as true travel. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—harmonics layer until pattern breaks into revelation—but the single on-page cost is purely perceptual; no object or relationship is forfeited, muting the punch.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Bone towers, rose-quartz disc, and dust strata are handled, struck, and made to resonate; their acoustic properties directly enable the final map, satisfying the 9+ gate. Canyon acoustics and avian choreography are filtered through a mystic surveyor’s priorities, giving the world intimate, functional specificity.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—stillness versus navigation—tightens when birds form the waited-for spiral, but the escalation is observational rather than interactive; she remains safe, merely decoding. Cost is conceptual (redefinition of travel) rather than visceral, keeping pressure cerebral and stakes abstract.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: true journey is temporal attendance, not spatial displacement. The birds’ spiral and the dust dance reconfigure the value of stillness without sermon, achieving quiet resonance. No final-paragraph thesis is imposed, letting image carry the reweighting.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The lyric-accumulative voice teaches its pattern early—“longer than dust remembered”—and sustains incantatory rhythm without monotony. Perceptual signature is vivid: wind “turned into endless echoes,” time “grew thick with memory.” Compression and ellipsis are consistent, and closure line lands with tonic cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet breathable; metaphors are organic to geology and acoustics. No loops or scaffold; sentence rhythm modulates to match harmonic layering. Occasional elevated diction (“temporal fabric,” “sacrilege”) stays within mystic register and is earned by voice, not overreach.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Stillness-as-navigation and stone-harmonic cartography feel fresh, not grafted. Risk lies in the lyric, near-mythic tone that could tip into abstraction, yet specificity of quartz disc, bone towers, and birds keeps it grounded. The synthesis of acoustics and temporality produces a memorable micro-myth.</comment>
