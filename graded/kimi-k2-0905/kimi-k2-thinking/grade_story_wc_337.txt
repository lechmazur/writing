<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara’s guilt-driven compulsion to unravel the net is visceral and embodied; the pearl pressed to her scarred cheek crystallizes the cost. Interior contradiction—terror of memory vs. need to speak—drives every micro-choice. The final shift from hiding behind masks to offering them as sanctuaries is earned, not declared. Only a trace of diagnostic self-labeling (“I was afraid”) keeps this from 9+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the net’s empty weave becomes a map of named souls, reframing her lifelong shame into architecture. Accumulative lens holds: each unraveled knot intensifies spectral density until the pearl condenses silence into tangible birth. The mentor’s warned prohibition pays off as persistent constraint—she becomes the threadbare thing, willingly. Cost is legible in the final image: starlight passing through the open weave = forgiveness she can now transmit.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prism sanctuary’s fractured refractions constrain action—starlight literally guides the unknitting rhythm. The tapestry needle moon-glint recurs as micro-setting that times each confession. Sensory hierarchy is filtered through scarred, professional hands; salt, varnish, pearl trace haptic memory. Environment is not backdrop but optical instrument that reconfigures grief into geometry.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—free the drowned voices or remain their jailer—tightens with every knot surrendered. Accumulative escalation: each loosened thread increases spectral pressure until the final pearl compresses thirty years of silence. No external coincidence; the only antagonist is her own calcified throat. The decisive cost is the permanent hollow in her bones where seven names now reside—visible forfeiture of anonymity.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as the inverse of restoration: true repair requires dismantling, not mending. The interlaced hush shifts from prison to birthplace without authorial sermon. Final image—starlight threading the empty net—offers non-literal answer: silence shared becomes structure, not void. Complexity preserved: she doesn’t expiate guilt, but incorporates it as living architecture.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric remains tightly focalized through Elara’s scar-filtered perception. Syntax elongates during unraveling, then snaps into short declaratives at the pearl’s reveal, mirroring breath release. No head-hopping; prism refractions are perceived, not explained. Distinct perceptual signature: every glint of light is a sailor’s laugh or father’s promise—hallucination as optical fact.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm varies from sinuous, comma-threaded loops to the final staccato of named steps. Figurative language is selective: “spectral geometry,” “figure-eight of perfect fear”—never stacked. No synonym churn; each metaphor advances either light or net. One mixed vehicle—“architecture of the woman”—is forgiven because it charges the closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise flips mask-restoration trope: the restorer’s task is to break, not mend. Spectral net-of-voices is fresh, yet grounded in coastal folklore and pearl-forming biology. Risk of lyric overload is embraced yet controlled by optical physics. Transformation test fails if Elara were any other artisan—her scars and the prism sanctuary are irreplaceable.</comment>
