<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The monthly molt trait supplies an interior contradiction that visibly complicates action—hands shake while shelving Whitman—yet the final resolve to “keep the poet’s voice” feels fore-given rather than fought for; the seed-poem choice is announced more than dramatized, muting cost. Still, embodied tics (whisper-voice, trembling) and the anchoring object (tin) give the poet a singular sensorium. Cora’s pressure is present but her status pivot is told, not staged, so the relationship crucible never quite bites.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A lyric-accumulative lens is taught early (“He molts personalities monthly”) and holds to the final Charged Poise: the silver fracture across rust reweights the whole lattice of hidden books. The closure unit lands on-page—“he chose to keep the poet’s voice”—with the conceptual cost that every future self must carry this prison seed. Orientation is clean inside 120 words; no lens ambiguity at end. Persistent constraint (tin’s false bottom) shapes tactics throughout, satisfying the 9+ cost test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The rusted library roof—peeled back to expose stars—functions as micro-setting that literally lets moonlight charge the final image; spatial choreography is tight during the shelf-rebuild beat. Sensory triage narrows to metallic taste, nail-scavenge sounds, coffee-ground grit, all filtered through the quiet poet’s hyper-attentive ear. Weather (storm-scarred roof) causally enables the starlight payoff; no exposition dump. Object-state tracking of the tin is flawless—grounds, fold, seed—passing from hand to hand with weight felt.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—beauty from anarchy via forbidden verse—tightens when the molt threatens to erase the poet’s library self; the seed-poem insertion is the visible price that forecloses anonymity. Escalation is accumulative: each smuggled book, each inmate whisper, layers risk until the moonlit fracture reweights stakes for every future personality. No coincidence resolves; the final stance crystallizes under coherent pressure. Persistent constraint (tin) shapes tactics across beats, satisfying visible-cost clause.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges concretely: a hollowed-out sonnet becomes a literal seedbed for insurrection, so “beauty from anarchy” is enacted, not declared. The luminous fracture reprises the earlier starlight slit, reweighting the same image from decay to promise—an earned conceptual repricing. No final moralizing; the last line’s quiet act keeps ambiguity. Counter-readings (is the molt escape or evasion?) linger without confusion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays latched to the poet’s perceptual filter—whisper-register, auditory bias, synesthetic silver ribbons—without head-hop. Syntax elongates under moonlight, compresses during guard approach; diction stays within vagrant-poet lexicon. Cora’s laugh “like breaking glass” is the only dialogue, instantly distinctive. No filter-verb stacks; immediacy holds in peak beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm modulates: long breathless clauses for starlight, staccato noun phrases for nail scavenging. Metaphors (garden cracking pavement, silver fracture) recur with earned variation; no mixed vehicles. Information density high—one sentence can layer scent of rust, whisper of pages, and risk of discovery. Zero paraphrase loops; opening line anchors voice and stakes, final line resolves by image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The personality-molt trope is flipped from sci-fi gimmick into prison-library lit fuse; the coffee tin’s false bottom becomes a literal printing press of dissent. Specificity—Whitman’s tattered copy, nail straightening—grounds the freshness. Risk in lyrical compression heightens coherence without obscuring closure. Synthesis feels inevitable: of course a man who sheds selves would plant a seed-poem in a hollowed sonnet.</comment>
