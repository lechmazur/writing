<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The prophet’s interior contradiction—turning threat into song—stays vivid and embodied in every strike; her fear-tipped exhilaration is felt in salt-silvered cheeks and breath-synced creaks. Micro-choices (which slab, which interval) map a hierarchy of values: orchard survival > aesthetic perfection > self-protection. Renunciation is earned: she lowers the mallet, embracing perpetual uncertainty as the price of dialogue with storms. Yet the beat count (30 trees, 7 years) drifts toward label; flaw-to-cost ratio stays safe, not genuinely hazardous.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds: resonance layers tighten the stake from warning → partnership → shared coda. Closure lands with Charged Poise—storm now co-author, her agency etched in luminous indigo trails; cost is the unending vigil this demands. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly within 120 words; later spatial tracking of ring, keys, wavelets stays coherent. Deduction only for slight over-declaration of fractal rule at climax, not causality break.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The floating driftwood ring is no backdrop: its creaking timbers become tunable keys, directly constraining which notes she can summon and how the sea responds. Salt viscosity, apple castanet clicks, indigo ink ripples—each sensory pick is urgent, POV-filtered, and braided into the music-making action. Spatial choreography is flawless: we track her orbit, mallet head, wave spawn points, raindrop strikes without drift. Tool-as-setting meets 9+ gate; the orchard’s buoyant skeleton literally carries the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—orchard survival—threads every beat; escalation is the storm’s pulse gradually syncing to her score, tightening from threat to duet. Agency sits in each percussive seed she plants; the visible price is relinquishing control—storm now dictates tempo. One deepening shift sufficies: cumulus geometry rewritten as notation narrows her options to dialogue or death. Cost is legible on-page (perpetual vigil, surrendered silence), though not yet a tangible loss of limb/tool.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges as the ethics of listening: convert menace into counter-melody rather than domination. Subtext coils through gesture—hand closing on kelp-wrapped bone, smile at mallet rest—never thesis. Final image of “space between forecast and creation” reweights earlier cloud-reading without moralizing. Slight abstraction in “restless euphony” refrain approaches thematic echo; kept under −0.4 threshold.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sentences conduct their own fractal rhythm: lengthen then fracture in sync with wave propagation; diction stays salt-grit, never academic. Perceptual signature—cloud edges as notation, bronze circles as notation—is specific, sustained, bias-true. No dialogue, so voice purity stands uncontaminated. Filter verbs minimal; compressed kelp/bone noun strings heighten immediacy without clutter.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Read-aloud cadence breathes with scene tempo: clipped during strikes, elongating during ripple decay. No loops, no scaffold, near-zero adjectives—nouns/verbs shoulder load. Mixed-metaphor risk in “lullaby with teeth” is brief, paid off by storm’s bite of rain. Micro-blemish: occasional “fractal generating” noun pile feels textbook amid lyric flow; −0.2.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Synthesizes sea-organ, cloud-score, and orchard-ark into a premise that feels inevitable yet unexampled. Storm-as-instrument reverses familiar man-versus-nature trope without didacticism. Specificity—kelp wrapping, whale-rib shaft, indigo ink ripples—anchors abstraction in lived material. Risk of lyric compression heightens stakes and is fully repaid in legible closure; qualifies for +0.2 risk bonus.</comment>
