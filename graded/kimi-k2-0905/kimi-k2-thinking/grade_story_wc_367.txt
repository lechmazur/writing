<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Interiority is lyrical rather than embodied—laughter as weather instrument risks label-speak. The “accidentally prophetic” trait is asserted repeatedly but never dramatized via a micro-choice that backfires; the one spoken prophecy (“The tide will turn…”) is self-fulfilling without visible cost. No contradictory impulse undercuts her exultation; shadowed elation is named, not felt. Endurance of destiny is declared, not paid for—no path is foreclosed, so Earned Stasis remains conceptual.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/lyric lens: pattern of light→shadow→prophecy is taught early and reweights meaning at the end. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the emerald glow and dawn image reconfigure the world’s digital fog, cost felt conceptually. No persistent constraint or price shapes future tactics—her power is celebrated, never taxed. Orientation is clear; causality is poetic parallelism rather than tight because/therefore linkage.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Emerald lighthouse, glass-crystal wick, and star-pricked dark supply micro-setting that constrains every beat of light-steering. Visceral sensory triad—wind taste, crystal chill, green ray—anchors POV without sliding into catalog. Spatial choreography holds across the single scene: beam-thread from tower to hull is trackable. Final image of gold dawn reweights the emerald palette and satisfies 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: can ancient shadows guide a lost ship through digital fog? Pressure escalates only once—light-thread thrown, ship answers, storm abates; no narrowing of options or visible price. Escalation is situational: external storm abates rather than protagonist paying cost. Agency is symbolic (turning wick) rather than tactical; the world obeys her prophecy without testing her resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through light/shadow motif: memory versus digital amnesia, old print versus new dawn. Subtext operates in silent dance of silhouettes—no character articulates “media obsolescence.” Final image of gold dawn reprices emerald light as analogue rebirth; ambiguity lingers on whether laughter births or merely heralds change. Avoids overt moral; avoids thematic echo penalty.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person omniscient adopts a mythic register—temple bells cadence, long vowel music—that fits lighthouse-keeper-as-prophecy. Perceptual signature is star-filtered maritime mysticism: ink weight, hollow star-channel, silver thread. No head-hop; voice remains outside character but poetically consistent. Compression (“the world forgot the weight of ink”) teaches elliptical pattern that pays off in dawn-gold echo.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud ear is strong: sentence lengths crest and recede like waves. Occasional purple stacks (“emerald lighthouse under stars still kept its ancient vigil”) but metaphor logic stays coherent—no mixed vehicles. One paraphrase loop: “shadowed elation, a thrill wrapped in the weight of destiny” restates same beat. No artifacts in closure; final line is clean, luminous.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Freshest synthesis: print-extinction grief refracted through maritime-optics physics (total internal reflection guiding real ships). Shadow-as-blueprint premise commits fully rather than metaphoric garnish. Risk of lyric omniscience pays off in resonant dawn image. Could not swap lighthouse for any beacon—its emerald glass and ink-weight backstory are particularized.</comment>
