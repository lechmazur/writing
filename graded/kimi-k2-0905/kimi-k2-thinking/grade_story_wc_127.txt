<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The dealer’s detachment is credibly maintained; his “static-electric” empathy test and calibrated dosing show a professional whose craft is also his prison. Interior contradiction is present—he feels “a faint affection” yet labels himself spectator—but the beat is condensed into a single line rather than allowed to twist under pressure. The withheld micro-choice on whether to taste the dose himself keeps him from full complicity and limits the arc’s depth. Still, his voice is specific, never generic, and the ending image of “patient wait” earns a stoic, costly stasis.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the final static hum reweights the entire ritual, proving empathy remains a commodity he can meter but never own. Causality holds—each drop is tested, spark acknowledged, client dosed—until the last beat where the dealer’s own skin still crackles, foreclosing the option to feel freely. The lens is Accumulative/Textural: repetition of amber, static, and half-truths thickens the air rather than twists plot. Cost is felt in the lingering charge that will not ground; no larger external price is required for this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Amber grotto functions as micro-setting: its honeyed light guides dilution choices and its dusk pulse times the dose. The blotter petal is handled, re-handled, and finally re-cased—its journey tracks the emotional transaction. Stone bench, resinous air, and distant drip are filtered through the dealer’s sensory hierarchy, never tourist catalog. Spatial choreography stays clean across two bodies and one exit. The setting quietly constrains: no quick escape from resin-thick air, no daylight to expose the counterfeit.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can engineered empathy bridge the bureaucrat’s void without collapsing—is signaled early and tightens when the spark confirms potency. Pressure grows texturally: each repetition of “half-truths” and “static” thickens the moral murk rather than forks the plot. The client’s softening jaw is the visible price, but the dealer’s own flicker of longing is the subtler cost that forecloses his immunity. No external reversal is needed; the deepening is the accumulation of borrowed feeling that can never be his.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges from tension between instrumentality and yearning: empathy as product vs. empathy as lived risk. The amber light itself becomes a running meter of this falsified warmth, darkening toward night as the illusion’s expiry is sealed. No character spells the thesis; instead the final “patient wait” crystallizes the dealer’s perpetual suspension between insight and felt life. The lingering static hum refuses moral symmetry—no redemption, only residue.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Voice carries a restrained lyric cadence—parallel anaphora, muted diction—that suits the dealer’s calculated distance. Syntax tightens under the dosing beat (“drop by drop”) then relaxes into reflective loops, mirroring the ritual’s tempo. No dialogue is required; interior monologue stays concrete, avoiding diagnostic labels. Register remains consistent—no sudden poetic inflation—so the final “quiet static” reads as earned poise, not ventriloquism.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet textured: “honeyed light pooling on stone” compresses color, temperature, and liquidity in five words. Metaphors stay coherent—static as both test and metaphor for blocked connection—no mixed physics. Occasional template cadence (“I watched… I noted… I touched…”) is minor and functional, keeping ritual rhythm. No scaffolding loops obscure causality; each sentence either advances dose or deepens residue.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Premise—illicit empathy distillation—feels fresh yet emotionally ancient, avoiding cyber-thriller cliché by grounding commerce in a grotto rather than neon alley. Static electricity as assay method is a specific, non-obvious twist that crystallizes the dealer’s alienation. Transformation test passes: swap setting or object and the entire emotional math collapses. Risk is moderate—lyric accumulation over plot reversals—but coherence justifies the choice.</comment>
