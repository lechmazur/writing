<comment>The poet’s insomnia and centuries-old longing are vivid, but her interiority floats in lyrical summary—“photosynthesize pain into beauty” recycles four times without a single moment where we see her body betray exhaustion or her hand shake while placing a pearl. Micro-choices are absent: the armistice blooms off-stage, merfolk “felt their rage soften” by unseen lullabies, so the turn rests on declarative enchantment rather than her visible, fallible agency. Internal contradiction is gestured (shy vs unstoppable) yet never staged; no scene shows her hesitate, then override fear at cost. The ending smile is earned only by accumulated refrain, not by a beat where she risks failure or forfeits sleep, keeping the change emotionally thin.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands cleanly as Conceptual Repricing: the seabed blossoms into a living treaty charged with “reef-shadow joy,” a visible social cost that reweights centuries of war. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each nightly verse layers density until the final image crystallizes meaning. However, the Orientation Test dings −0.3: “gargantuan shell that rose from the shoals like a fossilized moon” offers no anchor to depth, era, or scale until after line 120; the disorientation never pays off at closure, merely persists as decorative fog. Causality is lyric, not sequential, so the tightening is legitimate, but the price (her perpetual insomnia) is asserted, not dramatized in the final cadence, keeping the score sub-9.</comment>

<comment>The shell-cathedral is handled with tactile specificity: conch walls, spiral chambers, coral spears laid on the rim—objects repeatedly handled, constraining ritual space. Sensory triangulation is biased to the poet’s exhausted ear: “half-sung lullabies carried on an off-key wind” lets sound carry setting rather than static vistas. Spatial choreography stays coherent as merfolk circle the rim and tails paint light; no impossible geography. The reef itself evolves from scar to blossom, meeting the 9+ gate by charging the final image, though broader oceanic rules (currents, pressure, bioluminescence timing) remain lyrically vague, capping at 8.2.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—fragile peace—signals early via postcard prophecy and tightens each night as new verses are laid, meeting the single-deepening rule under Accumulative lens. Yet escalation is atmospheric, not tactical: no credible obstacle or backlash threatens the armistice; the lone “storm” mention stays hypothetical, so cost stays conceptual rather than felt on-page. The poet’s agency is diffuse—lullabies drift unseen—so the merfolk’s surrender reads as charming fait accompli rather than earned reversal with trade-off. Peace blooms beautifully, but pressure plateaus; without a live risk that forecloses an option, the tightening lacks visceral bite.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: sorrow transmuted into living petals, peace as photosynthesis rather than victory. The refrain “photosynthesize pain into beauty” risks proto-profundity, but the final image of blossoms rooted in battle-scarred sand gives it concrete body, satisfying the resonance test. Subtext operates in silences—absence of the lover, unsung words inside shells—avoiding explicit moral. The concept of reef-shadow joy (light shot through remembered grief) crystallizes a nuanced emotional hue that resists tidy takeaway, though fourfold repetition of the exact phrase edges toward thematic echo (−0.2), holding the score just below 9.</comment>

<comment>Voice sustains an incantatory cadence—long vowel currents, off-key wind as auditory signature—distinctive and stable within the poet’s exhausted, star-counting consciousness. Diction stays inside lyric poet lexicon: “nebulae,” “supernova remnants,” never drifts into academic gloss. Syntax mirrors narcotic sleeplessness with comma-bleeds and anaphora (“Across centuries of longing…”) that accelerate toward trance, then exhale in the final line. No dialogue to test, but the lullaby lyrics are integrated as ambient text, not quoted speech, keeping vocal purity intact; the slight risk of monotony is intentional, rewarded.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm is hypnotic, yet figurative density approaches purple in stretches (“fossilized moon,” “kelp in a calm tide,” “phosphorescence yet shaded”) without pattern-teaching variance; high-pressure beats (merfolk surrender) still drip metaphor, warranting −0.4. Several scaffold phrases repeat (“across centuries of longing,” “shyly unstoppable”) creating template cadence, another −0.3. Clause stacks occasionally obscure sequential action (“She sang of lost constellations, of love letters…”) but meaning remains retrievable. Closure line (“a quiet tide that never ceased to turn pain into beauty”) lands cleanly, preventing artifact from touching the final image, capping at 7.2.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Fusion of insomnia, shell-cathedral, and blossom armistice yields fresh mythic logic; the postcard-as-constellation ink is a specific, memorable object. Centuries-long serenade turning coral spears into petals feels non-obvious, risking but escaping preciousness through concrete reprise. The “off-key wind” as courier of peace is a charming acoustic invention that could only belong to this piece. Some DNA from “Little Mermaid” and familiar pacifist-poet trope keeps it shy of 8.8, but the synthesis is distinctive and emotionally coherent.</comment>
