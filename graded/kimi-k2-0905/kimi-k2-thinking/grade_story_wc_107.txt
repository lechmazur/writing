<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Marek’s interiority is rendered through embodied, glass-specific perception (“fire was the only thing that understood frost”) and contradictions acted in-scene: he both courts memory and builds vessels to contain it. The bookmark crack as “entrance” and the gauge flicker 42→43 dramatize a micro-choice with felt cost, earning the closure renunciation. No diagnostic self-talk; every beat is filtered through blower’s metabolism of heat/breath. Flaws—frozen grief, theatrical address to dead machinery—actively shape tactics and the final stance of leaving the bowl behind.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of thaw/leak/glass gather intensifies density toward the bowl as Charged Poise. Orientation anchored by concrete stair, kiln, forty-two-percent gauge within 120 words; no debt. Causality preserved by parallel material thaw in dam/bookmark/heart. Closure: bookmark floats, crack widens, gauge ticks—Conceptual Repricing with undeniable cost. Persistent constraint (dam still dying) shapes decision to abandon bowl rather than take it. No artifact dulls final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Control room as micro-setting: rusted panels, frozen gauge, Lena’s chair constrain every gather of glass; leaks dictate bowl’s fill. Body-as-setting: palm-crease leather parallels concrete crack, both bleeding. Final image—bookmark darkening in meltwater—charges the resonant reconfiguration. No exposition dumps; world rules (decommissioned dam still exudes hum) learned through touch.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: can Marek create a vessel that holds grief without shattering it? Escalation via accelerating thaw → new fracture → bowl scaled up, each step foreclosing retreat. Cost legible: crack widens, bookmark soaked, gauge moves—tangible price for “safe zone.” Agency remains his: he decides to leave bowl, not coincidence. One tightening suffices; pressure coherent under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete returns: thawing dam = thawing heart = widening bookmark crack; no abstract statement. Final image answers unasked questions by reweighting crack from flaw to entrance—earned, not preached. Ambiguity preserved: bowl remains, next thaw unknown. Emotional after-effect visceral: reader left holding wet bookmark, not lesson.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited adheres to Marek’s glassblower sensorium; perceptual signature in heat, silica memory, breath-through-pipe rhythm. Voice modulates: playful apostrophe to absent turbines undercuts grief without rupturing tone. No head-hop; distance stable. Diction stays within artisan lexicon; “gather,” “furnace,” “anneal” exact. Final sentence—gauge flicker—maintains restrained awe consistent with character.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Sentence rhythm breathes with kiln cycles; no template cadence. High information density: “cracked leather bookmark…creased like the palm of a hand that had worked too hard” does triple duty (object, body, grief). One mixed metaphor spotted—“valley’s collective heart” abstract but saved by immediate concrete follow-up. Zero paraphrase loops; no scaffolding. Minor overwriter in “dramatically narrate mundane tasks” line, but self-aware and voice-true.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: decommissioned hydro-dam as glass studio, bookmark as both page-holder and cardiac suture. Risk of theatrical apostrophe paid off by nesting it inside solitary ritual, turning potential gimmick into necessity. Conceptual integrity: every thaw drip literally feeds the bowl. Not wholly unprecedented, yet angle feels inevitable in hindsight; emotional specificity anchors novelty.</comment>
