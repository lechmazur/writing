<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—chastity inside a pleasure profession—powers every beat, but the “poetic body” label doubles as summary; we witness only one frisson of cost when her heart hammers under the lullaby’s pressure. Her final smile is earned, yet the absence of any visible consequence on her body or status keeps the cost abstract.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each thread she untangles layers density until the sanctuary shatters into a symphony of disobedience. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—windows fly open, compliance breaks—legible because the harvest of echoes is now loose in the city; cost is felt in the instant watchman’s whistle becomes question rather than warning.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Frozen air as prism, silver courtyard, snowflakes as “forgotten syllables” supply tactile micro-setting that constrains her silent dance and later catches fractured starlight in the closure image. Spatial choreography stays clean; only the courtyard’s exact social geography (where windows are, who sleeps) stays vague, a forgivable ellipsis at this length.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—liberate the city’s silenced voices—tightens through each thread she pulls; the lullaby’s counter-pressure rises as her heart hammers, making the cost visceral. One meaningful deepening: the moment “alarming serenity” flips to open windows; options narrow for the regime, widen for the people.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of art-as-insurrection emerges without sermon: the courtesan’s forbidden chastity and kinetic poetry embody resistance; the closing gift—“The sanctuary is yours now”—lets citizens complete the arc, dodging tidy moral. Subtextual tension between performance and authenticity threads every image of snowflake versus prism.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lush, cadenced third-person lyric stays stable; perceptual signature is Elara’s synesthetic ear for “spaces between notes.” Metaphors are stacked yet patterned (snow = syllables, starlight = prism) so density reads as taught design, not clutter; no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>High poetic density skirts overwriting because the prism metaphor is seeded early and paid off in shatter; still, two adjacent “alarming serenity” reprises feel looped. Sentence rhythm breathes with her dance, but occasional stacked modifiers (“crystalline walls beneath the ice”) slow propulsion a beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: courtesan-as-virgin, lullaby-as-tyranny, dance-as-key—each trope inverted through sensory specificity. Risk in near-purple lyricism is justified because cadence itself becomes the insurgent code. No derivative echoes; the harvest-of-echoes concept feels inevitable yet new.</comment>
