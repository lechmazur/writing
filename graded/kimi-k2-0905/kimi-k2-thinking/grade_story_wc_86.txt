<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kael’s interiority is concrete—the drawer pull as memory-totem, the whispered self-promise—yet his “uncommonly thoughtful” trait is asserted more than dramatized; no contradictory impulse surfaces under pressure. Micro-choices (offering the brass, untethering the rope) are present but cost is collective rather than personal, softening the arc. Still, occupation and ritual role feel lived-in, and the final renunciation carries quiet weight.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The moon-phase protocol teaches a tight causal gate: causeway appears only at gibbous zenith, so every beat waits on that clock. Closure is a Charged Poise: the causeway opens, prisoners walk, Kael pockets the now-weightless pull—futurity reconfigured with intangible but legible cost. One scaffold phrase (“the space between apology and forgiveness”) recycles twice; otherwise causality is clean.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Storm-worn parapet, wind-polished stone, moon-lit mist—details are filtered through Kael’s ritual-attuned eye and constrain movement (narrow ledge, slick surface). The drawer pull serves as micro-setting: handled twice, it alters gesture and meaning. No orientation drift; geography stays coherent within the single parapet stage. Final image of thickening mist recharges the furrowed hush without overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake: prevent war by flawless exchange; moon-clock tightens the window to one irreversible moment. Escalation is situational—waiting, not battling—but pressure crests when the rope hisses free and the first footstep hits the causeway; misstep could still ignite reprisal. Cost is communal/ritual rather than personal, slightly softening intensity, yet the final hush registers the narrowing of options.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through recycled objects and rituals: drawer pull, frayed rope, moon cycle—mistakes transmuted into protocol. No moral is stated; the final image of mist re-swallowing the parapet reprices trust as fragile and perpetual. Subtextual gestures (brass exchange, rope hand-off) carry the apology/forgiveness tension without articulating it. The raven cry swallowed by wind offers a quiet conceptual after-shock.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Kael’s sensory filter; diction is restrained, slightly archaic without pastiche (“gibbons moon,” “furrowed hush”). Rhythm mirrors tide and wind—long sentence, short beat, caesura of mist. Dialogue is minimal, indirect, voice-true. No head-hop, no register drift; even the single epithet “silvery scythe” feels like Kael’s thought, not author flourish.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Sentence craft is lean and propulsive; only two near-echoes (“the space between...”) and one stock pairing (“bitter past / wiser future”) intrude. Metaphors are spare and consistent—moon as scythe, mist as furrowed hush—without stacking. Information density high: one line often delivers atmosphere, bodily cue, and ritual rule. Final paragraph cadence slows to match the tide’s turn, earning the resonant close.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Fantasy trope of ritual exchange is refreshed by negotiator-as-custodian of objects rather than hero of blades. Moon-phase causeway and drawer-pull totem feel specific to this world, not generic. The “recycle mistakes into wisdom” motive risks aphorism but is saved by concrete protocol and the frayed rope’s visible history. Risk is moderate—quiet stakes, lyric tilt—yet coherence and restraint make the remix memorable.</comment>
