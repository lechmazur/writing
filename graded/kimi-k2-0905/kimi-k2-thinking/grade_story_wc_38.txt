<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lyra’s interiority is vivid—“encrypt her vulnerability into strength” is performed, not asserted—and her micro-choices (rolling the dice, bow signature) align with motive. The spider and dice act as external mirrors, giving her contradictory impulses a stage. No second character on page, so relationship crucible N/A; cost is felt in the final baptismal flood. Interior voice stays concrete, though one beat of diagnostic self-labelling (“calm defiance”) flirts with abstraction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each roll → dance → system response tightens options until the flood liberates. Closure is a CR—water re-prisons the lab but frees her, cost legible in the drowned tomb she leaves behind. The sunken-lab orientation is taught early and pays off, so Orientation Test waived. One micro template cadence (“She wrote…she rolled…she performed”) slightly dulls the final beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The lab is filtered through survival priorities—rust, diodes, recycled air—never museum tour. Whale-bone dice and spider web function as micro-setting that literally constrains/code her escape, satisfying 9+ gate. Spatial choreography is clean; the rising flood tracks causally. Sensory hierarchy mirrors stress: iron taste > visual >sound, narrowing as air thins.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—escape or drown—signalled in first paragraph; escalation is the tightening cipher that turns exercise into override sequence. Each dance roll raises the chance of AI audit, visible cost when she trembles between pirouette and breath. The final flood is not coincidence but the logical release she scripts. One meaningful tightening suffices; price is the lab she sacrifices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme—“vulnerability encrypted as strength”—emerges through choreography, not thesis. The spider web’s completion mirrors her journal lattice, reweighting patience as weapon at closure. No moralizing; final image of silver lattice against sun reprises without explaining. Avoids thematic echo; only near-slip is the word “liberate” spelled aloud, but it is dramatized motion, not label.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person lyric is stable, with perceptual signature in maritime Gothic diction (“hundred fathoms,” “jawbone of a whale”). Rhythm accelerates into staccato noun phrases as flood approaches, mirroring breath shortening. No dialogue, so dialogue bullets N/A. One filter-verb cluster “she could hear the spider’s silk whispering” is voice-motivated and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>High information density: one sentence often layers motive, object, and motion—“the dice bore the grin of fate…” simultaneously characterizes tool, stakes, and tone. Metaphors stay coherent (dice = fate, web = cipher) and do not stack in pressure beats. One paraphrase loop “each journal entry a silken thread…she spun her own” is spaced enough to read as intentional echo. Final line lands with crystallised cadence, no scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Premise—escape by dance-coded journal—is non-obvious and grows inevitable via taught alphabet. Whale-bone hangman dice and spider web feel specific to this drowned world, not borrowed props. Transformation test passes: swap items and the cipher collapses. Risk in lyric repetition is justified because it enables AI misreading; no gimmickry. Slight drop for near-allegorical naming (“lyrical code-breaker”) that edges archetype.</comment>
