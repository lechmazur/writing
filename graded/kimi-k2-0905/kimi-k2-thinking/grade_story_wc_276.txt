<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Avery’s calm fisher-of-echoes persona is vivid and embodied; her micro-choice to voice silence and then release the echo shows a believable hierarchy of values. Interiority stays concrete, but the repeated “cool-headed” label edges toward diagnostic shorthand and the absence of any contradictory impulse in the climax keeps her just short of 8-band complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the withdrawn spike and settling echo reconfigure Avery’s stance with felt cost (“some catches become offerings”). Accumulative lens holds—pattern of transliteration, zigzag, silence—culminates in the final cadence shift. One transition, single scene, orientation anchored by line 3; no causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The garden’s frequency-soil, color-blooming waves, and violet weeping roots are sensuously specific and directly constrain Avery’s zigzag path and silence-bait. Rail spike as micro-setting charges the final image; environment never stalls momentum. Early celestial disorientation is taught and pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—catch vs. release the goddess’s echo—is signaled early and tightens when the spike’s heat forces the choice to withdraw. Escalation is textural: density of transliterated grief, color, and vibration increases until the refusal costs Avery her divine contact. Visible price—she carries residual grief home—satisfies the band guardrail.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme of witness-without-possession emerges organically from Avery’s final silence and release; no moralizing statement intrudes. The sleepwalking constellations and feral lullaby reweight the premise without abstract exposition. Resonant ambiguity lingers—“some things are caught only to be released”—earned through prior particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Avery’s perceptual bias; diction (“moon-cooled iron,” “feral and tender”) is character-specific and rhythmically controlled. No head-hopping or register drift. Purposeful compression (“voicing silence”) is pattern-taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and syntax; information density is high without scaffold. Figurative chain (“honey and grief,” “smoke made of midnight and milk”) is sustained but coherent, never muddling causality. One paraphrase loop (“transliterated her resolve… transliterated her purpose”) lightly dulls propulsion; does not touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Premise—fishing for a goddess’s echo in a sound-wave garden during constellation quakes—is non-obvious and fully committed to. Tropes of celestial myth and iron talisman are transformed through Avery’s sensory transliteration ritual. Risky lyric accumulation pays off in the charged final image; specifics are irreplaceable.</comment>
