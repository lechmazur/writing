<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Mira’s interior contradiction—love of carnival chaos vs corporate safety—stays concrete through tactile micro-choices (pocketed stone, paint-slick fingers). The final flicker of child-recognition crystallizes her renunciation with visible cost, though earlier “dual allegiance” is stated more than dramatized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Causal linkage holds: each mural is a because/therefore response to privatization pressure; closure lands as Earned Stasis—she pockets the stone, foreclosing open surrender. Orientation is clean within 120 words; only mild causality wobble is the off-stage “corporation’s deadline” that never materializes as an on-page threat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Setting is filtered through Mira’s body and tools—turpentine sting, rain-softened planks—so the raft-carnival constrains every paint stroke. The stone chip functions as micro-setting that charges the final image; without it the closing beat loses its grit and memory-claim.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Stakes tighten from vague “community must adapt” to the concrete timetable encoded in the clock-mural; one meaningful escalation occurs when rain partially erases the code, forcing faster child-to-child relay. Cost is felt (Mira’s soaked vigil), yet the corporation remains an abstract menace rather than an on-page obstacle.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through the reframed graffiti—art as living archive versus commodity spectacle. Final phoenix-mural reweights the stone chip from nostalgia to insurgent map, achieving Conceptual Repricing without moralizing. Subtext would sharpen if corporate POV or collateral damage appeared even briefly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Voice is lush yet controlled, carnival argot fused with corporate buzz in Mira’s perception (“slick suits walked the midway”). Rhythm modulates: long breathless sentences during painting, clipped fragments under storm. No head-hopping; perceptual signature stays anchored to Mira’s paint-smudged intuition.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Strong density—sentences double-duty worldbuilding via sensory verbs (“lights dancing on blackwater”). Occasional overwrought stacked metaphors (“liquid sky”, “fireflies”) slightly dilute peak beats; one mixed metaphor “bed of chipped stone” blurs physical logic. No loops or scaffold, momentum sustained.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Floating carnival-as-refuge and graffiti-as-covert-infrastructure feel fresh, not stock dystopia. Transformation test passes: story hinges on specific raft geography and paint chemistry. Risk in lyric elision is earned—closure image of phoenix-map synthesized from prior cipher-feathers, not borrowed trope.</comment>
