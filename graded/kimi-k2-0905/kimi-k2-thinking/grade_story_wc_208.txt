<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Mara’s quiet, tactile obsession with driftwood grain and salt-language is concrete and idiosyncratic; her decision to carve the single curved line under the archway visibly costs her prior detachment and fuses her to the lineage. Interior contradiction is light—no moment where her “perpetually learning” trait actually blocks or endangers the quest—so the arc feels more discovered than struggled-into. Still, the embodied chisel cut and the warmth of the slide against ribs keep the change credibly physical and earned.</comment>

<comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: each sensory layering (turbine-hum, salt-black stone, lantern projection) tightens the same stake—find the pattern that includes her—until the final carved token reconfigures her identity. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the archway glows, the lineage becomes legible, and the cost is the irrevocable insertion of her token into the stone niche. No orientation debt; who/where/when are anchored by line 40. Causality is thematic-cumulative rather than plot-reversal, appropriate to lyric design.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Coastal turbines, barnacled rocks, and salt-black archway stones are filtered through sculptor’s haptic bias; every detail is touched or carved. The lantern slide and driftwood chip literally become micro-setting that constrain the final act—she can’t leave until the token is fitted. Weather and turbine-hum modulate from backdrop to chorus, charging the closing image. Spatial choreography is clean: climb, pocket-pull, niche-fit track without drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“Will she locate herself inside the lineage before the storm erases the archway?”—is signaled early and deepens via each layer revealed by lantern light. Escalation is textural: each carved signature under the projected light adds filial weight until refusal to leave becomes the only possible stance. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral: she forfeits outsider freedom and accepts custodial guardianship. A tighter physical risk or an explicit limitation (injury, time sprint) would have pushed higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as custodial continuity versus solitary artistry; no explicit thesis stated. The spiral/line motif reweights from mere ornament to covenant marker in the final image. Subtext of “listening to material you did not shape” reverberates in turbine-hum and ancestral slide. Resonant reconfiguration lands when her carved token fits the void—meaning made without words.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person POV remains tight to Mara’s perceptual filter; no head-hop. Sentence rhythm sculpts itself like woodgrain—long saline clauses interrupted by chipped fragments (“a breath, a wave, a turbine blade”). Diction stays within sculptor’s sensory lexicon; no academic register drift. Compression (“timewoven alliances” as spidery label) is taught early and paid off at projection beat.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud cadence is deliberate and wave-like; no template stems. Figurative layering is dense yet each metaphor drives either atmosphere or emotional stakes—“turbine-hum reverie” fuses mechanical and ancestral. No mixed metaphors or paraphrase loops. Final line tucks the slide away with rhythmic closure matching opening image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fusion of GPS failure with magic-lantern navigation feels fresh; lineage-as-layered stone etchings is non-obvious. Risk of lyric-cumulative structure heightens rather than obscures meaning. Could edge higher if the storm deadline had bitten physically; as is, originality is in the haptic genealogy concept rather than plot surprise.</comment>
