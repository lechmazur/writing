<comment>Elara’s “perpetually surprised” trait is cited but never complicates her choices; it reads as a label. The interiority stays lyrical (“feeling was a kind of sharpness”) rather than showing contradictory impulses in the moment she slots the chip. No micro-choice is charged by surprise; the emotional arc is smooth, not flawed. The ending’s “hum of belonging” is felt, but the cost is abstract rather than foreclosed by prior causality.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands cleanly as a Conceptual Repricing: the decoded frequency reframes “belonging” rather than delivering coordinates. The causal chain from drone glyph → orrery sequence → chip release is tight, but the pilgrim’s off-page exit remains an unmotivated hole. Lens is Causal; the final image reweights stakes without contradiction. Cost is conceptual, not visibly paid by Elara on the page, so 9+ is barred.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Limestone drinking light, brass gears frozen mid-calculation, copper air—details are selective and POV-tinted. The observatory’s star-slotted pinions constrain the exact sequence of pulls, integrating setting into action. Micro-setting (matrix slot, orrery shadow) directly shapes the climax. Dusk’s “brilliant dimness” mirrors the tonal closure, charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“decode the frequency of belonging”—is signaled early and tightens once when the waveform turns out to be emotional, not cartographic. The seven-pinion sequence is a single meaningful narrowing of options under Causal lens. No visible price is exacted from Elara; the cost is conceptual, not visceral. Escalation is present but modest; one deepening suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges obliquely: belonging as a waveform one feels, not a location. The “brilliant dimness” motif reweights from visual paradox to epistemic limit at closure, avoiding overt statement. No moralizing summary; resonance is left humming. Slight abstraction keeps it from 9-band.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Elara’s perceptual filter—rotor hum, star-glyph flicker, copper air. Syntax lengthens and contracts with action beats; no head-hopping. Diction (“star-maps remained mute,” “typeface no one could fully read”) is crisp, consistent, and character-tilted. Slight poetic cadence risks template repetition but stays controlled.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>High information density: single sentences layer sensor readout, emotional flicker, and mythic time. No synonym loops or filter-verb stacks; metaphors stay coherent (“orrery’s shadow loomed like a spider’s web”). Final third keeps clarity; no artifact touches closure. Rhythm modulates naturally; paragraph cuts are purposeful.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Freshest angle: star-maps as emotional typeface, belonging as a literal frequency. Ancient observatory + drone tech feels organic, not grafted. “Brilliant dimness” as both visual and epistemic trope is memorable. Concept is specific enough that swapping “matrix chip” for generic key would break the climax; still, premise orbit is familiar (ruins, lost tech, pilgrim), keeping it just shy of 9.</comment>
