<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is gorgeously particular (“screaming tenderness held behind her teeth”), and the jasmine-cork as emotional Rosetta stone gives her a tactile, embodied motive. Marcus remains slightly schematic—the bark-then-tender arc is credible but leans on the lighthouse magic rather than on milked contradictions in his own gestures. Their final micro-choice—his trembling hand, her quiet “tomorrow”—earns the eleven-month standoff with visible cost. Still, the relationship crucible forces a stance shift, so the arc satisfies.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the cobalt lens filters Elara’s intent into a whisper Marcus finally hears, re-weighting their entire dynamic with undeniable cost—“teach me how to listen” spoken in a voice cracked from disuse. Causal linkage is tight: cork → lens → vibration → Marcus’s chest-level recognition, each beat because/therefore. No orientation debt; lighthouse, dawn, and profession are anchored within 50 words. The lighthouse’s dual function (guide ships + filter hope) is taught early and pays off in the final image, satisfying the persistent-constraint test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Cobalt glass that sings when struck, walls still warm after the heat wave, salt air replacing fever—selective sensory triangulation makes the lighthouse itself a character. Micro-setting rule satisfied: the lens is the tool that constrains Elara’s only viable tactic (non-verbal transmission). Spatial choreography is flawless—stairs, cottage, lantern room tracked without drift. Weather shift from thunderclap to copper-lit waves mirrors internal thaw without overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can silence speak louder than shouting?—is signaled in paragraph one and tightened once: the lens-cork experiment forecloses Elara’s earlier passive endurance, risking final refusal from Marcus. Cost is legible: she hazards permanent relational fracture if her “whisper” fails. Escalation is incremental under Accumulative lens: heat retreats → cork memory → lens filter → shared vibration → wordless touch. No coincidence; pressure grows through her single decisive gambit.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: communication as vibration, not volume. Jasmine-scent memory and lighthouse glass reweight each other so the final whispered “tomorrow” feels like a conceptual repricing of every prior shout. No moralizing; resonance is bottled in the cork’s empty circle and the cracked bell sky. The piece invites reflection on what carries intention when words fail—an ambiguity that lingers cleanly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Perceptual signature is laser-specific: Elara reads “shoulder tightening” and “knuckle whitening” as Morse code; Marcus hears silence “through his chest.” Rhythm flexes from long fever-sentence to staccato dawn clauses, mirroring heat break. No head-hop; single POV holds. Compression like “the scream of his tenderness” is patterned early and paid off when he actually whispers. Diction stays within keeper lexicon—no Latinate drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud ear test passes: sentence openings vary, paragraph lengths breathe with escalations. Information density high—one sentence often performs setting, metaphor, and motive (“cobalt lighthouse stood breathing cool salt air, its blue stone walls still warm…”). No paraphrase loops; “vibration” recurs with accruing meaning, not synonym churn. One mixed metaphor—“sky like a cracked bell”—but it is taught at opener and pays off in final bell-like ringing of intent, so coherence holds.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Fresh inflection: lighthouse as emotional alembic rather than mere beacon. Jasmine cork repurposed from sentimental prop to communication device transforms trope of keepsake. Risk of lyrical obscurity is taken but paid off in legible closure. Synthesis feels inevitable—keeper lore + scent science + acoustic metaphor—without drifting into magic-for-convenience. Not quite 9+ because premise could belong to another coastal setting with minor retrofit, but specificity of cobalt glass singing anchors it close.</comment>
