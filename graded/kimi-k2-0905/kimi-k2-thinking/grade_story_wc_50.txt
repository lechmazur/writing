<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The locksmith’s interiority is concrete—his peripheral attention is dramatized through the tuning-fork trials and quartz-lens grinding, not labeled. His contradictory twin drives—preserve every echo vs. let time breathe—collide in the decisive choice to redesign for release, not storage; the cost (surrender of hoarded wonder) is visible in the final image of angled light that “smiled from the periphery.” Flaw: the 17-year backstory is summary-only and could have compressed into a present-tense micro-choice to tighten causality.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the timer becomes a key that unlocks the cavern’s own breathing; the cost is the abandonment of the hoarding paradigm he served 17 years. Causal chain holds: overload of dying-moment echoes → shatter → reverse-engineer release lens → final click that reweights meaning. Orientation clean by line 4; no lens ambiguity. Single micro-turn at “six degrees off-center” crystallizes options before the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Marble veins as “secret rivers,” condensation-sweating limestone bench, and quartz lenses ground to refract rather than absorb are tactile, choice-driving specifics. Environment literally channels both sound and time; the six-/twelve-/eighteen-degree angle map turns geography into tactical grid. Final image of “angled light that now danced across his workbench” recharges every prior surface description with new function. Micro-setting (mercury pendulum frozen mid-swing) doubles as prop and temporal barometer, constraining his redesign.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore echo harvest—tightens into its opposite: surrender the harvest to let moments breathe. Pressure escalates through iterative angle tests that reveal overload, forcing redesign; visible cost is the locksmith’s acceptance of perpetual sharing (loss of exclusive custody). Last click forecloses the hoarding path under Accumulative/Textural lens. Could edge higher if one intermediate beat showed tangible resource spent (bloody fingertip from quartz grinding, etc.).</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: memory kept alive by sharing, not ownership. Subtext in the shift from “store wonder in the cellar of reason” to “wonder was stored…in the angled light” reframes cellar as open architecture. No moralizing; final repricing lands via image. The wounded-season conceit links ecological and emotional scars, inviting reflection on how collective trauma must be vented, not entombed.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person lyric distance stays locked to the locksmith’s perceptual bias—every acoustic notice is oblique, never straight-on. Syntax mirrors tinkering precision: clause-stacked descriptions of angles and frequencies. Vocabulary (“chronomantic,” “refract rather than absorb”) stays within artisanal lexis. No head-hop; interior access limited to what a peripherally focused craftsman would articulate mid-task.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>High information density: one sentence can braid condensation, marble grain, and acoustic memory. Rhythm breathes with scene—long clauses for lull, staccato fragments for tuning-fork strikes. No loops or scaffold; metaphors consistently optical/acoustic. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image. Minor density slip: “store wonder in the cellar of reason” appears twice; second use could have been cut to let the image alone reprise.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fusion of horology, acoustics, and marble geology feels non-obvious yet inevitable. Concept of harvesting dying moments because season itself is wounded reframes climate grief through timepiece magic. Risk of abstraction defeated by tactile lens-grinding and angle mapping. The inversion—timer becomes key to release, not lock—delivers fresh reconfiguration that retroactively justifies every prior gear metaphor.</comment>
