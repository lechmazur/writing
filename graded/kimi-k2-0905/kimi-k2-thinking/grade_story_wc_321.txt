<comment>Lina’s resilient positivity is embodied in her steady hands and radio-voiced resolve, but the interior contradiction never sharpens into a visible cost; she remains affectively flat across beats. The final smile feels unearned because no micro-choice shows her battling despair or paying a palpable price for hope. Micro-choices (tracing spirals, pressing transmit) are present yet mechanically described, not filtered through a distinctive perceptual signature. Captain Roedskal’s nod is the only status shift, but it is too brief to function as crucible.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the ferry’s triple-existence snap solidifies timelines with the hourglass-fulcrum image, cost felt in the “permanence settling on her shoulders.” Causality holds under Hybrid lens—radio pulses → grotto response → hull flicker—though the merge rule is taught rather than foreshadowed. Orientation is clear by 120 words (who: Lina, where: Tidemark deck, when: seventh-tide night). The sideways clock motif pays off at closure, waiving disorientation penalty.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>The ferry console, damp rail, and hollow grotto walls are tactile anchors that constrain radio-range and cable-length; starlight threads pool in hull hollows, charging the final image. Spatial choreography stays coherent across the deck-wheelhouse-grotto axis. Sensory hierarchy narrows to sound (engine clank, radio hum) and touch (warm glass) under pressure, avoiding tourist catalog. Micro-setting objects—hourglass, radio, console—function as environment, steering tactical choices.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—anchor the ferry between timelines—signals early; one meaningful tightening occurs when the glass warms and the hull flickers, narrowing options to final pulse. Agency is continuous: Lina’s burst transmissions drive each escalation; coincidence is absent. Cost is visible but abstract (“timelines tug at her edges”); no concrete forfeiture (fatigue, injury, social loss) grounds the price. Escalation coheres under Hybrid lens; the radio-hum/grotto harmony is legible, yet stakes never pierce the body.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Theme—permanence-in-transience—emerges through the empty hourglass glowing with starlight, not exposition. Motif recurrence (sideways clock, vanishing, starlight threads) reweights meaning at closure when the ferry “solidified with a sigh.” Subtext resides in silence: Captain’s nod and empty hourglass speak of time exhausted. Final whispered radio pattern offers non-literal resonance, avoiding moralizing, though the insight remains slightly abstract.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Third-person close stays locked to Lina with perceptual signature—“sideways spin of the wheelhouse clock,” “radio’s pulse that matched the sway of the grotto’s walls.” Syntax mirrors her cadence: fragments under pressure (“Tidemark to all echoes…”) compress urgency. No dialogue contamination; Captain’s mutter is distinct slang. Filter verbs minimal; free indirect style clean. Rhythm accelerates with burst transmissions, breathing only after the snap.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Sentence variety strong; openings rotate from participial to noun-verb without drumbeat. Metaphors stay coherent—“starlight pooling like silver”—and do not tangle physics. One paraphrase loop: “resiliently positive” echoed four times; no synonym churn elsewhere. No scaffold or brand lists; high information density in radio-code description. Final image line is crisp, propelling closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Vanishing-ferry-between-times is fresh, yet echoes Ghost Ship trope; inversion of empty hourglass as fulcrum for timelessness adds non-obvious inflection. Specificity—“sideways clock,” “spectral grotto under starlight”—grounds universals. Conceptual integrity holds: no late rule changes, timelines merge via earned pattern. Risk in lyric mosaic pays off; could tip higher with tangible cost.</comment>
