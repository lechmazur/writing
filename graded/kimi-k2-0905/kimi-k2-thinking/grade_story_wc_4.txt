<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The archivist’s interiority is lyrically sketched yet remains consistent: her calm is shown through the ritual of placing photographs, not asserted. Still, she never faces a true contradiction or micro-choice that threatens that calm; the “cost” of perpetual archiving is implied rather than dramatized. Because the town’s gradual contribution happens off-stage, we don’t see her stance actually crystallize or erode under pressure. Earned endurance is asserted in the coda, but the absence of a visible, scene-level trade-off keeps her just below the 9-band threshold.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the “one last photograph” completes a living circle, reweighting the entire field as a forever-unfolding rite. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern (photo arcs = lavender rows) taught early, cadence deepens with each returning season, and the final image crystallizes the unfinishable nature of collective healing. Cost is conceptual yet undeniable—the archivist and town are condemned to perpetual, iterative remembering. No orientation debt; space-time anchors (widow, child, stone altar) are refreshed every ~100 words, keeping the drift legible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The lavender–ruins pairing is more than backdrop: the wind-carved altar stone is literally shaped by entropy, forcing the archivist’s low table for photographs and determining the arc’s physical curvature. Micro-setting doubles as tool: the map-case whispers against her hip, its worn fabric a metronome for measured steps; its final river-stone smoothness is the tactile cost of decades. Light angle re-enters as causal trigger (“afternoons when the sun... she would linger longest”), directly governing when ritual intensity peaks. Factory-as-cathedral evolution from rust to perfume is the closure image, making environment indispensable to meaning.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—can grief be converted into shared beauty?—is signaled in line one and tightens through communal accretion rather than single reversal. Agency is distributed: archivist initiates pattern, townspeople add fragments, but no single on-page beat forces a trade-off that forecloses a path for her. Cost is cumulative and conceptual (infinite responsibility, case worn smooth) rather than a visible sacrifice in scene; this suits the Accumulative lens yet keeps escalation gentle. One meaningful cadence shift occurs when the child’s daisy becomes the seed for her future return, but the beat is summarized, not dramatized.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically from iterative image: photo arcs mirror lavender rows, making the healing process botanical—perennial, not terminal. Subtext lives in silence: the smell of copper machinery ghost-laughs during lunch breaks, letting grief stay sensory and unsummarized. Final line offers resonant non-moral: rearranging wounds into patterns of beauty—never stated earlier, only enacted. Avoids sentimentality by keeping loss raw (calloused hand still reaching) while simultaneously blooming.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric maintains mythic distance yet preserves perceptual signature: archivist notices “silver nitrate” not “black ink,” revealing archival training. Sentence rhythm lengthens during lingering, contracts at mention of machines humming again, echoing breath control. No dialogue, so voice contamination is impossible; prose carries subtext alone. Free-indirect folds seamlessly—“she could almost hear...”—without filtration clutter.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Varied sentence openers, natural paragraph shapes, and high information density—each sentence layers time strata (“pressed flowers of forgotten birthdays” packs scent, emotion, calendar). Figurative language is pattern-taught (arcs = sentences in a language) and paid off; no mixed metaphors. Minor paraphrase loop: “perceptively calm” reused thrice; each instance carries new contextual weight so penalty is hairline. Closure beat is uncluttered, crystallizing spiral of moments without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Freshens the familiar “artist heals town” trope by replacing paint with photographs arranged like lavender rows, turning factory entropy into living loom. Specific detail—dove gray case, copper smell, daisy offered by child—anchors concept in tactile reality. Conceptual risk: healing is unfinishable; story embraces infinite process rather than tidy catharsis, a stance rarer than closure-by-statue. Synthesis feels inevitable yet not derivative; no direct echoes of canon.</comment>
