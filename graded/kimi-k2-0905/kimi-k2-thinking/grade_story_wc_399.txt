<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The interior contradiction—walker feels urgency yet never doubts—is only asserted, not dramatized; “strangely honest” mask and “peripheral awareness” stay abstract labels, never modulating her micro-choices under pressure. No visible cost or renunciation is shown; the consecration succeeds cleanly, so the arc is smooth but flat. The lone character exemption is met, yet the absence of embodied tension keeps her below high-band credibility.</question>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the consecration locks the parapet, the echo is housed, and the pavilion’s hymn gives a Conceptual Repricing (the desert’s fabric is re-weighted). Lens is Accumulative/Textural—repetition of “whisper,” “echo,” “sand” tightens mood rather than causal chain; one meaningful cadence shift at the end satisfies short-form requirement. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no penalty.</question>

<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Body-as-setting (half-mask), kinetic parapet, and pavilion fabric each constrain action: mask channels intent, parapet must be ritually pinned, pavilion voices guide tempo. Sensory hierarchy stays tight—sound > sight > touch—mirroring walker’s peripheral perception. Scale stays micro, but specificity is high; no world-rule inconsistency.</question>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Stakes—loss of wisdom—are declared repeatedly but never threatened in scene; nothing jeopardizes the ritual, so tension is atmospheric, not tactical. One meaningful tightening occurs when sand parts, yet it feels inevitable, not oppositional. Cost is conceptual (future burden of guardianship) rather than felt on-page; qualifies as Accumulative deepening but not high-band pressure.</question>

<question>5</question><grade>7.0</question><comment>Theme—transmission versus ownership of wisdom—emerges through image pattern (echo, thread, hymn) rather than exposition. Final image of “thread in the fabric of the world” offers resonant reconfiguration without moralizing. Ambiguity is preserved: next prophet may unravel or re-weave. Subtext stays implicit; no thematic echo penalty.</question>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</question><comment>Third-person lyric voice sustains a hushed, incantatory cadence that matches whisperfield calm; diction (“ley lines,” “kinetic parapet”) stays within walker’s mystic lexicon. No dialogue, so no convergence risk. Perceptual signature—peripheral, half-masked, murmuring—remains consistent and differentiated from prophet’s off-stage voice. Compression (“she drew that thread into herself”) is purposeful, taught early, paid off at close.</question>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies between long breathy units and short ritual fragments, supporting ceremony tempo. Occasional soft loops—“whisperfield calm” repeated three times in closing paragraph—hover near paraphrase but serve accumulative design, so minor deduction only. Metaphors (sand breathing syllables, pavilion fabric breathing) stay coherent. No scaffold artifacts in closure beat; clarity intact.</question>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Fusing ley-line cartography with animate desert architecture feels fresh; “kinetic parapet” as moving stone choir is a memorable coinage. Whisper-field as acoustic archive re-energizes familiar trope of hidden wisdom. Conceptual risk—lyric over causal—pays off in resonance but caps ceiling because plot remains predictable. Specificity of ritual (circle, lattice, thread) prevents generic feel.</question>
