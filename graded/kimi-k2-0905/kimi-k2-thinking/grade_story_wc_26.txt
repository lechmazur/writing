<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Interiority leans poetic rather than embodied; “luminous regret” is named more than felt. The stone-as-catalyst choice is credible, but the emotional cost is filtered through lyric summary, not live contradiction. Enough micro-choices (pressing the stone into the screen, pocket now empty) anchor the arc, yet the peak beat cites feeling rather than dramatizes it.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the transformed shadow becomes guardian veil, cost felt in her emptied pocket and “luminous regret.” Causal chain—stone’s path traced across footage, then physically pressed—holds. Orientation is swift; library/cloud anchors arrive by line 4. One minor causality gap: why decades-old footage reacts to stone is asserted, not seeded, but the lyric logic carries the moment.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Blooming glass-and-steel flower-library is tactile: petals “unfurling each evening,” shelves glowing faintly after the metamorphosis. Cloud-carpet below, amber dusk, and the archive room’s monitor light form a coherent vertical world. Setting constrains action—only at this dusk edge can she perform the binding—and charges the final image of glowing shelves.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—hope’s decay vs. preservation—is signaled early and tightens once: shadow’s bold reach forces her to risk the stone. Agency is attention-and-act: comparing footage, then pressing stone into image. Cost is legible—stone gone, weight of regret assumed. No external antagonist needed; shadow’s feeding on hope supplies coherent pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through image pattern: shadow shifts from threat to guardian, implying every preservation demands forfeiture. No moralizing line explains this; the final veil-image reweights earlier footage comparisons. Ambiguity is purposeful—readers must decide whether the trade was worth it—anchored in concrete particulars (emptied pocket, glowing shelves).</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Voice is lyric-accumulative, taught in the first sentence: “sharp-eyed dusk noticer.” Metaphor density stays high but rhythm stays deliberate, not algorithmic; sentence lengths swell then contract with dusk deepening. Perceptual signature—attention to slippage of light, weight of stone—remains consistent. No dialogue to test, so no register clash.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is textured yet tight; no synonym loops or template cadences. Opening line anchors voice and concept in one breath. Occasional elevated diction (“metamorphose,” “conceptual repricing”) fits the mythic register. One mixed vehicle: “edges fraying like old film” beside “feeding on hope” is allowable in lyric mode without muddle.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Shareable-dream world floats a flower-library that harvests dusk light; the unbound shadow as hope-eater feels fresh. River-stone-as-bind combines earth-memory with digital archive, a synthesis not seen in standard templates. Risky lyric compression is chosen over explanatory exposition and pays off in final image. Specificity keeps premise from drifting into abstract nowhere.</comment>
