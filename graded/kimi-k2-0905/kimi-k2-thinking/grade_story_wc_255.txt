<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elara’s “innocently cunning” trait is shown, not told, when she lures Dorian with the plant-music demo; the internal contradiction plays on stage. The color-blind painter filter sharpens every perceptual beat—she “feels” warmth instead of seeing red, a consistent bias that later charges the final image. Dorian’s stoic-glassblower persona never cracks into back-story dumps; his shift to embracing flaw is legible solely through the molten droplet he places in her palm. Cost is present but soft—no irretrievable loss—so the arc stops just short of 8+ “visible price” gate.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens: pattern of mirrored spirals—ashes, plant spiral, grey canvas—builds toward the final rainbow flash that reweights “imperfection” as beauty. Closure is a Charged Poise: the two stand before their flawed creations, options re-cast, cost felt in the shared hush. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land by line 3; no penalty. One micro-turn: the trade offer itself; no second decisive change, fitting the 600-word default.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Courtyard operates as micro-setting: furnace heat, steam veil, and droplet in palm constrain every beat. Jasmine-fern-ivy array is not backdrop; leaf curl encodes the “note” that seals the bargain. Glass tools—blowpipe, molten orb—are handled, not catalogued. Final rainbow refraction off the droplet recharges the grey-stones image, meeting 9+ gate for object-charged closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“find beauty in imperfection”—is signaled in paragraph 4 and tightened when Elara barters awakening for fire. One meaningful escalation: the plant harmonic demo that forces Dorian’s stance shift; no second reversal, acceptable at this length. Cost is conceptual (shared embrace of flaw) rather than visceral, keeping score sub-8.8. Pressure stays coherent under accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves the turn.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from spiral pattern: ash → plant → canvas → glass, each a frozen breath of imperfection. No character articulates the thesis; the final image of twisted vase beside grey canvas is the silent argument. Subtext lives in plant movement: vines “listen,” implying art can be collaborative rather than authored. Resists moralizing; leaves reader with charged ambiguity about whether imperfection is enough.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person lyric voice sustains metallic, glass, and vegetal diction without drifting into workshop poeticism. Syntax lengthens during plant-music beat to mimic curling vines, then clipped for droplet exchange—rhythmic control under pressure. No dialogue, so voice distinction clause is waived. Perceptual signature—Elara’s grey-silver filter—never leaks into Dorian’s interior, keeping POV stable.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentence lengths contract around furnace action, expand during plant spiral. Figurative density high but patterned: “frozen breath of memory,” “frozen breath of imperfection”—echo is taught early and paid off. No mixed metaphors; glass droplet as rainbow prism stays physically coherent. One paraphrase loop: “molten glass droplet” repeated within three lines; minor, does not touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: color-blind painter + glassblower + plant-music code + bartered awakening compresses four risks that cohere without gimmickry. Phoenix ashes reappear only as temporal marker, avoiding over-tidy symbolism. Conceptual risk—grey palette as triumph—lands because prior beats train the reader to value texture over hue. Feels inevitable in hindsight, earning the +0.3 risk bonus within band.</comment>
