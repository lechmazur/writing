<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara’s inventor-enthusiast streak feels vivid in her tactile seed-planting and mirror-puzzle sketching, yet the “notably receptive” tag is asserted more than dramatized. Interiority stays concrete but never cracks under contradiction; she’s serene from arrival to exit, so no visible flaw complicates her resolve. The closure vow is internally consistent yet costs her nothing we see—no lost time, money, relationship, or risk—so renunciation lacks bite.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds: each lyrical return of “orthogonal”/“storm-born silence” thickens texture rather than causality, and the final Charged Poise (moonlit sprout) reweights innovation as sacred duty. Spatial/temporal anchors arrive by line 3, satisfying orientation. Closure cost is felt conceptually but not as lived price, keeping score sub-9.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Brook-side micro-setting is filtered through Mara's puzzle-designer eye—water sound as “auditory trigger,” moonlight as mirror-prop—so environment constrains her inventing and charges the sprout image at close. Selective sensory triage (smell future, touch soil, hear water) mirrors professional priorities. Spatial choreography stays clean in a single kneel-and-rise move; no geography drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“safeguard space for innovation”—is declared early but stays abstract; no external antagonist or ticking clock narrows options. Pressure escalates only lyrically via repeated “hush” and “storm-born silence,” an accumulative intensification that reweights ambiance, not tactical risk. Cost is conceptual (patience required) rather than dramatized loss, keeping tension moderate.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of nurturing strangeness emerges organically from corpse-flower biology and escape-room ethos; no character sermonizes it. Final sprout image reconfigures patience as creative weapon, offering quiet conceptual repricing without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers: is the bloom gift or trap?—inviting reflection beyond plot.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Mara; perceptual signature filters every detail through puzzle-designer diction—“orthogonal,” “multi-sensory trigger,” “labyrinth.” Rhythm modulates: longer clauses for ideation, staccato fragments (“A single line.”) for punch. No head-hop or register drift; lyric repetition is pattern-taught early and paid off in last-line cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Sentence variance and information density are high; most lines twin-job (advance + image). Occasional soft repeats—“storm-born silence,” “orthogonal avenues”—serve accumulative pattern, not loops. No mixed metaphors or scaffold clauses. A single paraphrase loop (“safeguard this space for innovation” vs. “safeguard the space for innovation”) is minor.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Fusing corpse-flower horticulture with escape-room ideation yields fresh angle on “innovation through decay.” Lyric accumulative structure is non-template, risking quiet ending that still lands via Charged Poise. Specificity of scent-based puzzle design keeps concept from drifting into generic “artist receives muse” trope.</comment>
