<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Kai’s barefoot, stargazer-turned-signal-finder identity is vivid and embodied; her micro-choice to press palms to stone and sing a lullaby crystallizes her hierarchy of values. Interiority stays concrete, avoiding label-speak, and the contradiction between observatory loss and newfound ground-level “sight” is held in scene. The flaw driving the action—her need to find meaning rather than fight—stays active and costs her solitude, turning into broadcast vulnerability. No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible waived; barefoot tactility and opera-glass talisman function as intimate “other.”</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the port-wide song reweights silence into weaponized sound, cost felt in her exposed solitude. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of hum-beacon-song builds density until the final cadence shift. Orientation is anchored by word 50; no ambiguity. Because the stone circle’s resonance is introduced as pre-colonial constant rather than new rule, no late-rule break; persistent constraint (the hum) shapes every tactical move. Accumulation cap does not apply—only one minor loop (“bare feet” twice in 30 words) does not touch closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Micro-setting triumvirate—bare soles on metal grating, brass opera glasses, solar beacon—constrains every move and charges the final image. Spatial choreography is flawless: bay → observation deck → pad seven → stone circle, each distance tracked via footfall and focal-length. Selective sensory hierarchy favors vibration and sound over visuals, aligning with POV’s astronomer-trained attention to frequency. Environment directly supplies the tactical resource (acoustic amplification) that makes the ending possible, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</question><grade><comment>Dominant stake—“can silence be broken?”—is signaled in paragraph two and deepens through hum-beacon-song accumulation. One meaningful tightening: when loudspeaker hijacks her lullaby, options narrow to public exposure versus retreat; she stays, paying with loss of anonymity. Cost is legible on page: “her bare feet humming” implies irreversible fusion with the stone’s frequency. No reversal, but accruing pressure under Accumulative lens suffices; escalation is protagonist-driven (she sings, she stays).</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges from frequency-as-resistance: ancient hum + child’s lullaby = nonviolent rupture of occupation silence. No thematic echo; no character states “this is how we fight.” Final image reweights opera glasses from star-vision to ground-vision, re-pricing meaning from sky to bedrock. Ambiguity lingers—will song spark revolt or mere pause—yet emotional after-effect is concrete: reader left listening for after-hum.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Kai; perceptual signature is frequency-biased, not visual—opera glasses used to “read” hum, not sky. Syntax lengthens under serenity, shortens under sonic surge, mirroring breath. No dialogue, so voice distinction bullet waived. Brass-cool / calloused-palm diction remains inside stargazer lexicon; no register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is lyric yet propulsive; metaphor vehicles (rose/amber suns, thunderous serenity) stay coherent to sound-and-light physics. No mixed metaphors; redundancy limited to two “bare feet” within 30 words (−0.1). Information density high: one sentence = sensory cue + emotional register + plot advance. Rhythm modulates with sonic crescendo without algorithmic pattern. Closure line clean, image-driven, no scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: insurgent lullaby + archaeo-acoustic stone circle inside spaceport wreckage. Trope of “rebel broadcast” is re-rooted in pre-colonial geology and child’s song, removing militarized cliché. Risky lyric accumulation pays off—hum not weaponized tech but ancestral resonance. Specificity of opera glasses repurposed for ground-level pattern recognition makes transformation tangible. If relocated to any other planet or war, the hum-beacon-song triad collapses—proof of inseparability.</comment>
