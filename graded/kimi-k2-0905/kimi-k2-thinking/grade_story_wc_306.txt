<question>1</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The narrator’s “conscience-for-hire” premise is stated, not dramatized: no client payment, no ethical dilemma, no moment where the shard or chimes force a choice that costs them. Interiority drifts into lyrical self-label (“protected vulnerability,” “sincerely insincere”) without on-page contradiction or stakes. The cloak slips off as a symbolic gesture, not a tactic with price. What keeps the score afloat is the embodied sensory attention (ash on coat, salt wind) and the micro-choice to unhook the lantern; still, the character remains an atmospheric observer rather than an agent whose flaws compound.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly as Charged Poise: the shard’s spectrum reweights the rule-set, making certainty impossible, and the cost is felt in the narrator’s loosened cloak and open-ended promise. Causality under an Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each chime, smoke wisp, and colour band thickens the texture until the final prism crystallizes meaning. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (lighthouse, dawn, rocky path). Keeper’s voice drifts down without prior spatial cue, a minor teleport, but the effect is lyrical, not causal-breaking. Persistent constraint—the shard’s void—shapes the final image, satisfying the 9+ cost test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The lighthouse, wind chimes, and salt air are used as tactile tools, not postcard backdrop: the chimes’ discord literally blocks entry until the lantern is unhooked, and the breezy dawn carries the keeper’s spoken key. Shard-as-micro-setting constrains perception; its empty centre is handled twice, charging the final spectrum. Spatial choreography holds across the spiral ascent. Sensory hierarchy narrows to wind, light, and smoke, matching the reflective tempo. Environment directly shapes the tactic of loosening the cloak, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—trading black-and-white judgment for nuance—is signalled early and deepened through each chime clash and spectrum flare. Escalation is textural: density of colour and wind increases until the void fills with possibility, foreclosing absolute answers. Agency is present but mild: unhooking lantern and cloak are symbolic, not tactical trade-offs with visible price. The tightening is felt more as atmospheric charge than option-narrowing; a sharper cost (lost client fee, broken shard) would push higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the shifting shard image: emptiness refracts into spectrum, asserting that truth is plural. No explicit moral is stated; the keeper’s line is a riddle, not a thesis. Subtext lives in gesture—cloak loosening, chime silence—rather than exposition. The final smile and open promise invite plural readings without confusion. The only abstraction risk is “protected vulnerability,” but it is grounded in the cloak’s physical loosening, averting pseudo-profundity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>First-person voice is stable, lyric, and perceptually specific: “wisp of smoke to curl,” “bruised horizon.” Syntax lengthens under reflection, shortens during ascent, matching breath. No dialogue, so voice convergence is N/A. Diction stays within the narrator’s contemplative register; occasional elevated Latinate choices (“reverie,” “spectrum”) feel intentional to the philosophical tilt. Compression in campfire-to-lighthouse transition is taught by the reflective cadence and pays off in the final prism.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is rhythmically alive: varied sentence openings, paragraph breath, and metaphor that stays physically coherent (“light split into a spectrum that painted the walls”). No scaffold loops or synonym churn. Information density is high; each sentence layers image, atmosphere, and concept. One strained metaphor—“lighthouse light a pale eye blinking”—is permissible. Closure image is crystal-clear. A single filter-verb cluster (“I realized that…”) is minor and does not dull immediacy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Premise fuses fantasy vocation (“conscience for hire”) with lyric philosophic quest; the synthesis feels fresh, not checklist. Wind-chime language system is particular and non-obvious. Hollow mirror shard refracted into spectrum offers a reconfiguration that grows inevitable in hindsight. Risk in abstract vocabulary is balanced by concrete sensory grounding. The piece avoids generic lighthouse gothic or moralistic fable, landing in a singular atmospheric stance.</comment>
