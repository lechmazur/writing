<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The archivist’s interiority is consistently concrete—“her reactively visionary mind already sensing how absences could be navigated like treacherous reefs”—and her micro-choice to blow the valve is the hinge that earns the navigator’s tears and her own quiet closure. Contradictory impulses (curator vs. cartographer of silence) coexist in the same beats, and the renunciation of sound in the final note carries visible cost: she accepts perpetual exile from full sonic rescue. No stock therapy-speak; even “hearten” is enacted as physical demonstration, not label. Single-POV baseline met; no relationship crucible needed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the final pure silence reweights exile from wound to composition, cost legible in the navigator’s departure with “a transcript of his silences.” Causal lens holds—because she blows the staggered intervals, therefore the silences map harbors and the navigator weeps. Pattern of staggered intervals is taught by word 200 and pays off in the seventh sounding. No orientation debt; anchors clear by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The ivory stones after rain serve as micro-setting that literally alter light and metaphorically become blank pages awaiting inscription—this constrains the archivist’s next act of writing. Salt-crusted velvet case, brine-scented hands, and mist-writing droplets are tactile, lived-in details that evolve with action. Spatial choreography clean: valve handed over, carried to archive, placed in case. Sensory hierarchy obeys her professional filter—smell of brine first, sight of stones last.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—compile fragments into meaning—signaled in paragraph 1 and tightens when each interval forecloses another possible harbor. Escalation is causal: every sounding narrows the navigator’s untold story until the seventh interval leaves only silence as the irrecoverable remainder. Cost is felt: the navigator weeps, the archivist accepts an endless task. No coincidence; pressure is coherent under the causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: absence as compositional negative space. Subtext lives in gesture—she “plays” silence the way a musician plays rests. Final image of spray writing “first draft across her skin” offers non-literal answer: meaning is iterative, never fixed. No moralizing; complexity intact—silence remains both wound and bridge.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is precise—“salt-stained repositories,” “bottled starlight”—and rhythm modulates from long liquid sentences to the clipped final “She placed the valve in a case.” No head-hopping; single POV stable. Free indirect style clean: “her reactively visionary mind already sensing…” No filter-verb stacks; diction stays within archivist’s lexicon. Dialogue absent by design; voice coherence maintained.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Read-aloud ear test passes: cadence mirrors tide—long swells, then abrupt breakers. Information density high—“the ivory stones of the harbor, washed by the recent rain, gleamed like blank pages awaiting inscription” does world, metaphor, and emotional state in one stroke. Zero loops or scaffold. Metaphors stay coherent (reef, map, inscription). Minor template echo—“then a…then a…then a…” in market cries is purposeful list, not artifact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Premise—archivist who collects ocean spray to map silence—is non-obvious and inseparable from setting. Transformation test fails if relocated: the harbor’s name, salt, mist, and trumpet valve are specific to this geography. Risk-taking in structure—staggered intervals as plot—pays off in closure. No close echoes; voice syntheses feel fresh yet inevitable.</comment>
