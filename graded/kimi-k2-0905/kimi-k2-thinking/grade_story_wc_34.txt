<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The balladeer’s desire to “give melody to the phantom’s ache” is stated repeatedly but never crystallizes into a concrete, costly choice; her interiority drifts in lyrical summary rather than showing contradictory impulses under pressure. The scribe’s sudden adoption of the same mission feels imported rather than earned. No visible flaw or blind-spot complicates either woman; their actions trace a smooth arc of beneficent artistry. Because the closing vanishing is more image than trade-off, the required “earned stasis” is only gently present, keeping the score south of 6.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Ambient lyricism substitutes for causal linkage: the courtyard, bolt plate, and ghost code keep re-appearing in lush sentences, but the “because/therefore” spine is loose—beats advance by atmospheric drift more than by tightening choice. Closure offers luminous uplift yet no on-page price or path foreclosed; the mist simply dissolves, satisfying the Resonant Reconfiguration form but at low personal cost. Orientation is clear early; transitions are smooth, satisfying Track A. The lens is Accumulative/Textural and holds, yet the lack of a decisive, irreversible turn caps the score below 7.5.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Setting is the story’s chief glory: the cloud-borne courtyard, glyphs blooming in stone, and the singing rivets create an airy, tactile dreamscape that constantly steers attention. Sensory selection stays biased to the balladeer’s wind-listening ear, integrating detail into motion (“each swirl a verse, each bolt plate a chorus”). Spatial choreography is clean; no geography drifts. While the environment doesn’t constrain final tactics, it supplies the charged image that lifts the ending, meeting the 9+ gate for charging the final image and thus anchoring the high-7 band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—giving voice to the ghost’s mute ache—is declared early and restated often, but pressure escalates only by poetic intensification (mist thickens, glyphs flare) rather than by narrowing options or demanded sacrifice. No credible loss (time, safety, identity) is risked or paid; consequently the “tightening” remains ornamental. Agency is present—stamping, singing—but never faces a trade-off that forecloses a path. Under an Accumulative lens, the cadence shift is lovely yet cost-free, capping the score just below 6.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: encoded memory as communal balm, art as trans-generational voice. Subtext resides in the gradual shift from solitary balladeer to communal choir, shown through duplicated action rather than thesis. The ending withholds moral statement, offering instead a luminous drift of freed code—an image that re-weights prior glyphs with hope. Complexity is modest; the lack of a contested or risky thematic angle keeps the score solidly above 6 but below 8.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Third-person lyric voice sustains a consistent, wind-attentive perceptual signature; diction stays spare and musical, avoiding purple overload. POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Compression and elision (“driftingly alert”) are taught early and paid off in the floating closure. Dialogue is absent by design; prose rhythm modulates from lull to crescendo without drum-beat monotony. Voice distinction is high for a single-focalizer piece, meriting low-8 territory.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Lines achieve musical density without clogging momentum; metaphor chains (“ghost in code,” “tinkersong wonder”) recur deliberately, forming a taught pattern rather than accidental clutter. Occasional near-paraphrase pairs (“between lightning and thunder, when the air held its breath”) slightly dilute propulsion, but no loop or scaffold stalls the climax. Opening and closing images are strong and complementary. Minor overwriting nicks the score, yet the overall read-aloud ear is above 7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Fusing graffiti activism with sky-garden surrealism and a sonic-ghost premise yields a fresh synthesis; the concept feels inevitable in hindsight yet not derivative. Recurrent “encoded roses” and singing rivets supply an original icon set that could not be swapped without collapsing the texture. Risk is taken with near-pure lyric escalation, and it largely pays off in a coherent closure. Hence a low-8 score nudges into the 8.5+ band for successful risk.</comment>
