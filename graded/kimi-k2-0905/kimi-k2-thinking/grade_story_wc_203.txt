<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Marlon’s quiet obsession with “what ceilings hide” is anchored early and paid off when he pockets a mainspring barrel—an earned, tactile cost. His observational gift is dramatized through dust-pattern reading that discovers the hidden barrels, not merely asserted. The final refusal to take all the barrels shows a credible, understated renunciation. Interiority stays concrete, though the ghosts’ backstory is somewhat spoon-fed rather than discovered through friction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the pocketed barrel and the cracks re-weight Marlon’s life-long quest, making “bearing witness” the new, weightless burden. Causality is sound: dust pattern → barrel → ghosts speak → ceiling cracks → decision to leave most behind. The single-scene orientation is clear by line 6; no disorientation penalty. One subtle causality gap: why the ghosts solidify only on touch is implied, not dramatized, but does not rupture the lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The circus ticket office is rendered through selective sensory triage—dust choreography, burnt-caramel scent, sagging ceiling—each detail filtered by Marlon’s technician gaze. Space stays coherent: counter groans under his weight, tiles push up, distance to façade tracked from inside to moonlit exit. The mainspring barrels function as micro-setting that constrains the final choice. No environment-forced tactic beyond the climb, so capped at 8.0 for 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</question><comment>Dominant stake—“discover what ceilings hide”—is signaled in paragraph 4 and tightens when the ringmaster’s gesture forces the ceiling tile lift, narrowing options to take or leave the barrels. The tightening carries visible cost: Marlon shoulders the “weightless burden” of testimony, foreclosing his former purely technical stance. Pressure stays accumulative/textural: dust density, ghost solidity, barrel hum layer toward the final image. One credible loss—leaving most barrels—alters his moral inventory.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</question><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: unpaid labor frozen in clockwork, capitalism’s silenced mechanisms. The ghosts’ testimony avoids moralizing; the final image of cracked façade breathing secrets reweights the premise without a stated thesis. Subtext operates in gesture—ringmaster’s upward finger, Marlon’s pocketed single barrel. The weightless burden motif accrues ironic density: literal brass becomes existential load. Complexity is honored; owners remain faceless, no redemption offered.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</question><comment>Third-person limited adheres to Marlon’s technician perceptual signature—every sense filtered through pulleys, cables, dust calculus. Syntax stays precise, rhythmic, never drifts into canned lyricism. No dialogue, hence no voice convergence issue. Filter verbs (“he noticed,” “he understood”) are sparse and motivated by analytical profession; no immediacy loss. Final paragraph’s cadenced repetition of “weightless burden” reads as deliberate incantation, not template cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</question><comment>Prose is lean, high-density; figurative language is selective (“dust itself became a language,” “spring wound tight beneath his ribs”). No mixed metaphors or register drift. One paraphrase loop: “weightless burden” appears three times in closing paragraph—within tolerance because it recharges thematic coil. Rhythm modulates—long sentences for accumulation, clipped fragments for ghost arrivals—propelling rather than stalling momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</question><comment>Fusion of elevator tech, ghost testimony, and horological contraband feels fresh; each element constraints the next. The “clock springs as unpaid wages” twist is non-obvious yet inevitable once revealed. Dust-pattern forensics repurposes a mundane skill into spectral archaeology. Risk—using ghosts—is justified because their silence forces Marlon’s interpretive agency. No close echo of famous circus ghost scenes; specificity of brass barrels and ceiling cracks distinguishes the piece.</comment>
