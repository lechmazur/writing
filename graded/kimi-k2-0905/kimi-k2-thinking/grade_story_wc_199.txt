<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Lira’s quiet, ritualized diligence feels lived-in; her micro-choices (silver needle prod, spiral stacking, dust sprinkling) trace a credible arc from dutiful sorter to prophetic midwife. Interiority stays concrete—“heart quickens,” “fingers leave moonlight”—and the final smile carries visible cost after every seed is rewritten. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene, so the internal conflict beat is soft, capping above 8.0.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The accumulative/textural lens is declared in sentence one (“perpetual twilight”) and held: each seed, leaf, and dust grain thickens pattern until the final “chorus of forgotten voices” reweights the world. Closure is a Charged Poise: Lira stands amid beacons, rain of silver leaves reconfiguring folklore itself—cost is the irreversible substitution of memory for ash. No orientation debt; geography stays legible across the climb.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>“Ashen skyborne arbor” is never catalogued; instead we taste dust, feel root-hollow silk, see moonlight smear on bark. The arbor’s spiral root geometry is re-used as seed-stack blueprint, so setting literally shapes the final gesture. Micro-setting triumph: moonstone needle and petrified-leaf cairns constrain every tactile move. Environment passes the 9+ quick test by charging the closing image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“decode before the next hush”—is signaled early; pressure tightens when dust forces a new leaf-type that must be read. One meaningful cadence shift: melody-map redirects climb to First Seed, foreclosing the option to wait. Cost is felt—the arbor’s prior silence is overwritten by unasked voices—but price is more conceptual than visceral, keeping score just inside the 8-band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the iterative seed–leaf–monument triad: memory must be planted, not archived, for life to regenerate. No explicit thesis; final image of silver-leaf rain lets reader feel the cycle without moral. Subtext in “mossy delight” reframes decay as fertile joy—an earned, non-literal answer. Complexity is present but not contested, so ceiling stays mid-8.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Lyric-accumulative voice sustains ash-soft cadence, sentence length waxing like moonlight. Diction—“petrified leaves,” “mossy delight”—is narrator-specific and never drifts into catalog prose. Patterned repetition (“emerges transformed always”) is taught early, paid off at each seed-split. No dialogue, so voice purity remains unbroken under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm breathes with the hush; paragraph breaks mirror seed-spiral pacing. Figurative layers are dense but coherent—moonstone dust as “heartbeat of the sky” stays within physical logic. One paraphrase loop (“emerges transformed always” ×2) is forgiven as motif-teaching. No artifact touches the closing cascade, keeping 9-band in sight.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fusing arbor-orchards with memory-lore seed-sorting feels fresh; moonstone dust as both tool and nutrient is a non-obvious synthesis. Risk—the recursive “transformed always” hook—pays off by making transformation the story’s engine rather than ornament. Concept commits fully; no retreat to generic pastoral. Missing a second elevating twist to push into 9+.</comment>
