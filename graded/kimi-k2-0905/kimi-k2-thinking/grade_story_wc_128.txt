<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lena’s “whimsically attentive” eye supplies concrete micro-choices (loose bolt, smudged manifest) that seed the plot, and her resolve to uplift silent contributors drives every beat; the final friendship and ceremony feel earned, though her interiority occasionally drifts toward tidy summary rather than simultaneous contradiction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The causal chain is clean: misrouted envelope → locket discovery → investigation → Caleb found → joint ceremony; the library/star setting anchors each pivot, and closure lands with Resonant Reconfiguration as Lena pockets the returned locket, now a talisman of perpetual compassion cycles—cost felt in her admitted inability to predict returns.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Cliffside glass-and-iron library, salt-laden gusts through tall windows, and the locket’s silver weight are selectively re-used to constrain choices (open-air meeting neutral ground, lantern-lit terrace); micro-setting beats entwine with emotional pressure, charging the final starlit image without tourist sprawl.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—giving harbor heroes visible gratitude—tightens through each mini-campaign beat; the single meaningful turn is the ceremony itself that forecloses anonymity for the night watchman; cost is present but diffuse (time/social credit) rather than viscerally individuated, keeping it just below the 8.8 band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>“Silent contributor” motif emerges organically from dockworker particulars; theme crystallizes when Caleb’s returned locket reframes quiet labor as the port’s true heartbeat, avoiding explicit sermon yet inviting reader reflection on unseen worth—mildly undercut by closing line’s overt “melody of kindness.”</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Third-limited coastal-broker diction stays specific to manifests, manifests, “bill of lading,” with rhythmic uplift in lantern paragraphs; no head-hopping, steady psychic distance, perceptual signature sharp (“cobbled promenade,” “salty night air”)—only minor template cadence in “cycles of compassion” refrain.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High information density—each sentence advances discovery or atmosphere; clean grammar, varied paragraph breath, figurative control except one soft mixed metaphor “wave of gratitude that echoed cycles”; no synonym loops, no scaffold, strong propulsive cadence up to and including final line.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Familiar “lost heirloom reunites strangers” frame is refreshed through maritime cargo-broker lens and collective honor ritual; specifics of punch-card archives, night-shift foremen, and harbor Heart awards make the world particular; closing constellation/locket reprise feels inevitable yet not derivative—lacks a truly bold structural risk that would push higher.</comment>
