<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The sentinel’s gentle ache and wish to “bridge” strangers are stated rather than dramatized; no contradictory impulse is tested. The single micro-choice—burying the vial—arrives late and carries no visible cost, so the arc feels observational, not crucible-forged.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory echoes and parallel-hunting build density toward the sealed letter. Closure is a Charged Poise: the lamp-lit letter on the table reweights the vineyard’s mismatched rows as a communal offering. Cost is conceptual—his solitude is now purposeful—yet the moment is quiet; hence high-7s, not 8+.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Amber pavilion, fermenting-grapes air, and lantern shadows recur, charging the final lamp-lit table. The pavilion’s warmth literally steers his decision to leave the letter there, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial track stays clean; only the “distant hum” risks phantom bus but reads as memory, not orientation break.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can the vineyard reconcile mismatched hearts?—is clear, but pressure plateaus after letter burial; no new narrowing or price. Escalation is textural (repetition of parallels) rather than tactical; consequence is conceptual, not felt, capping entry below 7.0.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: mismatched vines model acceptance of fractured love. Final image of the letter left for “any future wanderer” reframes solitude as hospitality—an earned, non-moralizing insight. No echo-chamber abstractions, but reliance on reiterated vineyard metaphors keeps it just shy of 8+.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lyrical, consistent third-person intimate; perceptual signature filters every detail through vineyard-tending sensibility. No dialogue to stress-test voice; prose stays within lexicon. Occasional template cadence (“He wrote of… He sealed… He tucked…”) slightly flattens rhythm, preventing 8+.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Strong sensory density, but stacked harvest/wine metaphors in nearly every sentence create minor overwriting. “Perhaps we were never meant to be, but the memory of you lingers like the scent of late harvest wine” is evocative yet joins a long queue of scent images, dulling peak beat. Otherwise clean grammar and coherent spatial flow.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Vineyard-as-microcosm for star-crossed love is familiar, yet the sentinel’s act of writing to unknown wanderers freshes the trope. Specific viticultural details (trellis shade, graft incompatibility) ground the metaphor. Risk is moderate; final vial burial feels inevitable, not surprising, keeping score mid-7s.</comment>
