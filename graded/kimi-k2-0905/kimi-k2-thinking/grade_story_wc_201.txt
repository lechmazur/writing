<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elena’s interior contradiction—wanting to solve mercy while refusing absolution—stays active in every beat; the pewter strap anchors her micro-choices and the final refusal carries visible cost. Proprioceptive enhancements directly shape her gait and memory retrieval without sliding into clinical exposition. No secondary characters appear, so relationship crucible is N/A. The only drag is a faint therapeutic tinge to “mathematics of mercy” self-labelling near the end, blunting rawness a notch.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each UV pulse and strap touch thickens the pattern until the final reweighting—“mercy was not to be calculated, but to be lived”—lands as Resonant Reconfiguration with conceptual cost. Orientation is taught by word 30; disorientation serves the payoff. No causal gaps; every return of violet fire or proprioceptive surge adds density rather than outline sequences. Closure beat carries undeniable price: she forecloses absolution and embraces open-ended survival math.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>UV forest, moss underfoot, and pewter strap form a micro-setting trilogy that actively constrains each step and memory trigger; the strap’s texture alters grip pressure in the climax. Sensory hierarchy skews to haptic & proprioceptive, matching Elena’s augmented nerves. No exposition dumps; world rules learned through sting of light and ozone. Final image—“light wrapping like a shroud”—recharges setting back to body with conceptual cost, clearing 9-bar.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will she bow to ultraviolet penance or forge her own mercy equation—is signaled in first paragraph and tightens through each UV pulse that threatens to overwrite her data set with guilt. Proprioceptive spikes act as escalating price tags, forcing micro-steadying moves that foreclose retreat. No antagonist on stage, but situational pressure keeps mounting until the final refusal crystallizes stance. Cost is visible: burnt forearm, strap imprint, perpetual vigilance she must now carry.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges entirely through pattern: numbers recalled under duress become variables, UV light becomes the harsh constant, strap equals witness. No explicit thesis until the final line, and even that is an earned image rather than sermon. Mercy reframed from religious constant to lived differential equation is a fresh conceptual repricing. The refusal of tidy moral is built into the open-ended walk, letting ambiguity linger without drift.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Lyric-compressed third-person stays tightly bound to Elena’s sensory filters; proprioceptive exactitude creates a rhythmic signature (“millisecond before her knees buckled”). Patterned elision (“they had burned her with questions”) is taught early and paid off. No dialogue, so voice purity remains intact. Diction stays within plausible survivor lexicon until “mathematics of mercy”—a slight register lift, but context justifies it as her self-coined term.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm alternates between clipped proprioceptive readings and longer, UV-saturated clauses, propelling without drumbeat. Figurative language is selective—“violet fire,” “shroud”—and never clusters into purple. Minor scaffold: “she braced again” repeats three times; the echo is purposeful cadence but still noticeable. No mixed metaphors, no filter-verb stacks; high information density achieved through noun-verb torque.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: enhanced proprioception + interrogation math + UV penance forest fuses thriller tech, survivor lyric, and conceptual sci-fi in under 800 words. The mercy-as-variable thesis feels non-obvious yet inevitable after the pattern of recalled numbers. No trope tourism; every image is tethered to Elena’s nerves. Risk in abstract stakes pays off because body-anchored detail keeps urgency visceral.</comment>
