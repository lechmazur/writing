<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The custodian’s interior contradiction—retrocognitive gift vs lifelong incomprehension—drives her climb, but the moment she “understood now” is summarized, not embodied; the final smile feels un-earned because no micro-choice on the tower shows her paying visible cost for that knowledge.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the beacon’s silent light reweights coincidence into pattern; cost is felt in the three approaching strangers whose arrival forecloses her solitude. Causal chain holds under Accumulative/Textural lens—each shard, star path, and gust is a taught pattern that converges in the prism array.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>The glass humming pavilion functions as micro-setting: its panes vibrate at frequencies that alter her heartbeat, guiding the final alignment; star-paint constellations on the ceiling are tactile anchors whose faded silver constrains her finger-tracing choices. Spatial choreography stays clean from base to summit.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—prove pattern inside chaos—tightens when the shard’s silence must be positioned at Navigator’s apex; failure would keep the wasteland dark. One meaningful deepening occurs as retrocognitive fragments accumulate into the single second of original flaw; price is the irrevocable exposure of her tower to unknown travelers.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through the prism’s fracture → repair arc: “every broken thing contains its own precise geometry of repair.” The final image of reciprocal beacon-answers reweights the word coincidence without moralizing, delivering a resonant non-literal answer to the thematic question.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Voice carries a sustained lyric cadence that modulates with altitude—“thistle-blown hope” compresses to “a low thrum that matched her heartbeat.” Perceptual signature is custodian-specific: she notices star-paint erosion, shard hush, wind frequency. Compression like “discordant shards that hummed against the silence” teaches the texture early and pays off at the silent-light climax.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Rhythm varies: long anaphoric runs (“the same star alignment…”) give way to clipped final clauses. Metaphors stay physically coherent—light as ash, silence as geometry. Minor scaffold: two adjacent “she saw / she traced” openers loop without new pressure; the density of figuratives in the beacon-firing beat is high but pattern-taught, so clarity survives.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of retrocognition + crystal acoustics + star navigation feels inevitable yet fresh; no genre template matches “shard of hush.” Risk in lyric accumulation pays off when silence literally becomes light, a conceptual repricing that would collapse if any element were swapped. Specificity anchors the fantastical in custodian finger-tracings and wind-frequency physics.</comment>
