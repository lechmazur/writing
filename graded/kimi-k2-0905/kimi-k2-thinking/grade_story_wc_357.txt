<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Kael’s interiority is sensory and pilot-specific (“glider’s wings catching invisible currents”), her motivation cleanly rooted in family survival. The broken arrow’s pulsing warmth gives embodied, emblem-level contradiction to her stoic posture. Micro-choices—releasing glider controls, touching the scarred seed—expose a hierarchy of values under pressure. The final renunciation (stop fighting die-off) is earned by prior causal trial and carries visible orchard-wide cost, satisfying the 9+ test.</comment>

<comment>Causal chain holds: satellite warning → launch → water-flow navigation → seed contact → renunciation. Orientation is anchored by word 50; gravity-rule is taught early and repaid at closure when the same inversion ends with “soft sigh.” The single tightening inside the arch narrows options—release controls or fall out—creating felt cost. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: resilience re-priced as growth through dying, not around it; the price is the family’s forever-changed pruning practice.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Floating arches, twin suns, and reverse-flow irrigation ribbons are filtered through pilot priorities; every detail either guides navigation or mirrors internal stakes. The 20-degree temperature drop at the arch threshold is a micro-setting beat that constrains the final choice to drift. Spatial choreography tracks glider, water, and seed cyclone cleanly. Environment literally re-weights the meaning of “up” and “down,” charging the final image; thus meets 9+ gate.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—orchard survival—signaled in paragraph 2. Escalation is driven by Kael’s agency: she chooses to release controls inside the arch, trading aerial mastery for epistemic access; this tightens options irreversibly. Cost is legible: the family must now cultivate disease, not fight it—an on-page tactical forfeiture. Under causal lens, one meaningful turn suffices; the inversion hour acts as persistent constraint that shapes every tactical decision.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from particulates—scarred seed, braided rivers, repaired arrow—never from thesis statements. Final image of “grow backward into roots while reaching forward” offers resonant non-literal answer to resilience question. No moralizing; ambiguity remains: orchards may still die, but now with different meaning. Subtext in whirling silence and broken-then-whole arrow reweights failure as generative, satisfying 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person hovers at pilot-distance yet retains perceptual signature—attention to wind, water, and tool feedback. Prose rhythm modulates: long gliding sentences for ascent, staccato fragments inside cold arch (“Here was the attribute…”). No head-hopping; focalization stays locked to Kael. Non-standard gravity grammar (“world began to fall upward”) is taught early and echoed at closure, keeping voice coherence intact.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>High density: “irrigation streams detached…became silver ribbons” does world, motion, and metaphor in one stroke. No synonym loops; each metaphor is singular and physically consistent. Sentence openings vary; paragraph cuts are purposeful. Final line achieves charged poise without overwriting. Minor filter verb (“she felt”) appears once but is justified as tactile epiphany; does not dull momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Gravity inversion + floating stone arches + orchard colony is a fresh synthesis; the botanic-genetic memory twist is non-obvious. Premise is followed to conceptual limit without retreat. Risk-taking (lyric drift-release as climax) heightens meaning without clarity loss. Specific detail—sap-sealed arrow, spiral glyphs—prevents abstract anywhere-ness, meeting transformation test.</comment>
