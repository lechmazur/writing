<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The prophet’s interior contradiction—yearning to fix time while doomed to forget—anchors every beat; the chalk snap and spiral are embodied costs. Yet the “precognitive forgetfulness” is asserted more than dramatized in choice; we never feel him lose a future he almost had. Still, the final smile at “absurdity” is a credible micro-shift that forecloses further pursuit. Enough for a quiet arc, but not the full pressure of flaw-driven mistakes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the snapped chalk and remaining spiral reconfigure the stake—he can’t keep the echo, only let it go. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each driftwood marker, tape, and chalk line thickens the pattern until the final cadence shift (“let the tide carry him home”). Orientation is taught by image within 120 w; no因果 breaks. Cost is legible in the snapped chalk and fading sound. Meets 9- gate for closure but lens repetition could be tighter.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Junkyard textures—rusted VCR doors, silent spools, gravel crunch—are filtered through the prophet’s synesthetic quest; every object is handled, not catalogued. Fog and scrap metal constrain visibility and movement, guiding the chalk spiral placement. The “faint vibration of a tape that never played” charges the final image by returning as the unheard hum. Micro-setting (chalk nub, snapped stub) physically alters the ground and is left as legacy—meets 9- gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“capture the sound of growing older”—is signaled early; pressure intensifies through sensory accumulation rather than external opposition. The tidal breathing swells as a pattern break at the spiral-drawing beat, forcing the costly chalk snap that forecloses retention. No coincidence resolves; the sound recedes because he cannot hold it. Escalation is textural, not causal, fitting the lens; a sharper mid-arc trade-off could push higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme—time’s echo is un-ownable—emerges from the prophet’s tactile failures rather than thesis statements. The final smile reweights the chalk dust from tool to relic, offering conceptual repricing without moralizing. Recurrent tapes and driftwood accrue meaning through use, not symbolic graft. Ambiguity lingers: next pilgrim may hear or ignore the spiral—earned complexity, not tidy wisdom.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays tight to the prophet’s synesthetic lens: “low hum of rusted VCRs,” “scent of wax and the sound of time’s slow sigh.” Syntax lengthens and compresses with fog thickness and chalk fracture, creating tidal rhythm without monotony. No head-hopping; diction remains within his self-taught mystic register. Distinctive perceptual signature meets 9- gate; occasional alliterative clusters flirt with purple but stay purposeful.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “He pressed a finger to a rusted screen, feeling the faint vibration of a tape that never played” does triple duty—action, sensory, theme. No scaffold loops; only two near-paraphrase lines (“echo of his own aging breath” / “sound of growing older”) but they frame beginning and end, serving cadence. Metaphors stay coherent within magnetic/tidal field. Minor filter verbs remain voice-motivated. Clean enough for high-band, final third immaculate.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Premise—junkyard mystic records unrecordable time—feels fresh yet inevitable; details like Betamax shells and 1994 birthday tape are specific, not quirky ornament. Risk lies in lyric stillness over plot, but coherence justifies the gamble. Could edge 8.5 with one more irreplaceable world rule; as is, transformation is strong but not absolute.</comment>
