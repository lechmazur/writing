<comment>Mira’s interiority is sensorily embodied (“glass vials heavy,” “mineral breath”) and her contradictory drives—archivist vs. trespasser—play out in the compass-touch beat. The final renunciation is earned: she chooses custodianship over immersion, paying the cost of perpetual longing. No diagnostic self-talk; eccentricity manifests as tactile ritual. Micro-choices (decanting, kneeling, circle of vials) reveal her hierarchy of values without exposition.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the spinning compass + scent-circle reconfigure her life’s rule-set with undeniable conceptual cost—she now guards the ineffable. Lens = Accumulative/Textural; density of scent-memory images escalates until measurement dissolves. No orientation debt; who/where/when anchored by word 60. Persistent constraint established: “she would become its keeper” forecloses future entry. Cost is legible in the final image—“empty pocket… resonant hush.”</comment>

<comment>Quarry, factory, lagoon, and compass form a micro-setting ecosystem that constrains every move; descent-route details (calcite-slick ledges, rusted rebar) track spatially. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven—petrichor > sight > sound. The compass as object-as-setting charges the final image; its frozen needle toward the lagoon literally directs plot. Weather and industrial decay evolve causally with each ingress.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—find where explanations fail—is signaled in paragraph 3 and tightens when compass needle locks east. One meaningful deepening: lagoon memory-stack reveals 1923 team’s deliberate crossing, converting mystery into moral choice. Protagonist agency drives the turn: she pours the scent, then refuses the water. Cost is visible—empty vials, empty pocket, lifelong guardianship.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from olfactory archive vs. existential threshold; no overt thesis statements. Final image of spinning compass in scent-circle offers Conceptual Repricing: knowledge itself becomes a boundary, not a key. Subtext resides in silence—factory’s “broken windows now merely windows” implies acceptance of unanswerable. Ambiguity is purposeful: keeper-role is both gift and life-sentence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited clings to Mira’s perceptual signature—scent-first metaphors, mineral tastes, temperature gradients. Syntax lengthens during descent to mimic breath condensing; short clauses return at surface. No head-hopping; psychometry access is framed as sensory invasion, not omniscience. Diction stays within her plausible lexicon—“solution tubes,” “petrichor,” “decanting”—without academic drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Rhythm modulates with pressure—long sensory sentences underground, clipped fragments topside. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or choice. Metaphors stay coherent (needle as memory, lagoon as page) and are sparse enough to avoid purple overload. Opening and closing lines perform mirror work: “heavy with glass vials” vs. “empty pocket,” creating cadence bookend.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>Petrichor-as-archive is fresh; coupling it with psychometric limestone memory repurposes two familiar tropes into a new sensory epistemology. The 1923 expedition’s elective vanishing reweights colonial discovery narratives as voluntary surrender to wonder. Conceptual risk—ending on guardianship rather than revelation—pays off by redefining heroism as restraint. Synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
