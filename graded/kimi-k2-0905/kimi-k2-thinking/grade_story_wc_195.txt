<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Aldric’s “withdrawn” trait is asserted rather than dramatized—no contradictory impulse or social friction forces him to act against type. The vow he murmurs is the only beat where interior contradiction could surface, yet it emerges as convenient acceptance, not struggle. Cost is present (eternal servitude) but feels abstract because the prior loneliness was told, not embodied. Meets the 9+ threshold for interior contradiction only if we accept the vow as renunciation, but the lack of embodied prior stakes blunts the ache.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the doorway swallows Aldric and rewrites the greenhouse into a cosmos of puppets—cost is the irreversible loss of singular self. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens: each image (silver vines, petrified-fruit puppets, unsnapping) layers density until the final folding of light reweights reality. Orientation is anchored early (glass cathedral, perpetual darkness by line 3). One soft spot: the “abandoned marionette theater program” is discovered without prior causal seed, a minor teleporting prop, but it is immediately woven into pattern logic and does not rupture closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The greenhouse is not backdrop but instrument: vines tighten into spirals of light that physically cage Aldric’s choice, satisfying the 9+ gate that setting constrains final tactics. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true—Aldric the caretaker notices luminescence, silver string knots, the faint pulse beneath roots. Endless night is more than ambience; it supplies the vacuum into which possibility is poured, making the final cosmic marionette show inevitable. Spatial choreography stays clean as Aldric kneels, traces, pulls, steps—each motion tracked without impossible jumps.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—capture the shape of possibility—is signaled in the inciting whisper and escalates through each unsnapping that swells fruit into universes. One meaningful tightening: the final thread-pull collapses the greenhouse into a doorway, foreclosing retreat; cost is the eternal dissolution of self into puppeteer/puppet duality. Pressure accrues texturally: each re-snapped pattern adds density, harmonic song, cascading light—options narrow to “step through or stay alone forever.” No reversal, but the deepening is sufficient under Accumulative lens; visible price is his bodily dissolution into the infinite dance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges without moralizing: the price of infinite creation is the erasure of the singular creator. Subtext lives in the puppets’ “ecstatic terror”—a silent warning that possibility devours its maker. Final image of marionettes dancing “shimmering with the light of captured possibility” reweights earlier fruit imagery into cosmic scale, achieving resonance. No thesis stated; meaning is left in the after-echo of the allegiance, satisfying the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person luminous-epic register is stable, with syntactic elongation that mirrors the endless night: “glass cathedral of perpetual darkness,” “fluid geometry that defied logic.” No head-hopping; perceptual signature is Aldric’s caretaker gaze—he sees luminescence, silver threads, harmonic song. Diction stays within plausible fairy-tale lexicon; no corporate register drift. Rhythm breathes—long sentences for awe, fragments (“Reality shifted”) for pivot points—creating purposeful modulation under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>High density: “vines twisted into spirals of light” does world, action, and image in one stroke. No looped stems; each sentence advances pattern or stakes. Metaphors stay coherent—strings remain silver, light remains folded, no mixed vehicles. One clause of overwrite—“shivering bliss” repeated three times—ticks the Density flag but never touches the closure beat, so caps at −0.2, leaving room in 8-band.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fuses alchemy, puppet theatre, and cosmic creation into a single inevitability: petrified-fruit marionettes as lost guardians of reality-fruit is fresh, not checklist. Risk—endless night greenhouse as portal to multiverse—pays off: the glass walls become the observable limit of one universe among many. Transformation test fails if any element is swapped; the orchard’s biology is the engine of the plot. Synthesis feels both mythic and scientifically strange, achieving the non-obvious angle required for 9-band entry plus risk bonus.</comment>
