<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is concrete—her calloused thumb reading splinters maps directly to her lived craft. The contradiction between preserving the town’s guilt and accepting the earth’s shift is dramatized in the single choice to pocket the rake handle. Micro-choice hierarchy is visible: tower duty > communal absolution > personal blame. Only the “ethical burden” phrase nudges toward label-speak, keeping it just outside the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Charged Poise: the pendulum’s arc is re-weighted by the new knowledge that the ground, not Marten, betrayed them. The rake-handle inscriptions deliver the decisive causal pivot on schedule at ~75 % of the word count, paying off the taught pattern of “pendulum pause = revelation window.” Cost is legible in the final line: she must now maintain time atop a fracture the town still refuses to see. Lens is Accumulative/Textural; density tightens once, then crystallizes without contradiction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The tidal obsidian ridge functions as micro-setting: its glass shards cut boots and dictate timing—Elara must descend before the tide erases evidence. The broken rake handle is a portable setting fragment whose scored grooves literally carry the world-shift data. Environment constrains the final choice: tide return = erase or reveal. Sensory hierarchy obeys POV—she notices salt spray patterns, not panoramic vistas—delivering the 9-band gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Dominant stake—restore communal balance—tightens once: from penitent winding to shared truth-telling. The rake handle’s fifth inscription (“Let the pendulum bob be your absolution…”) forces the live trade-off between comforting lie and sustainable time. Cost is visible: she forfeits moral simplicity and accepts lifelong complicity in a subtler deception. Agency is decision, not confrontation; one meaningful deepening satisfies the short-form bar.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: absolution accrues like tide marks—incremental, undeniable. The rake handle’s tiny letters embody the concept; their erasure by seawater re-prices the meaning of “permanent record.” Final image reconfigures the premise: maintenance of time is now maintenance of a shared, shaky myth. No moral is declared; resonance is carried by the silver pendulum bob hanging in charged stillness.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is consistent: volcanic glass “sings,” pendulum “hangs weightless,” time “staggers.” Syntax glides from long clause to fragment under pressure—“She stood, pocketing the rake handle.” No filter-verb stacks; diction stays within Elara’s artisan lexicon. Compression in “three degrees of arc” is taught early and paid off. Voice modulates once: from penitent precision to measured acceptance, mirroring the tower’s realignment.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Zero loops; no scaffold. Sentence rhythm mirrors pendulum swing—long, then cut. Information density high: “obsidian swallowed three degrees of arc” compresses geology, breach, and metaphor in five words. Figurative language is sparse, pattern-taught, and avoids muddle in peak beats. Read-aloud ear test passes; final line cadence delivers a dying fall that charges the earlier “silver and still” image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Premise—timekeeper absolving a dead man via micro-carvings on a farm tool—feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Synthesis of geologic fault and moral fault is fresh; neither idea alone would suffice. Transformation test fails if Elara is swapped out—her vocation enables the inscription decoding. Risk in using pendulum pause as revelation window heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specificity anchors universals; no retreat into abstraction.</comment>
