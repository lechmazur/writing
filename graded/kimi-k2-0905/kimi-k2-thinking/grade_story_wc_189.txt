<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is textured through tidal imagery and the jade cicada, but her contradictory impulses stay largely abstract—“rather than confront the future directly” is told, not embodied. The brother remains a silhouette; no distinct gesture or idiom separates him, so the relationship crucible never heats. The final shared understanding is credible, yet the cost feels diffuse because the brother’s leaving is still prospective; the emotional price is implied rather than dramatized on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the tide’s rise and the cicada’s warmth crystallize a stance of quiet release with legible, if gentle, cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each ripple and star-silver layer deepens the stake—though the single tightening is subtle. Orientation is secure by line 3; no因果 breaks occur. One scaffold loop (“texture of time” repeated almost verbatim) slightly dulls the final image, keeping the score just below the 9 gate.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The grotto’s star-pierced ceiling and chalk star-maps are economically anchored and filter through Mara’s chronicle gaze; space stays coherent. The jade cicada doubles as micro-setting, its leaf-veins catching starlight to constrain her tactile attention and charge the final image. Selective sensory triangulation—cool jade, soft give of water, stone breath—supports the theme without catalogue. Environment never blocks choice, but its steadfastness anchors the parting, meeting the 9- gate requirement.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—accepting her brother’s departure—surfaces early; pressure mounts via accreted tidal imagery rather than event. The meaningful tightening is the tide’s quiet surge that lifts pool creatures, cueing Mara’s release; cost is present but low-impact (prospective loss, not irrevocable). No reversal or trade-off narrows options; the conflict remains internal and observational. Sufficient for the lyric mode, yet lacks a visceral price that would push higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme of transition emerges through concrete littoral cycles rather than statement; the cicada’s molt and rising tide reweight the same stake at closure. Subtext resides in silence and starlight, avoiding moralizing. Final image of “tide retreating” offers a non-literal answer anchored in prior particulars. No thematic echo or platitude intrudes; complexity stays intact.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person POV hovers close to Mara’s perceptual filter—starlight as “liquid silver,” grooves of time in jade—maintaining consistent psychic distance. Syntax lengthens during reflective beats, compresses at the brother’s quiet line, mirroring emotional cadence. No head-hopping; brother’s interior is rightly inferred from shadow and voice. One clause of elevated diction (“conceptual repricing” territory) slips in—“the essence of transition periods”—but remains within her chronicler idiom.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose carries lyric density without purple drift: each sentence layers image, body, and concept. Strong verbs (“pierced,” “tracing,” “pooling”) and specific nouns (“chalk marks,” “hermit crabs”) keep momentum. One paraphrase loop—“texture of time” echoed twice in 40 words—deducts 0.2; no mixed metaphors or filter stacks. Rhythm modulates from long tidal sentences to the terse final line, earning high-band placement.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>The tidal-pool lens on sibling parting feels fresh, synthesizing natural-history attention with emotional transition. Star-map grotto and jade cicada are particular to this narrator, resisting swap test. Risk is moderate—quiet lyric rather than twist—but coherence justifies the choice. Could edge higher with a sharper late reconfiguration that only this setting could enable.</comment>
