<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Cassian’s quietly analytic nature is embodied in every beat—gloved fingers turning the globe, noting viscosity, tapping the brass chest—so the trait is never label-only. The interior contradiction between measuring grief and feeling it peaks when he records the snowflake-settling rate while the globe “pulsed with its own minute gravity,” showing science as both shield and longing. The final micro-choice—packing the globe as artifact, not prison—caps a credible renunciation whose cost is the cold exactitude of his last written equation. Mort’s patient presence supplies steady secondary pressure, making their relationship a crucible without ever drifting into explanatory dialogue.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens is declared immediately (“water pressed against the hull like an old regret”) and held to the last line, with each sensory density increment reweighting the same stake: how to carry absence. Closure is a textbook Conceptual Repricing: the globe moves from “singularity of memory” to “artifact,” a reclassification that costs the illusion that measurement could dissolve feeling. Anchors (who/where/when) are taught by line 3 and payoff is the final ascent, leaving orientation debt fully waived. The only hairline slip is the single explanatory line “That was the paradox he was trying to solve,” but it is embedded inside an active observation beat, so causality remains intact.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The sunken library is not backdrop but tactile constraint—anemones colonize decks, coral fuses with logs, water pressure bends brass—every detail pressures the handling of the globe. Micro-setting rule met: the snow globe itself becomes environment-in-hand, its “minute gravity” guiding the final reclassification. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: Cassian notices refractive index before emotional color, a scientist’s panic. Spatial choreography is pristine; bodies, distance, and object states track across the ascent without drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—how to release grief without erasing it—is signaled in the first paragraph and tightened each time Cassian records a new datum, narrowing options from “solve” to “carry.” The meaningful turn is the shift from kinetic grief to potential memory; the price is the admission that understanding does not dissolve ache, only reclassifies it. Escalation is textural: each physical observation adds density until the final repackaging beat forecloses the fantasy of dissolution. Cost is legible in the cold exactitude of the final slate equation and the lingering “sophisticated melancholy” that ascends with them.</question>

<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges without once stating “grief” or “loss” outright; instead, the physics metaphor reweights absence as a conservation law. The snow globe’s final reclassification offers a resonant, non-literal answer: letting go is not deletion but re-categorization under continued gravity. Subtext is carried in gesture—Cassian’s gloved fingers never remove the gloves, a quiet admission that direct contact would scald. The ending image of the globe cradled in a pack, still pulsing, denies sentimental resolution and leaves undeniable conceptual cost: the object will outlast the observer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Cassian’s perceptual signature—every metaphor is measurable: turbulence, viscosity, logarithmic decay—creating a scientist’s lyric. Mort’s dialogue is sparse, indirection-heavy (“You’re untangling threads that don’t want to be untangled”), distinct from Cassian’s murmured equations. No head-hopping; Mort’s interior is never ventriloquized, only cooled water and sly timing. Psychic distance compresses under pressure: the final ascent is almost telegraphic, syntax tightening like oxygen thinning.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence adds new data or metaphoric layer without synonym churn. Rhythm modulates—long fluid clauses underwater, staccato notes during measurement, then a calm iambic close on the surface. Metaphors obey physics: “snow whirled around the static plane” keeps fluid dynamics accurate; no mixed vehicles. High information density: one line can do three jobs (“It mirrored the way memory fades, not linearly, but in diminishing returns”) without crowding. The final line “And Death, being Mort, simply waited for the next descent” lands a perfect cadence twist that recharges every prior image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The premise—grief as measurable physics performed inside a drowned WWII library—feels freshly synthesized rather than quirky; the metaphoric rule-set is taught early and obeyed to the end. The snow globe containing a tiny Electra circling Howland Island is a specific, non-obvious object that could not be swapped for any generic keepsake without collapsing the thematic equation. Risk is taken in the lyric-scientific register, yet clarity never buckles; the voice remains individual, not committee-averaged. Transformation test passed: plot and emotional arc would shred if any shell-world detail were swapped out.</comment>
