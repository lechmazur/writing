<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara’s survivor-guilt is made bone-deep through embodied scars and the porcelain box she still cradles; the thirteen-year ache is never named, only shown in her moonlit climb and stone-circle ritual. Her decision to sacrifice the crew is filtered through fire-breath perception, not abstract guilt-talk, and the final choice—to leave the box and keep teaching—crystallizes a credible endurance with visible cost. Interior contradiction pulses in the same breath: she both masters fire’s language and was mastered by it. The only drag is a trace of therapeutic self-diagnosis (“survival could feel like betrayal”) that momentarily lifts the lens.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the open, moon-filled box re-weights the rule-set—grief is not a burden to set down but a load to shoulder with purpose. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural; pressure mounts through recurring celestial imagery and the slow accretion of ash, stones, scars until meaning tilts. Every beat is causal in the textural mode: each return of light on cracked glaze intensifies the emotional tariff. Cost is unmistakable in the final image—porcelain “empty but full”—and the shift from carrying the box to carrying the memory is felt, not declared.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The moonlit ridge is not backdrop but tool: silver pools dictate where Elara steps, granite spires frame her stone-circle shrine, and planetary arcs meter the thirteen-year vigil. Micro-setting succeeds too—the cracked porcelain’s glaze becomes a lens scattering constellations across granite, literally projecting stellar patterns that charge the closure image. Weather is used tactically: wind disperses ash at the exact beat grief is released. Spatial choreography is flawless; no impossible positions or floating props.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—how to carry the irredeemable choice—tightens once: the box’s ash must be released, forcing a public witness that forecloses private erasure. Escalation is textural: each celestial reference raises the cosmic accounting of her bargain, narrowing her option to mere endurance. Agency is renunciation rather than action; the cost is the lifelong weight she accepts in the final stride downslope. No coincidence muddles causality; pressure stays coherent under the accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from concrete particularities—blue-willow shards, charred button, stone circle—rather than thesis statements. The moral calculus (“I was only choosing how to carry the dying”) is earned through thirteen years of sleepless sinew, not late editorializing. Subtext operates in gesture: the open lid’s scattering of ash is the only apology the dead will receive. Resonance lingers because the story refuses to resolve guilt; it reconfigures the terms of carriage.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric distance remains stable, ventriloquizing Elara’s fire-sharpened perceptual signature—“fire’s language,” “rice-paper scars,” “hard softness.” Syntax mirrors her gait: long clauses climb the ridge, then fracture into short, white-hot images at beats of regret. No filter-verb stacks; immediacy is preserved. The only micro-slippage is one line of diagnostic self-talk, but voice re-centers instantly.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is artifact-free: no loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Figurative language is sparse and precise—“silver light pooled,” “constellations wheeling overhead”—each image pays off in the final light-scatter. Sentence rhythm varies naturally, accelerating on the ascent, breathing at the stone circle, then steadying for the descent. Opening and closing lines anchor and recharge the motif of carrying light through broken vessels.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The fresh inflection is survivor-grief treated as metallurgy: scars mapped as “letters in a language only other burned ones could read.” Celestial choreography re-weights the stale trope of “letting go” into “bearing with purpose,” a conceptual repricing rarely dramatized. While wildfire survivor stories exist, the porcelain-box shrine and stellar witness feel particular, not borrowed. Risk is moderate—lyric accumulation over plot—but coherence holds.</comment>
