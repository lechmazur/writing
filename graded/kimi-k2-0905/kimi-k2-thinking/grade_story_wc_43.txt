<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara’s calm-compassion motive is anchored early and drives every micro-choice; her decision to “let the music carry the words” is the causal hinge that reunites father and daughter. The interiority stays concrete—vinyl shard catching light, pill-bottle clicks—forgoing generic “grief therapist” clichés. One soft spot: we never see her own cost (fatigue, doubt) so the kindness feels friction-free, keeping her just shy of full ambiguity. Still, her agency crystallizes the ending, satisfying the 9+ quick test on earned choice.</question>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: the drip-hum-oxygen pattern accretes into a lullaby that reweights silence into bridge. Orientation anchors by line 3; the shard’s recurrence teaches the pattern; closure lands in a Charged Poise—Lena pressing fragment to ear while father’s spun-glass voice rises—cost felt as irreversible farewell. No ambiguity, no breaks, cost visible on the final beat.</question>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Micro-setting (vinyl shard + solarium window) does double duty: it refracts light to cue memories and literally bridges the estranged pair. Antiseptic-rain perfume is selective, not touristic. Spatial choreography clean—no impossible reaches. Just misses 9 because environment could have pressed one harder choice (e.g., failing playback equipment forcing live song).</question>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“flawless goodbye before dusk”—is signaled immediately; the blood-work deadline tightens options. Escalation accrues through sonic density: drip, rustle, hum → shard-play → father’s fragile duet; each addition forecloses alternate reconciliation routes. The final cost (permanent silence after duet) is legible on page. Situational lens holds; no coincidence resolves.</question>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges non-declaratively: broken vinyl = broken bonds; reassembled sound = rejoined love. No moralizing line explains this; final image of “radiant haven above clouds” reweights premise that endings can still sing. Subtext pulses in gesture—Lena pressing jagged edge to ear—silence speaking louder than apology. Complexity intact: no tidy absolution for three-year absence.</question>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person intimate stays locked to Elara’s sensorium; perceptual signature filters world through acoustic detail and scent. Rhythm modulates—long breathes in solarium, staccato during shard hand-off—mirroring emotional cadence. No head-hop, no filter-verb clutter. Diction stays within hospice worker lexicon; slight poetic lift (“poem of finality”) is voice-motivated, taught early, paid off.</question>

<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary from lyric compound to clipped single-clause under rising emotion; no template cadence detected. Figurative language stays coherent—vinyl scent = hope perfume—without metaphor pile-ups. Information dense: one line can advance setting, symbol, and emotional beat. Zero paraphrase loops, zero scaffolds; copy clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: hospice + broken record as instrument of reconciliation feels inevitable yet unwritten. Risk of sentimental “music heals” trope is averted by keeping playback partial—shard never fully plays—so repair remains metaphoric, not magic. Specificity of daughter’s three-year silence and father’s IV-drip rhythm grounds premise. Slightest ding: core frame still shadows “art saves” template, keeping it sub-9.</comment>
