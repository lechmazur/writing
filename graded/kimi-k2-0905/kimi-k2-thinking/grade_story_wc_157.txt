<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Aris’s contradictory selves—compliant professor vs. seed-smuggler—are alive in every micro-choice; the taxed-thought world forces him to speak rebellion to plants, a cost already legible when the auditors leave empty-handed. Interiority is concrete, never diagnostic: “feeling its ribbed surface thrum” anchors motive in touch, not label. The final whispered phrase is earned rebellion with visible legal risk. No stock epiphanies; the flaw (over-ornate diction) is stylistic, not motivational.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: because thoughts are taxed, therefore Aris caches meaning in seeds; because auditors arrive, therefore the greenhouse’s living chaos thwarts them. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—gourd vines will rattle the city’s map of escape routes, a conceptual cost already seeded. Setup-to-payoff is tight: ladybug → bee → seed → rattle. No orientation debt; anchors (who/where/when) land by line 20.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The greenhouse is not backdrop but tactical weapon: humidity scrambles scanners, pollen clouds carry cipher. Mango-roots conceal the dead-drop; orchid shadows obscure hand-movements. Sensory hierarchy—tactile seed, insect wing-beat, auditor’s grey sleeve—mirrors the surveillance vs. nature dialectic. Micro-setting (seed between thumb/forefinger) literally constrains the final activation phrase.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—mental autonomy vs. commodified thought—tightens when quarterly tax quadruples and new gardeners appear. One decisive escalation: auditors cross the threshold; Aris’s only move is to let living chaos blind their tech. Price is concrete: if gourd map fails, arrest is certain. Agency stays horticultural, not heroic, preserving causal credibility.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulates: seed as untaxable syntax, ladybug as unpaid sentinel. No explicit thesis; instead the final image of rattling gourds re-weights “thoughts are territories” without moralizing. Subtext in auditor’s eye-tracked ladybug: nature’s irreducible signal vs. state’s crude harvest. Complexity intact—no tidy victory, only proliferating vines.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is academic-rogue: Latinate “etymology” mashed with insurgent pollen packets; syntax lengthens under greenhouse humidity, then clips when auditors speak. Dialogue is coded action: “aphids are candid” = extraction team blown. No head-hop; Dr. Chen’s voice stays external, filtered through Aris’s stake. Compression like “candidly cryptic” is pattern-taught early and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density: one sentence pollinates six boroughs. Rhythm accelerates with bee release, then staccato under detector flicker. Only micro-loop: “warp” used twice in two lines—minor. Metaphors (vine constriction, sonic map) stay biologically coherent. Final line lands clean, no scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Novel synthesis: insect-mediated steganography as tax resistance. Familiar dystopia (thought-police) is retooled through botanic cryptography, making the seed literally the key. Risk—letting auditors enter—pays off when nature itself blinds tech. Conceptual integrity absolute; story never flinches from its own premise. Transformation test fails: swap seed for USB-stick and entire logic collapses.</comment>
