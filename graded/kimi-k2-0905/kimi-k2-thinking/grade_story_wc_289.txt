<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Lira’s interior ache is lyrically evoked, but her shift from private ghostwriter to public artist is declared rather than dramatized in-scene; the moment she “enlists” collaborators happens off-page, so the cost of exposure is felt only atmospherically, not through a visible micro-choice that hurts.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the spiral grows stanza-by-stanza, reweighting secrecy into shared art; closure lands with CR as the rain-sealed letter re-prices her anonymity. Causality is light—how the child’s stone or poet’s bowl alters her stance is implied, not shown—but the pattern is taught early and pays off in the final image, satisfying the lyric-contract.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Lotus pond, mirrored tiles, and twig spiral are repeatedly handled, not just viewed; each refracts light onto Lira’s changing sense of exposure, culminating in the spiral’s heart that holds her signed letter. The temple never becomes a tactical constraint, so the 9+ gate is missed, but sensory specificity is disciplined and purposeful.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—move from hidden to seen—remains abstract; no moment forces Lira to risk a specific relationship or client. Escalation is atmospheric (more offerings, more shimmer) rather than a narrowing of options; the “cost” is poetic but not tactical, so pressure plateaus mid-band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of communal ownership of private longing emerges imagistically—threads dyed at dawn, rain-bowl holding sound—avoiding explicit thesis. Final letter-to-self reweights earlier ghostwritten anonymity without moralizing, achieving quiet CR resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person lyric sustains a consistent watercolor texture: “rain kissed petals,” “prismatic quiet.” Diction stays within Lira’s perceptual lexicon; no head-hop, no scaffold. Rhythm modulates from long breathy sentences to short declaratives at the seal-and-release beat, earning high-band control.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong read-aloud cadence, stacked metaphors kept in check by spatial grounding. Minor filter-verb clusters (“she imagined,” “she realized”) dull immediacy in two beats; final third stays clean, so 9+ is disallowed but craft remains polished.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Familiar trope—reclusive artist goes public—is freshened by thrush-nest spiral as sculptural diary and rain-sealed letter as CR. Specificity of lotus-temple mirror-tiles gives the frame an original shimmer, though core arc is recognizable.</comment>
