<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Lira’s interiority is lyrically rendered (“salt-soaked heart,” “melancholy joy”), but her contradictory impulses stay mostly declarative; the embodied cost of gathering shards is a gentle hum rather than a wound. The single on-page choice—releasing the glass to the tide—earns its poignancy, yet the micro-choices inside the geode are largely ornamental, not tactical. The flaw is muted passivity: she watches shoots grow and paths reveal themselves rather than levering open new options. Still, the voice remains consistent and the final renunciation lands with visible, quiet cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The causal chain is fairy-tale solid: shard-flicker → seed-sprout → shard-completion → tidal return. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the sea doesn’t erase, it recollects, and that reweights every prior “loss.” Cost is legible in the final image—Lira walks away “empty of seeds,” her satchel a visible forfeiture. The lens stays accumulative/lyric throughout; no orientation debt; one smooth descent transition.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Environment is protagonist: the iridescent geode walls constrain movement and literally embed the missing pieces. Sensory hierarchy skews visual—shimmer, glow, hue—but the quartz tapestry is tactile and lived-in, not tourist postcard. Weather is internalized as “amber and rose” sunset echo, mirroring the reweighted glass. Micro-setting (tide pool) becomes the stage for the final reconfiguration, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—why paths vanish—tightens once: answer revealed inside geode, no further narrowing. Agency is observational rather than confrontational; pressure accumulates through luminous density, not antagonistic push. Cost is conceptual (acceptance of cyclical forgetting) rather than tactical loss. The tightening is meaningful under the accumulative lens, but the protagonist’s stance crystallizes without a trade-off that alters later options.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of cyclical remembrance emerges from image, not assertion: foam → footprints → foam. The final tide-pool placement reprises the opening “sea-foam recollectionist,” reweighting “loss” as communal archive. No moralizing sentence mars the exit. The cheerful gloom tone itself becomes the thematic answer, inviting plural readings without confusion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Voice is saturated with oceanic diction (briny, salt-soaked, iridescent) yet stays precise; syntax lengthens under wonder, shortens under revelation. No dialogue to distort register. POV remains tightly interior; perceptual signature skews toward chromatic noticing—every glitter is emotion-coded. Compression is lyrical but pattern is taught early (“sea-foam recollectionist” sets the contract) and paid off in the foam-spray finale.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Rhythm breathes with scene needs: cascading anaphora during light-storm, then hushed monosyllables for tide-pool release. Mixed metaphors are avoided; “earth’s glittering throat” is single, sustained vehicle. Minor scaffold: “she watched… she scattered… she pressed…” triple opener inside geode; not painfully repetitive but templated. No artifact touches the closure image; final line is clean and resonant.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fusion of meteor-shard emotion-tech with organic seed-memory is fresh; neither trope is stock in flash fantasy. Risk in lyric passivity is deliberate and coherent, not gimmick. The conceptual flip—disappearance ≠ erasure—feels inevitable in hindsight yet non-obvious at entry. Specificity of “Memoria Swallow” and “crater glass” anchors the conceit; could not swap in generic “magic crystal” without collapse.</comment>
