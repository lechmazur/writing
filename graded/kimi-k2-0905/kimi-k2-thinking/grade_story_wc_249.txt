<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kael’s interiority is vivid—drumming on his own ribcage to translate Mira’s echo—yet the “shared dream” motive is asserted more than tested; no mid-scene micro-choice lets us watch him abandon an alternative path. The final dissolution lands as earned stasis, but the cost is felt more in image than in a prior decision we witnessed him wrestle. Still, his perceptual signature is consistent and character-specific.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the lovers become the garden’s syncopated heartbeat, a conceptual repricing that reweights the premise. The lens is accumulative/textural—pattern of drumming builds density until identity liquefies—and holds without contradiction. Causality is lyric rather than plot-linear, acceptable under Track B mosaic; the “hush of the universe inhaling” recurs as taught pattern. Cost is legible in the disappearing body and the facility’s misreading of it as “malfunction.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sound-wave garden, quartz trees, copper vines, and the auric lagoon are tactile, lived-in, and constrain every beat: drumming on flora changes the field, lagoon surface becomes the medium of transmutation. Sensory hierarchy stays tied to Kael’s musician ear; spatial choreography is crystal-clear. The lagoon’s star-reflection of extinct constellations charges the final image, meeting 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will Kael and Mira merge as a living pattern?—tightens through each drumming beat that strips options: disable cuff, drone approaching, bleeding palms. Escalation is textural: interference patterns shift from noise toward harmony, foreclosing return to human form. Cost is visible in torn skin and the AI’s alarm, but agency is slightly diffuse; the lagoon itself completes the act.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: transhuman love refuses archival storage and chooses ephemeral wave-form. The lagoon’s extinct-star reflection reweights the dream—immortality through impermanence—creating conceptual afterglow. No moral is declared; resonance is carried by the final doubled heartbeat. Sorrow stays auroral, not sentimental.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is compressed, rhythmic, lexically controlled—“auric sorrow,” “syncopated heartbeats”—mirrors Kael’s percussive cognition. No head-hopping; POV modesty respected. Patterned elision (“the hush of the universe inhaling”) is taught early and paid off at closure. Under stress, syntax shortens without drumbeat monotony.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>High information density: one sentence often layers sensory cue, memory shard, and world rule. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; metaphor vehicles stay internally consistent (sound → flora → liquid). Read-aloud rhythm accelerates with approaching drone. Tiny slip: “regrets blossomed into dying chords” edges purple, but fits the lyric register and does not obscure closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses hard-SF memory entanglement with lyric wave-garden, a synthesis not seen in stock templates. Risk of disembodied ending is embraced and paid off by the prior drumming pattern. Specificity—black stone, strawberry taste, copper vines—anchors abstraction. The transformation feels inevitable yet non-obvious in hindsight.</comment>
