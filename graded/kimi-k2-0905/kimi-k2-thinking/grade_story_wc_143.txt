<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The inspector’s quiet determination and embodied awe land; her micro-choices (kneel, shield eyes, whisper promise) reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. Interiority stays concrete, never drifts into label-speak. The only gap is a missing beat where her curiosity could visibly clash with the knowledge that photographing the bloom hastens its doom—would have sharpened cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Causal chain is clean: grain falls → flare → photograph → bloom dies; the before/after is legible and irreversible. Closure carries visible cost—the violet flare becomes a death warrant—earning Charged Poise. The lens (Causal) holds without ambiguity. Minor waiver: orientation anchors (who/when) arrive late but serve the hush effect, so no penalty applied.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lunar regolith, visor reflections, chemical vial, and camera exposure are filtered through professional attention, constraining tactics (anchor tripod, shield eyes). The moonlit summit and Earth-glow are not scenery but tools that set the bloom’s location and the flare’s necessity. Spatial choreography is flawless; no impossible props. One notch below 9 because the crater rim could have been used to hide or reveal the bloom under new light, tightening stakes further.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve the ephemeral bloom’s image—signaled early and tightens once: the flare both records and destroys. Agency is present (she triggers the reaction) but the cost is environmental rather than personal sacrifice; price is felt yet not paid out of her body or future options. Sufficient for this length, but lacks a secondary constraint that would foreclose an alternate tactic.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of transience versus human preservation emerges through the flare that saves and kills; no explicit thesis states this. The violet bloom as final image reweights the entire space-age promise: we can archive but not keep. Avoids sentimentality by letting the wilt happen in half a sentence. Could have pushed further by letting the camera memory itself flicker or corrupt, but still resonates.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays close to inspector’s perceptual filter: “boots crunched,” “visor reflected,” “breath fogged.” Syntax lengthens under awe, shortens under flare—rhythm mirrors pressure. No head-hopping; diction remains within aerospace lexicon without jar. One hairline slip: “dawning hush” is used twice in identical cadence; a micro-variation would have secured 9+.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is lean, high-density; every sentence advances image or beat. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Figurative language is spare and accurate (“rock like forgotten seas”). High-pressure flare paragraph balances long breath and staccato clicks. Final line lands clean without echo—only the repeat of “dawning hush” keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Lunar last-bloom is fresh; combining geological clock, chemical timer, and photographic death sentence gives a new angle on “you can’t take it with you.” Specificity of violet color refracted through translucent petals feels discovered, not decorative. Risk is moderate—quiet ending instead of heroic save—but coherence is high. Loses top tier because the bloom itself could be any fragile ephemeral; giving it one alien trait (e.g., petals that sing under sunlight) would have made irreplaceability undeniable.</comment>
