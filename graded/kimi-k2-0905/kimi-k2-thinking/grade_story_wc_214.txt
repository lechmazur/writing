<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Sola’s spiritual-curious trait and janitor role blend into one credible stance: she sweeps star-dust while questioning the void. Interiority stays concrete—hands on meteor-iron patches, voice in low chant—but the shift from loneliness to empathic strength is more reported than embodied; the climactic “quiet strength she had never known” is told, not micro-chosen. Still, her consistent vulnerability and the glass-cradling gesture give a solid, character-bound through-line.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as a CR: the overlooked era is re-priced as “cocoon for transformation,” glass set in window casting warm glow—felt cost is the years of tending silence. Accumulative lens holds: pattern of hush → moss → sanctuary tightens meaning without causal reversals. One scaffold trace—“the station’s silence was a deliberate choice” (concept told late)—nicks clarity, but image reweights premise with undeniable cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Station is sketched through lived detail: rusted gears, cooling-metal sighs, meteor-iron patches—each item double-duties as texture and Sola’s biography. Micro-setting of yellow glass alcove later constrains choice (she must keep it to feed the moss). Spatial choreography stays clean; only the “highest window” feels briefly unanchored. Overall, selective sensory economy makes the derelict observatory pulse.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can solitude become generative?—is signaled early; pressure accrues via accumulating stillness rather than causal turns. No explicit tightening beat narrows live options; the shift from isolation to sanctuary is gentle pattern-break, not trade-off. Cost is retrospective (“years later”) rather than on-page tactics. Sufficient for accumulative arc, but lacks visceral price at the pivot.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the inversion of silence = fertile ground; no moralizing states it. Glass-into-moss image reweights “stillness” from emptiness to life-support—an earned conceptual flip. Vulnerability-as-strength is threaded through star-empathy, but the insight is softly articulated rather than dramatized in a single costly beat. Still, resonance lingers via haunting final glow.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person lyric voice sustains hush-appropriate cadence—long vowels, silken shroud, whispered uniform—without purple overload. Syntax flexes with emotional crests: short whispers at meteor shower, then expansive “flourishing stillness.” No dialogue to test, but perceptual signature is distinct and stable. One filter-verb cluster (“seemed to exhale”) is minor; overall, rhythmic control heightens pressure without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies gracefully; sentence openings avoid mechanical pattern. Figurative language is selective—“silken shroud,” “station thrummed”—and stays coherent. One paraphrase loop: “flourishing stillness” is repeated conceptually without new image between 3rd & 4th paragraph (−0.2). Otherwise dense, clean propulsion; closing line lands crisp.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Cosmic-janitor-as-star-empath is fresh; trope of abandoned observatory is revived via moss-garden ecology. Risky lyric accumulative structure pays off in final glow. Still, “vulnerability = strength” core is familiar, and glass-to-moss biology drifts toward gentle whimsy rather than hard transformation. Specificity of meteor-iron patches and amber breath-mist keeps it memorable.</comment>
