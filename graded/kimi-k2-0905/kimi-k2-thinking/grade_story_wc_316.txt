<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The sensei’s contradictory impulses—numbness vs. the ache to feel—are dramatized in the single gesture of pressing palm to jar; the final synthesis of clone-selves lands as earned cost because every prior beat literalized the split. Interiority stays concrete (“grief stabbed through him like a tanto blade”) and avoids label-speak. Micro-choice hierarchy is visible: he forfeits perfect emptiness to reclaim pain, a visible price that forecloses the path back to ego death.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a decisive CR: the brain dissolves into his chest, reweighting the rule-set—feeling is no longer the enemy but the price of existence. Causal chain holds under Hybrid lens: timeline fracture → clones appear → vivify circuit → paradox resolves. Orientation anchors (floating rock, three clones, jar) arrive by line 3; no debt applied. Cost is legible in the final image—“tears cutting salt trails”—and persists as constraint for future teaching.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The jar, rock dojo, and dissolving stones are micro-settings that constrain choice: the jar must be shattered before integration can occur, the crumbling dojo forces the step-off moment. Sensory hierarchy mirrors POV bias—formaldehyde swirl, silver-blue veins—selective and urgent. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly: clones collapse into him, stones melt, he remains centered. Final image reuses the floating rock as pure force of will, charging the closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—custody of singular consciousness—is signaled in line 4. One meaningful tightening: vivify circuit merges emptiness with preserved emotion, foreclosing the option to remain hollow. Pressure escalates under Causal lens because each rewrite risks permanent duplication; agency resides in the sensei’s choice to initiate merger. Felt price—grief flooding back—alters later tactics: tomorrow’s lessons will “slice through pretense from the first breath.”</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: integration over transcendence. Subtext operates in the jar label “DUPLICATE” and the silent fear on mirrored faces. No moralizing; final line offers resonant CR—“the master was not the one who transcended emotion, but the one who embraced it completely.” Ambiguity lingers: integration may reopen old wounds, yet that risk is the proof of life.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person POV stays tight to the sensei’s perceptual signature—“seeing the hollow core within each performance.” Rhythm accelerates during vivify: short clauses, em-dashes, light verbs mimic energy arc. No head-hopping; clones’ fear is externally observed. Diction remains within lexicon of martial metaphors—tanto, kata, vivify—without strain. Final cadence slows to match tear-stained acceptance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence. Figurative language is selective—“liquid time,” “silver-blue veins”—and never clusters during peak beat. One paraphrase loop detected (“emptiness and form” restated) but does not touch closure. Strong verbs (stabbed, dissolved, arced) carry load; minimal adverbs. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image that recharges “integration” motif.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses Zen koan with hard-SF paradox; clone custody battle feels non-obvious. Transformation test fails if names change—jarred brain, vivify technique, floating dojo are inseparable. Risk-taking (ego death vs. emotional resurrection) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specific detail—“brain pulsed with dormant synapses”—prevents abstraction. Synthesis ending grows inevitably from established complementary-opposites logic.</comment>
