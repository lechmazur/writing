<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—quiet enthusiasm vs. stellar doubt—stays active in every beat and is embodied in micro-choices (coin-casts, pressing forehead to amber). The final “soundless smile” crystallizes Earned Stasis with cost: she accepts eternal unknowing. No second character on page, so relationship bullets skipped. Motivation is clear and scales to the cosmic stake without psychological leakage.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the coins dissolve into unity, her wavelength merges with the collapsed cosmos, cost is the perpetual absence of certainty. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern of static → coins → silence deepens meaning each cycle. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) taught inside 50 words and payoff at ending justifies early lyric compression. One minor scaffold: “she must wavelength align with purpose or dissolve” restates prior beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Amber deck, resin walls, frozen galaxies, and the brass telescope create a tactile micro-setting that constraints motion (creaking deck, press of forehead) and charges the final image (walls glow with pre-birth light). Selective sensory hierarchy favors touch and resonance over visual catalog. Spatial choreography clean across three coin-casts. Environment mirrors internal state without overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—honor the frequency of extinct realities—signaled in paragraph 2 and tightened when static forms the command “Align yourself.” One meaningful deepening: shift from “what will be?” to “what must have been forgotten?” narrows options under Accumulative lens. Cost is legible in eternal stellar doubt she must carry. No reversal, but single stance crystallization satisfies short-form pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from iterative distillation of loss into resonance; no explicit thesis stated. Final image of her as “the new signal” reweights all prior static-listening without moralizing. Ambiguity persists—choice may be illusion—yet feels earned. Prophecy line “Having been, she will be” offers Conceptual Repricing that reframes the entire arc.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person POV remains tight to Elara’s perceptual filter—static hiss makes teeth ache, coins warm to heartbeat. Rhythmic control mirrors mounting resonance: longer sentences for cosmic scale, fragment bursts under static peaks. No dialogue, so naturalism/subtext skipped. Lexicon stays within plausible arcane-astronomer range; “wavelength align” is scene-motivated jargon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>High information density: single sentences fuse world, body, and stake (“coins…fossilized reality, minted from timelines”). Figurative language is patterned (frequency/wavelength motif) and never muddies causality. Zero loops or synonym churn. One tiny scaffold: “she needed to understand…more deeply” could be cut without loss, but it occupies low-pressure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Collapses eschatology into tuning-fork metaphor; backwards causality and coin-fossil realities feel inevitable yet fresh. Risk-taking in lyric structure pays off—static as dialect of loss teaches pattern early and closes with silence. Conceptual risk heightens stakes without gimmickry. Would not work if coins swapped for dice or cards; specificity is irreplicable.</comment>
