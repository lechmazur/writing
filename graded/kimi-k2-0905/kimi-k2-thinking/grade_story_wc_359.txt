<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lyra’s synesthetic gift is vividly embodied (“each chime as a ribbon of shifting hue”) and her motive to “certify wonder as essential” is declared early. Interiority stays concrete, but the single decisive act—ringing the bells when the chisel strikes—lacks a prior micro-choice that shows her actively weighing risk or cost; the turnaround feels pre-ordained rather than earned under pressure. The moment of fracture is beautiful but the internal contradiction or fear that would make the final peal costly is only implied, not dramatized. Still, the stance crystallizes and wonder is visibly unfettered, satisfying the 9− gate.</comment>

<comment>The closure is a luminous Conceptual Repricing: the sculpted hush literally cracks, wonder spills as “luminous tide,” and the aurora keeps dancing after the bells fall silent—cost felt in the endless upkeep Lyra now shoulders. Causal linkage is clean: chisel cue → bell sequence → hush fracture. Lens is Accumulative/Textural: density of color-sound imagery tightens until the pattern break releases wonder. Orientation is anchored by line 3; no lens ambiguity or artifact touches the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The ice cavern is not backdrop but active antagonist: its “weight of frozen sound” presses ears, dictates ritual timing, and glows only when bells are tuned to aurora hues. Spatial choreography is exact—circle of bells, reflected colors on ice, sculptor’s distant stroke—all tracked without drift. The aurora itself becomes a living instrument; its shades are mapped to bell frequencies, turning sky into playable terrain. Micro-setting (amber sheet) warms against cold, constraining when Lyra must act before it cools—detail that charges closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—prove wonder cannot be silenced—escalates as the cavern’s hush literally thickens, forcing Lyra to match aurora colors to bell tones or lose the moment. One tightening beat suffices: the first marble strike triggers an irreversible sequence; failure would freeze wonder forever. Cost is visible: the amber sheet dims, Lyra’s breath lingers like spent currency, and she must remain as lifelong guardian—foreclosure of ordinary life implied. Agency is collaborative (sculptor cues her) but still protagonist-driven: her synesthetic calibration enables the release.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: wonder as breathable atmosphere, silence as oppressive architecture. The re-pricing is the cavern’s hush becoming “a living silence” that breathes color—an image that reweights the opening premise. Subtextual irony: the sculptor, oblivious, still chisels yet now “with newfound reverence,” showing wonder contagious. No moralizing paragraph; the final line lets marble “forever echo” the bell’s argument, leaving ambiguity about who is sculptor and who is sculpted.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise: “prism-song bell ringer,” “oscillating repose”—neologisms taught by context and repeated until legible. Rhythm modulates withPressure: short declaratives during chisel strike, then flowing color-sound clauses as hush fractures. Perceptual signature is synesthetic, never generic: violet is “bronze hum,” green is “silver thread.” No head-hopping; distant sculptor remains opaque, seen only through Lyra’s aurora-tuned senses. Filter verbs are intentional (“she felt the weight lift”) to keep sensation primary.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Lines are dense but never clogged: “the resonance unfettered wonder, releasing it from the sculpted hush” performs three jobs—action, result, metaphor—in one breath. No synonym loops; “sculpted hush” recurs with accrual, not redundancy. Metaphors stay consistent (ice = silence = weight) and converge in the cracking image. Minor scaffold: “she knew” twice near end could compress, but artifacts stop short of closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The fusion of synesthesia + bell tuning + aurora as instrument is fresh; nowhere else could this climax occur. Trope of “artist awakens world” is inverted—world awakens artist first. Risk: lyrical compression could alienate, but pattern is taught early and paid off. Transformation test fails if Lyra is swapped out—her sensory wiring is the engine. Final reconfiguration feels inevitable yet non-obvious.</comment>
