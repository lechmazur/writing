<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Mara’s grief is embodied in the compass burn and trembling fingers; her renunciation—burying the compass under the juniper—earns quiet closure. Yet her interiority occasionally drifts into abstract “cerulean regret” labels rather than sensory contradiction, and Hideo remains a serene archetype without visible stakes in the outcome.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The causal spine is tight: compass tugs → lace instructions → wire bending → compass cooled → tree absorbs longing. Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Mara leaves with a cutting whose needles carry the apology-color, a visible cost that forecloses old grief. One micro-turn—the compass settling—reconfigures her tactics without soft-reset.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The mist-cut dawn ferry, tide-pool pier, and cedar table are filtered through Mara’s salt-stung perception; the juniper pot becomes micro-setting that absorbs the compass and later anchors the needle. Weathered dock and diffused lace-light constrain her delicate wire-work, charging the final image of blue-green needles.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—retrieve unspoken apology—tightens when the lace pattern demands precise ritual and the compass cools only after Mara yields control. The cost is the surrender of the compass itself, a tangible forfeiture that narrows her future grief-tactics. Pressure stays coherent under causal lens; no external antagonist needed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: remembrance is not a wave but a tide that must be diffused, not dammed. The apology-color’s migration from pigment to leaf offers a resonant, non-moral answer. No abstract sermon—just the image of blue-green in needles—reweights the premise with conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lyric third-person adheres tightly to Mara’s sensory funnel: “mist that clung… like unspun silk,” “rhythmically placid” echoing Hideo’s tide-pool cadence. No head-hop; diction stays within her plausible lexicon. Sentence rhythm breathes—long teal sweeps for grief, clipped clauses for wire twists—without algorithmic pattern.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentences open with prepositional mist, then tactile nouns (wire, moss, lapis). Figurative density is high but patterned early—lace diffusion taught by 25%—and pays off in the leaf-tip image. Zero paraphrase loops or filter-verb stacks; information dual-loads action and atmosphere without scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Ghost-ship compass + bonsai-wire lace fuses nautical and horticultural mythologies into a fresh grief-tech. The apology-color synthesized from rainwater and lapis feels invented yet inevitable. Risk lies in lyric compression, but coherence holds; no derivative echoes. Specificity of tide-pool silence as pedagogy keeps concept anchored.</comment>
