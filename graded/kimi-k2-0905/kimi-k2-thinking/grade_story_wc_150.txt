<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lina’s interiority is concrete and embodied (“weight of the dead lightly”), her micro-choices (fitting the wedge, whispered promise) reveal a hierarchy of values, and the arc from exile to renewed faith is credibly endured rather than explained away. Flaws (dread, caution) stay consistent and complicate her gentle determination. The 20-year exile backstory is anchored to present stimuli and alters her stance, satisfying BRR. No contradictory impulses appear side-by-side in scene, so the 9+ quick test isn’t met, but the portrait is individual, coherent, and cost-bearing.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: the sundial’s gradual reassembly tightens the “interrupted journeys” stake through density and cadence shift; the final image of whole stone casting a new shadow is a Charged Poise that reweights the premise with felt cost. Anchors (who/where/when) are clear within 60 words; no orientation penalty. Causality is lyric rather than because/therefore, permissible under this lens. Closure lands on-page (“the sun moved with deliberate slowness”), so 9+ gate is eligible, but the cost is more conceptual than viscerally paid in body or option; hence held just below 9.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard is not backdrop but tactical: roots guide her feet to fragments, bones become bookmarks, dappled light patterns the moment of discovery. Spatial choreography is clean (roots between femurs, stone clicks into groove). The sundial as micro-setting constrains the final choice and charges the ending image, meeting the 9+ gate. Sensory hierarchy reflects Lina’s priorities—touch of moss, smell of memory—never cataloguing.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—restoring continuity to interrupted lives—signals early and tightens through each unearthed fragment; the sundial’s completion is the single meaningful deepening that forecloses abandonment and makes the faith-renewal legible. Agency is observational rather than confrontational, fitting the Accumulative lens, yet a visible price (years of exile, dread carried) is named and carried forward. Coincidence (finding the wedge at twilight) complicates rather than resolves. Cost is more conceptual than corporeal, keeping it shy of 8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the orchard’s living archive and the sundial’s shadow: continuity across rupture. No moralizing sentence; the final whispered promise is image, not thesis. Particulars (gnarled roots in ribcages, star-map etched edge) accumulate into a requiem for interrupted journeys that resists tidy equivalence. The ambiguity—faith renewed yet exile unerased—lingers with honest complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Free-indirect style stays anchored in Lina’s perceptual signature: “smelled of moss and memory,” “sunlight filtered…to paint dappled patterns.” Syntax modulates with emotional intensity—short clauses under pressure, longer lyric strands during reflection. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk is zero. Filter verbs appear but are voice-motivated (“she felt a warmly curious tug”). Patterned repetition (“one stone at a time”) is taught early and paid off in the final whisper, earning rhythmic coherence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence runs. Information is dense: roots/breath/light triangulate in one clause. Metaphors are coherent (orchard as storyteller) and never mixed. One paraphrase loop detected (“interrupted journeys now slowly resuming” echoes earlier summary) but it does not stall the beat; −0.2 applied. No artifact touches the closure image. Read-aloud rhythm is fluid, with paragraph cuts that change emotional charge.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The catacomb orchard plus functional sundial is a fresh synthesis of memento mori and horticultural rebirth; the star-map fragment is a specific, non-obvious inflection that feels inevitable after the bone-textured roots. Risk—lyric stillness in a grave-orchard—heightens rather than obscures meaning. If transplanted to another valley the emotional engine collapses, so transformation test passes. No close literary echoes detected.</comment>
