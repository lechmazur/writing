<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The librarian’s contradictory impulses—scientific caution versus ancestor-loyalty—are dramatized in trembling fingers, lung-clogging dread, and the override of safety protocols. Each micro-choice (pinning the nail, entering coordinates) visibly climbs the risk ladder toward the final dare. The copper nail against her heart crystallizes a believable, costly allegiance. Only the director’s off-stage protests keep this from full 9-band compression.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a clean Charged Poise: the valley camp materializes, the reversible-exile rule is repaid, and the cost—her career, perhaps her safety—radiates from the director’s silent retreat. Causal links hold: nail-pin → journal decoding → coordinate entry → eye-storm reveal. Orientation is anchored by word 30; no seams break the because/therefore chain. The final image reweights every prior map as lie, satisfying the conceptual price test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>“Thawed permafrost and something organic and wrong” is selective, urgent, plot-relevant. The corkboard, observation deck, and 1880s instruments are tactile, spatially tracked, and used—never backdrop. Weather metaphors mirror inner state without overt symbolism. The station’s instrument towers constrain movement and supply the console she violates, passing the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prove Vance’s truth before the station buries it again—tightens exactly once: overriding protocols locks her into irreversible insubordination. Cost is felt immediately (alarms, director’s threat) and conceptually (history’s erasure now hers to shoulder). No secondary reversals are needed at this length; one decisive narrowing suffices. The calm eye’s appearance is earned, not coincidental.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</question><comment>The theme of sanctioned forgetting versus matriarchal return emerges through the nail, journals, and jet-stream scar rather than exposition. The final invitation—“Look at what we’ve been erasing”—delivers resonance without moralizing. Reversible exile is re-priced from quaint penalty to living portal, forcing reader to re-calculate every official map. Ambiguity lingers: hero or traitor, exile or homecoming.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is cool, precise, map-librarian—notice how “fractured jet stream” and “barometric pressure readings” stay inside her professional lexis. Rhythm accelerates into stubbed clauses under alarm red: “She didn’t care.” No head-hop; psychic distance contracts credibly as dread thickens. Filter verbs (“felt”) are minimal and motive-driven.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentence variance is natural; no template cadence or synonym loops detected. Figurative language is sparse and accurate—“spongey dread like wet wool” is sensory, not purple. Information density is high: one sentence often toggles action, setting, history. The closing paragraph’s dry/certain flame vs. damp fog is a crisp, non-muddled metaphor that recharges earlier motifs.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The atmospheric-river exile premise feels fresh yet inevitable; climate horror melds with Victorian gendered erasure without strain. Copper nail as skeleton key to a weather-eye is a specific, non-obvious synthesis. Risk is taken—lyric escalatio of a ghost camp—yet causality and clarity hold. Derivative guardrail waived: no familiar template hosts this exact algorithm of meteorological truth vs. sanctioned amnesia.</comment>
