<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Kael’s contradictory drives—guilt-driven penance and the analytic hunger to reconstruct—are shown through embodied gesture (tracing ash, mixing pigments from their own past). The micro-choice to begin painting with charcoal made from their earlier arson is a sharp, credible turn that crystallizes the value hierarchy: truth > self-preservation. Interiority avoids therapy-speak; instead, “volcanic tenderness” gives a sensory, geologic idiom to shame. What keeps the score sub-9 is that the mentor’s dying words arrive as a convenient memory-flash exactly when needed, slightly diluting the causality of the final resolve.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the vault of untouched histories is accessed only because Kael’s mural trail (Fibonacci angle at dawn) reweights their prior fires from erasure to revelation—an on-page Conceptual Repricing with felt cost. Causal chain holds: each mural beat is because/therefore linked to the next cipher layer. Orientation is anchored early (library ruin, volcanic foothills, 3 yrs off-grid). The only slip is the late, un-foreshadowed “bioluminescent fungi” that briefly softens the physical logic of pigment sourcing.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Limestone chambers, sulfur-steam, ochre veins—every geological detail is mined for pigment and therefore constrains the artistic trail; environment literally feeds the plot. The tapestry fragment acts as micro-setting: its dissolving threads force Kael to reconstruct rather than steal, pivoting tactics. Spatial choreography is tight; we track torch-to-fungal light transitions without position drift. Final image of dawn light through three skylights is both atmosphere and timing device for the vault reveal, earning the 9-ready gate, but capped at 8.6 because the “crystalline memory devices” appear without prior sensory seeding.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore what they once burned—tightens when each mural both atones and risks discovery; the Fibonacci progression mechanically forecloses shortcuts. Escalation is causal: every new chamber portrait ups the ante by revealing another persecuted lineage, narrowing Kael’s options to either finish or abandon the trail. Cost is visible: weeks of bodily labor, scarce ochre mined by hand, and the final weeping self-portrait that advertises guilt to any future Revisionist. Pressure plateaus slightly mid-story when the murals risk becoming a repetitive sequence rather than a ratchet.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme—memory as palimpsest that can be burned or painted back—emerges through the pigment origin stories rather than exposition. The vandalized self-portrait motif reweights at closure: the weeping restored version makes the earlier propaganda slash a literal incision into Kael’s identity, now acknowledged rather than erased. Subtext in silence: scholars “brave enough” to come don’t speak of forgiveness, only witness, letting the tapestry’s tears answer the moral question. No thematic echo sentences; the final image performs the insight, achieving non-literal resonance.</question>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays strictly inside Kael’s perceptual filter—volcanic metaphors, warp/weft mathematics, sulfur breath—creating a distinct geologic-textile idiom. Psychic distance compresses under stress: “steam hissed… carrying the ghost of a million voices” collapses time and memory into one sensory gulp. No head-hopping; even mentor Cress is seen only as Kael’s memory-trigger. The occasional latinate clause (“analytically intuitive mind”) nudges register upward but remains consistent with Kael’s self-coding temperament, so voice holds.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm varies from molten-long to staccato—“They mixed pigments. They painted faces.”—mirroring labor then urgency. Mixed-metaphor risk in “volcanic tenderness” is justified by geothermal setting and pays off in final “volcanic and unyielding” guardian stance. One paraphrase loop—“each mural… more detailed than the last”—repeats concept without new pressure, docking 0.2. Otherwise high density: one sentence can anchor place, reveal backstory, and foreshadow Fibonacci angle, keeping momentum despite lyric thickness.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: arsonist-as-librarian flipped via pigment archaeology; tapestry as both self-portrait and propaganda site; Fibonacci geometry as both cipher and spiritual atonement. Risk of preciousness is averted by tactile materiality—charcoal from old fires, ochre mined with bloodied knuckles. Not quite 9+ because the “crystalline memory devices” feel like a near-future trope shoehorned into an otherwise geologic-past world, slightly diluting the otherwise seamless archeological texture.</comment>
