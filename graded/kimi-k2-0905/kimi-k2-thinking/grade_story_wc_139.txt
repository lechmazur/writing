<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Sam’s interior calculus—“what algorithm justified deception for survival?”—is vivid, embodied, and drives every micro-choice; the ledger-stroke moment crystallizes their hierarchy of values. The father remains off-page, so relationship-as-crucible can’t ignite, but Sam’s internal contradiction (honesty vs complicity) stays live in scene. The final stance—helping the con by refining it—carries visible cost and feels earned. Voice repetition (“mathematics,” “liquefies”) edges toward template cadence but never quite flattens the individual perceptual signature.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Sam hands over the photocopied ledger, foreclosing the exposé path while re-weighting the con’s moral algebra. Causal linkage holds: each beat (map → breach → ink pot reveal) tightens options under the 2:47 AM clock. Orientation is anchored by line 3; no penalty. Persistent constraint—the $47 k price and the director’s narrowed eyes—shapes the final transaction. One minor scaffold: “waiting actively” is named repeatedly before its mechanics are shown, a faint loop that keeps this just sub-9.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The embalming machine’s wheeze and chemical stench permeate every beat, constraining Sam’s breathing and timing; the ink pot’s cracked glass becomes a micro-setting that charges the final image. Sensory hierarchy is POV-specific—Sam notices surgical steel, fluid gurgle, not floral wallpaper. Spatial choreography is flawless: eighteen-pace map, three-minute blind spot, the exact angle between cabinet and door. Environment directly enables the breach and pays off in the closing dirge-currency metaphor.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—survival via forged papers—signals early and tightens when the letterhead proves nonexistent, forcing Sam to pivot to the ledger. Agency remains Sam’s throughout: the breach, the pocketing, the negotiation. One meaningful deepening: the ink pot turns out to contain their own origin story, reframing cost from cash to identity. Price is visible—Sam trades moral purity for asylum math—but the escalation feels slightly compressed in a single beat rather than incrementally layered.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: fairness = negotiated complicity, honesty = luxury good. Subtext operates in gesture—handing back the pot as “offering” instead of exposé. The embalming fluid metaphor reweights at closure, turning rigidity-to-compliance into moral pliability. No tidy moral, only a crystallized ratio: seven lies = freedom. Final image (organ notes as currency) recharges earlier “mathematics” without declaring a thesis, keeping resonance sharp and unsentimental.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person close sustains a metallic, chemical diction—“deathly vitality,” “ethical algebra”—that feels Sam-specific and teaches its pattern early. Rhythm accelerates during breach (“fingers flexing, breathing measured”) then slows for the dirge, mirroring tension. No dialogue, so voice distinction is internal; the lyrical nominalizations (“liquefies rigid thinking”) remain consistent rather than register drift. Perceptual signature—counting seconds, angles, dollars—never leaks into authorial omniscience.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence despite repeated “mathematics” motifs. Metaphors stay coherent—ink pot cracks as “old skin,” fluid as “liquefies rigid thinking”—and integrate with physical logic. Information density high: one line can advance clock, mood, and theme (“At 3:04 AM, the director returned...”). Minor scaffold: “waiting actively” phrase appears three times in close proximity; paraphrase-loop check applies −0.2, keeping this just sub-9.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: funeral home + con-as-embalming + teenage ethicist. The ink pot’s pivot from antique prop to birth-archive feels inevitable yet unforeseeable. Specific detail—“judge’s letterhead,” “$47 k,” “seven more lies”—anchors the premise in lived criminal economy. Risky structural compression (single night, single viewpoint) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Transformation test passes: swap venue or object and the entire moral algebra collapses.</comment>
