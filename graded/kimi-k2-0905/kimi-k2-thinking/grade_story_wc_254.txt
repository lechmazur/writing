<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The poet’s aesthetic obsession is palpable—she touches quartz, translates hum into verse—but her interiority loops in lyric summary rather than contradictory impulse. No micro-choice visibly costs her anything; the “tremor of certainty” is declared, not dramatized as conflicting desire. Because she walks alone, relationship/status crucible is N/A; still, the absence of a tested flaw or trade-off keeps the arc below 7.0.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory layer (lantern-moth hush, quartz hum, cloud-shadow) thickens until the lake’s sigh reweights the stake. Orientation is taught by image rather than exposition—who/when emerge by ~80 words—so waiver applies. Closure is a Charged Poise: the final silhouette merge reconfigures the boundary she sought to dissolve, with felt cost in the fading light. No causal break, though the beat could tighten further.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Cobalt atrium, quartz colonnade, and frozen lake are rendered with synesthetic specificity—color as sound, ice as canvas—each constraining her paraphrase act. Spatial choreography stays clean: footstep echoes, palm on pillar, lake-center pause track cleanly. Environment breathes with her: walls shift hue, ice ripples in perception, proving micro-setting as active agent. fits 9+ gate: the colonnade’s hum literally enables her final verse; without it the closure image collapses.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—dissolve boundaries between self/world—signals early and escalates via sensory saturation rather than external opposition. Single meaningful tightening: palm-flat-on-quartz beat dissolves skin/stone border, reweighting her stance. Cost is perceptual, not actionable; no live option is foreclosed, so pressure stays lyrical rather than tactical. Sufficient for 600-word lyric mode, but lacks a visible price that would push higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of permeable boundaries emerges from concrete acts—touching quartz, whispering verse—never from exposition. Final image of silhouette dissolving into cobalt shadow offers non-literal answer: identity becomes environment. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in the lake’s sigh. Resonance is strong, yet slightly abstract absence of a concrete forfeiture keeps it shy of 8.5.</question>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</question><comment>Voice is lyric-cinematic: compressed metaphors (“spine of frozen music”), rhythmic anaphora (“she… she…”), perceptual slippage taught early and held. No dialogue, so evaluation is on narrative texture; diction stays within poet’s aesthetic lexicon. Filter verbs are minimal; immediacy maintained. Under peak pressure (lake-center), syntax tightens to short clauses without breaking pattern. Distinct perceptual signature earns 9- eligibility; minor over-repetition of “hum” and “dissolve” nudges down.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm is musical, but paraphrase loops (“dissolving boundaries… boundary between… dissolve the next boundary”) and near-synonym churn (“tremor of certainty… tremor of certainty”) dull momentum. Mixed metaphors—“lantern-moth hush” vs. “spine of frozen music”—cohere poetically, yet slightly strain logic. No scaffold sentences or template cadence; sentences vary in length and opening. Density is high; compression admired, but the echoing diction keeps it from 8.0.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fusion of sound-sculpture architecture with lyric interiority feels fresh; quartz colonnade as musical instrument is not a trope seen before. Risky second-person implied intimacy (“you” never named) is avoided; single POV holds. Conceptual commitment total: the world really does hum and dissolve. Transformation test passes—poet’s arc relies on specific quartz/lake synergy. Slight over-milked “hum” refrain is the only familiar echo; still, the synthesis earns high 8.</comment>
