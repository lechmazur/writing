<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara’s hybrid nature—brass gears vs. “human heart”—is dramatized in the micro-choice of venting the crucible only halfway. Contradictory impulses (archival duty vs. olfactory trigger) coexist in the same beat, not summarized. Final stance of “never the same self” is earned by the creel refusal that visibly costs her protocol compliance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure unit is a Charged Poise: the half-transmuted creel persists as “question not data,” reweighting the Archive’s premise. Cost is legible—“quiet triumph of refusal” + lunar migration pain—under Accumulative/Textural lens. Pattern of tidal retreat → geothermal gradient → moon-pull is taught early and charges final image without ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Tidal atrium, brass exoskeleton, and bamboo weave are all tactile tools that constrain the final choice of partial smelt. “Pressure glass,” “geothermal vents,” and “winter-sun” are filtered through Elara’s mechanical/human sensorium, never touristic. Spatial track is clean: steps → platform → crucible → warming stones.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</question><comment>Dominant stake—“preserve wonder in routine”—tightens when the creel’s living scent triggers an unauthorized gradient-smelt, foreclosing full data extraction. Visible price: protocol breach recorded, lunar migration ache, creel left as un-archived anomaly. Single meaningful deepening suffices under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</question><comment>Theme emerges from the creel’s transmutation: preservation demands imperfection, memory needs material weave, not pure information. No moralizing; final image of “fish swimming through woven spaces” reweights earlier Archive logic without statement. Contradiction is embraced as method, not problem—resists tidy binaries.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Voice fuses mechanical precision (“tessellated floor,” “annular furnace”) with sensuous lyricism (“smelled of living water,” “sunlight on skin”). Compression taught early: “gears storing moments tomorrow could no longer hold” signals elliptical lyric mode. Rhythm modulates—long tidal sentences vs. staccato “Let them be fish” triad—mirrors lunar shift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>High information density: one sentence often does object, metaphor, and world-rule (“bamboo darkened but did not burn, crystals softening like amber, data bleeding into reeds”). No filter-verb clusters or template cadence. Mixed metaphors (“tidal memory,” “winter-sun serenity”) are coherent within hybrid POV; no clarity loss at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: post-temporal library where identities migrate by moon phase, smelting becomes partial metabolism. Creel-as-archive obviates familiar data-death trope. Risk of lyric repetition pays off in final reprise; concept commits fully without exposition retreat. Specific detail “river-reed weave through sensors” makes abstraction lived.</comment>
