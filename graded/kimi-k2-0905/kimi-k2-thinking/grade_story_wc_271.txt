<comment>Elias’s interiority is textured through somatic memory—his fingers “remembering” her palm pressure anchors grief in flesh rather than therapy-speak. The contradiction between clinging to the photo and learning to release constant touch is dramatized in the final beat when he folds rather than cradles it. Micro-choices (sketching roots, pressing palm to bark) externalize quiet talent while accruing visible cost: the photo “seemed less crumpled,” implying the body now archives the memory. Closure earns Earned Stasis: he forecloses the old compulsive ritual with felt price—stillness that costs perpetual labor.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens taught by repetitive tactile beats (photo, bark, wind) that intensify rather than linearly cause. Orientation anchor (who-where-when) met by line 3; no disorientation. Closure is Charged Poise: final image of him descending while lighthouse “blinks” reweights earlier automation—his body becomes the human beam, cost legible in “heartbeat in his pocket.” Persistent constraint: he must return tomorrow to keep the light; no soft reset. All props (photo, eucalyptus, automated beam) track intact with causal state changes.</comment>

<comment>Monterey cypress bark grooves and salt wind are filtered through Elias’s forensic-architect eye, turning setting into tactile archive—tree as body-memory vault. The decommissioned lighthouse is not backdrop but conceptual constraint: automation versus human vigilance, resolved when his body becomes the new tower. Micro-setting (photo against bark) directly enables the freezing beat; setting thus charges closure. Sensory hierarchy favors touch over visual, matching somatic theme; no static postcarding.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake: convert raw grief into sustainable vigilance without denial. Escalation is textural—each return visit layers nacre around grit; tightening occurs when he realizes “freeze” must include the drone shadow, not exclude it. Agency visible in the final freeze: he chooses to hold both memory and wound, foreclosing infinite photo fondling. Cost is felt: perpetual labor of return (“he would be that keeper”). Coincidence absent; no antagonist needed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</question>
<comment>Theme emerges from reversal: optimism is not escape but full immersion in wound—“diving into its fullness.” Subtext carried by lighthouse automation vs human vigilance—technology cannot archive touch; only flesh can. Final image reweights “pearl of stillness” from escapist quiet to costly, ongoing responsibility. Resists moralizing; no character articulates thesis; curator’s line is oblique enough to function as poetic cue rather than author mouthpiece.</comment>

<comment>Third-person limited stays inside Elias’s perceptual signature—salt wind as her laughter, grooves as palm prints. Psychic distance tightens during freeze: prose fragments into sensory shards (“cool roughness became her palm”) without losing clarity. Distinct diction: “somatic markers,” “nacre,” “forensic architect” precise yet character-bound. No head-hop; curator’s dialogue stays external. Rhythm modulates: longer clauses for reflection, staccato for freeze instant. Voice cohesion maintained under peak pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops; no filler: “photo seemed less crumpled” does triple duty—shows change, implies cost, recharges motif. Metaphors precise: “pearl of stillness” links grit-to-nacre biological process to grief layering. Sentence variety: participial openers timed to emotional breath; no template cadence. High information density: single clause can anchor time, body, memory (“salt wind, her laughter”). Copy clean; pronoun antecedents unambiguous. Read-aloud rhythm varied without algorithmic drumbeat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Fusion of drone-wedding trauma with arboretum somatic-archive feels non-obvious; grief processed through tree bark rather than shrine or therapy room is fresh. “Quiet talent” trope inverted—skill used not to solve but to preserve sensation. Risk taken in lyric accumulative structure pays off: repetitive tactile freezes create trance momentum. Transformation test passed: swap setting or object and entire emotional engine collapses. No derivative premise penalty.</comment>
