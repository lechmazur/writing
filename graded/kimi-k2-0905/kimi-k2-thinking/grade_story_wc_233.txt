<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The queen’s interiority is vivid—velvet cloak catching thorns, breath as “only constant”—and her disenchantment is embodied rather than labelled. Yet the decisive surrender to sentinel-hood is asserted more than dramatized; we are told she “found she no longer belonged” rather than shown a micro-choice that costs her a concrete piece of self. The flaw is diagnostic summary in the climactic beat, softening the earned edge demanded at this length.</comment>

<comment>Causal chain holds: dream → climb → vision → surrender. The grotto’s memory-dump is elegantly foreshadowed by “bleeding starlight,” so the revelation feels inevitable, not ex machina. Closure lands as Charged Poise: “she had become the dream” reweights every prior image with conceptual cost—immortality as erasure. The slight dock is for an overture of court advisors that never materializes into on-page opposition, leaving the early stake a shade abstract.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Environment is protagonist: thorns grow upward, frost etches “lacy menace,” ember heat melts ice into “dangerous lace.” Each sensory layer is filtered through the queen’s fatigue—air “strangely patterned,” sky “purple into something that wasn’t quite night.” The cobalt grotto’s mineral drips and star-wounds constrain her final choice; stepping into the pool of light is physically irreversible. No orientation debt; anchors (who/where/when) are crisp within the first 60 words.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—will she surrender her name to stop the curse?—is signaled at “some mysteries were sealed.” Escalation is accumulative: each vertical foot trades warmth for identity, until the grotto’s heat liquefies the last option. The tightening is visible—“her memories were already fading” —but the price is more conceptual than visceral, keeping it shy of the 8.8 band where bodily cost would be felt on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without sermon: power = sacrifice, dynasty = cyclicide. The image of star-ember “fireflies” migrates from beauty to surveillance, reweighting wonder into burden. Final line “waiting for the next disenchanted queen” crystallizes the moral—monarchy is a dream that devours its dreamers—without stating it. The slight reserve is for a touch of abstract diction (“conceptual repricing”) that edges toward the metaphysical rather than the sensuous.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-liminal lyric voice sustains courtly diction—“silk slippers already soaked,” “stone teeth”—while compressing under altitude: sentences fragment into breath-spaced phrases mirroring thin-air hypoxia. No head-hop; camera stays inside the queen’s frost-narrowed perception. Patterned repetition (“lacy menace… dangerous lace”) is taught early and pays off when the same lace becomes the coronet of star-embers. Rhythm modulates from processional cadence to staccato gasp, aligning with ascent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Line-level craft is near-immaculate: no scaffold, no synonym churn, no mixed metaphors. Information density is high—one sentence often does three jobs (texture, motion, foreshadowing). The only micro-slip is “purple into something that wasn’t quite night,” where the escaped clause slightly diffuses the visual; a sharper verb could have pinned the sky. The final image of “star embers seeking their newest sister” lands clean and luminous.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>The “queen becomes mountain sentinel” trope is familiar, yet the specific mechanics—starlight as literal blood, frost as lace that crowns—feel freshly soldered. Risk is taken: second-person address (“you were never the dreamer”) appears only in the closing apothegm, but because the narrative has earned a mythic register, the shift reads as oracle, not gimmick. Transformation test fails if names are swapped, because the sensory palette is tied to alpine altitude and mineral light. A hairline minus for proximity to feminist-monarch-sacrifice narratives recently in vogue.</comment>
