<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Vorrin’s “underachiever” identity is dramatized through his patient, passive craft rather than trait-labels; the final refusal to extract the keystone is the earned culmination of a lifetime of valuing slowness over yield. Interiority stays concrete (“his hands growing more calloused as his magic grew more numb”). No secondary character on stage, so relationship bullets N/A. Cost is present: he surrenders pension, warmth, corporeal form—visible in the closing image of his body dimming to match the stone’s pulse.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Vorrin’s quiet refusal converts the mission into permanent self-sacrifice, creating a before/after legible in the final mist-image. Drive lens = Accumulative/Textural; cadence of dying-light repetitions tightens the stake until the last paragraph reweights “lingering luminance” as his own heartbeat. Cost is on-page: “his own light dimming to match its rhythm.” Orientation clear by 50-word mark; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Micro-setting success: the keystone itself functions as environment—its “single ivy leaf” and pulsing light constrain every choice once Vorrin reaches the pedestal. Icebound spire is sketched with chilling sensory economy (“air that accommodated impossibilities by keeping them perfectly preserved”). Spatial choreography clean; no geography drift. The final image of man-stone-mist fusion charges closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake = preservation of unpredictability vs industrial extraction. Escalation is situational pressure: each paragraph intensifies the cold clarity that the Refactory will erase the last wild trace. The single meaningful tightening occurs when Vorrin realizes there are no sigils to unstrap—his only remaining option is refusal. Cost is visible: eternal exile in frost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the keystone’s shift from quarry-item to sacred relic of inefficiency; no sentence states “theme is...” Final image reweights “lingering luminance” as the living resistance to automation. Subtext in the body-language of mist-walking: surrender as agency. Avoids thematic echo; no moralizing paragraph.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in compressed lyric cadence and alchemical diction (“stratopause,” “unstrap sequence,” “brilliant dimness”). Syntax mirrors diffusion: long breathy sentences during mist-walk, then crystalline fragments at the summit. No dialogue, so dialogue bullets N/A. POV distance remains tight third; no filter-verb clusters.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High information density: each sentence layers physical detail, world-rule, and emotional state. Rhythm controlled—mist ascent flows, summit snaps to brittle fragments. No paraphrase loops; metaphors consistent (“needle of frozen crystal,” “cathedral of dying light”). Final line lands clean without scaffold or sentimentality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fusion of industrial-magic-decline with lyric pilgrimage feels fresh; “Refactory” neologism and mist-walking mechanics grow from premise. Tropes (last magical artifact, frozen sky-prison) are repurposed through underachiever lens. Risk in quiet ending pays off—no spectacle, just stance crystallization. Specificity of “ivy-leaf” carving anchors vision.</comment>
