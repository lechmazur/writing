<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is concrete—her bioluminescence flickers with skepticism—and her micro-choices (tasting the ring, handing it over) embody the shift from mechanical certainty to sensory trust. The contradiction between luminous body and skeptical mind is felt in-scene, not declared. Renunciation of the ring costs her evidentiary proof, earning the closure stance. Voice stays idiosyncratic; no diagnostic self-labeling.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the transfer of the ring reweights knowledge— consensus becomes internalized, not artifacted. Causal chain holds: each taste notes a real electoral beat; ring’s relinquishment is the because/therefore pivot. Orientation anchor (“lavender bluff”) arrives by word 10; no penalty. Lens stays Accumulative; density, not twist, drives the turn.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The tin ring functions as micro-setting: its metallic flavors constrain every major beat and charge the final image when Elara pockets its quiet hum. Lavender bluff minerals, aurora ribbons, and root-chemical votes are filtered through gustatory perception, never tourist list. Spatial choreography is clean: ridge descent tracked, no impossible positions. Environment causally alters action—taste shifts decide timing of encounter.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will Elara accept unprovable weather consensus?—tightens when ring taste fuses forest vote with aurora plasma, foreclosing data-proof option. Cost is legible: she forfeits evidentiary certainty and future reporting power. Escalation is one deepening, not reversal, fitting Accumulative lens. Pressure stays coherent; coincidence only complicates arrival timing.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme—knowledge as sensory election rather than ownership—emerges through taste-shift imagery, never stated. Subtext resides in gesture of ring transfer: silence > thesis. Final image of “sap, starlight, coming rain” reweights earlier metallic tastes into planetary memory. No final-paragraph moralizing; resonance stays particular.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is distinct: synesthetic gustatory perception colors every observation (“flavor of old decisions”). Syntax stays controlled under aurora pressure; no head-hop. Diction within lexicon—no corporate register drift. Dialogue brief, natural, carries hail subtext. Rhythm modulates: long clauses for aurora sweep, fragments for taste sparks.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High information density: single sentences deliver electoral chemistry and body response simultaneously. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Mixed metaphors avoided—vehicles stay meteorological. Rhythm read-aloud clean. Minor purple tinge (“terrestrially cosmic”) forgiven as coined idiom taught early. Closure image crisp, uncluttered.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise—forests elect weather-carriers via root-vote tastable in recycled space tin—is non-obvious synthesis of terraforming, emergent systems, and sensory epistemology. Risk of gustasy narration paid off in coherent closure. Specific detail renders concept inevitable in hindsight; swap any term and story collapses. Transforms cli-fi trope into intimate ballot of flesh.</comment>
