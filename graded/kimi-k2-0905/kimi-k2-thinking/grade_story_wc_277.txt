<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Victoria’s contradictory impulses—dread of paternal guilt versus hunger for editorial integrity—stay alive in every beat; the rosewood nib as blood-drawn stylus literalises the cost. Her decision to send the counter-memo is not an epiphany but the culmination of twenty years of micro-choices, each one seeded by the mirrored images of telescope/black-hole. The only restraint from 9+ is that the board’s power is asserted more than shown; a single glare from an actual editor would have tightened the crucible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is unmistakable: the scanned memo flying out at 3 a.m. reconfigures both public trust and her private orbit, and the indent her father’s nib leaves in the desk is the visible price. The causal chain—phone call → catalogue of red-ink absences → proof-by-contradiction memo → transmission—never loosens. The drive lens (Causal) is held without waver; every beat is because/therefore. Earned Stasis is achieved: she can no longer remain a silent satellite.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The observatory is not backdrop but gravitational hardware: the dome’s height and the ticking grandfather clock convert into physical pressure (“each second an accusation”). Micro-setting works through the nib and the table’s mahogany grain, both of which constrain the final ceremonial signature. Fog dissolving into gold at dawn externalises the decay of opaque regret. Only the lack of a sensory anchor for temperature or smell keeps this from 9.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—paper’s credibility versus public health—tightens when Victoria realises silence once birthed three more spills. The reversal is her refusal to sign the kill memo; the cost is filial betrayal carved into the desk. Under the causal lens, each red-ink absence escalates the moral arithmetic until intervention becomes the only internally consistent act. The pressure curve is one smooth ascent, sufficient for this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the imagery chain: telescope (witness) versus black hole (suppression) reweighted so the paper must become the telescope. No character states the thesis; instead the final line “better to be the telescope than the black hole” offers Conceptual Repricing. Moral ambiguity lingers—her act may still sink the paper—yet the piece refuses to sermonise. The emotional aftereffect is awe at the cost of seeing clearly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The narrative voice carries an astronomic cadence—“orbits of regret,” “gravity well of silence”—that remains consistent and character-specific. Compression such as “headlines dissolving into mist” teaches the reader to accept metaphoric density early. No head-hopping; psychic distance stays close to Victoria’s calibrated lens. The solemn-playful tension is voiced through ironic precision (“cosmic joke”) without ever flattening into committee prose.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm alternates between long gravitational sentences and short stellar bursts—“the nib was sharp enough to draw blood.” No filter-verb stacks or paraphrase loops; each sentence either advances image, stakes, or causal link. Figurative language is patterned (celestial mechanics) and therefore coherent rather than purple. The only micro-slip is “echoing observatory” used twice within sixty words, a hairline repetition that does not touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Father-daughter newspaper guilt is familiar terrain, but the astronomic metaphor system (event horizon, orbital decay, telescope vs black hole) feels freshly synthesized and inevitable in hindsight. The proof-by-contradiction method borrowed from mathematics re-casts editorial ethics as a logical proof, a risk that sharpens rather than obscures stakes. Specificity—“three more chemical spills,” “2003”—grounds the concept. The final supernova image of the nib is earned, not gimmicky.</comment>
