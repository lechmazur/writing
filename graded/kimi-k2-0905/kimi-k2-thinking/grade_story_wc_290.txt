<comment>Elara’s claustrophobia and compass-hand tremor are shown, not labeled, and her micro-choice to press the copper tip into stone despite panic is a crisp beat that earns the key. Interiority stays concrete (“the metallic whisper that echoed the organ's lowest note”), anchoring her contradictory impulses. No secondary character appears, so relationship bullets are waived; the compass as heirloom grandfather-relic supplies credible motive without over-telling. The final renunciation—treasure is knowledge, not gold—carries visible cost as she re-imagines the city’s future, satisfying earned stasis.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the blueprint library reweights the quest from artifact to possibility; cost is the silence of the now-useless organ and her own shaken hands. Causal lens holds: each descending beat is “therefore” driven by compass geometry and sonic mapping. Orientation is clean—catacomb depth, church above, night—by line 5. Minor slip: “the city began to stir” is off-stage; still, the reconfiguration is on-page, so the quick test passes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Copper-tipped compass and star-painted vault function as micro-setting that constrains every move; the phantom circle etched in dust is a tactile anchor. Sensory selection narrows to sound (organ bass) and touch (metallic whisper) under panic, obeying POV bias. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly: mortar façade → compass center → press → door sigh. No world-rule contradiction; church acoustics and geometry are consistent. The vault’s constellation ceiling recharges the “blueprint” motif at closure, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—retrieve the key—tightens once: the compass must pierce stone at the exact sonic peak, foreclosing retreat. Pressure is situational but coherent: walls literally breathe malevolence, forcing her stance crystallization. Cost is visceral: panic spike, organ silence, and the realization that treasure is responsibility. No off-stage rescue; the reversal is her hand turning the key. Sufficient for this length, though a second tightening would lift it higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme—“spaces can be reimagined”—emerges from the blueprint library reveal, never stated. Subtext lives in the copper patina shared by compass and key, quietly linking past tools to future redesign. Final image of her tracing a new line on blank vellum reweights earlier geometry obsession without moralizing. Ambiguity is purposeful: will the city embrace her vision? The wistful rebellion tone stays intact, resisting tidy thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Third-person hovers at a lyric distance that matches the organ’s resonance; diction stays within Elara’s perceptual lexicon (“prismatic desire,” “sonic tempest”). Rhythm accelerates under panic—sentence fragments mimic breath-tightening—then lengthens at starlight release. No dialogue, so evaluation is for narrative voice only; the compass’s “metallic whisper” is a clean sensory metaphor that doesn’t drift into purple. Pattern of echoing “whisper” at door and closure is taught early and pays off, satisfying 9+ control.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Sentence variety is strong; no template cadence runs. Information density high: one line can do setting, emotion, and causality (“The organ's crescendo peaked... and in that sonic tempest, she saw a faint outline of a door”). Only minor scaffold: “the city began to stir” is external filler; cutting it would sharpen. Metaphors stay coherent (organ as ghostly guide, stone as breathing foe) without mixed logic. No artifact touches closure; final line is image-driven and clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Familiar quest trope is refreshed by sonic cartography—organ music as corridor map—and the inversion that treasure is unbuilt futures, not gold. Copper patina bridging compass, key, and blueprints feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk of claustrophobic POV inside stone lungs is bold and heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specificity of “drafting compass point” as both tool and legacy keeps it from generic explorer tale.</comment>
