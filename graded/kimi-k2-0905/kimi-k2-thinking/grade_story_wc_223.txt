<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kael’s interiority is concrete and embodied; his tremor on the marble ‘r’ shows interior contradiction under pressure. His micro-choice—handing over the pawns—is a visible hierarchy of values with social cost. One slip: his “I am a historian” line flirts with diagnostic self-labeling, but is saved by the follow-up gesture of stepping. The final renunciation (staying) is earned by prior causal steps and bears real opportunity cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the reverse walk repatterns the gallery from prison to archive, cost legible in Kael’s solitude. Causal chain holds: because he walks the word, therefore the panel opens, therefore the past is restorable, therefore he stays. Orientation is anchored by the 60-word mark; the “interregnum” cities cape and vacant throne cue who/where/when. One hairline slip: the nomadic penumbra’s leader is quoted without prior on-page seed, but the line is paid off by Kael’s final vow.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The whispering gallery itself acts as tool: its acoustic properties dictate the spelling method and constrain every footfall. The chessboard’s missing pawns return as carved fragments, their tactile state altering later choice. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true—Kael notices echo-location, not décor. One minor drift: “luminous absence” is repeated thrice, flattening rather than deepening; still, the final image recharges it.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore erased memory—signaled in the first sentence. Pressure tightens once: the ‘m’ step triggers the groan, narrowing option from search to rescue. Cost is visible: Kael forfeits mobility (stays, turns gallery into archive) and accepts guardianship of trauma. Agency is sustained; coincidence complicates but does not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the recurring pawn image: the smallest pieces re-weighted from absence to agency. No explicit thesis; the final vow “never forget the pawns lost” is spoken through action (reverse walk) rather than sermon. Subtext in silence: the prisoner’s blink carries the history small gestures defied. The gallery’s echo turns memory into acoustic resistance—earned wisdom without platitude.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Kael’s perceptual filter—only his heels, scars, and spatial math. Distinct rhythmic signature: Latinate diction (“interregnum, penumbra”) counter-pointed by monosyllabic steps (“r-e-m-e-m-b-e-r”). No head-hopping; prisoner’s interior is rendered only through observable blink and hand-mark. Filter verbs appear but are voice-motivated (“the gallery caught his steps”). Final cadence mirrors opening, teaching the pattern.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and stress; high-pressure beats compress to fragments (“spelling hope”). No synonym loops or template cadence. Metaphors stay coherent: “ghost who learned to cast a shadow” marries profession to ontology. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by action that recharges motif. Zero scaffolding; each sentence advances image, motion, or consequence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses crisis-actor profession with post-massacre restorer, a synthesis not seen in prior fiction. The walking-spelling mechanic literalizes memory-as-geometry, turning architectural acoustics into insurgent archive. Risk—lyric accumulative structure—pays off when backward walk re-weights every prior step. Specific detail (carving pawns from palace wreckage) anchors freshness; removal would collapse thematic and causal logic.</comment>
