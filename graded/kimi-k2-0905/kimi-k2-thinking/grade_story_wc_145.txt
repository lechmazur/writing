<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Kael’s quiet obsession with “beginnings” is vivid, but his interiority drifts into lyrical summary (“charted beginnings… tracked beginnings”) rather than embodied contradiction. The falcon feather and phrasebook act as extensions of will, yet no micro-choice on the page visibly risks or costs him anything until he kneels on the ice. The final transfiguration reads as mystical reward, not earned renunciation, because prior beats never pit his need against a live limitation or loss.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: Kael becomes the source, rivers unspring, maps are obsolete—cost is the obliteration of the observer-self. Causality is lyric-associative rather than strict, but the pattern (condensation → feather → crack → dissolution) is taught early and holds. The single causal gap: how “reading” frost translates to physical dissolution is asserted, not bridged, keeping the piece just under the 9+ gate.</comment>

<comment>Corrugated metal, rusted rivets, and the frozen lake’s forgotten shape give tactile, POV-filtered specificity. The phrasebook dog-ear and condensation on glass function as micro-settings that literally steer the plot. Weather is not backdrop but oracle: the ice’s whisper in seven languages forces the final stance. Only the outpost’s interior layout remains vague, preventing full 9-band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“to find where the rivers begin”—is signaled early and re-weighted when the answer becomes “where they remember they are water,” a deepening rather than reversal. Pressure escalates through pattern accumulation (falcon, feather, condensation, crack) rather than antagonistic opposition; the tightening is lyrical but legible. No visible price is exacted from Kael before the transfiguration, so the escalation feels observational, not personally costly.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as the cartographer’s need to fix origins dissolving into the recognition that sources are relational, not locatable. The phrasebook’s worn page and the falcon’s wordless feather carry the idea without sermon. Final line risks overt thesis (“endings are beginnings reversed”) but is saved by the preceding image of Kael stepping into the weeping ice, letting the reader feel the conceptual flip rather than merely read it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Kael’s perceptual filter: frost as text, ice as archive, rivers as language. Syntax stretches into poetic cadence (“the lake breathed slowly”) yet remains anchored to his cartographer’s gaze. No head-hopping or register drift; even the archaic “herald” feels consistent with his apprenticeship lore. The voice modulates under pressure—final beats shorten, clauses fracture like the ice itself.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but purposeful: each sentence layers image, myth, and tactile detail. Occasional metaphor stacking (“dark comma against the white page of sky”) borders on excess yet serves the text-as-map motif. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; pronouns track cleanly. One mixed vehicle—“mirror of the worrying tranquility”—momentarily blurs agency, keeping the score below 9.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The inversion of cartography—maps erased by the reader becoming the source—feels fresh and inevitable. Condensation cryptography and a phrasebook of thaw-dialects refract a familiar quest into linguistic mysticism without gimmickry. Risk is taken: a quiet, metaphysical dissolution replaces conventional climax, but groundwork in pattern and image pays off. Not quite singular, yet memorable.</comment>
