<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The fiddler’s contradictory fear-of-loss/need-to-sing impulses are embodied in trembling fingers and the decision to decode wind-map; interiority is concrete, specific, and drives every beat. No second character on page, so status lens waived. Flaw: “pixelated amnesty” is diagnostic jargon delivered twice without embodied cost; slight therapy-speak. Final renunciation—burying the past via song—lands with visible relief, satisfying Earned Stasis.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the new bridge-song crystallizes options—ashes of “never” become fertile—cost felt in the hush after last note. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of glass–scaffold–grove intensifies, cadence deepens, meaning reweighted. Orientation anchored by word 80; deliberate disorientation (pixelated world) later pays off in closure image. No teleport props; Morse-scaffold logic is taught and obeyed. Cost legible: “weight of the past lift” tied to playing.</question>

<comment>Pine-thick air, moonlit shards, and scaffold-wrap Morse create tactile, choice-guiding environment; recurring glass flake functions as micro-setting that charges final image. Details filtered through musician’s bias: notices sound of plastic, translates flutter into location, uses fiddle as shovel. No white-room; spatial track clean from pullout → gravel path → cairn. World rules consistent; no anachronism. 9+ gate met: glass shard constrains choice and reappears to charge closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—transform ghost-silence into living song—signaled early; pressure tightens when scaffold wind spells a real location, forcing trek & dig. One meaningful escalation under Accumulative lens: each artifact (glass, wrap, tin) ups density, narrows option to retreat. Protagonist agency: decodes, walks, opens, plays—cost sweat & tremor visible. No coincidence resolves; final song is renunciation, not victory, satisfying Earned Stasis.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme of resurrection-through-art emerges via concrete chain: ghost → map → buried photo → new melody; no explicit moral. Subtext carried in gesture—bow scraped “each silence an answer.” Final image of wrap dancing to fiddle reweights earlier random flutter into collaborative chorus, offering Conceptual Repricing. Avoids tidy binary; ambiguity lingers—song may or may not free ghost—yet emotional aftereffect palpable.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person omniscient stays tight to fiddler’s perceptual signature: sound-first, metaphor of music-as-language, synesthetic “pixelated night.” Rhythm mirrors breath: long lyrical sentences in calm, staccato fragments under discovery. No dialogue, so voice contamination avoided. Scaffold wrap “Morse code” phrase is repeated with rising urgency, pattern taught and paid off. Register stable—poetic yet grounded in mountain idiom. 9+ quick test met: perceptual signature distinct, rhythmic control heightens closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies: anaphora “each note… each silence” accelerates tension; final paragraph lengthens to mirror song release. High density: single sentence often does scene-work, emotion, image. No loops or synonym churn; “pixelated” recurs with evolving meaning, not artifact. Mixed metaphors absent. Minor scaffold: “luminous disbelief” repeated; slightly abstract but ties to closure, forgiven. Closure image (“wrap danced in time”) crystallizes without figurative muddle.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Familiar trope—musician communes with ghost—made fresh by scaffold-wrap Morse code as map, wet-plate shard as mirror to past, pixelation metaphor linking analog & digital memory. Synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight: every flutter foreshadows final duet. Risk taken with wind-as-language pays off, reconfigures meaning. Specificity of collodion glass and cairn grove roots story in lived world. Not derivative; transformation test passed—swap elements, logic collapses.</comment>
