<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s embodied thaw is vivid—tears as “notes she could finally feel” lands—but her interior contradiction stays static; we never see her resist or doubt the magic process, so the change feels administered rather than earned. The drum-maker’s silence mirrors hers, yet he exerts no pressure; their relationship is a tableau, not a crucible. Still, the final micro-choice—carving the groove into the drum—ties cost to action and satisfies the 9- gate for one character.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the filament of hush reweights silence into song, cost is legible in the carved groove and carried drum. Causality is Accumulative/Textural—each image thickens the mirrored hush until the cadence shift at the final beat—so the lens holds. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no teleporting props. The only drag is the late rule reveal that backward vinyl can “carve” silence; the payoff is beautiful but not primed, keeping this just under 9.</comment>

<comment>The cavern’s cold stone air and “echo of forgotten rhythms” act as micro-setting that literally receives the carved filament; the drum skin and needle function as environment-in-hand, constraining the final gesture. Sensory hierarchy favors touch over sound, matching POV. Seasonal rustle returns in the last line, recharging the stake. Meets 9- gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—defeat emotional numbness—is signaled in line 1. Pressure intensifies texturally: each reversed pulse thickens the “cotton silence” until it fractures; the visible price is the tear-track and the permanent carved groove. No coincidence; escalation is one sustained deepening that forecloses the option of remaining numb. Cost is legible, but the absence of an external test or antagonist keeps this just outside the 8.8 band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: deafness as bridge, not barrier. The mirrored hush reweights silence from absence to substance without moralizing. Final image—drumbeat felt in the chest—offers a non-literal answer to the central question. No thematic echo or platitudes.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays tight to Elara’s tactile bias; syntax lengthens and softens during the enthrallment, then snaps short on the carved tap. No dialogue, so no voice leakage. Perceptual signature—“notes she could finally feel”—is character-specific and recurs at closure. Meets 9- gate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with the beats: long sentences for the cavern hush, staccato for the drum tap. Figurative language is sparse and coherent—no mixed metaphors. Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or stake. Clean copy. One hairline slip—“shimmering with a faint filament of hush” edges purple but serves concept, so no deduction.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The backward vinyl carving silence is a fresh synthesis; the deaf music teacher trope is elevated by tactile reversal rather than inspirational cliché. Risk—magic phonograph—commits fully and pays off in the final carved groove. Specificity of the snapped needle and hide drum keeps it from feeling gimmick. Not quite a 9 because the drum-maker remains archetype, not individual.</comment>
