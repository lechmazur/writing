<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kael’s contradictory impulses—duty to the lanterns vs. ache to recover Mara’s memory—are shown through embodied micro-choices (scaling the ladder, chipping the crystal). The final renunciation of speech with Mara carries visible cost and is earned by the prior causal chain. Interiority stays concrete, avoiding label-speak. A hairline slip: the “navigation almanac she didn’t recognize” is told, not shown in scene, keeping it just shy of 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the wildflowers-keyed crystal fracture restores Mara’s violet memory, reweighting the world’s rule that deleted memories are irretrievable. Cost is legible in Kael’s exhausted stumble and the new quiet of the lanterns. Causal lens holds: every beat (coffee map → fifth piling → chamber → crystal → home) is linked by therefore/because. No orientation debt; anchors clear by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The harbor’s gravity pockets and salt-crystal chamber are not backdrop; they constrain every step (wrench weight, inward-pulling crystals) and charge the final image of steady lantern flames. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true—Kael notices brine pumps he saw as a boy, not tourist filler. Micro-setting (the lantern hook as pry-bar) alters tactics. Meets 9+ gate: environment shapes tactics and final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—recover Mara’s lost memory—is signaled by breakfast-eye-emptiness line 4. Escalation tightens once: the spiral of coffee grounds narrows options to the fifth piling, forcing bodily cost under fluctuating gravity. Agency stays with Kael; no coincidence resolves. Price is crystallized in the eardrum-press silence and the whale-bones-becoming-fertilizer counterweight felt off-page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the inversion of grief: the planet’s mourning swallows memories, yet private love exhumes them. The violet scent refracted from crystal reweights “deleted” from irreversible to bearable. No moralizing; final image of whale-song carrying deleted memories offers resonant non-literal answer. Subtext in pressed flowers as both key and prayer avoids thematic echo.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Kael’s perceptual signature—harbor mist slicks his palms, silence rings like weight. Rhythm modulates: long gravity-laden sentences drag, then fracture into crystalline shards at the climax. Diction within POV lexicon; no filter-verb clutter. Dialogue is absent by design, so voice evaluation rests on interior texture, which remains distinct and coherent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; no template cadence or synonym loops. High information density: one sentence often sets atmosphere, advances action, and foreshadows (e.g., “lanterns above burning steady…first time since dawn”). Mixed-metaphor risk—“cotton wool soaked in starlight”—is borderline but fits POV’s synesthetic bent and does not obscure causality. No artifacts in closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses maritime magical realism with neuroscience grief—memory as mineral deposit—feeling inevitable yet fresh. Transformation test fails if violets or gravity crystals swapped. Risk in lyric compression (coffee-ground cartography) pays off by crystallizing the final image. No close echoes; whale-song carrying deleted memories offers new mythic logic.</comment>
