<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The coachman’s interior contradiction—silent ferryman of grief yet compelled to sing life back into dead ground—is dramatized through embodied micro-choices: scattering pods, digging for moisture, whispering in forbidden tongues. Each action exacts a palpable cost (dust in lungs, cracked skin, voice raw). The final stance—continuing to plant while knowing the war-dead remain present—earns its quiet renunciation. Only the absence of a second on-page character keeps this from the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the battlefield’s transformation into garden reweights the premise—memory and death now share breath with bloom. The lens is Accumulative/Textural: cadence of dead languages, seed dust, and bird-calls layer until the final image crystallizes option and cost. Causality holds: because he sings, the pods crack; because he listens, he finds water; because he persists, the grey scar softens. Cost is visible in the cracked pods, the raw voice, and the nightly return that forecloses rest.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The blooming jetty’s rotting planks and glowing petals constrain every move: he can only plant where wood meets water, only hear the submerged concord at twilight. The reef’s ghost—limestone moisture beneath cracked earth—literally feeds the seedlings, binding setting to tactic. Spatial choreography is immaculate: coach→jetty→battlefield→garden, each zone tracked by boot-sink and gull-cry. The final image of “narrow vastness” is charged by the jetty’s thin line against sky, making setting inseparable from closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reclaim battlefield with garden—is signaled in paragraph three and tightens when the grey earth first refuses seed. The mid-story reversal: gull-map reveals hidden moisture, turning impossible ground into conditional possibility. Persistent constraint: each pod spent is one memory gone; each chant taxes the voice that must return tomorrow. Cost is legible in cracked pods, raw throat, and the nightly repetition that forecloses other life.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through pattern, not statement: dead languages + living shoots = memory and renewal co-exist. The submerged concord reframes loss not as erasure but shared breath, paid off when “living and dead share the same breath” in the final paragraph. No moralizing—final image of nightly seed-vow lets resonance linger. Ambiguity remains: garden does not erase scar, only renegotiates it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays tightly fused to coachman’s perceptual signature: seabird syntax he alone decodes, dust taste of pods, ache of knees against parched earth. Dead-language diction flavors prose without pastiche; rhythm lengthens during chants, shortens during dig. No head-hopping; psychic distance stable. Compression (“narrow vastness”) taught early and paid off in final line.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image, sound, or stakes. Figurative layer is spare—dust like “tiny ships” once—never clogs the beat. Syntax modulates with labor: long breathless clauses during chant, staccato during gull-cry map. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and re-charge motif without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fusing WWI-haunted coachman, eco-ghost-reef, and ornithomancy feels inevitable yet unseen. Risk: entire plot hinges on learning bird-calls—executed so convincingly the fantastical reads as folk science. Transformation test fails if any layer swapped. Final “narrow vastness” coinage crystallizes new emotional geography. Bold, specific, irreplaceable.</comment>
