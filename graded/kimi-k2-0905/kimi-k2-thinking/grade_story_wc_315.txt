<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid—“muscle memory,” “cold metal,” “heartbeat matched the hum”—but motivation stays abstract: “preserve trust” is asserted, never tested by contradictory desire. No interior contradiction surfaces; the revision sequence proceeds smoothly, so the choice carries no visible cost to character. The buckle-as-token is evocative yet static; it never jeopardizes or re-weights his identity. Earned change is missing; the ending posture is resolute continuation, not foreclosure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Closure is a quiet Charged Poise: manual override locks, tether stabilizes, guardian returns to vigil—cost is implied (eternal watch) but not dramatized. Causal chain is thin: “tether failing” → revise sequence → vibration confirms fix; no intermediate obstacle or knowledge twist. Orientation clean by 120 w; no teleport props; world rules (floating arbor, data vines) stay consistent. Lens is situational-ritual; pattern holds, yet escalation plateaus rather than tightens.</comment>

<comment>“Nocturnal arbor above the clouds” is sketched with synesthetic shorthand—starlight on metal, sway of branches, low hum—economy over breadth. Micro-setting (buckle, control interface, breath-mist) constrains the revision act and reappears in final image, meeting 9+ gate. Selective sensory triage reflects crisis: cold, vibration, click—visual dominance justified by night watch. No geography drift; spatial choreography stays tight in one perch.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade>
<comment>Single stake—tether integrity—signaled early; pressure is steady, not escalating: no new data, time squeeze, or personal risk introduced after the call. Agency present (manual override) but choice is technically smooth, consequence external (city saved) rather than personal cost. No reversal or trade-off; tension rests on atmospheric repetition rather than narrowing options. Closure hum offers reassurance, not irreversible loss.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Theme of custodial burden emerges imagistically—buckle, echo, pattern seeking—rather than thesis. Final image of stars as “distant eyes” reweights earlier vigil as cosmic surveillance, satisfying resonance test. No moral spelled; ambiguity lingers on whether perpetual watch is salvation or curse. Yet theme is monocellular: no competing value (duty vs. self) is staged, so complexity is limited.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric-technical, consistent diction—data pulse, arbor, pattern seeker—tuned to lone sentinel’s precision. Rhythm modulates: long breathy sentences under stars, staccato clicks during override. Compression taught early (“soundless echo”) and repaid in closure. No dialogue, hence no voice leakage; perceptual signature remains tight and idiosyncratic.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm is fluid, but mild scaffold loops recur: “the watcher’s burden” / “soundless echo” each appear 4× without new inflection; “pattern seeker” echoed in opening and close feels template-tag. Metaphors stay coherent (tether as lifeline, stars as eyes) yet verge on stock. No mixed vehicles, but density of figurative filler in climactic beat dulls impact. High information density otherwise—each sentence layers sensory + operational data.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Floating night-arbor data-tree is fresh visual synthesis; guardian trope is familiar but re-cast as tech-shaman. Risk taken with lyric repetition instead of plot reversals—coherence achieved yet stakes feel safe. Concept commits fully; no retreat to exposition. Could swap arbor for orbital station with minor edits, limiting “inevitable in hindsight” test.</comment>
