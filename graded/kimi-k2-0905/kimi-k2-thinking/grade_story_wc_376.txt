<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The calligrapher’s body-as-plant conceit is consistently embodied (curled leaves under evasion) and her micro-choices (telling the guard the truth, pressing the reel to her palm) carry visible cost; the buried memory on the final reel is set up by earlier guilt, making her renunciation earned rather than an epiphany.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative lens: each magnetic reel adds density of candor until the climactic playback of her own voice reframes stakes; the ending’s Charged Poise—the reel on the desk, gold leaf brushed across the label—reweights the premise with conceptual cost: she must keep choosing candor or wilt. No causal leaps; transitions are legible, closure lands on page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Glass greenhouse city, rusted ladder, brittle tapes, and the zinc fragment as micro-setting all constrain movement and supply tactile stakes; the toxic sky remains a persistent pressure, mirrored by her curl-response. Spatial choreography is clean across shards; sensory selection narrows under urgency (sour air, hissing tape). The fragment’s etched lines literally guide her hand to the hidden reel—object-as-setting that charges final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single dominant stake—recovering lost honest speech—tightens when each reel’s candor re-illuminates her own buried lie; the guard scene provides the mid-text cost test (truth vs. physical pain). Escalation is accumulative: every truthful playback adds luminous contrast to her prior cowardice, narrowing her options until she must shoulder the reel’s weight. Closure crystallizes the ongoing cost: honesty is no state but constant practice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from pattern, not sermon: wilting/candor/gilding recur with escalating stakes; the final action—gilding the reel label—renders the moral as tactile labor, not statement. Subtext in the guard’s “slick” evasion and the neighbor’s watering tears carries the emotional after-effect. Conceptual repricing: honesty becomes an organic, photosynthetic act—maintenance, not triumph. No late moral sentences; final image alone suffices.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person lyric voice maintains consistent vegetal diction (“glass forest,” “gilded leaves,” “soil of memory”) without register drift. Rhythm modulates: longer clauses for lamplight studio, clipped fragments under ladder descent. No head-hopping; perceptual signature remains plant-sensitive (curl, wilt, shimmer). Compression taught early—“conversations vanishing into the vents”—and paid off by reel hiss.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density: single sentences do triage work (sensory, world-rule, interior ache). Zero filter-verb stacks; strong verbs anchor motion (“she touched one, and the tape hissed”). Metaphors stay within vegetal logic—no mixed vehicles. Parallax loop check clean; no synonym churn. Opening and closing lines create echo-cradle (“glass forest” ↔ “oasis of memory”) without template cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The candor-as-botany conceit is fresh synthesis; postal plate fragment as compass repurposes steampunk relic into moral tech. Risk in quiet ending (no rebellion, no rain) commits fully—conceptual repricing instead of plot pyrotechnics. Transformation test fails if relocated outside greenhouse-archive dyad, confirming specificity. Familiar eco-dystopia elevated by interiorized physiology rather than exterior revolt.</comment>
