<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses—scientific detachment vs. visceral surrender to the forest’s grief—are alive in every beat; the moment she kneels and lets the stillpoint “seep into her bones” is the visible cost that earns her later quiet blaze. Interiority is textured through synesthetic perception, never label-speak. The ring’s cooling→warming arc tracks her shifting hierarchy of values without exposition. Blind spots (she cannot see constellations) compound the stakes, making her endurance the only credible resolution.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the ring’s final stillness reconfigures the premise that maps are external; the cost is the irreversible internalization of her mother’s silence. Causality holds: each ultrasonic note she traces (beat 1) → ring torque westward (beat 2) → silence node (beat 3) → crystallized blaze. Orientation anchored by word 30 (“vibrating bark”). No lens ambiguity; accumulative texture intensifies until the hinge-night image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Body-as-setting functions as primary constraint: palms, forehead, pores become the cartographic surface. Ultrasonic forest is not backdrop but instrument—lichen notes physically redirect her feet. Platinum ring’s temperature shift is a micro-climate that charges the final image. Spatial choreography clean: trees tighten westward, earth’s heartbeat tracked through boot soles.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—locate a mappable geography of grief—tightens when the forest’s silence cancels every frequency, foreclosing retreat; the price is absorbing the unsaid bedside words. One meaningful deepening: the ring needle spins inward, renaming the quest from cartography to autobiography. Agency remains hers; coincidence complicates (constellation hinge) but does not resolve. Cost is visible: the ring’s stillness = path foreclosed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: maps drawn on skin > paper; the final star-flare is the non-literal answer to “where is grief?” No moralizing, only reconfiguration. Subtext of maternal cartography surfaces once—“her mother had also been a mapmaker”—then accrues through the ring’s warmth. Emotional aftereffect lingers as quiet blaze rather than assertion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is synesthetic, blind, and frequency-driven: “language of shivers,” “lichen etched in major lifts.” Rhythm modulates from long ultrasonic sentences to the abrupt pocket of silence, mirroring cardiac cadence. Diction stays within tactile lexicon; no vision-based metaphors. Compression taught early—“forest sang beyond hearing”—and paid off when silence becomes the single audible note.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops; no filter-verb stacks. Information density high: one sentence often layers sensory input, memory, and torque direction. Metaphors are internally coherent (constellation hinge, compass inward) and do not collide. Final line “map of quiet blaze” is crystalline, no scaffolding.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Premise—blind dowser mapping grief via ultrasonic forest—feels inevitable, not gimmicky. Risk: grief as literal geography could collapse into abstraction, but stakes stay visceral via skin-absorbed notes. Synthesis of synesthesia + cartography + maternal silence is fresh; removing any layer collapses the engine. No close literary echoes.</comment>
