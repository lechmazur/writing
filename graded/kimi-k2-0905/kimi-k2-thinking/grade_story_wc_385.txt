<comment>The Echo Singer’s interior contradiction—hunger to preserve echoes vs. the wound of her own lost love—remains abstract; no micro-choice on the page shows her risking or forfeiting anything concrete. Her “final crescendo” is summarized, not dramatized, so the renunciation costs no visible stamina, breath, or social price. The seashell’s warming pulse is the sole embodied cue; everything else is lyrical assertion. Still, her perceptual signature is vivid and consistent, lifting the score above mid-band.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the canyon murmurs the sung name, the shell falls silent, and stance crystallizes—“keeper of echoes.” Cost is conceptual (eternal melancholy) but not felt on the page; no prior beat shows what she forfeits by accepting the role. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern taught early and paid off, yet the single causal tightening is the off-stage decision to “sing it into the canyon,” un-shown. Orientation is clear by line 3; no penalty, but the missing dramatized turn caps entry to the 6-band.</comment>

<comment>Setting is the story’s engine: the serpentine nexus actively swallows starlight, exhales secrets, and shudders under the weight of truth. Micro-setting objects—seashell half, reed-blown note—constrain tactics; the shell’s warming pulse charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clean; starlight cracks map a legible web across the floor. Sensory economy is excellent; canyon humidity, rock temperature, and acoustic layers serve the lyric mode without tourist catalog.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—preserve echoes vs. conspiracy of silence—is signaled early and reiterated, but the antagonistic pressure is atmospheric, not agentive. Escalation is textural: density of echoes increases, knowledge deepens, but no live option is foreclosed; the singer was always going to sing. The sole tightening is the off-page decision to channel the lover’s echo; because it is un-dramatized, cost is conceptual, not tactile. Still, the accretive pattern is coherent under the Accumulative lens, keeping the score in the high-6 pocket.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</question>
<comment>Theme—memory as wound, echo as immortality—emerges through recurrent image of the seashell filling with stolen voices; no explicit thesis stated. Final image of the singer as “quiet seashell half” reweights prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates in silence: the canyon’s final smile is an ambiguous acceptance of endless sorrow. Reed-blown melancholy saturates every paragraph, yet avoids sentimentality by concrete acoustic detail.</comment>

<comment>Third-person lyric voice sustains a distinct perceptual signature: “walls humming with the secret song of the universe.” Syntax coils like the canyon—long vowel chains, anaphoric pulses—mirroring breath-based song. No dialogue, so no register drift. Compression and elision are taught early (“the canyon twisted…”) and remain legible at closure; no head-hopping or filter-verb clusters.</comment>

<comment>Rhythmic control is exemplary; sentence length modulates to mimic breath and echo decay. Information density high: one sentence often layers sensory, metaphoric, and thematic work. Minor loop: “reed-blown melancholy” is repeated verbatim five times, creating template cadence that dulls the final beat; −0.4. No mixed metaphors or scaffold sentences. Opening and closing lines are sharply image-anchored, propelling momentum.</comment>

<comment>Premise—acoustic archaeologist in singing canyon—is fresh, yet the conspiracy-of-silence trope is abstract and untransformed. Seashell-as-archive is a lovely specific, not seen before. Risk-taking lies in lyric accumulative structure rather than plot surprise; coherence holds. Emotional specificity of “resonant wound” prevents generic template feel, though the lover-echo twist is forecast early.</comment>
