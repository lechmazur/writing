<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Kael’s grief-borne obsession is vivid, but interiority veers into poetic self-diagnosis (“this was purpose without promise”) that flattens contradiction. No second character on-page, so relationship crucible absent; micro-choices (locking coordinates, sealing geode) show hierarchy of values yet feel pre-scripted by concept. Earned stasis is present—she accepts witness over extraction—but the cost is asserted, not dramatized on body or future. Voice remains lyrically consistent, but emotional specificity is sometimes abstracted to theme.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: pattern of micro-perturbations + crystalline memory builds to charged poise. Orientation clear by line 6; no penalty. Closure unit = resonant reconfiguration: “infinitely remembered” reweights premise; cost is conceptual (grief archived, not relieved). However, causality between geode-readings and internal shift is implied, not demonstrated; no tangible constraint carried into tomorrow weakens cost visibility.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Floating observatory, drone-wrecked cathedral ruins, cooling breakers—selective, sensory, grounded via Kael’s engineer-grief filter. Micro-setting of geode and scanner constrains every beat; spatial choreography tight (tilt, steady, transfer slot). Atmosphere mirrors theme: high-altitude chill = emotional stasis. Setting subtly guides choice—twenty-minute cooling window is literal clock and moral frame—qualifies 9+ gate but object, not environment, dominates final image, capping at 8.8.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—map the geography of never-was—signalled early. One meaningful tightening: breaker countdown narrows window, forces final scan choice. Agency is attention/renunciation (she seals data, doesn’t weaponize it); cost is opportunity—knowledge stays inert, grief unalleviated. Pressure coherent under accumulative lens; no reversal, but deepening of same stake suffices for 600-word scope.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Theme—survival as archival witness—emerges through geode imagery & unused-potential metaphor, never sermonized. Subtext in silence: “this was enough” hides abyss of no-next-step. Final image of starlight refracting through crystallized ghosts offers resonant non-literal answer, reweighting loss into permanence without moral. Avoids tidy thesis; ambiguity legible yet emotionally grounded.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Compressed lyric cadence taught from line 1 (“observatory drifted…”) and sustained; no head-hop. Perceptual signature—quantum-imprint, microvolt grief—remains character-specific. Diction skews scientific-poetic but stays within Kael’s technician-grief lexicon. No dialogue, so voice judged on interior; occasional over-cranked metaphor (“galaxy of unspent futures”) is earned by pattern. Rhythm modulates with breaker countdown, tightening breath.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>High information density; sentences multitask. No loops or synonym churn; figurative layering dense but coherent—geode = memory vessel sustained. One mixed-metaphor risk: “atomic rage” for breakers, but fits overheated techno-poetic register. Final third clean; no artifact touches closure. Occasional elevated diction (“intangibly tangible”) is voice-motivated, not register drift.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Premise—mining unused explosive potential of dead wedding guests via quantum geode—is non-obvious synthesis of grief & tech. Geode-as-memory-core evolves from table decoration to archive, transforming familiar trauma trope. Risky lyric compression taught early; pays off in final refracted starlight. Specificity (Kiev aunt, microvolts) prevents conceptual slide. If plot were body-swapped, the crystallized-unpotential device would collapse—meets transformation test.</comment>
