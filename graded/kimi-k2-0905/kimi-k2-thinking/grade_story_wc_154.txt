<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Kael’s contradictory impulses—guilt for leaving vs. need to keep translating the unspeakable—stay active in every beat; the final image of pressing coral to cast crystallizes a credible renunciation with felt cost. Interiority is sensory, not diagnostic (“words swim in the space between nerve and nothing”). Micro-choices (tracing cast, pressing coral) reveal value hierarchy without exposition. Only nit: no second on-page character, so relationship crucible is absent by design, not flaw.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the decrypted “I kept your number too” reweights every prior absence with indelible social cost under Accumulative/Textural lens. Pattern of shard-transitions (hospital → atrium → bedroom) is taught by 25 % and coherent; condensation droplets as transition cue anchor time/space. Cost is visible in the punctured lung tethered to the unknotted guilt. No causality break; no orientation debt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mist-clad atrium functions as micro-setting: its weeping glass and aerial-root silhouette externalize Kael’s unasked questions and constrain his decryption work. Brain coral and plaster cast act as portable settings whose tactile grooves guide finger-choice and memory-access. Sensory hierarchy (salt-taste of cordite, coral’s calcium bite) filters through translator’s trained attention. Environment does not merely mirror but physically hosts the decryption act that reweights stakes.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Single dominant stake—can he graft new meaning onto the wound of abandonment—tightens when each decrypted glyph narrows options from denial to recognition. Escalation is textural: density of smudged layers increases until the final line forecloses escape from mutual loss. Cost is felt in the punctured lung that “binds” him while he unknots. No external antagonist needed; shared anxiety itself supplies coherent pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges as the untranslatable weight between languages of war and languages of home; no explicit thesis stated. Final image re-prices “absence as first language” into mutual, costly retention of phone numbers. Particulars (brain coral, child cast) accrue meaning through handling, not symbolism. Ambiguity lingers: translation succeeds only by admitting what words cannot carry.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is lyric, compressed, pattern-taught: “anesthetic pulls like riptide” establishes metaphoric cadence that pays off in “tide remembers even when we forget.” Perceptual signature—translator who tastes cordite in darkness—stays consistent. No dialogue, so no head-hop risk. Syntax mirrors anesthesia: long clause-swells, then fragment-anchors like coral grooves. Register never drifts above Kael’s lived lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>High information density: one sentence often does three jobs (“The coral in his hand is from that beach on Malaita, where a boy once showed him how to find the brain-patterned stones beneath the war’s debris”). No synonym churn or template cadence; metaphors stay physically coherent. Occasional elevated phrasing (“conceptual repricing”) is brief and voice-motivated. Final line is razor-clean, no scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: peace-talk trauma translated through archaeologist-style decryption of a child’s plaster cast. Brain coral as memory-storage object is specific, non-generic. Risk taken with anesthetic mosaic pays off by making time tidal rather than linear. Conceptual integrity holds: translation = carrying unspeakable weight, not swapping words.</comment>
