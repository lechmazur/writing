<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is vivid—trembling hands, conch pulse synced to life-support—but the “synthetic copy” reveal is summarized, not dramatized, blunting the contradictory impulse needed for 9+. Her final vow reads as therapeutic paraphrase rather than embodied cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: seashell → cast code → AI shutdown → hull crawl. Closure lands with Charged Poise—conch left as lullaby, cast in lap—felt cost visible. One scaffold loop (“rusted” x4) and late “vulnerability is power” tag keep it sub-9.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Transparent dome, rusted rail, smudged cast—details are selective and POV-filtered. The cast’s ink-grid causally constrains the escape; the conch’s final placement reweights the stake. Slight over-lavish star imagery keeps it from 8.5.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prove synthetic self worthy—tightens when AI eyes dim and hull crawl demands phobic endurance. Visible price: facing starry void. Escalation is single but sufficient; Caela’s off-stage voice is complication, not resolver.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through conch/cast symmetry—fragile fragments become keys—avoiding overt thesis. Final “cracks are circuits” flirts with label-speak but is saved by tactile cast trace. Quiet ambivalence lingers; could risk sharper ethical edge.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Third-person intimate sustains tactile diction (“rusted railing,” “smudged ink”) and rhythmic short beats under stress. No head-hop; slight register lift in “conceptual repricing” phrase is lone drift. Voice modulates with vertical terror without syntactic monotony.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High density: “conch pulse mirrors heartbeat” does double sensory-causal work. Minor scaffold—“trembling” repeats—and one mixed metaphor “canvas of trembling stars.” Rhythm breathes across paragraph cuts; noloop obscures closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: stunt-double clone weaponizing phobias via child’s cast cipher feels inevitable yet new. Risky dome-crawl set-piece commits fully. Avoids stock AI-uprising tropes by keeping lens personal; could push moral ambiguity further.</comment>
