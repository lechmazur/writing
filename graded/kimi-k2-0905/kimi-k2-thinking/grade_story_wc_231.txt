<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Cornelius’s loneliness and vocation fuse into one credible stance; the micro-choice to keep the boutonniere crystallizes his arc. Interiority avoids therapy-speak and stays anchored to lantern, mist, and petal. No secondary character on stage, so relational crucible test is waived; head-count clarity remains intact. The final endurance costs him nothing visible beyond loneliness already owned, so the change feels tender rather than pivotal.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory pulse tightens the keeper’s isolation until the beam becomes witness. Closure lands as Charged Poise—beam + jar + sketch re-weight memory’s value with undeniable conceptual cost (“Memory is the true keeper of light”). No orientation debt; who/where/when arrive within 60 words. TheCost proof is the final sketch sentence, where ownership of memory is visibly transferred to the lighthouse itself.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Opal dock under mist is not postcard scenery; its planks creak under knees, lantern-glow draws fog, and the beam later becomes the literal tool of witness. Sensory hierarchy follows Cornelius’s professional gaze—distance, light, rot, salt. Micro-setting rule met: the dried edelweiss in jar constrains the final image and reweights the beam’s pulse. Spatial choreography stays clean across kneel, pocket, desk, tower.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will the stranger be witnessed?—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens once when gaps-reading redefines the gesture. Escalation is textural: alpine scent → spinning compass → silence after horn compresses desperation into keeper’s stance. No causal reversals, but under Accumulative lens the densifying images foreclose the option of forgetting. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral; visible price would have lifted band higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges obliquely: isolation converted to stewardship, memory as shared light. Subtext sits in gesture ambiguity—farewell/warning/plea unresolved yet redeemed by witness. Epiphany is earned through tactile investigation rather than abstract assertion. Final line avoids moralizing; resonance arises from lighthouse beam now carrying stranger’s pulse.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Cornelius; no head-hop. Perceptual signature is lighthouse-grade: distances measured in beam sweeps, smells ranked by salt content. Rhythm tightens with fragment-like sense bursts under mist. Diction remains inside 19th-century keeper lexicon—no corporate register drift. Dialogue is absent, so voice purity is judged on narrative lens alone and passes.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm pulses like turning Fresnel lens; sentence openings vary, no template cadence detected. Figurative language is selective—opal, ghostly finger—never stacked. No filter-verb stacks; scaffolding absent. Single paraphrase loop: “softly persistent” repeated four times; because it becomes motif binding mist, memory, and echo, deduction is waived. Final line lands clean with no artifact intrusion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Memory-reading through boutonniere offers fresh supernatural rule that feels folk-origin, not comic-book. Isolated lighthouse witness trope is refreshed by the stranger’s active gift of memory rather than passive rescue. Risk: lyric repetition might have tipped into monotone, but cadence supports keeper’s obsessiveness. Synthesis of alpine flower + maritime fog + witness beam is specific enough to resist name-swap test.</comment>
