<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The sculptor’s interiority is lyrically present yet stays curiously friction-free; no contradictory impulse ever threatens her serene quest, so her choices feel pre-ordained rather than risk-laden. Micro-choices (tracing cracks, fashioning bow) are tactile but never force her to relinquish anything or adapt under pressure. Result: empathy is declared, not dramatized at cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Closure earns a Charged Poise: the grove “singing inside silence” reweights the world’s quietude as receptive rather than empty; cost is felt conceptually, aligning with Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation anchor (grove, dawn, lone sculptor) surfaces ~140 words—just late enough to require a −0.3 dip. Because/therefore logic is loose (porcelain simply “awakens” rather than yielding knowledge through trial), but the tightening cadence of dawn→lantern→night sustains legible momentum.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Alder trunks, porcelain shards, and breath-cold air are sensuously selected and return to constrain technique (bow against insulators, lantern against dark). Micro-setting—cracked glaze read as sheet music—literally decides her playing method, charging the final “soft note hanging.” Weather and light evolve with the causal evening fade, grounding the abstract song in a particular dusk.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“create music in a silent world”—is declared early, but escalation is associative, not consequential. Tension accumulates through repeated images (silence vs. faint hum) rather than through tightened options or forfeited alternatives; no moment forecloses failure or costs her stamina, pride, or tool. Consequently the tightening is aesthetic, not practical, keeping pressure within the lyric/textural band but below the threshold of visible price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of “empathy in motion” emerges imagistically: she feels the linemen’s history through cracked porcelain, threads their lost electricity into audible sound. Final quiet lullaby reconfigures silence as collaborative rather than oppressive, achieving resonance without moralizing. Ambiguity is preserved: world outside grove hardly notices, so the empathy stays intimate, incomplete, and therefore credible.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person lyric voice sustains a musical cadence—long vowels, soft consonants, internal rhyme—matching the symphonic concept. Perceptual signature is consistent: attention to grain, glaze, sap, and hush never drifts into touristic catalog. POV modesty respected: narrator infers hedgehog, fox, rabbit responses but never claims omniscience; all sensory data remain grove-bound and plausible.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><commend>Salience rises from selective metaphor (cracks as “sheet music,” leaves as “notes on a staff”), but occasional template cadence (“the …, the …, and the …”) surfaces 3–4 times, creating low-level drumbeat. Some near-paraphrase adjacent lines (“hum grows into chord … cascade fills the grove”) dilute density. Overall clear, but the final clause “soft note hanging in the air” would hit harder without preceding generality “the story ends”.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Fusing discarded power-line insulators with forest sound-making offers a fresh repurposing of industrial detritus; silence-as-instrument concept lifts the piece beyond familiar “artist awakens world” templates. Specificity of porcelain stress cracks guiding bowing technique provides the non-obvious mechanics that make the premise memorable. Hedgehog, fox, rabbit cameos risk twee, yet remain understated enough to avoid cutesy collapse.</comment>
