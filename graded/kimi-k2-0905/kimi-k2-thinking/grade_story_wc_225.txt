<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The tutor’s guilt-steeped interiority is viscerally embodied (“clung to his conscience like a stubborn shadow”) and drives every micro-choice; the moment he accepts the pawn from the girl crystallizes a credible, costly shift. No diagnostic self-talk, but the reflective blocks edge toward 20 % and the girl is more emblem than crucible, so relationship pressure stays mild. The Earned Stasis—teaching again with no guarantee history won’t repeat—lands with felt cost, yet the flaw-compounding is stated more than dramatized after the key is found.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Holding the causal lens, the tapestry’s thread-to-move logic keeps because/therefore linkage tight; each pluck narrows options toward the silver key. Anchors (who/where/when) are fixed by line 4 and the temporal stasis rule is taught early; orientation test waived because the freeze is functional at closure. Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the key turns, time restarts, and the tutor’s resumed teaching carries visible emotional cost (“his heart a quiet storm”). One minor causality bump: the verse “When the king’s sacrifice is accepted” appears late yet is treated as prior knowledge.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The frozen village is sketched with brisk, selective strokes—“clocks halted at the same hour,” “cobblestones” under “woven hush”—that guide access and mirror stasis. Platinum tapestry functions as micro-setting: its frayed threads constrain every tactical read the tutor performs. Spatial choreography stays clean across the square and hollow chamber. Weather (“distant thunder”) is used more for tonal pulse than tactical constraint, so the 9+ gate for environment-forced choice is missed, capping at 8.8; details remain vivid and POV-filtered throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—redemption through teaching—signals early; pressure escalates via each decoded thread that forecloses wrong moves and sharpens the cost of repeating past error. The tightening beat is the discovery of the verse that demands a king’s sacrifice; the tutor’s choice to keep teaching after unlocking time embodies the visible price. Escalation is coherent under causal lens, but the village populace remains off-stage; external pressure is largely symbolic, so the felt price is more internal than relational. Still, agency stays with the tutor and the cost is legible on the final page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges without moralizing: forgiveness as continuous winnowing, not absolution. The tapestry’s shifting meaning (labyrinth → lesson plan → heart) reweights earlier material in the final glow. Subtext resides in the girl’s pawn, the unspoken shared silence, and the dissolution of the labyrinth into dawn light. One near-miss: the phrase “fierce repose” is used twice and drifts toward explicit thesis, but the second instance is embedded in image, not sermon.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lyrical third-person floats close to the tutor’s perceptual signature—“threads shimmered like platinum,” “fingers…began to fidget productively”—with rhythmic, clause-varied syntax that mimics chess calculation. No dialogue to distort voice; narrative diction stays within the tutor’s plausible lexicon. Filter verbs are minimal and purposeful. The metaphor chain is dense, yet patterned early and paid off at the glowing dissolution of the labyrinth, so it reads as taught compression rather than overwriting.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm is varied; sentence lengths ebb with reflective lulls and tighten during thread-plucking beats. No scaffold loops or synonym churn; each noun is specific (“crystal,” “cobblestones,” “pawn”). One mixed metaphor—“time flowing forward like a river after a broken dam”—slightly blurs the freeze-to-flow transition, but clarity survives. Information density is high: one line often performs atmosphere, motive, and causal cue simultaneously. Closure image remains crisp.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: chess notation grafted onto a mythic frozen-village tapestry. The “winnowing” gambit literalizes abstract guilt into tactile thread-plucking, a risk that pays off emotionally. Proximity check: no close echoes of famous scenes. The concept commits fully without late rule changes. While the redemption-through-teaching arc is familiar, the specificity of the tapestry-labyrinth mechanic and the girl’s pawn keeps the vision memorable.</comment>
