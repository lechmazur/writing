<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mei’s contradictory impulses—clutching vs. releasing memory—are dramatized in the loom shuttle; her final renunciation is earned and costly. Interiority stays concrete (“the bead glowed brighter with each offering”), never drifting into label-speak. The thirty-year span is convincingly compressed into the amber bead’s weight. Micro-choices (placing the bead in the shuttle, surrendering tea-steam memory) reveal value hierarchy under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the empty weave and vanished bead reconfigure meaning with undeniable conceptual cost. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: silence thickens by density loops until the final cadence shift. Causality is interior—each surrender compresses time into amber—but motive remains legible. No orientation debt; bamboo orchard and loom are anchored by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The loom and amber bead function as micro-setting: they constrain every tactical choice and charge the final image. Bamboo forest is sketched with selective sensory economy—“silence grew thicker than morning mist”—filtered through Mei’s auditory obsession. Spatial choreography is clean: box against ribs, candle-shadow on warp threads. Weather and season stay peripheral, avoiding tourist-catalog cliché.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—mending vs. surrendering silence—is signaled early and tightens through each offering. One meaningful deepening: the puzzle piece showing Mei’s younger self forces reciprocity. Cost is visible—memories evaporate into light—altering tactics. Escalation is accumulative, not causal-reversal, fitting the lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the inversion of repair into relinquishment; no explicit thesis is stated. The amber bead’s migration from pocket to shuttle to absence reweights “silence” from wound to gift. Final image—ripe plum dropping—offers non-literal answer about cyclical completion. Resists moralizing; ambiguity lingers without confusion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person lyric voice sustains a perceptual signature—sound-stripped attention, loom-rhythm syntax. Compression (“she wove the puzzle pieces into the fabric”) is taught early and paid off at closure. No head-hopping; POV distance stays tight to Mei. Diction stays within rural-Chinese loom spinner lexicon; no register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loop or scaffold; every sentence advances image or stakes. Metaphors are controlled—silence as textile, amber as heart—never stacked. Rhythm modulates with loom clicks, mirroring tension. Final line shines with polished brevity: “a stone so polished by loss it could shine in the dark.”</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Premise—loom that weaves silence—feels fresh yet inevitable. Puzzle-piece payoff transforms stock “message from dead child” trope into conceptual trade-off. Risk-taking (textile metaphysics) heightens coherence without gimmickry. Specificity of orchard-plum drop rescues ending from abstract everywhere.</comment>
