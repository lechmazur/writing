<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vespera’s insatiable creativity is dramatized through the seven-day weaving ordeal, her refusal to hoard seeds afterward, and the embodied sap-stains that mark her cost. The interior contradiction—salvaging wonder by draining it—drives every beat without tidy resolution. No secondary character applies direct pressure, so the relationship crucible is waived; her sole agency under an accumulative lens is credible and scaled to lyric length.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the nameless color from the cracked seed reweights the rules of wonder itself, with the permanent “hush” and sap-stain as visible cost. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: cadence layers (thread, song, sap) tighten until the final image crystallizes. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) is taught by word 30; disorientation serves the lyric hush later paid off. No causality break; the reversed waterfall heartbeat is a taught pattern, not a cheat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The parapet, waterfall mist, and sap function as micro-setting that constrains her weaving posture and later stains her hands—details returned in the closing image. Spatial choreography stays clean: water threads, root branches, and her collapsing body track across seven contiguous days. Sensory economy favors touch and color frequencies over visual catalogues, feeding the textural lens.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><pressure>The dominant stake—preserve wonder before total grey-out—is signaled in paragraph 1 and escalates as each captured essence thins its source. The tightening occurs when the seed cracks, foreclosing the option to ever harvest wonder the old way again; the price is the irreversible sap burden she now carries. Under an accumulative lens, the cadence shift (mist → threads → sap) reweights the cost without external antagonist, sufficient for this length.</pressure>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the inversion of preservation: hoarding kills, weaving multiplies. The final image of sap glowing on her palms reprises the earlier “pearl” seed, now repriced as perpetual duty. No moral is stated; the moss-grown secret languages invite counter-readings of endless creative labor. The refusal to give visitors a tidy answer keeps ambiguity earned.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person lyric voice remains stable, its diction filtered through Vespera’s synesthetic precision—“frequencies that capture joy.” Rhythm modulates: long anaphoric cadences for the weaving marathon, then clipped fragments at collapse. No dialogue, so voice distinctness is measured through perceptual signature alone, which passes. The reversed-waterfall fragment is a taught syntactic rupture, not unmotivated slippage.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</comment><comment>Zero loops, scaffolds, or filter-verb stacks; each sentence either advances image or tightens cadence. Figurative language is patterned (color = frequency = thread) and paid off, avoiding purple drift. High information density: “sap of between-ness” compresses world-logic and bodily cost in four syllables. No artifacts touch the closure beat; the final line’s hymn cadence is intentional.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The orchard that bears doorways rather than fruit reframes multiverse trope as perpetual creative maintenance, not escapist portal fantasy. Capturing essence via song-frequency而非blood-sacrifice offers fresh ethical calculus. The “color that had no name” acts as conceptual repricing, not gimmick, because seeded by prior chromatic losses. Risk is high—lyric ellipsis, reversed physics—yet coherence under accumulative lens keeps it from gimmickry.</comment>
