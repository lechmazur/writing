<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kael’s exile-guilt and need to “discover beauty in the difficult” drive every beat; the stone’s release is a credibly costly renunciation. Interiority stays concrete—thumb in dent, pulses under knees—and the final disappearance feels earned. No contradictory impulses are staged simultaneously, so the 9+ bar is missed by a hair.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: releasing the stone rewrites the exile from shame into gift, cost legible in the erased footprints. Accumulative lens holds—magnetic fragments and memory shards layer until the pattern crystallizes. Orientation is taught early by compasses spinning wild, waived penalty.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Lodestone gravel that erases footprints and a basalt stone that warms under a thumb do double duty as micro-setting and tactical constraint; the final image depends on their exact physical properties. Sensory hierarchy mirrors Kael’s chess-tutor attention to weight and texture. No world-rule drift; geography stays coherent across the single scene.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—can he repay Mira by decoding silence—tightens when each magnetic flutter is mapped to a pawn or knight, narrowing options to the final stone-release. Pressure is accumulative: pulses → memory → pattern → irrevocable absence. Cost is felt on-page in the erased footprints and the hollow dent left behind.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme—sacrifice as reversible beauty—emerges through stone, eclipse, and erased prints, never stated. Final image reweights the earlier covenant without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers: will Mira read the absence correctly? Complexity is embraced; no tidy thesis closes the circuit.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited maintains tight psychic distance; diction (“ghost gambits,” “lodestone gravel”) is filtered through a chess tutor’s spatial mind. Rhythm swells and subsides with magnetic pulses, no head-hop. Compression (“seven empty years” in one clause) is strategic, taught early, and pays off in the final silence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence or synonym loops. Metaphors stay coherent—magnetic fields as board, stone as bishop—without purple overload. High information density: one clause often advances memory, stakes, and sensory ground. Final line is crisp, propulsive, and typo-free.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Chex exile + magnetic nexus + silence-translation synthesizes fresh myth without genre borrowing. Risk—renunciation as victory—pays off. The basalt stone’s final “black bishop” reconfiguration feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Could tip into 9+ with one more concrete Mira memory to sharpen the debt.</comment>
