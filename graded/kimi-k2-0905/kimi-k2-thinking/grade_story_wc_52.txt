<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s contradictory impulses—clinging to the echo of her dead husband while carving a lion that must never roar—are dramatized in every tactile stroke of the chisel. The moment she presses the quartz prism into the wood’s heart crystallizes both her surrender and her reclamation, the cost visible in the tremor of her hand and the whistle’s dying fall. Interiority never drifts into label-speak; grief is lived through ash dust, rain lenses, and the scent of chamomile. The only cap is the absence of an external human antagonist, but the wood itself serves as sufficient crucible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Charged Poise: the lion finished, the prism set on the sill, the rust-hued peace accepted with undeniable conceptual cost—she has frozen the memory, not the man. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory layer (steam, rain, wood dust, refracted light) tightens the stake until the final rainbow flare reweights “here-and-gone” from lament to livelihood. No orientation debt; who/where/when is anchored inside 60 words. The kettle’s whistle functions as both clock and whip-crack, its silence the decisive change.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The loft is rendered as body-extended tool: skylight rain droplets become “tiny globes that held the whole sky,” constraining Mara's gaze and thus her carve strokes. Ash blank, chisel edge, and quartz prism are tracked in hand with no spatial drift; their evolving states (raw → maned → heart-prismed) directly alter her tactical choices. Sensory hierarchy obeys grief’s narrowed attention—sound of kettle, scent of sawdust, glint of whip memory—never tourist catalog. Micro-setting fully charges the final image; remove the prism’s rainbow and the closure collapses.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“harvest lessons from loss before steam runs out”—is signaled inside the first 100 words. Pressure escalates via texture density: each curl of mane shavings tightens the emotional cost, the whistle’s rising pitch an audible countdown. Agency is renunciation rather than conquest; she chooses to trap the echo inside wood rather than demand resurrection, a visible price paid in sweat on the blank. Coincidence absent; causality is chisel-stroke → memory-surface → peace accepted.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the inversion of containment: by freezing the memory she liberates herself from its haunting. No thesis is declared; the final image of rainbow light on carved mane reweights “here-and-gone” as lived artistry rather than bereavement. Subtext operates in silence—the absent roar, the unshaped lion’s mouth—inviting reflection on what we can and cannot preserve. Resonance lingers in the reader’s own chest as the question of which memories they would crystallize.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Mara’s perceptual signature: rain beads are lenses, steam is a clock, ash is heavier than physics allows. Rhythm modulates with carve pressure—short clauses during chisel strikes, lengthened cadence during prism placement—without syntactic monotony. No head-hopping; the lone interiority is consistent, modest, and filtered through grief’s bias. Diction remains within a grieving crafts-person’s lexicon; “crystallized time” is introduced as folk magic she has read about, not authorial sleight.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances either texture or tactic. Metaphors are internally coherent—mane curls like smoke, peace settles like rusted copper—without mixed vehicles. High information density: one sentence can deliver scent, tool state, and memory trigger simultaneously. Read-aloud ear test passes; rhythm breathes with kettle crescendo and chisel fall, no scaffolding or filler.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The widow-carves-her-lion-tamer’s-absence premise is familiar, but the crystallized-time ritual married to woodcarving physics feels freshly specific. Risk is taken by letting the climax be a quiet prism placement rather than a roar; the choice heightens thematic coherence without gimmickry. Details (ash weight, rust-hued peace, chamomile steam) are particular to this voice and loft, not transferable to another grief template. Final rainbow refraction reuses the rain-drop lens taught early, making innovation feel inevitable.</comment>
