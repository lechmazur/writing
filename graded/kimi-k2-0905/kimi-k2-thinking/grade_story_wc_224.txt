<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Mira’s “steady pulse” motive stays visible in every micro-choice; the cracked-mirror eyes and mercury-glass tag remain embodied, never abstract. The final decision to press the feather is the earned, irrevocable cost that forecloses retreat. Interior contradiction is present but compressed; the story leans on lyric accumulation rather than scene-scale duress, so the deepest contradictory impulse is implied more than dramatized. Still, the refusal to turn back feels personal, not symbolic, and the mercury-glass metaphor constrains perception throughout.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the stone’s dissolution reweights the bookstore itself into “the shape of home,” with the silvered feather as visible, portable cost. Causality is accumulative/textural: each corridor’s breath and glyph-glow adds density until the final pulse re-maps the labyrinth. Orientation is taught by deliberate disorientation (shifting corridors) and pays off when the shelves “align into a pattern”; no anchors remain unclear. One meaningful tightening—the stone’s activation—reconfigures meaning without a causal reversal, satisfying the lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The mountain bookstore is not backdrop but active map-maker: shelves twist, spines whisper, dust tastes of forgotten stories, and these qualities directly enable the final reconfiguration. Selective sensory hierarchy mirrors Mira’s mirror-eyes: reflective, cracked, metallic. The feather’s barbs, the wet-ink air, and the basalt pedestal are tactile tools that constrain the tracing method. Environment charges the final image—the aligned shelves spell “home”—meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“understand the shape of home”—is signaled early and tightens once: the stone’s activation permanently fuses home to living pattern, foreclosing nostalgia for a static place. Escalation is textural: each breath of corridor and silver spill increases density until the thunder breaks. Visible price is the stone’s loss and the feather’s irreversible etching. Agency is renunciation/creation rather than confrontation; coincidence never rescues.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the inversion of home from place to relational pattern; no character lectures us on this. The shifting bookstore literalizes the idea without allegorical stiffness. Subtext in the raven-feather gift (a past kindness now weaponized as tool) adds moral ambiguity. Final image reweights earlier motifs—mirror, thunder, labyrinth—into quiet heartbeat, avoiding tidy moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays tightly aligned to Mira’s perceptual filter: every noun is chosen for metallic, reflective, or textural resonance. Rhythm accelerates with short pulse clauses during glyph-tracing, then exhales into longer cadences at dawn. No dialogue, so voice distinctness is judged solely on narrative texture, which remains singular. Filter verbs (“she realized”) are minimal and voice-motivated; patterned elision of articles feels intentional and is taught early.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Zero paraphrase loops, zero mixed metaphor; figurative language is sparse, deliberate, and internally coherent. High information density: one sentence often layers sensory cue, world rule, and emotional tilt. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image that recharges thunder→heartbeat motif. Micro-movements (“she folded the feather into a small leather pouch”) are purposeful, sealing cost.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: the bookstore-mountain as living genealogy map is not a stock trope. Mercury-glass seer who bleeds memories into silver is specific, not archetype. Risk—letting the labyrinth rearrange nightly—pays off when the same instability becomes the medium of home-making. Could not swap mountain, feather, or glyph method without collapsing logic.</comment>
