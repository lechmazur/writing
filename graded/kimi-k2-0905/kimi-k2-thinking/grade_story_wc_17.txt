<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Mira’s obsession with “what walls dream” is embodied in every tactile beat—fingertips on ivy, forehead to stone—so the final shift from lament to invitation feels earned. Her contradictory impulses (obsession vs. burden) coexist in scene, not summary, and the renunciation of pure remembrance carries visible cost: she seals the report with wax and walks away from the corridor she loves. Interiority stays concrete and character-specific; no therapy-speak intrudes. The inherited flaw of hyper-perception drives both gift and price, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The accumulative/textural lens holds: each sonic fossil, diary blister, and cracked emulsion layer thickens the density until the chalkboard formula reweights the stake. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Charged Poise—as Mira presses forehead to stone and the corridor exhales “Remember, but act.” The cost is felt in the wal of separation: she leaves the passage that once defined her. No orientation debt; anchors (who, where, when) are clear by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The ivy-veiled passage functions as micro-setting: frost-vine hybrids clutch damp stones that guide Mira’s fingertips and later constrain her departure. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven—calloused fingers detect ink under blisters, milky sun pierces cracked ceiling—rather than tourist catalog. The chalkboard equation reappears as a recharged image, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible shifts.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—voice the dreams of stone—tightens when the film strip reveals erased solutions, foreclosing pure remembrance. Escalation is textural: each sonic fossil and diary page accumulates pressure until the chalk formula crystallizes the cost of silence. Agency is renunciation: she leaves the corridor to seed new calculations, paying the price of separation. One meaningful deepening suffices; no reversals required.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from particulars: stone as battery of human intention, chalk dust as frantic erasure, ivy as living lament. The final image—“Remember, but act”—reweights the premise without moralizing. No thematic echo; the mantra is spoken by the corridor, not Mira. Ambiguity lingers: restoration is possible yet unfinished, inviting reader reflection.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Perceptual signature is distinct: “sonic fossils,” “frequency of suppressed knowledge,” “harmonic of guilt” all filter through Mira’s professional ear. Rhythm modulates with intensity—compressed clauses under pressure, longer cadences during red-dark development. No dialogue, so voice convergence risk is waived. Register stays within a cartographer’s plausible lexicon; no corporate drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>High information density—single sentences layer sensory, emotional, and conceptual work: “Legacy's burden pressed against Mira's ribs like shrapnel” shows cost, metaphor, and embodiment in one stroke. No scaffold loops; varied sentence openings avoid drumbeat. One mixed metaphor (“stone remembered everything, absorbed intention like a battery”) is minor and does not touch closure. Proofing clean; no typos.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The corridor-echo-cartographer premise is fresh, yet grounded in tactile procedure. The chalkboard-equation negative flips a familiar eco-catastrophe into inverted tones, making the past a photographic ghost. Risk—lyric accumulative structure—heightens resonance without obscuring closure. Specificity (frost-vine, calloused fingertips, chalk dust) prevents generic template drift.</comment>
