<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s interior contradiction—cataloguing doom yet clinging to salvation—drives every micro-choice; the dice ritual embodies this. The final refusal to exit through the rupture is earned by a lifetime of iterative proofs and rolled regret. Visible cost: he forfeits the last illusion of escape, accepting infinite penance. Minor slip: the single epithet “grim optimist” leans summary, but the embodied climb overrides it.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a crystal of Earned Stasis: Elias steps onto solid stone, foreclosing the rupture forever; the dice’s new rhythm is the felt price. Accumulative lens holds—texture of regret is reweighted from trap to companion. Pattern taught early (infinite steps, frozen watch) and paid off in the glitch-fade. No orientation debt; causality intact: every roll tightens the spiral toward this renunciation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The staircase is not backdrop but antagonist: its nanometric precision and self-healing geometry directly block mapping, rest, escape. The chipped die’s tactile asymmetry acts as micro-setting that constrains navigation; its clatter is spatialized sound. Final image—glitch pixel step that Elias refuses—charges the entire atmosphere with refused mercy. No slips; environment shapes tactics and closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Dominant stake—carry the texture of missed opportunity—tightens through each roll; the 0.003% bias is the visible price paid in stamina and time. One meaningful escalation: double-six rupture appears, narrowing options to step through or endure; Elias’s agency crystallizes the stance. Cost legible: infinite climb continues, dice heavier. No deus-ex-machina; luck complicates, does not save.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: regret is not escaped but incorporated as bodily weight. The dice’s shift from divining rods to penance jewelry reconfigures meaning. Final image of continued ascent with imperfect rhythm offers non-literal answer—endurance is the only form of capture. No moralizing; complexity intact.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Voice is mathematician-poet: precise diction (“nanometric riser”) yet lyric cadence (“cosmic indifference”). Perceptual signature filters every detail through Elias’s theorem-obsessed lens. Compression taught early—“seven days or seven centuries”—and held; no scaffold. Rhythmic control peaks at glitch-fade, mirroring heartbeat suspension.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</question><comment>Zero loops; each sentence advances stakes or texture. High density: “geometry healed itself by morning that never came” does triple world-clock-emotion work. Metaphors stay consistent (physics vs. flesh). No overwriting; clarity intact at closure. Read-aloud ear test passes—varied sentence lengths echo climbing breath.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Infinite staircase as perpetual-motion prison is fresh synthesis of Escher + thermodynamic horror. The 0.003% bias turning into a cosmic compass feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Risk—refusing exit—pays off emotionally. Minor deduction: epithet “grim optimist” nudges archetype. Overall, specificity triumphs over surreal premise.</comment>
