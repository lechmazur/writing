<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lin’s interiority remains textured—salt air sharpens grief, the pocketed ticket warms against skin—yet the dog’s off-page survival and the guides’ oracular calm feel convenience-plotted rather than pressure-forced. Emotion is embodied, but the decisive reunion lacks a micro-choice that costs Lin anything visible; the star stamp is mislaid, not wagered.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: the shoreline lullaby and star stamp accumulate until the cove reprise reweights “unused courage” as already owned. Closure lands as Charged Poise—Lin rises with the dog, options reconfigured—but the ferry guides’ ticket punch is never paid for; cost is only atmospheric, not tactile.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Fog-draped shore, lantern star, mossy stone—each object is handled, not catalogued, and the ridgeway’s slipperiness literally slows Lin’s gait, tightening stakes. The cove’s firefly vigil mirrors internal ignition, satisfying the 9+ gate: setting constrains the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Pressure tightens once: from snapped leash to solitary traverse to lantern offer; the ferry guides’ “cross only when ready” crystallizes stance. No second reversal, but the single deepening is sufficient; cost, however, remains ambient rather than paid in flesh or future.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges obliquely—courage as pre-owned, not acquired—avoiding overt thesis. The shoreline lullaby motif reweights at reunion, but the ferry guides’ final aphorism edges toward echo; still, the image of the half-buried ticket sand-buries the moral rather than stating it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric sustains a hushed, tide-syncopated cadence; perceptual signature is coastal—wind hums, salt stings, lantern star glints. No dialogue to distort voice; syntax stays within Lin’s sensory lexicon, compressing under fog yet breathing at twilight.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Lines are lean, metaphor disciplined: “heartbeat echoing the hollow surf” does double sensory duty. Occasional template cadence (“step by indirect step”) appears but pattern-teaches the mantra; no mixed metaphors, no scaffold loops. Read-aloud rhythm ebbs and returns like surf.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Ferry-guide star-punch converts a travel trope into quiet talisman; indirect route literalizes emotional obliquity. While “lost dog finds owner” is familiar, the twilight vigil and sonic lullaby lend freshness; risk is modest, but specificity rescues the premise from cliché.</comment>
