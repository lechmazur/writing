<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elena’s interior contradiction—needing to draw yet fearing the blank page—remains concrete and embodied; the charcoal-blackened fingers, the frozen dial at 4-2-8, and the decision to tap the housing in her sister’s rhythm all reveal hierarchy-of-values under pressure. The “auroral sorrow” smile at the end is a credible, costed renunciation of exile from her own gift. No second character on stage, so relationship bullets are waived; headcount stays clear. Micro-choices (kneel, trace, tap, lift, sketch) steadily reconfigure her stance; memory gift is used, not label-displayed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: because the lock refuses the dial-turn, therefore she transposes the rhythm into percussive tapping; because the shackle snaps, therefore the painting lifts and the charcoal bundle appears. Orientation anchors (who= Elena the artist; where= crystal cave; when= after laughter dies) arrive before 120 words. The closure is a Decisive Change with visible cost: she begins the first dawn-line on stone, foreclosing permanent silence. One shard only; no teleport or amnesia; stakes tighten exactly once—lock opens → art must resume.</comment>

<comment>The cave is not postcard backdrop: the humming crystals actively refuse her wish for silence, forcing choice; the mineral-stained painting literally hides the charcoal cache she needs. Spatial choreography is clean—kneel, trace, tap, lift—no impossible body shifts. Sensory economy favors echo and mineral drip over visual excess, matching POV priority. Final image of first light on wet stone reweights setting from tomb to womb, satisfying the 9+ gate: environment charges the closing beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—will she draw again?—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens when lock snaps: she must now face the blank page or betray the calling. Agency is present; no outside savior. One meaningful turn only, appropriate to length; cost is the ache of “auroral sorrow” she must now paint into every future portrait. Pressure stays coherent; coincidence is absent. Could edge higher if a sharper tangible loss (time, tool, social risk) had been dramatized, but closure still carries felt price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme—artistic calling as inescapable dawn after personal night—emerges through pattern of light-in-dark imagery rather than statement. “Draw the dawn” note is concrete stimulus, not abstract moral. Final smile echo reconfigures loss into generative sorrow without sermon. Complexity upheld: rebirth does not erase grief; it is braided with it. No final-paragraph thesis, avoids thematic echo penalty.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays tight to Elena’s perceptual filter: selective attention to mineral hum, charcoal texture, sister-laugh pitch. Rhythm modulates—long sentences for memory compression, staccato taps for lock beat. No head-hop, no filter-stack. “Auroral sorrow” coinage is justified by POV artist-mind. Dialogue absent by design; voice coherence remains intact.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, high-density; most sentences carry double duty (action + image). No synonym loops or template cadence detected. Mixed metaphors absent; “auroral sorrow” is singular, deliberate coinage. One minor scaffold: “the weight of silence” echoed twice—within cap. Opening and closing lines are image-driven, ear-tested. No artifacts touch closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Familiar grief-to-creativity arc is refreshed by mnemonic percussion lock-picking and crystal cave as womb-tomb. Specificity of charcoal stains, 4-2-8 ritual, and auroral sorrow concept lifts it beyond generic. Transformation test fails if names change, but sensory and procedural detail is idiosyncratic enough to feel author-specific. Risk-taking modest but successful; no late gimmicks.</comment>
