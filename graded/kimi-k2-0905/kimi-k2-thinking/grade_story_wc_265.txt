<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Interiority is lyrically rich—“She understood that the mechanical rainforest was not a prison but a question”—but stays abstract; no embodied contradiction or visible cost anchors her shifts. The gear turns, but the woman’s hierarchy of values remains a smooth parable, not a pressured choice. Closure is a serene acceptance rather than an earned renunciation, so change feels preordained.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each dawn’s new biome layers pattern until “she had become its architect.” Closure achieves Charged Poise—map/territory fusion with conceptual cost—because the final line crystallizes ongoing transmutation. Transitions among groves are legible via sleep-frame, satisfying mosaic Track B. No orientation debt; who/where taught early via “copper leaves chimed against brass bark.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Micro-setting triumph: the gear, the singing sequoia, and the piston-hollow literally constrain where she sleeps and how the compass points. Sensory triage—“brass bark,” “oak-turbines sang of consequence”—filters through philosopher’s epistemic bias. Spatial choreography is dream-logic yet consistent; each dawn re-skins the same neural grove. Final image of “clockwork and chlorophyll intertwined” recharges the whole texture.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—map the frontier inside her mind—tightens when gear self-rotates and forest dissolves into pattern; option to remain passive is foreclosed. Escalation is accretive: each biome adds a syntactic “truth” that compresses until identity fuses with forest. Cost is conceptual but legible: she forfeits separateness, “part of the equation.” No visible price alters later tactics, keeping it shy of top band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from refrain of “question” vs “answer,” mechanistic vs wild, resolved in non-literal fusion: she is both map and territory. No sermon—final line is imagistic, not thesis. Recurring gear/tree syntax reweights at closure, achieving Conceptual Repricing. Ambiguity lingers: is insight transcendence or solipsism? That counter-reading is invited, not flattened.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Single, consistent lyric-philosophic POV; perceptual signature—“frequencies only she could hear”—filters every image. Sentence rhythm mimics clock-then-wind cadence, taught by second paragraph and held to last line. No dialogue to distort. Compression like “she breathed with it” shows psychic distance shift under serenity. Register stays within philosopher’s diction; no head-hop.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>High figurative density but pattern-taught early—“copper leaves chimed”—so metaphor reads as world-rule, not ornament. No mixed metaphors; vehicles stay mechanical or arboreal. Sentence variety follows breath: long accumulative clauses build to short crystalline close. One paraphrase loop: “the probable miracles became certainties, each one a note…” but loop is thematic reprise, not scaffold, so minor.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Synthetic freshness: clock-work rainforest as cognitive cartography feels non-obvious yet inevitable. Conceptual risk—lyric mosaic without antagonist—paid off via coherent closure. Gear-as-compass pointing “inward” is precise inflection that generic object could not swap. Tropes of awakening transmuted through epistemic stakes, not wellness cliché.</comment>
