<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mara’s cautious hope is dramatized through micro-choices—pressing headphones to ears, night-after-night recalibration, risking the tower—so the trait alters tactics rather than decorating her. The interior contradiction (hope vs. mounting evidence of malevolence) is kept alive in-scene, culminating in the visibly costly decision to fry the antique console. Flaws (naïveté, academic isolation) actively complicate the power plays and alien gambit rather than serving as backstory labels. The final “shield of charts” stance shows earned stasis: she keeps the job, the community, and the burden, cost felt in burnt-ozone exhaustion.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The causal chain is tight: subsonic manipulation → campus hysteria → Mara’s counter-frequency → immediate dissipation of paranoia, all on-page. The 2:47 AM spectrogram reveal is the hinge beat; every move after is therefore/ because. Closure is a Charged Poise: arguments falter, the tower stands scorched, alien signal gone, human mistrust lingering—cost legible in the silent studio. Orientation anchors by line 3; no lens ambiguity; no teleporting props. The only hairline slip is “cosmic tricksters laughed” – an externalizing phrase that momentarily pops us out of Mara’s limited inference, but it is brief and does not touch the final image.</comment>

<comment>Paint peeling “like dead skin,” burnt-coffee/ozone/vinyl smell, and the turntable needle vibrating under subsonic assault make the radio booth a tactile micro-setting that constrains action—she risks frying these very relics. Spatial choreography is clean: booth → quad → tower, bodies tracked. Weather is irrelevant but sonic atmosphere is constant; campus geography is compressed to iconic nodes (quad, senate chamber) that matter to broadcast reach. The astronomical charts evolve from research tool to protective sigils, charging the final image—satisfies 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—prevent alien-induced civil collapse—tightens when the dean threatens funding and Chen poaches her data, forcing Mara to gamble the transmitter. The one meaningful escalation is the 2:47 AM pulse; every beat after narrows to “now or never.” Cost is unmistakable: she may “fry the transmission tower” and draw censure—this risk is reiterated and then enacted, leaving the station damaged. Agency is hers alone; coincidence complicates (pulse timing) but does not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: the price of maintaining hope in a universe that weaponizes it. Subtext lives in silence—arguments falter mid-sentence, faces slacken—rather than exposition. The final image of charts as “protective sigils” reweights earlier research into armor, a conceptual repricing that lingers. No moral is asserted; the reader is left holding the undecided question of what else hides in static.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is astronomer-precise yet radio-worn: “spectrogram display warped,” “infra-linguistic commands beneath the threshold.” Syntax lengthens under reflection, cracks into fragments under fatigue, matching emotional tempo. Perceptual signature is strong—Mara notices star clusters “that seemed to pulse with malevolent intent,” a scientist’s metaphor she immediately second-guesses, keeping modesty. No head-hopping; diction stays within her academic idiom even at dawn climax.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “celestial tricksters embedding infra-linguistic commands” does triple duty (character worldview, world rule, stakes). Rhythm flexes—long sentences for late-night calibrations, staccato for switch-flip climax. Mixed metaphors are avoided; “starlight in fog” is single, coherent. Minor scaffold: “the ethereal grit of the situation crystallized” is abstract summarization, but it is one line and does not recur near closure. No loops, no filter-verb stacks.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: campus-radio noir meets SETI gaslighting, made specific through Mara’s archaeological booth and 70s equipment. “Aliens exploit campus budget wars” is non-obvious yet inevitable once shown. Risk—burning the tower—pays off narratively and thematically. Transformation test: swap any ingredient (location, profession, object) and the story collapses, proving integration.</comment>
