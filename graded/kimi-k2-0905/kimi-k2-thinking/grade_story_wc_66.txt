<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is lyrically specific—“each note a ghost of a forgotten tale”—and her micro-choice to weave pirate lyrics into the coda crystallizes her hierarchy of values. Yet the absence of visible failure or contradictory impulse keeps the arc a touch too frictionless; the cost is poetic rather than dramatized. Still, her embodied attention to dust, ink, and radio static individuates her within the scene’s pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the final image of dust motes as “tiny storytellers” reweights the premise that stories can be molecular, with conceptual cost legible. Causality is lyric-accumulative rather than strictly because/therefore, but the pattern is taught early (“if dust could learn to sing”) and honored in the last line. Orientation is anchored by word 50; no ambiguity at closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The ember alcove, shortwave dial glow, and luminous ink function as micro-setting that literally constrains visibility and thus transcription tactics. Mist and cold are filtered through bodily urgency—breath fogging, cloak shielding—integrating environment with action. The final dust image evolves from metaphor to material audience, charging the closing beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—can forbidden music re-seed narrative life?—tightens once when Mira risks embedding the pirate cipher; no further narrowing, but the single deepening is sufficient at this length. Cost is conceptual: the orchestra will unknowingly perform sedition. Escalation is lyrical, not causal, and fits the accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: story as subatomic vibration, art as contraband light. No moralizing—final line lets dust “tell stories” without commentary. The pirate broadcast reweights from illegal noise to seed of myth, a resonant reconfiguration that invites reflection on scale and survival.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person lyric remains close to Mira’s perceptual filter—“she imagined each speck of dust as a listener”—with syntax that mirrors musical phrasing (anaphora, cadenced clauses). No head-hopping; distance stable. Diction stays within a copyist’s poetic lexicon; radio static, ink bloom, and mist are sensed through her occupational synesthesia.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Rhythm modulates from long breathless sentences to staccato fragments (“Night deepened.”) without algorithmic pattern. Figurative density is high but purposeful, reinforcing musical texture; no mixed metaphors. Minor paraphrase loop on “dust” imagery subtracts 0.2, keeping it below 8.5.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The luminous-ink cipher embedded in an orchestral score feels fresh and inevitable; the dust-as-audience trope is re-energized by molecular literalism. Pirate shortwave as myth-seed synthesizes retro-tech with post-apocalyptic famine without gimmickry. Risk in lyric accumulation pays off in closure image.</comment>
