<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lina’s affectionate skepticism is alive in her eye-roll at the recall news and the pocketed geode, but the interiority drifts toward poetic self-diagnosis (“willowglass hope flickered”) rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The decisive turn—using the geode as resonator—arrives as a declared plan, not a forced micro-choice with visible cost. Earned stasis is implied, yet the emotional price feels poetic rather than somatic. Still, the single-POV voice stays consistent and the geode-touching beats keep her tactile and particular.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: repeated geode-light-resonance images tighten the stake until the canvas bloom reweights meaning. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Charged Poise—where the fractal tree image crystallizes options and felt cost: she will share the data, foreclosing pure skepticism. Causality is internal-pattern rather than external event chain, acceptable under the lens. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land by line 3, well within the 120-word window.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The light-painting studio is rendered through acetone scent, fluorescent buzz, and the metal table that doubles as geode altar; these micro-details constrain her improvised chemistry and ground the resonance experiment. Long-exposure canvases absorb geode luminescence, turning setting into active collaborator in the closure image. Spatial choreography stays coherent—vial, dust, table, thumb mark—across the single scene. The environment never feels generic; its technical specificity is economical and POV-filtered.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</question><comment>Dominant stake—can she extract usable knowledge from a recalled pill—tightens once: the geode’s hum shifts the risk from abstract to somatic. Escalation is textural: each pulse overlays pill-dust, mica flake, skin tingle, canvas glow, increasing density rather than narrowing external options. Cost is conceptual (she will share the data, exposing her private method) rather than visceral; this keeps pressure in the mid-band. Agency is present but poetic—adjusting brushes rather than a decisive irreversible act.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges obliquely: skepticism versus the seduction of pattern, framed by fractal imagery that reweights from hazard to healing. No character moralizes the theme; the final canvas tree is an unspoken answer. The recalled pill and geode function as conceptual mirrors—both fractally precise—allowing a quiet repricing of risk. Ambiguity lingers: the cure is possible yet untested, leaving the reader in charged poise rather than message.</comment>

<comment>Third-person close hovers just above Lina’s nerve endings, filtering every descriptor through her tactile bias (“familiar mix of curiosity and caution”). Syntax stays lean, then flares into lyric clusters at pressure points without losing clarity. No dialogue means voice purity rests on diction and rhythm; the piece sustains a distinctive perceptual signature. The geode’s mica layers and pill-dust receive the same precise, slightly skeptical attention, keeping voice stable.</comment>

<comment>Prose is clean, scaffold-free, with high information density: one sentence often layers scent, light, and emotional valence. Figurative language is restrained; when it appears (“frozen auroras,” “willowglass hope”) it is pattern-taught and recharged at closure. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn detected. Occasional elevated diction (“conceptual repricing”) is POV-consistent with Lina’s analytical bent.</comment>

<comment>The nanotech-pill + geode-resonator pairing feels fresh, not a trope checklist; the fractal optic exploited through light-painting tech gives an original inflection. Risk is taken in the lyric-accretive structure rather than plot twists, and it pays off in the final arboreal image. Conceptual integrity holds: the story commits to its internal logic without late rule bending. Slight deduction for the “recalled telepathy pill” premise echoing familiar bio-tech anxieties, but the geode pivot rescues it from derivative territory.</comment>
