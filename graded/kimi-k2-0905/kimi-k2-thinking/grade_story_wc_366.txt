<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Caleb’s reticence and “warmly observant” trait are shown through tactile upkeep of the lighthouse, but his interiority stays general (“luminescent ache” repeated) and the final choice—bottling the sea-glass—feels symbolic rather than driven by a visible internal contradiction; the ghost’s warmth is sensed but never complicates or tests his motive on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The causal spine is clear: lamp fails → finds glowing sea-glass → bottles it + letter → relights lamp; closure lands as Earned Stasis with the bottle left for the chain, cost legible in the final image. Orientation is swift, transitions clean, yet the ghost’s agency and the stone-message mechanics are told more than tested, keeping the turn modest.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Salt-crusted glass, brass housing, spiral steps, and the cairn’s moss-covered rocks are filtered through Caleb’s caretaker gaze; the lantern room’s cold and the ghost’s warmth create an immediate sensory tension that guides his decision to bottle the glass, satisfying the 9+ gate for setting-as-constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Stakes—preserve the lighthouse’s promise of safety—are signaled early and tighten when the lamp dies; the single reversal is Caleb’s shift from mere maintenance to ritual protection (bottling the glass). Escalation is gentle, pressure mostly atmospheric; cost is conceptual (the ache bottled) rather than a live option foreclosed, capping the score at the entry to high band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of transmuting loneliness into shared guardianship emerges through the bottle-and-cairn ritual; the sea-glass and stone chain reweight from quaint detail to covenant without overt statement. Final line reprises “luminescent ache,” achieving resonance, though the ghost remains under-exploited thematic counter-voice.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Third-limited stays tight to Caleb’s taciturn perception; diction (“salt crust,” “flat stone”) is caretaker-plain, rhythm steady like surf. No dialogue, so voice hinges on sensory selectivity; occasional lyrical lift (“bloom like a small sun”) is earned and doesn’t rupture distance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose is lean, sentences varied, no scaffold loops; a few soft modifiers (“soft, lingering ache”) could be cut, but figurative language is sparse and coherent. High-information lines carry triple duty (action, atmosphere, emotional cue), keeping momentum through the climb, bottle, and descent.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The stone-message letter chain and bottling safety are fresh inflections on lighthouse lore; the ghost functions more as ambiance than transformative force. Specific maritime caretaker detail keeps the piece from generic haunting, but central moves remain recognizable, placing it in strong but not startling territory.</comment>
