<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Lira’s interior contradiction—clarity vs. blindness—is dramatized in her grip on the pearl and the choice to surrender it; the “steady unpredictability” flaw shapes her final micro-choice with visible cost. The pilgrim remains a catalyst, not a character, so relationship/status crucible is absent; Lira’s agency alone must carry the arc and does, though barely. Emotional embodiment stays lyric rather than visceral; no bodily toll beyond trembling light. Earned renunciation lands, but the absence of a second on-page figure keeps pressure monocular and caps the band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of crystalline music and layered shadows builds density until the pearl’s surrender reweights the stake. Closure is a Charged Poise—the cave’s new cadence and Lira’s tinted sight—felt cost is legible in “now tinted with the knowledge of what she hadn't seen.” Orientation anchors within 30 words; no causality breaks. One shard; transitions unnecessary. The pilgrim’s single-word beat works as pattern intensifier, not causal turn, satisfying the lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The cave’s chime-scale and bright darkness are returned to twice with altered timbre after each shadow ingress; final image reweights the same crystals as now “steady, unpredictable.” Body-as-setting is handled via Lira’s palm-and-pearl micro-positioning that decides the climax. Sensory hierarchy favors echo and luminosity over visual catalog, matchingPOV bias. No spatial drift; distance from pilgrim to back-wall silhouette tracks cleanly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: preserve/control the magnification of everyday magic; tightened when the pearl begins to pulse foreign rhythm and surrender becomes the only remaining tactic. Agency is renunciation, not confrontation; cost is the permanent tinting of her clairvoyance. Escalation is accumulative: each new note raises density until surrender is inevitable. No external antagonist; pressure is situational and coherent under chosen lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the paradox of magnification: to enlarge wonder one must accept blind spots. Subtext sits in the overlapping shadows—what amplifies also obscures. No explicit thesis; final image of “steady, unpredictable rhythm” reweights the opening certainty. Ambiguity lingers without confusion: is the new magic gift or hazard? Complexity embraced, no moral ledger.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Lira; no head-hop. Perceptual signature is synesthetic—sight as river, sound as color—consistent and character-specific. Rhythm modulates: longer clauses during vision-fog, staccato fragments at pearl surrender. No dialogue, hence no voice convergence. Register remains lyric-fantastical yet anchored to POV’s plausible mystic lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Read-aloud cadence is musical, echoing cave’s own; sentence length varies to mimic crescendo/decrescendo. Some near-looping of “bright darkness” and “shimmering glow” but repetition is pattern-taught, not scaffold. No mixed metaphors; vehicles stay acoustic/luminous. Information density high; each line advances music or shadow state. Minor filter-verb clusters (“she felt,” “she realized”) in two beats but do not stall closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Fusion of music-geology and clairvoyance tech feels fresh; cave as resonant instrument is not stock fantasy trope. The “steady unpredictable” attribute is literalized in irregular crystal chords rather than asserted. Risky lyric structure holds under accumulative lens. Could swap pilgrim for any silent herald, hence not fully irreplaceable; innovation is world-level, not plot-level.</comment>
