<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—scholarly ambition vs. inherited duty—surfaces early and culminates in the 3:47 AM keystroke that reweights the telegram. The embodied tremor of her hands and the mirrored ancient scribe give credible lineage to her final renunciation. Yet the predecessor’s frantic notes are told, not dramatized, so the generational hand-off feels slightly abstract rather than viscerally earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the sentence “We carried it together” reweights every prior symbol and charges the daylilies with communal cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern of star-pulse → phoneme → confession tightens once at 3:47 AM. Orientation is clean: who/where/when anchored by word 80. No causal break; the telegram’s restored bloom is the visible price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The brass telescope, wooden ribs, and photometer curve constrain every action; the star’s 5.4-day heartbeat is the clock that forces tonight’s session. Daylilies shift from fragile relic to restored bloom, charging the final image. Selective sensory hierarchy—petals like parchment, screen-light dips—keeps the observatory a lived workspace, not postcard.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: decode or remain complicit in buried grief. One meaningful tightening at 3:47 AM—she types the confession, foreclosing solitary ownership. Cost is the restored bloom itself: she relinquishes private triumph to communal archive. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens; no reversal, but the cadence shift from star-pulse to shared sentence is sufficient.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the inversion of record-as-prayer to record-as-healing; the daylily’s one-day bloom becomes the emblem of transitory pain made permanent through shared witness. No moralizing—final line is image, not thesis. Ambiguity lingers: next chronicler may yet fail, but the contract is now visibly communal.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature is astronomer-poet—“photonic amber,” “phonetic keys”—without register drift. Rhythm modulates: longer clauses for trance, staccato for final keystroke. No dialogue, so voice carries all melodic burden; compression like “temple of silence” is taught early and paid off at dawn.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>High information density: single sentences fuse star data, bodily response, and mythic time. No loops or scaffold; metaphor vehicles (star-heartbeat, telegram-parchment) stay coherent. One possible over-write: “finger accusing the darkness” risks purple, but it opens the piece and sets the accusatory frame that closure absolves, so forgiven.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fusion of variable-star astrophysics with ancestral trauma healing is non-obvious and specific; no trope template matches it. The daylily-telegram as compressed archive feels fresh and irreplicable. Risk taken in lyric accumulative structure pays off because the 3:47 AM cadence shift teaches the pattern early and closure reuses it.</comment>
