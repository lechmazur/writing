<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The gardener’s motivation to honor the dead and “give voice to silent echoes” is clear, but his interior contradiction—why this tapestry matters now—remains abstract; no micro-choice under pressure tests that motive. Emotion is embodied (stained fingers, quiet resolve) yet never forces a visible trade-off, so the arc is observational rather than crucible-forged. The earned change is gentle understanding, but the cost is only conceptual; we feel no path foreclosed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the silver “tear” thread reweights silence itself as a valid intention, a quiet but legible before/after. Causality is lyric-accumulative; each decoded thread adds density rather than narrows options, yet the pattern holds. Orientation is swift—cemetery, silo, bench by line 60—so no penalty. The only slack is that the tapestry’s maker is never anchored as a prior lived presence, so the “pact” feels archival more than urgent.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Cobalt silo, star-ribbons, velveteen gloom—each recurrent image is recharged at exit, turning environment into emotional mirror. Micro-setting (antique case, low bench) constrains posture and attention, guiding the painstaking untangling beat. Cemetery gravel and thread-dye provide tactile specificity; weather is absent but not missed. Spatial choreography is immaculate; we track boots, bench, tapestry spread in a tight 360° arc.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—decode the unspoken—signals early, but pressure is textural: each knot tightens patience, not risk. No live option is foreclosed; failure would merely leave the mystery intact, so cost is aesthetic rather than consequential. Escalation is a cadence shift from “jumble” to “smooth,” satisfying under Accumulative lens. A visible price (time, sore fingers) is paid, yet it alters no tactic beyond persistence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: intentions can be wordless yet fully weighted. The tapestry’s silver tear reprises moonlight and cemetery stars, reconfiguring silence as mercy rather than absence. No explicit moral is stated; the reader is left to feel that grief’s language may be thread, not speech. The concept stays narrow, avoiding pseudo-profundity, but the spareness also caps resonance at quiet rather than revelatory.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person lyric floats close to the gardener’s perceptual filter—his whistle, hum, stained fingers—without leaking into omniscient exposition. Diction stays within a groundskeeper’s plausible lexicon; “velveteen gloom” is the single poetic reach, justified by repeated use. Rhythm mirrors the untangling motion: long sentences for knots, clipped fragments for release. No dialogue, so voice remains uninterrupted; syntax is varied, read-aloud smooth.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Information density is high—every sentence advances image, metaphor, or action. Figurative language is selective: “silver thread like a tear” recurs and pays off. Minor scaffold: “tenderly organized shelves / tenderly organized testament” is deliberate echo, not loop. No mixed metaphors, no filter-verb clutter; opening and closing lines anchor voice and re-charge motif.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The chess-clock-silo- tapestry nexus feels fresh, merging cemetery gothic with archival archaeology. Yet the decoded love-pact is a familiar trope; specificity lies in sensory compression, not moral surprise. Risk is moderate—lyric accumulation over plot—but execution is confident. The synthesis is memorable rather than groundbreaking.</comment>
