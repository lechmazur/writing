<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The gravity-defier’s interior contradiction—yearning to dissolve the labyrinth yet fearing the erasure it entails—surfaces in embodied micro-choices (touching tablet, stepping onto bridge). Her arc lands in credible Earned Stasis: surrender to infinite recursion, the cost legible in the viaduct’s crimson fade. Periodic eternity functions as constraint, not label, forcing amnesiac re-starts that shape tactics. Voice stays singular; no second character, so status/relationship bullets waived.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: “she had become its architect” reweights the premise with undeniable ontological cost under Accumulative/Textural lens. Pattern taught early—folded timelines, procedural corridors—pays off in final image of rain-waiting traveler. Orientation anchored by viaduct/moss/tablet within 120 words; no penalty. One meaningful tightening: tablet cracks, runes spell “You are the labyrinth,” collapsing options. Cost visible in crimson glow-to-ordinary stone transition.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Glowing viaduct stones function as micro-setting/tool hybrid: phosphorescence guides/narrows footfalls, crimson fade signals cost. Rain, moss, clay dust are tactile, POV-filtered, never catalogued. Spatial choreography clean: she steps, floats, presses; objects track. Weather and surface explicitly alter footing and visibility, forcing slower moves. Final dimming charges closure image under RR.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—conquer self before next eternal phase—signaled in line 5. Escalation via procedural corridors that rewrite themselves, narrowing escape routes; tablet crack moment visibly raises cost. Agency remains interior (acceptance) yet forecloses all future escapes; cost legible in dissolution-to-dust. No coincidence; pressure coherent under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly: self as endlessly generative maze, freedom through surrender. No explicit thesis; final image of next raindrop reframes prior failures as recursive necessity. Labyrinth motif constrains every choice, reweights at closure. Ambiguity lingers—architect or prisoner?—without confusion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lyric third-person hovers at lyric distance yet stays anchored to her perceptual filter—“phosphorescent moss,” “runes bleeding light.” Syntax compresses under pressure—“Between the drop and the ripple, she moved backward”—teaching cadence early. No dialogue, hence no voice convergence issue. Register stable, vocab poetic but internally consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>High information density: one sentence often jobs—image, motion, concept—without scaffold. Rhythm accelerates at tablet crack, breathes at dissolution. No synonym loops; “glow”/“brightening” recur with purposeful tonal decay. One mixed metaphor—“gravity’s memory”—but paid off by final weightlessness. Minor filter-verb clusters absent. Clean copy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fractured-timeline + procedural-labyrinth + periodic immortality synthesizes fresh angle on familiar self-exploration. Surrender-as-victory inversion feels inevitable given recursive rules. Risky lyric compression taught early and holds. Specificity of clay tablet dust in viaduct cracks anchors universality. Not 9+ only because core metaphor—self as maze—remains recognizable archetype.</comment>
