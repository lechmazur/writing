<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The archivist’s interiority is concrete—her reverent fingers, the shiver of “haunted euphoria”—and her choice to write the covenant anew is embodied. Yet the contradiction between preserving fragility and forcing regeneration is asserted rather than dramatized; we never see her hesitate or err, so the flaw feels safety-hedged. Micro-choices (climbing the hillside, steeping tea) mirror values but carry no visible cost; the ending’s cost is atmospheric, not character-bound. Still, her perceptual signature is distinct and consistent.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: each sensory layer (walnut-ink, jasmine, salt air) densifies until the final image reweights the stake. Closure is a Charged Poise—her journal becomes a “map” for others—conceptual cost legible. The Orientation Test is waived: disorientation (who/where delayed) is taught early and pays off in the twilight jetty image. One meaningful tightening occurs when she uncaps the ink vial, foreclosing retreat. No causal break, but escalation is atmospheric rather than tactical.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Environment-as-tool: the jetty’s moss-slick planks constrain her climb; night-blooming jasmine scent charges the final bouquet image. Sensory economy is strong—walnut-ink aroma, salt-kissed air—filtered through archivist’s preservative bias. Spatial choreography clean: scroll → locket → hillside → jetty progression tracked without drift. The micro-setting (locket photo as “brittle scroll” proxy) functions as site of covenant rebirth, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve small moments—signaled early. Escalation is density-based: each object (scroll, locket, ink) layers memory-weight until the jetty becomes threshold. No visible price (no torn sleeve, no dropped key) keeps it below 7.0; cost is atmospheric. Agency is present—she writes—but the tightening is lyric, not tactical.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges via pattern: “small moment” objects (locket, jasmine sprig, ink stroke) accrete until the collective weight redefines covenant as communal, not private. No thesis statement; final journal line offers resonant non-literal answer. Subtext in gestures—tucking photo into fresh journal—implies archival love as living ritual. Avoids moralizing; ambiguity lingers in “anchor or drift.”</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays close to archivist’s preservative perceptual filter; diction (“salt-kissed twilight,” “walnut-inked pages”) is rhythmically compressed yet legible. Filter verbs minimal; sensory selection biased toward fragility. No dialogue to test voice distinction. Psychic distance stable; no head-hop. Peak stress shows in fragmentary “haunted euphoria,” a micro-shift that heightens without opacity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies: long breathless sentence of climb, then short final line. No scaffold loops; each sentence advances image or memory. Metaphors stay coherent (jetty as “dark ribbon”). One mixed image—“weight of small moments” is abstract—detracts slightly. Opening and closing lines anchor and recharge motif cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: archival conservation meets coastal elegy; covenant regenerated via scent and ink rather than speech. Night-blooming jasmine as communal offering transforms familiar mourning ritual. Risk taken in lyric accumulative structure pays off in final bouquet. Could swap village detail for another coast, but the archival-ink specificity keeps it above median.</comment>
