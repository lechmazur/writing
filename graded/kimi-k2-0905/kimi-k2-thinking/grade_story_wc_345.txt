<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Characters function as a communal "we," which flattens individual interiority; no single psyche shows contradictory impulses under pressure. Ghost lacks motive beyond benevolent template; community’s shift from skepticism to trust is declared, not dramatized. Final spiral chalk mark gestures toward cost but no one visibly forfeits anything, so Earned Stasis feels asserted, not paid for.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Accumulative lens: lyric montage of orchard life, ghost clues, bell ritual. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—spiral reframes hope as tangled—yet cost is cosmological, not personal; no named character forfeits a concrete want. Causality remains poetic rather than tactical; scarcity threat is announced but never squeezes a choice.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Floating arches, chalk glyphs, bronze bell etched with wings—details are sensory and specific. Environment never constrains a decision; arches serve as picturesque irrigation conduit rather than obstacle. Micro-setting (bell handle cool against shared palms) is the sole tactile anchor that briefly merges body and tool.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—save orchard from drought—is declared early but never tightens; no resource is visibly depleted, no live option foreclosed. Ghost’s messages remove tension by handing solutions wholesale. Final bell ring produces abundance without trade-off; escalation is aesthetic mist, not rising cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Theme of collective interdependence emerges through orchard labor imagery; subtext avoids sermonizing. Brambled hope motif returns in final spiral, but abstraction outweighs embodied cost. Insight feels gentle rather than urgent; ambiguity is present yet low-temperature because stakes never become visceral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lyric communal voice sustains consistent cadence; diction leans pastoral-philosophical without purple drift. Patterned repetition ("they gathered," "they understood") teaches its choral rhythm early and pays off in final hush. No dialogue, so voice convergence risk is avoided; perceptual signature is collective, not individuated.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length; no template cadence or synonym churn. Figurative language is restrained—"sky blushed," "nebula of respite"—and does not clog high-pressure moments. Occasional soft filters ("felt the stirrings") but immediacy returns through concrete noun pairs ("calloused hands," "bronze surface"). Clean copy, no scaffolds.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Altruistic ghost guiding farmers via chalk glyphs is fresh; pairing with butterfly bell as irrigation tech offers whimsical specificity. Yet core arc—mystic helper saves commune—leans on familiar utopian template. Risk is aesthetic, not moral; story commits to lyric uplift without subverting expectation. Specific planetary orchard details prevent full generic slide.</comment>
