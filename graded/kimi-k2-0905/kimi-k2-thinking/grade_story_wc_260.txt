<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—shame versus the need to keep caring—remains concrete in every micro-gesture (trembling fingers, deliberate feeding of brochures to the stove). The tail-tip injury externalizes her complicity and gives her a tactile penance to perform, so her choice to heal Veridian first is causally earned. Minor over-articulation (“balance wasn’t about never falling…”) edges toward diagnostic-speak, clipping the top band. Still, the final blue shift of the chameleon crystallizes her earned stance with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: because the partner vanished, therefore she burns the brochures; because the tail is wounded, therefore she mixes salve and stays to fight for custody. One clear Decisive Change—she opens the door to the officer—carries the concrete risk of public shame and loss of license. Orientation is clean within 60 words; the only soft spot is a mid-paragraph summary of “three hours ago” that could have been dramatized, but the closure beat is untouched.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The workshop’s cedar/jasmine mix is filtered through Elara’s guilt—every scent note is either tainted or reclaimed. Micro-setting succeeds: the amber jar, the wood-stove flare, and Veridian’s color-shifts all constrain her next move and charge the final image. Starlight “bleeding through like liquid silver” is the one phrase that edges purple, but it is isolated and pays off by echoing in the “shimmer even in stillness” closure. Spatial track is flawless—hands, tails, flames, and papers all remain possible.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can she still claim the right to care after abetting harm—tightens when each brochure burn removes the option to keep hiding behind paperwork. Escalation is accumulative: each healed animal subtracts a reason to flee and adds a reason to stay and face charges. No external reversals, but one internal micro-turn at the tail-tip salve beats the rhythm. Cost is felt: public shame, legal jeopardy, and the irreversible scar on Veridian’s tail.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the concrete particular of a chameleon’s regenerating tail: healing is not erasure but scarred adaptation. No moral is preached; the insight is literalized in Veridian’s color shift to “truth remembered” blue. Subtext operates in silence—Veridian’s stillness under the brush says more about forgiveness than any confession. The notebook addendum risks a thematic echo, but its placement before the officer’s arrival keeps it private armor rather than sermon.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elara’s perceptual filter; even the stars are “liquid silver” because she needs soft light, not astronomy. Syntax lengthens under grief, then fractures into short instrumental verbs (“mixed,” “lifted,” “brushed”) during the salve scene, mirroring her narrowing focus. No dialogue, so voice distinction is tested solely within interiority and passes. The controlled repetition of “tail tip” becomes rhythmic incision, not template drum.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm is supple: long sensory sentence, then a staccato instrumental clause, mirroring her inhale/exhale of shame. Only one scaffold loop—“the workshop smelled… now tainted by memory”—restates what the next sentence shows via burning brochures; a −0.2 paraphrase tap applies. No mixed metaphors, no filter-verb stacks. Opening and closing lines anchor and release with mirror-star imagery that recharges rather than decorates.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The “wildlife con” premise is familiar, but the compression into one tail-tip salve as the entire moral crucible feels fresh. Color-shifting chameleon as live polygraph of owner’s conscience is a sharp, specific twist that would not survive substitution. Risk is taken in the quiet ending—no press conference, no viral video—trusting the blue shift to carry cost. The synthesis of fraud fallout with tactile animal healing makes the angle memorable rather than message-y.</comment>
