<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Emlyn’s “emotionally rational” label is asserted but never embodied in contradictory action; she photographs a page and walks away, so the cost of truth-telling is only declared. No interior friction or flaw complicates her steady ascent to wisdom, so the arc feels pre-decided rather than earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the garden’s new roses reweight the lie into public knowledge with visible communal cost. Causality is thin—no obstacle between finding the letter and publishing it—but the lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds via recurring ivy/rose imagery that charges the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Station and ivy are tactile, photographed, and mirrored in the letter’s gold vines; the micro-setting (ledger under ivy) literally hides the MacGuffin, so environment constrains discovery. Sensory range stays narrow but purposeful; the ruin’s texture feeds the theme without tourist excess.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Stakes are declared (“rescue truth”) yet never tested; no institutional resistance, moral dilemma, or personal loss appears on-page. Pressure stays flat—finding the letter is effortless—so the single tightening is rhetorical rather than experiential.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of noble lies versus honest futures emerges through parallel imagery (station/ledger/roses) rather than lecture. Final garden image reconfigures the lie as compost for new growth—an elegant CR—though the absence of counter-argument keeps complexity shy of 8+.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Third-limited stays anchored to Emlyn; perceptual signature is academic-noticing (“mirrored a forgotten testimony”) without slipping into lecture. Rhythm is steady, but compressed phrasing under pressure is absent since pressure itself is absent; voice is coherent yet not distinctive enough for 8+.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Clean, readable prose; occasional template cadence (“each rusted rail… each cracked window”) but no loops scar the closure. Metaphors stay consistent (ivy/veins/petals); one mixed moment (“railway station stood swallowed by ivy, its iron ribs wrapped in green veins”) barely clouds the lens.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The archival rescue trope is refreshed by living archive/garden conversion, but the plot beats (lonely scholar finds smoking-gun marginalia, public instantly agrees) are familiar. Specificity of the illuminated ‘L’ and the station-to-garden re-use lift it above mid-band; still, the absence of resistance keeps risk moderate.</comment>
