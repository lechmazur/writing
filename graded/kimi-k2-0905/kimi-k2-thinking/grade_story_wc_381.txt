<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is vivid—his perceptual filter for “quiet spaces between sounds” is specific—but the emotional contradiction between duty and doubt is told more than embodied. The final shrug-question “was peace worth the price of ignorance?” lands as an abstract summary rather than a felt cost; no bodily trace of the cramp or paper-weight remains to embody the choice. Still, his micro-choices (folding, placing against the flow) align with motive and foreclose the prophetic path, satisfying baseline earned change.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure is clean: the final crane dipped in water triggers the decisive hush that rewrites the brook’s song—visible before/after with conceptual cost. Causal chain holds: 27 cranes → inverted flow → silence rewrites prophecy; no teleporting rules. Orientation is anchored by line 3 (who/where/when). The single causality worry: the “terrestrially cosmic” rule is never materialized—it reads as decorative adjective rather than constraint—so the universe-level stakes feel declared, not proven, capping the score below 8.5.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Brook, moonlit stones, and paper cranes are rendered with selective sensory economy; sound-as-letter metaphor streams through action rather than catalog. The cranes function as micro-setting—keys inserted into the water-lock—so the object-setting gate for 9+ is met. Spatial choreography is flawless: 27 cranes placed upstream-backward, each spot legible. Only the “terrestrially cosmic” sky remains a brushed stroke, never tightening tactics, keeping it under 8.8.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—hush the prophecy—signaled early; escalation is the deepening listening required for each upstream crane, a nice inversion of natural flow. The tightening beat is the final wing dipping, which silences meaning itself, foreclosing Elias’s option to ever re-hear the warning. Cost is conceptual (world loses memory of flood) but not viscerally felt by character on the page, so pressure stops short of 8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: the ethics of silencing danger to preserve peace. Subtext sits in the brook’s recovered “innocent” babble—an ironic victory. No moralizing paragraph; the question is left suspended in the final folded sheet. The crane recurrence shifts from instrument to tombstone of foresight, satisfying motif-use rules.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited holds steady inside Elias’s perceptions; diction—“crystalline tongue,” “smoothed hush”—is character-colored, not writerly flourish. Rhythm compresses under pressure (short clauses during final dip) then widens into dawn release, mirroring task fatigue. No head-hop or filter-verb clutter; every metaphor is something Elias could plausibly think.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet breathable: one sentence folds action, image, and world-rule (“Each placement required him to listen deeper…”). Figurative language is patterned and paid off—shadow-bridge, ink-spread hush—never crowding a single beat. Tiny loop: “tranquil blaze” appears twice without perceptual shift; not enough to dull closure. Otherwise no scaffold, no mixed metaphors, strong verb choices throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Origami-as-silence-engine is fresh; merging hydromancy with paper-keys feels specific and inevitable in hindsight. Risk is taken by making the climax the absence of sound rather than spectacle, and it pays. The “map silence” mechanic could become gimmick but is grounded in Elias’s lifetime craft mention. Only the “terrestrially cosmic” tag feels like unearned grandeur, slightly blunting novelty.</comment>
