<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elara’s “quiet, deliberate” trait is embodied in the steady automaton ritual, but the interiority never crystallizes into a contradictory impulse; the cost is aesthetic (shadows gone) rather than personal, so the change feels light. She never risks failure or moral trade-off; the seal succeeds on first try, muting pressure. Competence is balanced with calm, yet genuine struggle is off-page. Motivation is clear, but the arc is more discovery than crucible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Causal chain is clean: automaton key → loops → seal; each because/therefore step narrows options until shadows are channelled into the pocket. Closure lands as conceptual repricing—noon now literally shadowless—felt cost is the world’s altered optics. One micro-turn (reversed serpent) tightens the circuit. Orientation is immediate; no prop or rule drifts. The only stretch is the off-stage “sealed awakening,” but its threat is validated by the ritual’s success.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Floating isle, brass key, and rune-lit automaton are sketched with selective sensory strokes; moonlight angles and gear-hum anchor the beats. Micro-setting (automaton core) literally constrains the final choice. No world-rule contradiction; spoon-bent reality stays off-canvas, functioning as许可的异化背景. Spatial choreography is crystal—bodies, key, and shadows track cleanly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“where shadows go”—is signaled early and re-weighted when Elara realizes the automaton is the pocket. Tightening occurs loop-by-loop; each traced rune forecloses error and channels more shadow. Cost is conceptual: the world loses noon shadows forever; that price is legible in the final balcony image. Agency is pure—every escalation is her deliberate trace—yet the absence of resistance keeps this shy of 8.5.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</theme><comment>Theme of hidden order emerges from runes and clockwork rather than exposition; no moral is stated. Shadows as ungoverned phenomena vs. human-caged pattern offers a clean conceptual re-pricing. Subtext is light—quiet scholar becomes invisible guardian—but the lack of personal cost keeps resonance cerebral rather than gut-felt. Final image re-weights the premise effectively without sentimentality.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Voice is hushed, patient, Latinate-leaning (“luminous lattice,” “conceptual repricing”) that mirrors Elara’s deliberation; rhythm slows into longer sentences as loops close. No dialogue, so idiom and distance stay consistent. Perceptual signature is star-and-shadow obsessed, never generic. One clause drifts toward editorial uplift (“world could breathe a little easier”), but the bulk sustains restraint.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sentences carry double duty—description plus causal push (“Gears clicked, resonating...”). Metaphors are spare and coherent; no mixed vehicles. Occasional scaffold (“She began the first loop... then the next...”) but artifacts never touch closure. Opening and final lines are sharp, book-ending with mechanical tick and drifting isle. Minor paraphrase loops inside ritual sequence (−0.2) are the only drag.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: runic scholarship + clockwork automaton as shadow engine transforms a nursery mystery into conceptual fantasy. Risk is quiet—no villains, no explosions—yet the piece commits fully to its internal logic. Shadow-pocket as noon solution feels inevitable in hindsight. Not 9+ because premise is still a scholar-solving-puzzle tale, a familiar spine even if upholstery is inventive.</comment>
