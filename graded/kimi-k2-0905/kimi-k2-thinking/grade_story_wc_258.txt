<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is consistently particular—measuring the loft in millimeters to anchor abstract collapse in physical space. The trait “steadily curious” is dramatized: she refuses to comfort the client, instead multiplying paths with the cards, a micro-choice that visibly costs him emotional ease. Her flaw—hubris of pattern-making—implicitly complicates the ending: she’s building the next culture but may be repeating the same god-complex. The architect’s trembling hands and loose suit give secondary pressure without crowding the crucible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the measuring tape stretched across the spread reweights “ruin-to-possibility” as a grid the architect can now read, costing him his prior worldview. Causal lattice holds: each card dealt is a because/therefore node—seven towers fall, therefore roots appear, therefore the architect asks to rebuild. The rain metronome and tape-coiled-between-them object keep tension material. Orientation is taught early (“rain assaulting the skylight” by word 6) and anchors hold.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The loft itself is a micro-setting that constrains: east-wall-to-floorboard axis dictates the timeline of collapse; skylight rain becomes a dark mirror charging the final image. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true—Mara notices millimeters, ink pools, loose suit cloth, not tourist city vistas. Weather affects choice: storm keeps them loft-bound, raindrops as pixels literalizes her decoding labor. Spatial choreography clean—tape, cards, ink, bodies tracked across single room without drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can culture be reverse-engineered after currency failure—tightens when the architect begs “Show me how to build again,” foreclosing his old decentralized dogma. Agency: Mara’s decision to rotate the spread multiplies paths, visibly charging the grid with social cost—he must now navigate a web, not a chain. No coincidence; pressure coheres under causal lens. Price is legible: his hubris reflected in obsidian mirror, suit now empty symbol.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges without abstraction: collective panic mapped as physical texture—ink pools, pencil lines, tape numbers—making culture a measurable wound. Subtext in gesture: architect tracing the path “through the onyx symbols” shows conversion, not told. Final image reverses Genesis: towers dust → roots network, repricing decentralization as organic interdependence. No moralizing; resonance lives in the grid the reader must re-see.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is perceptual signature: cartomancer diction—“watershed, fork, sacred geometry”—without slipping into tarot cliché; syntax lengthens when she thinks in vectors, shortens under rain metronome. No head-hopping; single POV held. Compression taught early—“rain wouldn’t stop assaulting”—and paid off in final pixel-drop. Register stays within her plausible lexicon; no academic drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose propels: information-dense lines (“black as the markets that had imploded”) do double job of color and backstory. Rhythm varies: long anaphoric cadence when multiplying paths, staccato when drops become pixels. No loops; each mention of tape/ink reweights meaning. Metaphors stay coherent—rain as pixels, cards as watersheds—without mixed logic. Copy clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: post-crypto cartomancy + architectural reverse-engineering feels inevitable yet unseen. Risk of second-person–style address to reader (“she’d confide”) is taken and justified by inherited mystery tone. Tape-as-timeline and cards-as-topology transform familiar props into epistemic tools. The “web not chain” repricing is non-obvious and grows from prior particulars; not a stitched prompt response.</comment>
