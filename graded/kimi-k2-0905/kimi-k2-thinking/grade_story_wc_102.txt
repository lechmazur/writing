<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is lush and embodied—“camera obscura artist” perceptual lens never drops—but the final release of “unused love” is asserted rather than dramatized via a last visible micro-choice. No contradictory impulse complicates the pilgrim stance once the corridor opens; the lover’s dissolve is accepted without cost shown on the page. The arc is credible and affecting, yet the climax leans on epiphanic declaration, not an irreversible act.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each breath-toggled refraction adds luminous density until the hidden chamber reveals sparks that reweight memory. Closure is a Charged Poise—Mira exhales, chamber seals, love released—cost felt as “quiet resonance” and fog lifting to silver path. Orientation anchored by word 20 (“Mira stepped onto the viaduct”), pattern taught early, no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The viaduct’s iron rails, fog, and blooming flora double as optical aperture for the camera obscura; every metallic edge or blossom refracts through Kwan Yin’s tear, constraining how Mira can “see” memory. Micro-setting = breath-controlled lens; final image of silver path is charged by this embodied tool-environment fusion. Sensory hierarchy stays painterly, never touristic; spatial choreography clean across 800 words.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“where is unused love stored?”—tightens as each breath deepens the corridor of light, foreclosing the option that love was ever lost; price is the dissolution of the spectral lover. Escalation is textural: density of sparks increases until Mira’s chest becomes the vessel that must open. Agency = renunciation/release; no external antagonist needed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</question><comment>Theme emerges from refraction metaphor: love preserved ≠ love lost. Final image of “silver path” reweights prior “vault” metaphor without moralizing. Subtext operates in silence—no dialogue, only breath and light. Avoids thesis-statement until single late “She understood…” which is tolerated because immediately grounded in concrete released warmth.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lyric, single-POV present; perceptual signature is photographer-optical: “ghostly whispers,” “filmstrip unspooling,” “prisms on stone.” Syntax breathes—enjambed fragments mirror inhale/exhale without drum-beat cadence. No dialogue = no voice drift. Compression taught early (“camera obscura artist”) and paid off in final internal radiance image.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High information density: one sentence often carries sensory, emotional, and symbolic load. No loops or synonym churn; metaphors stay within optic/light register. Occasional elevated diction (“luminous fragments,” “spectral form”) fits pilgrim lyric mode. Final third clean—no artifact touches closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fusion of Buddhist reliquary (Kwan Yin tear) with camera obscura is fresh; “pilgrim of sparks” concept spiritualizes pixel-light. Breath-as-aperture mechanic is non-obvious and drives entire plot. Risk: lyric meditation could feel generic, but optical specificity grounds it. Missing higher band because premise could swap any memory-object without breaking arc.</comment>
