<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Lira’s interiority is sensorily rich (the mulberry ache, fracture-mirror reflection) and her renunciation is foreshadowed, yet the decisive moment—“she told the envoy that the instrument was too fragile to travel”—is paraphrased, not dramatized, softening the felt cost. The telepathy and violin obsession are vividly embodied, but the empire envoy remains a silhouette, muting status pressure. Emotions edge toward performed rather than contradictory under peak pressure. Still, the final stance is coherent and character-particular.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural; cadence and image density tighten toward the seed-planting image that reweights the stake. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the unbroken circle in the coffee stain and the new shoot refract Lira’s forfeiture of funding into tangible hope. Orientation is anchored by sentence 3; transitions are legible under a single scene. Cost is felt yet mildly abstract—“mulberry ache softened into quiet certainty”—stopping just short of visceral punch required for 8.8+.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>The velvet observatory, jasmine scent, and midsummer half-light function as micro-setting, constraining Lira’s access and timing of the planting. Selective sensory layering (jasmine whisper, telescope starlight through ice) feeds the accumulative texture without stalling motion. Spatial choreography is clean; no floating props. The environment is not just mood but materially enables her hiding spot and final garden, qualifying for 9- gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—seed autonomy vs empire commodification—is signaled early and tightens when the envoy knocks. The perforated-destiny metaphor repeatedly narrows options (torn veil, fractured reflection). Escalation is textural: density of plant whispers and coffee stains increases until Lira’s renunciation severs the empire path. Cost is present—lost funding, hollow violin—but conveyed more conceptually than somatically, keeping it from 8.8+.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme of stewardship vs exploitation emerges through the violin-seed, not exposition. The mulberry ache, crown-shaped stain, and unbroken circle reconfigure meaning without moralizing. Subtext in jasmine’s whispered commands and the envoy’s “chrome-tinted glasses” efficiently encodes corporate chill. Final image crystallizes the question—archive vs empire—leaving lingering ambiguity about future survival, satisfying complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person POV maintains steady psychic distance; free indirect style dips cleanly (“She feared it would vanish…”). Perceptual signature is botanically slanted—every leaf murmurs, night-blooming jasmine “whispered secrets”—creating a consistent lyric texture. No head-hopping; envoy’s voice briefly surfaces through Lira’s filter. Prose rhythm modulates: longer cadences for reflection, clipped fragments at envoy’s arrival. Diction stays within scholarly yet sensorial lexicon, no register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Sentence music is generally varied, but recurring “velvet/dewdrop/whisper” clusters flirt with over-indulgence in a 700-word space. Mixed metaphors are avoided; vehicles stay organic. Information density is high—every line advances image or stakes—yet occasional scaffold appears (“She poured…letting the dark liquid settle into patterns that might reveal…”). No artifact touches closure; final paragraph lands cleanly. Paraphrase loops are minor, not systemic.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Fusing climate-botanic hope with provenance noir feels fresh; ice-crystal violin as genetic ark is novel and inevitable in hindsight. The telepathy-origin lab accident is sketched not explained, avoiding exposition dump. Accumulation of fragile-transparency motifs (ice violin, perforated destiny, transparent memorial) synthesizes organically. Risk: lyric density verging on preciousness, but coherence of design and earned final reversal offset the danger.</comment>
