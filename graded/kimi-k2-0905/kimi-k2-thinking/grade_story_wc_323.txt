<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mara’s “balancedly curious” nature is shown through tactile obsession with the anchor link and her refusal to surrender starlight; the final moment where she watches Corin become his own compass crystallizes a credible, earned endurance with visible cost—she will never see real stars yet keeps teaching their memory.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: each echo of “edge geometry” and starlight accretes until the anchor’s rust map reweights meaning; the closure is a resonant reconfiguration—Corin’s bioluminescent Ursa Major—where the cost is felt: starlight becomes internal, unreachable yet navigable.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The corroded anchor link functions as micro-setting that constrains every beat; its pits become star map, its fissures constellations, charging the final image; Pelagia’s dome and pressure layers are sketched with sonic, tactile, and luminous specificity filtered through Mara’s professional priorities.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—teaching starlight to the starless—tightens once: from decoding ocean-skin angles to watching Corin embody Ursa Major; the cost is conceptual yet legible: the method is imperfect, the stars remain unseen, but the path inside is irreversibly opened.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</question><comment>Theme emerges without statement: navigation as internalized memory; the anchor’s corrosion reprises as stellar cartography, reframing rust as information; the ending’s non-literal answer—stars carried inside—carries conceptual cost and avoids final-paragraph moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyric, compressed diction stays within Mara’s lexicon; “somber marvel” modulates from hush to crystalline bioluminescent pulse; perceptual signature is selective—pressure tug, metallic taste, spectral refraction—without head-hop; rhythmic acceleration under final meditation beat mirrors unfolding horizon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density: sentences layer steel/photon/geometry metaphors without muddle; no loops or scaffold; variance in sentence length and paragraphing supports breath and climax; anchor link’s state change tracked across beats; no filter-verb stacks in pressure beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: star navigation from benthic rust via pressure geometry; Tethian voices refract worklights into impossible spectra—image not seen elsewhere; risk in lyric accumulative structure pays off when closure folds space inside the body; transformation test fails if moved to land.</comment>
