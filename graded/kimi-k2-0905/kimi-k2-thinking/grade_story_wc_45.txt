<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elena’s interior contradiction—clinging to a folkloric theory she half-disbelieves—peaks when she offers to “turn my mistakes into constellations.” The embodied tremor of her hand on the envelope and the volunteered public humiliation make the renunciation credible. Moira’s shrewd innocence complicates status: the supposed victim now holds investigative power, forcing Elena to audition for absolution. Only the late, summary-heavy confession of Clara’s identity blunts the cost-on-page requirement.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: tooth arrival → confrontation → offer to rewrite narrative. The decisive change is Elena’s open surrender of professional identity (“It means undoing everything I’ve built”) with the concrete price of reputation. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) appear by line 4; no penalty. Closure line “make something better from the bones of what we broke” crystallizes new, hazardous collaboration—conceptual repricing with cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Hedge-maze yew walls narrow Elena’s path literally and emotionally; the cracked sundial becomes the table for reparative “bone-setting.” Morning-glory canopy supplies the final telescope sight-line, reframing garden as living star-map. Spatial choreography is clean: push through yew → bench → sundial → telescope. Environment is not backdrop; it forces the apology to happen in full view of the child’s once-playground, charging closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—Elena’s epistemic authority—tightens when DNA proves the fairy-tale wrong. Micro-turn at tooth hand-off narrows her choices to confession or flight. Escalation continues: naming Clara supplies second external cost. Elena’s agency drives the final offer to dismantle her own canon; price is public discredit, visible on page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from ironic inversion: folkloric “changeling” becomes human crime, academic “certainty” becomes cruelty. Subtext in Moira’s calm gardening of the telescope implies she has long awaited this reckoning. No explicit moral; instead the image of women replotting stars from errors keeps ambiguity alive. Final reweighting of “bones” from forensic evidence to moral responsibility gives lasting after-effect.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays glued to Elena’s perceptual filter: “yearning...more acutely,” “cleft in certainty.” Diction—“folklore forensics,” “conceptual repricing of night sky”—suits academic POV. Dialogue is minimal but distinct: Moira’s gnomic calm contrasts with Elena’s stammered need. No head-hop; psychic distance compresses under shame. Tense/aspect clean.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>High information density: “DNA matching the living MacLeod matriarch, carbon dating...” carries exposition without drag. Rhythm accelerates into short clauses as Elena confronts Moira, then relaxes into telescope image. Occasional elevated Latinate diction (“epistemic,” “repricing”) fits character but edges toward register drift; not enough to cloud closure. No loops or paraphrase stacks.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: changeling folklore × forensic cold-case × pedophile abduction, welded through single baby-tooth MacGuffin. Reversal of expert-fanatic into penitent ticks transformation test. Risk lies in compressed 740-word reveal of thirty-year conspiracy; still earns plausibility via journal device. Not radically experimental, but angle feels newly unsettling rather than gimmick.</comment>
