<comment>Mara’s interiority is lyrically rendered and her motive—transmute isolation into stewardship—drives every beat; the embodied shift from passive “observer” to active “bridge” is dramatized through tactile micro-choices (touching the sundial, recording hums). Yet the arc leans on summary more than scene, so the moment of irrevocable cost is felt conceptually rather than through a single, body-level beat that forecloses retreat.</comment>

<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the piece teaches its pattern of echo-and-reprise early (tidal shelves, ghost-flicker) and lands a Resonant Reconfiguration—Mara’s pulse fuses with extinct rhythms, re-weighting isolation into custodianship. Closure carries visible conceptual cost (“she is both present and echo”), but the absence of a crisp, causal trigger between sundial-touch and final fusion keeps it shy of 9-territory.</comment>

<comment>“Tidal library above clouds” is compressed into motion—shelves realign to heartbeat, clouds part for a sunrise-never-was—so the setting actively constrains her final stance. Micro-setting objects (sundial, stones) are handled, not catalogued, and their physical logic (atomic light, vibration) charges the closing image. Spatial choreography stays clean across the single continuous scene.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—will she remain isolated observer or become living archive—is signaled early and tightens through density increases (each spectral encounter layers mnemonic data into her body). One meaningful deepening occurs when the sundial projects ghosts into “tangible forms,” narrowing options: she must bear their chorus inside her. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral, adequate for length but not scalding.</comment>

<comment>Theme emerges from the iterative equation isolation = archive; the closing sunrise-that-never-was re-prices time as braided web, not line. Subtext resides in sensory image (mammoth mist brushing skin) rather than thesis. Final image avoids moralizing, offering charged poise: she stands “as weaver of time,” a resonant answer whose ambiguity invites re-reading.</comment>

<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric maintains consistent perceptual signature—light is “atomically reflective,” heartbeats are “extinct frequencies”—and modulates rhythm under pressure (fragments tighten during spectral merger). No head-hopping; psychic distance stays shallow and embodied. Diction occasionally drifts toward elevated register (“conceptual repricing”-level abstractions) but remains anchored in Mara’s sensory filter.</comment>

<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet agile: stacked metaphors (“brittle awakening,” “temporal tides”) are patterned early and paid off, so figurative layering feels earned, not purple. Repetitive stems (“she feels… she begins… she records…”) create mild template cadence mid-text, dulling momentum before the final paragraph recovers variability. No paraphrase loops or simultaneity errors; clause order stays lucid.</comment>

<comment>Floating memory-library that breathes extinct DNA into living archive is a fresh synthesis; risk is taken by making climax a conceptual rather than physical act, yet coherence holds. The sundial’s “atomic dance of ancient sunlight” re-weights bronze into data-storage medium—an inventive turn that feels inevitable once revealed. Transformation test passes: swap names or venue and the entire emotional algorithm collapses.</comment>
