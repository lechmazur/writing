<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Cinder’s interiority is lyrically specific—her body registers the “gravity of hopelessness thick as tar” while her fingers remember every twist of the rag knot—yet her motives stay general: “ignite a defiant light” never meets a named personal wound or micro-choice that would foreclose a path. The mosaic word “Rise” functions as an external trigger, not a crucible that forces her to risk or relinquish something she wants, so the cost feels abstract rather than character-bound. Earned stasis is gestured at—she walks on—but the page does not crystallize what refusal or renunciation she pays for that onward motion. Micro-choices (looping the knot, striking flint) are spirited but not contradictory; they align cleanly with her single-track desire, flattening complexity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure arrives as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the flames create a communal “chorus of gasps” that visibly loosens despair, and the final image of ember dust trailing behind Cinder gives theconceptual cost—that she must keep burning her own fuel. Causality is accumulative/textural: each sensory echo (chant, clink, mosaic) layers density until the fire re-weights the night’s meaning. The lens holds without ambiguity; the empty sky and blooming fortress are anchored by word 40. One soft loop—“She smiled. She smiled again”—is minor scaffold that does not touch the climax beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The fortress is rendered through kinetic, body-level discovery: Cinder’s boots crunch, her knees press into broken tiles, the kerosene rag’s weight drags at her hip—environment, tool, and body converge to constrain her final spin of flame. Violet wisteria and starless sky are re-filtered through the violet helix of fire, letting setting elements charge the closing image. Spatial choreography is clean; the half-buried archway is tracked from approach to kneeling to reflected glow. Selective sensory economy—perfume masking mortar, ceramic clink echoing—keeps momentum while rooting atmosphere.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—shatter the fortress’s hopelessness—is signaled early and tightened once: the mosaic command “Rise” makes the act of ignition unavoidable; refusal would leave the night unchallenged. Escalation is textural: density of floral/airborne imagery accrues until the fire’s helix re-prices the stakes, turning watchers from hidden despair to audible wonder. Cinder’s agency is decisive—she alone spins the flame—but the cost (charred rag, kerosene scent lingering as future burden) is more conceptual than viscerally felt, keeping the pressure vivid yet slightly abstract.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without slogans: the mosaic note becomes a literal instruction that art can weaponize beauty against void, a concept repriced when the violet flame mirrors the violet blooms. Subtext lives in gesture—Cinder’s whispered “We rise” transfers credit from solo arsonist to communal breath, implying solidarity born of spectacle. The ending offers resonant ambiguity: the fortress glows “like a promise,” yet the next ruin awaits, so hope is portable, consumable, never possessed. No therapeutic self-diagnosis or moralizing paragraph intrudes; meaning stays in image and scent.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited maintains a consistent lyric distance that can compress to “stubborn spark within” without overstepping Cinder’s lexicon. Syntax grows breathless under pressure—“The fire spun in a helix, a dancer of light”—yet stays anchored in concrete verbs. Perceptual signature is distinct: Cinder notices wind-borne ceramic percussion and kerosene ghosts on her fingers, not tourist-catalog botany. No head-hop, no filter-verb clusters; rhythmic repetition of “She smiled” is intentional cadence rather than artifact.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies: long floral clauses collapse into staccato sparks—“She struck a flint, and the knot erupted.” Figurative layering is dense but patterned; violet blooms foreshadow violet flame, so coherence justifies the lyric load. Information density high: one sentence can layer scent, memory, and tool history without paraphrase. Minor scaffold—“the night still held no stars” repeats the void motif twice within 40 words—dulls slightly but does not obscure closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>The “wandering fireworks designer” premise refreshes the familiar “light in darkness” trope by internalizing spectacle: fireworks become portable, weaponized rag knots. Specificity—twist-by-twist memory while winding the rag, the ceramic clink as only audible map—grounds the concept in tactile craft. Risk lies in the starless void cliché, but the inversion (no stars = blank canvas) and mosaic-generated command transform it into earned world-logic. Synthesis feels inevitable; remove the rag knot or mosaic and the entire resonance collapses.</comment>
