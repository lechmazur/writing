<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Interior contradiction is vivid: the narrator clings to scavenging while longing to soar, embodied in the chipped horse and spinning camera wheel. Micro-choices—pressing dew-like stories to skin, hesitating before the ghost’s hand—escalate under pressure. The final renunciation (accepting erosion, weaving fragments) is earned by prior causal chain and carries felt cost: the ghost dissolves, leaving the narrator alone with the wheel. Voice stays singular, no label-speak; emotional arc layers regret with resolute action, satisfying 9+ quick test except for slight register drift in “conceptual repricing” line.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the camera wheel’s final spin merges ghost and self into a new vessel, cost visible in the stillness that follows. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of fragment-collecting taught early, tightening each reprise until the lagoon mirror crystallizes meaning. No causal breaks; time is deliberately nonlinear yet legible. Persistent constraint—the halted carousel—shapes every tactic; the ghost’s invitation forecloses regret’s loop.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Kinetic lagoon and sky-carousel function as micro-setting: their energy and absence constrain every move (scavenge vs. soar). Sensory detail is selective—silent ripples, faint hum—mirroring fractured interiority. Spatial choreography clean: narrator moves from reeds to broken horse to lagoon edge, objects tracked. Final image reuses wheel and lagoon mirror to charge closure, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—negotiate with own ghost—signaled early and tightens when the ghost offers a lost story-piece. Agency visible: spinning wheel to sync heart, stepping forward under regret’s weight. Cost legible: ghost’s dissolution leaves narrator sole custodian of fragments. One meaningful deepening suffices; no reversals needed under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from particulars: eroded paint, forgotten brushes, dew-stories—no abstraction. Final image reframes erosion as material for new vessel, avoiding moral. Subtext in silence: unsaid words stone the throat. Resonance lingers without statement, capped at 8.8 because no secondary tension complicates the thematic question.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Perceptual signature consistent: chronologic confusion rendered via drifting leaves, dissolving words, spinning wheel as clock. Syntax breathes with pressure—long cadences for lagoon hush, staccato clicks for heart sync. No head-hopping; unreliability is subtle (time slips) and paid off. Diction stays within scavenger’s lexicon; “conceptual repricing” is lone register blip, not fatal.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Zero loops; each sentence advances image or stakes. High density: “chipped paint map of my own fractured past” does triple work. Metaphors stay physically coherent (carousel frozen mid-gallop above clouds). One mixed vehicle—“voice like wind through reeds”—is earned by ghost’s otherworldliness. Closure line is crisp, no scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Premise freshens familiar regret trope through aerial salvage site and camera-wheel talisman. Synthesis of carousel-stasis + nonlinear memory feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk—lyric fragment structure—heightens coherence rather than gimmick. Specific detail (child’s “forgot the brushes”) anchors universality.</comment>
