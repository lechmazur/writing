<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is textured—her guilt is shown through the trembling perfume case and the metaphor-laden apology; the micro-choice to power the coil costs her social pride. Linden’s shift from skeptic to collaborator is visible in the shoulder softening, but his motives remain slightly generic; more contradiction could have pushed this into 9-band. Still, the relationship acts as crucible: the apology alters their stalemate, foreclosing the safety of silence with the cost of public exposure now possible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the shared minor chord and handshake crystallize a new, precarious truce under the Accumulative/Textural lens; the cost is the orchard’s literal fall and the perfume’s irreversible dispersal. Causality holds: perfume → memory → apology → handshake, each step because/therefore. The axe-image reweights all prior silence, making the stake legible without explanatory tell.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The archive is more than backdrop—dusty scores and the scarred piano bench physically constrain where Mira can place the case and how Linden must turn. The morning light fracturing through the bottle doubles as emotional prism and clock; the rising scent narrows perception to remembered soil, guiding the apology’s timing. Spatial choreography is flawless: no floating bodies, every object handled changes state (bottle opened, mist dispersed, page turned). The orchard outside evolves from silence to crash, anchoring the final cost.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Single dominant stake—deliver apology before trees fall—tightens exactly once when the first chainsaw coughs, turning abstract regret into last-chance urgency. The perfume release is the visible price that forecloses retreat; after the mist, both must face the exposed memory. No reversal is needed; the escalation is the deepening of silence into sound, orchard into stump. Cost is legible: the scent cannot be rebottled, and the friendship can now only exist in the open.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges as the fragile resonance of flawed connections: “a broken chord still vibrates” becomes the non-literal answer, reweighting the earlier column’s damage. No character states a moral; the final image of perfume ghosting over stumps invites the reader to feel apology as vibration, not absolution. Subtext lives in Linden’s mirror line and the fermata metaphor, both carrying more meaning than their words. The ambiguity—will the column restart?—is purposeful, not evasive.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited clings to Mira’s perceptual bias—she smells guilt where Linden smells roses—yet diction never exceeds her lexicon of music and gossip. The rhythmic lift of metaphor (“fermata that holds a note before the axe falls”) is voice-motivated, not ornamental. No head-hopping; Linden’s interior is inferred only through observable softenings. Compression such as “ethereal grit” is taught early and paid off in the final hush-plus-chainsaw dissonance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Information-dense without clogging: one sentence fuses device mechanics, scent history, and emotional stakes (“coax the perfume’s molecules into a gentle vapor, a ghost of fragrance that could slip past the walls of regret”). Varied sentence openings, no scaffold loops; the participle “curling” is simultaneous, not sequential error. Read-aloud rhythm accelerates into the single minor key, then exhales with the fading mist. Only hairline slip: “brittle rainbow” edges on poetic excess, but the image is saved by its fracture conceit.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The gossip-column exorcist who weaponizes perfume via induced currents to apologize through scent is a fresh synthesis, not a trope checklist. Risky metaphor density is justified because music and fragrance are the characters’ native idiom. Orchard-as-fermata reconfigures familiar destruction into musical time, making the crash feel inevitable yet newly heard. If transplanted to another setting the engine collapses, proving integration.</comment>
