<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elena’s interior contradiction—needing to quantify decay yet recoiling from its messy evidence—remains present in every beat; the moment she brushes the butterfly dust and hesitates before answering her phone shows embodied, contradictory impulse. The final renunciation (she will not return to document) carries visible cost: she forfeits control and data, a genuine loss for a scientist. Reflection stays anchored to concrete cues (watermarks, mold, wing dust) and alters her present stance each time. No other characters appear, so relationship bullets are N/A; the characterization is strong but not quite exceptional because the epiphany leans on a single, well-worn “let it be” turn.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: Elena reframes noise as necessary, not eliminable, reweighting her life’s methodology at undeniable conceptual cost. Lens is Accumulative/Textural: water stains, mold, dust accrete until meaning flips; pattern is legible and coherent. Orientation is clear by line 11; no penalty. Transitions are smooth; one implicit cut from greenhouse to car to observatory stays within default. Persistent scaffold (“billion” twice, “pattern” four times) just avoids the −0.3 threshold, but the closure image is clean.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The greenhouse functions as micro-setting: broken glass overhead and squelching mud underfoot constrain movement and force Elena to kneel, ruining her trousers—tactile cost. Butterfly wing dust becomes the recurring object that physically adheres to her skin and later charges the final smile beneath the radio dish. Sensory selection is biased through her professional lens: she notices spectral patterns in mold rings and neutron-star-like decay in wood rot. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible shifts. Meets 9+ gate: recurring object (dust) charges final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether she will keep trying to strip drama/decay or accept it—tightens once when the dust transfers to her finger and she chooses not to bag it. Pressure is textural: each new stain or spore increases density until her stance flips; cost is the forfeiture of future data (legible in “she would not return”). No external antagonist; conflict is internal and situational, coherent under Accumulative lens. Deepening rather than reversal, but sufficient at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: dust, water rings, pulsar decay—never abstract lecture. The final reconfiguration (“I’m learning to hear both”) offers resonant, non-literal answer to how a scientist should live with uncertainty. No moralizing summary; the image of her brushing dust onto moss acts as silent thesis. Counter-reading possible: retreat into mysticism rather than science—complexity preserved.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV stays stable; no head-hop. Distinct perceptual signature: neutron-star metaphors filter every observation (“clock so precise it defined time itself”). Syntax lengthens under reflection, shortens at physical touch—rhythmic control. No dialogue, so those bullets are N/A. Diction remains within her scientific lexicon; no register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Lyrical repetition of “billion” and “pattern” borders template cadence but stays purposeful, echoing cosmic and local scales. Mixed metaphor hazard—“wings folded like a discarded map” vs “map” never re-enter—passes because immediacy outweighs brief strain. Information density high; each sentence layers observation with emotional charge. No paraphrase loops or filler stacks; final line is crisp. Artifacts do not touch closure; high-band cap not triggered.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: neutron-star data analysis meets post-flood greenhouse decay, making astrophysics intimate. Butterfly dust as archival medium is specific, not gimmicky. Risk of sentimentality is ducked by refusal to return—earned asceticism. Premise is familiar (scientist learns feeling) but transformed through granular occupational detail and reversal of “preprocessing” mandate. Quiet humility feels authentic to character, not imposed moral.</comment>
