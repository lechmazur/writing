<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is lyrically rendered but stays at a single register; the “uncharted solace” remains abstract rather than embodied in a contradictory micro-choice. No visible cost is paid—she simply chooses to stay—so the ending feels like acceptance rather than earned renunciation. The dual-identity idea is announced, never dramatized under pressure. Still, her perceptual filter is consistent and the voice is character-specific.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the ship’s exhalation and thinning fog reconfigure Mira’s options without curing her; the cost is the eternal drift she embraces. Causality is lyric rather than tight—each beat accumulates texture—yet the pattern is taught early and held to the final image. Orientation is clear by line 6; no orientation penalty. The lens is Accumulative/Textural and sustains.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The carnival-ship is rendered through selective sensory triage—rust flakes, mildewed popcorn, calliope pipes—each detail tethered to Mira’s search. The emerald swatch card micro-setting acts as both key and mirror, constraining her literal path and charging the final glow. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible moves. Environment directly shapes tactics and final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Stakes are signaled early—find the garden, rekindle solace—but the only tightening is the door reveal; no option is foreclosed or price paid. Pressure is atmospheric, not causal; escalation is poetic accretion rather than rising cost. The protagonist’s final stance crystallizes but does not trade anything away. Sufficient for lyric mode, yet short of 8-band cost clarity.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme of identity-as-mosaic emerges through recurrent garden of names, never sermonized. The emerald glow’s final reprise reweights earlier color motifs, offering conceptual repricing rather than moral. Ambiguity is preserved: solace stays unkindled yet bearable. Minor abstraction keeps it from 8.5+.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Mira’s perceptual filter; diction is consistent, slightly elevated but justified by fairytale tone. Rhythm modulates with discovery—short phrases on stairs, longer coils in garden. No dialogue to fault. Filter verbs are minimal; metaphors stay physical. Voice feels singular and pattern-taught.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Generally clean, but three adjacent sentences open with “The…” in the garden paragraph, creating template cadence (−0.3). Occasional stacked modifiers (“blissfully aberrant monument”) flirt with purple but stay legible. No loops or synonym churn. Information density high; every sentence advances image or micro-action. Good ear, minor artifact keeps it sub-8.5.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Carnival-ship-as-memory-archive is fresh, and the living name-flowers literalize identity in a way that feels inevitable in hindsight. Conceptual risk—the garden accepts rather than cures—elevates stakes without gimmickry. Transformation test passes: swap setting and the emotional arc collapses. Slight over-reliance on lyric fog tropes prevents 8.5.</comment>
