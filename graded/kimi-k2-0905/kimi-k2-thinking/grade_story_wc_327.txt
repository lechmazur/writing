<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The copper-veined storyteller’s contradictory impulses—her need to save the stone-tongue versus her recognition that its perfect translation will never be heard—are shown in the climactic act of pressing the diamond to the bone wall and later leaving it behind; her quiet endurance costs her the last of her voice and life, an earned stasis that forecloses every future path. The micro-choice to channel the spinebirds’ flight through her own metallic veins literalizes her body as conduit, making her final oxidized stillness a credible physical price. Interiority stays concrete and particular (“copper pathways,” “metallic veins catching the last light”) without therapeutic abstraction. No secondary character appears, so relationship bullets are waived; headcount is within default and never clouds choreography.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the diamond now sings a voice-without-ears, a conceptual repricing that makes the extinction of the language irreversible yet newly animate. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: each repetition of echo, copper, fracture, and flock layers density until the final cadence shift (“a memorial that needed no mourners”) crystallizes the cost. Orientation is anchored by line 3 (“spiraling bone tower… sun that remembered no names”) and stays legible throughout; no teleporting props or causal breaks. The persistent constraint—no remaining speakers—shapes every tactic and is visible in the final image of verdigris dust beside a singing stone.</comment>

<comment>The canyon, bone towers, and tunnel of echoes are not backdrop but instruments: the tunnel’s polished calcium literally amplifies the diamond’s new voice, constraining the climactic act. Micro-setting objects—the copper veins and flawed diamond—are handled in every beat, their changing states (veins oxidizing, fracture resonating) altering later choices. Spatial choreography is flawless: the climb, the press, the leaving of the stone track cleanly. Sensory economy favors texture over vista, matching the urgency of a last speaker racing extinction.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—can texture be given audible voice before the language dies—tightens once, at the exact midpoint when the storyteller realizes “sensation was not sound” and must harness the birds. This deepening reweights the fracture from curse to alphabet, foreclosing the option of pure human speech. Cost is legible: the final three speakers drop to two, then one, then none, and her own life is spent as payment. Agency remains hers; coincidence is absent; luck does not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: translation as persistence beyond meaning, memory as curse-gift. The final image of a voice that needs no ears reconfigures the entire premise, offering a non-literal answer to the central question—extinction is not erasure if matter itself keeps speaking. Subtext operates in gesture (placing the diamond back into the wall) rather than declaration. No moral is stated; the echo’s acceptance of the gift is the only elegy needed.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric voice sustains a consistent perceptual signature: metallic, mineral, avian lexicon refracted through a poet-engineer of sound. Rhythm modulates from long breathless clauses during ascent to staccato fragments at the moment of translation (“each turn a consonant, each swoop a vowel”). No head-hopping; POV distance remains stable. Filter verbs are minimal and motive-driven (“tasted of fossilized thunder”) rather than immediacy-dulling.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero paraphrase loops or synonym churn; each sentence advances image or pressure. Figurative language is patterned early (“copper-veined storyteller,” “canyon of endless echoes”) and paid off in the final cadence, avoiding purple excess. High information density: one line can layer sensory, emotional, and conceptual work (“the stone’s texture… flowed into her copper pathways as pure sensation”). No scaffolds, no mixed metaphors; closure image remains crystal.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of ornithological syntax, mineral memory, and metallic physiology feels inevitable yet wholly fresh; no template plot or stock figure is recognizable. Risk—making language extinction the core stake—heightens emotional charge without gimmickry. Specific detail (“fossilized thunder,” “verdigris of ancient grief”) anchors universals in irreplaceable particulars. The final inversion that curse = gift = persistence beyond ears is a non-obvious angle on familiar mortality.</comment>
