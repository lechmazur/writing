<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s face-blindness and methodical armor are concrete from the first beat; the shift from cold arithmetic to desperate warmth is dramatized through brush-strokes and ribbon-touch rather than label-speak. The final renunciation—returning the ribbon—pays the cost of reopened empathy, earned by every prior micro-choice. Interior contradiction is alive in scene: “precision wasn’t habit—it was armor” versus “she painted faster now, not methodical but desperate.” Only the off-page sister/roommate voices feel slightly convenient, keeping this just under the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal linkage holds: ribbon find → height correction → vendor arrest; each beat tightens because/therefore. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—ribbon returned, quarry now “stone” not “shadow,” empathy reawakened with the felt cost of future grief she must now carry. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“the quarry waited in predawn silence”). No lens ambiguity; the final image reweights the premise with undeniable conceptual cost: blindness becomes a “different kind of sight.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Limestone walls, mist, and fissure are filtered through Elara’s haptic attention; the ribbon’s bead is micro-setting that constrains the final choice to return it. Weather and geology evolve: mist “thinner now” mirrors lifted interior haze. Spatial choreography is clean—sixteen camera angles, GPS log, sealed envelope—each detail pressures her next studio move. The quarry’s weight as witness charges the Earned Stasis; without that tactile pressure the renunciation would feel unmoored.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reawaken empathy or remain armored—is signaled in paragraph four and tested when she touches the ribbon. One meaningful tightening: accurate but hollow portrait → desperate re-painting that names Catherine; this narrows her future from detached contractor to grieving witness. Cost is visible—she must now feel every case she takes. No coincidence resolves; the height discrepancy is earned by her prior methodical measurements.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges: subtraction can become addition when blindness is accepted rather than compensated. Subtext lives in the ribbon’s return—an unspoken vow to carry pain forward. No moralizing; the quarry’s final silence reconfigures meaning without statement. Thematic echo is avoided; “different kind of sight” is image, not thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person intimate carries Elara’s perceptual signature—geometries, ratios, needle-details—without ever slipping into clinical label-speak. Rhythm accelerates with brush-stroke fragments when empathy breaks through. No dialogue, so voice remains pure, compressed, and pattern-taught. The final sentence lands in cadence with the first—“furrowed hush” becomes “quarry held no more shadows”—a charged poise that reconfigures sound and sight.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentences do double duty: “She drew the silhouette where a face should be, then lanced it with the details she couldn’t visualize” advances both process and metaphor. Figurative language is selective, never stacked; mist “like breath on a mirror” appears once and pays off when mist lifts. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold. Opening and closing lines book-end with sonic echo without feeling engineered.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Face-blind forensic artist is fresh; using negative-space sketching to solve height discrepancy transforms the trope into plot engine. The ribbon’s reweighting from trash to key evidence feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Risky compression—no dialogue, no antagonist on-stage—heightens interior stakes without losing clarity. Final image of stone而非shadow is specific to this voice and cannot transplant to another tale.</comment>
