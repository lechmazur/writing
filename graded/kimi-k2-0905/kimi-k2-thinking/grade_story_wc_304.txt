<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara’s vocationally specific stillness, hereditary pattern-reading, and renunciation of touch compress a believable interior life into one on-page ritual; the final gesture of “whispered dedication” crystallizes values without exposition. No contradictory impulses collide mid-ritual—only poised execution—so the arc is credible rather than complex. Cost is present yet conceptually framed; a visible wince or tremor would have pushed higher. Voice is consistent, occupational, and singular.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens is announced in the second sentence—cosmic static as text—and holds to the last auroral shift. Closure is a Charged Poise: the gem’s “winter jasmine bloomed forever” reweights all prior chips and patterns with undeniable conceptual cost. Causality is pattern-based, not sequential, but still legible; the droplet transfer beat is dramatized, not summarized. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive within fifty words—no penalty.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Skyborne grotto, auroral pulses, and the emerald facet operate as micro-setting: the seventeen-second green band literally gates the infusion beat. Sensory selection is filtered through Elara’s pattern-ear: light is read as Morse, void as hush—never touristic. Spatial choreography is immaculate; no impossible body or prop positions. The environment’s “radiant hush” tone modulates from hush to radiant capture, mirroring interior arc.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>One dominant stake—snatch the final spark before oblivion—is signaled in paragraph four and tightened by the droplet’s fall; options narrow to perfect facet alignment or total loss. Pressure is textural, built from auroral countdown and thread fray, not external antagonist. Visible cost is the poet’s name erased, but Elara’s own jeopardy remains conceptual; a personal stake (a cracked prior chip, e.g.) would sharpen the upper band. Agency is attention-based renunciation—credible under the inferred lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from pattern versus oblivion: the cosmos forgets its static, Elara steals its last metaphor. No character states the thesis; the final image of immortal winter jasmine quietly answers the implicit question of what deserves rescue from silence. Subtext operates through silence itself—Morse static, withheld touch, whispered dedication. Complexity is honored: no moral is extracted, only a crystallized cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person intimate sustains a mortician’s tactile reverence: “hands steady,” “emerald warmed,” “green mouth drinking starlight.” Syntax lengthens during stillness, fragments at droplet fall, mirroring breath. Diction stays within Elara’s professional lexicon—no academic drift. No dialogue to corrupt voice; auroral light is the only conversation, read in Elara’s idiom.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Rhythm breathes with ritual: long sentences for vigil, staccato at capture. Figurative layers are sparse and pattern-taught—cosmic static, silver thread—so no density penalty. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or pressure. Opening and closing lines frame voice and re-charge motif: “radiant hush” → “winter jasmine bloomed forever.”</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Combining beautician and mortician into cosmic pattern-librarian feels fresh yet inevitable; ancestral tea-leaf to aurora-Morse progression historicizes the gift. The emerald chip as soul-capacitor re-energizes a familiar trope via stellar provenance and precise facet-alignment mechanic. Risk: lyric static-as-text pattern taught early and paid off at closure without obscuring clarity. No derivative premise detected; concept commits fully to its own logic.</comment>
