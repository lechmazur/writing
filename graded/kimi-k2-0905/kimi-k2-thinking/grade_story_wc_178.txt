<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Kael’s frugality and empirical rigor are vivid, embodied in chalk dust and stylus-scratch; the final renunciation—letting the tile vanish—carries visible cost in the emptied courtyard and his solitary vigil. Interior contradiction is light: he never doubts empiricism yet grows reverent toward pattern, a tension that could have been pushed further under pressure. Still, micro-choices (mapping grids against star charts, chalk order) align with motive and foreclose the path of possession, earning the quiet closure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the tile’s disappearance reweights the premise—knowledge survives not by owning but by releasing. Causal chain holds: each night’s measurement tightens possibility space until the schematic sequence triggers the vanishing. The lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern density (260 sum, palace proportions, star overlay) intensifies until the final cadence shift. Cost is legible in the vanished object and the banners of the next regime already replacing his sky.</comment>

<comment>Lapis-inlaid floor, chalk circles, windblown dust—selective tactile detail anchors the observatory as monastery. The tile’s warmth/cold cycle and moonlight angles constrain ritual timing, charging the final activation. Palace empties in real time, providing spatial choreography that tracks Kael’s isolation. Environment mirrors internal arc: stripped rooms → stripped self, yet the pattern persists, charging the ending image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—preserve knowledge across regime change—tightens when new banners appear; each decoded row narrows options to either seize or release the tile. No antagonist needed: pressure is temporal-political erasure. The tenth-night schematic completes the only viable path; refusal to hoard costs him the physical artifact but wins dissemination. Price is on-page: tile gone, papyri left behind, regime already overwriting sky.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as pattern > politics: empiricism itself becomes devotional once it confronts cosmic silence. Subtext lives in gesture—chalk on stone, tile vanishing—never sermon. Final image of banners under starlight reweights earlier numerology as quiet resistance. Avoids thesis statement; resonance is felt in the empty courtyard where knowledge has been diffused, not declared.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays tight to Kael’s perceptual filter—astronomer’s lexicon, beggar’s budget, stylus rhythm. Syntax lengthens during mapping beats, shortens at activation: cadence mirrors pressure. No dialogue needed; interior diction never drifts into modern academic register. Prose itself becomes schematic prayer, sustaining dusky harmony without monotony.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>High information density: “ghost-scent of burnt myrrh” does triple duty—sensory, temporal, sacrilegious. No synonym loops; each metaphor (palace as hollow shell, tile as lock) recurs with reweighted meaning. Rhythm breathes—long sentences for star work, single clause at vanish. Only minor slip: “empirically ironic” is self-diagnostic, but occurs mid-process, not at peak beat, so clarity intact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Fusion of Babylonian astronomy, magic square, and post-dynasty liminality feels fresh; not a trope checklist. Conceptual risk—mathematics as devotional practice—pays off in the cold/hot tile and chalk portal. Specificity of 260-day calendar and Pabilsag constellation anchors novelty. Could edge higher if Kael’s personal stakes (memory, identity) were risked as fiercely as the political.</comment>
