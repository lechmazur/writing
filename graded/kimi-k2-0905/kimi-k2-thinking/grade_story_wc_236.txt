<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Elena’s anosmic grief is embodied through tactile obsession with the midwife screw and auditory surrender to the clock; her shift from control to translation is credible, but the interior voice occasionally drifts into therapeutic self-labeling (“I had been treating my loss as a blank page…”) that softens the contradiction under peak pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: the screw, fog, and clock drops layer into a final Charged Poise where Elena threads the screw onto a chain—an unmistakable conceptual re-pricing of her grief. Orientation is swift; causality is interior but legible; cost is felt in the relinquishment of smell-centric identity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Brass-polish scent claim, dew-bead rosemary oil, and the clepsydra’s “captured rain” act as micro-setting that constrains Elena’s non-olfactory senses; the midwife screw’s topography and the fog’s watercolor wash charge the final image when she wears the screw as talisman.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—recovering meaning without smell—tightens once when Marcus reframes the clock as “translator,” forcing Elena to drop restoration and accept translation; the cost is the irreversible loss of scent as compass, made legible in her decision to wear the screw.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the screw’s migration: life-passage tools can be re-purposed for grief-passage; no explicit moralizing, only the resonant final image of the screw worn next to skin, reweighting “ordinary miracles” as perceptual translation rather than restoration.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Lyric, compressive voice teaches its pattern early (“wrapped in cotton,” “watercolors in rain”) and sustains perceptual signature; no head-hopping; free indirect style cleanly fuses Elena’s anosmic bias into metaphorical diction that climaxes in the tactile screw-chain moment.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with foggy pauses; high information density—each sentence layers scent-memory loss onto brass, water, screw; no loops or scaffold; one mixed metaphor “landscape where grief and adaptation bled into each other like watercolors in rain” forgiven under lyric license.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: anosmic aromatherapist + water-clock midwife screw births a non-olfactory epistemology; risk-taking in choosing quiet translation over scent-restoration pays off; the screw’s obstetric past repurposed as grief midwife feels inevitable yet non-obvious.</comment>
