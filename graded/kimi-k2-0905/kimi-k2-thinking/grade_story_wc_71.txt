<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The noticer’s quiet, almost liturgical drive is consistent and embodied in tactile ritual (slipping shards, whispered blessings). Interior contradiction is absent—he never doubts or falters—so the arc is flat, but the flatness reads as vocation rather than flaw. Micro-choices (placing the orris beneath the oldest oak) carry visible cost in the hush that answers back, earning the final smile. Still, the absence of any internal counter-impulse keeps him just short of full individuation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds cleanly: each displaced object layers silence until the town itself becomes a resonant instrument. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—the oldest oak absorbs the last shard, reweighting the entire prior chain so “houses feel alive” is now literalized as shared respiration. Cost is felt in the collective exhale that “echoed across the water,” a sonic hole the reader can almost hear. One soft causality slip: the jar of sea-salt thank-you appears without prior narrative seed, but its placement immediately feeds the pattern, so the break is hairline.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Quiet bay, amber streetlights, threshold stones, and oak roots are selected, sensory, and POV-filtered through the noticer’s “creeping” attention. The orris shard itself functions as micro-setting: its scent and sound-drinking property constrain every placement decision. Final image—oak roots drinking silence—recharges every earlier threshold, making environment the active agent. No world-rule inconsistency, no white-room lapse.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is the transmutation of inert houses into breathing presences; escalation proceeds by density, not reversal—each shard adds another voice to the choir. The tightening is the moment the oldest oak receives the shard: the town’s silence becomes total, foreclosing further collection. Price is legible in the swallowed sound itself, an absence felt as warmth. No external opposition or risk keeps this just outside the top band.</question>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</question><comment>Theme—attention as sanctifying ritual—emerges through iterated image, never thesis. The displaced objects refuse allegory; their power stays tactile and olfactory. Final image of golden pools on cobblestones offers quiet conceptual re-pricing: silence now glows. No moralizing, no tidy maxim—only the luminous fact that noticing is a form of love.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lyric third-person hovers at the exact distance of “creeping,” never entering heads beyond what a vigilant stroller could infer. Syntax repeats the ritual cadence of “He placed… He walked…”—a litany that teaches its pattern by the third beat and pays off in the oak scene. Diction stays within the noticer’s modest lexicon; “hushed blaze” is the single coined oxymoron, earned because it names the newly real. No filter-verb stacks, no head-hop, no register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</question><comment>Prose breathes with the same hush it describes: short sentences for placement beats, longer inhalations for bay atmosphere. Figurative language is sparse, never stacked; every metaphor (windows “blinking amber”) is anchored in physical fact. No paraphrase loops, no scaffold. A single hairline slip: “inadvertently profound” is used twice; the repetition is purposeful echo but still grazes template cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The entire concept—“sanctify a town by feeding it silence-shards”—is non-obvious yet instantly credible within its own lyric physics. Displaced debris (sea-glass, rusted hinge) becomes sacramental without metaphoric stretch. Risk lies in the quiet ending, but the golden glow on cobblestones recharges every prior shard, making the innovation feel inevitable. No derivative scaffolding, no trendy gimmick—only fresh ritual.</question>
