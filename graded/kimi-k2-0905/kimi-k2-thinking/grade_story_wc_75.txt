<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Liora’s motive—“rescue dying arts”—is declared early and re-asserted, but only one micro-choice (focusing the lens) is dramatized with embodied cost. Interiority relies on stock phrases like “quiet fire” and “rosewater dread” rather than idiosyncratic thought. The final resolve to keep baking is credible, yet the causal chain between bread initials and harp thaw is asserted, not shown through contradictory impulse or sacrifice. Passes the 9+ quick test marginally: choice is visible, cost is present but generic.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of scent, object, ritual escalates density toward a Charged Poise closure. Orientation anchored by word 50; no penalty. The single meaningful tightening—the sun-lens melting drop-by-drop—earns the harp note and reconfigures cultural hope; cost is felt in Liora’s chest-tighten. Causality intact: bread circle + lens = thaw, no lucky off-stage fix. Meets 9+ cost test, but beat count is thin; one capillary turn keeps it just below exemplary.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Rosewater mist, limestone corridors, emerald lens, and ice-harp are selectively returned until the lens-charged final image. Sensory hierarchy obeys POV: museum guide notices fresco ultraviolet signatures, bakers notice flour-dust “like ash.” The grotto geography is briefly white-room between kitchen and river chamber—bodies/distances untracked—costs a 0.2 chip. Tool (lens) directly constrains the climactic act, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</question><comment>Dominant stake—“rekindle lost cultural voice”—is signaled early; pressure rises through accumulative repetitions of scent, silence, and dough. One visible tightening: lens-ray on ice; the hiss and shivering string make cost audible. Agency sits with Liora; no coincidence resolves. Missing a secondary tactical loss (time, material) that could sharpen trade-off; remains strong but not 8.8+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</question><comment>Theme of cultural remembrance emerges from dough initials, lens light, and harp note rather than explicit thesis. Subtext glows when children dance to a “fragile hope”—no narrator spells out “art saves.” Final image reframes rosewater dread into “honeyed hope” without sermon. Ambiguity stays intact: beekeeper ghost still absent, culture still wounded. Avoids final-paragraph moralizing; meets 9+ resonance test.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</question><comment>Third-person close adheres to Liora’s culturally-toned perception: “whispers in the rust of ancient daggers.” No head-hopping. Rhythm modulates—long sensuous clauses in calm corridors, shorter beats at the thaw. Diction consistent with educated guide; no filter-verb clusters. Dialogue absent, so no voice-distinction test. Slight lift into poetic register (“haunting rosewater scent”) is motivated by atmospheric intent and stays legible.</question>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</question><comment>Strong information density: one sentence often layers smell, object, and social context. No synonym loops or template cadence; metaphor vehicles (ice-harp, yeast-scent) remain internally coherent. One paraphrase loop: “city’s once-buzzing heart began to wither” echoed as “city’s displaced persons huddled” — minor, −0.2. Final third is clean; artifacts do not touch closure. Read-aloud rhythm varied; earns high-band with hairline slack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</question><comment>Grotto-city + silent hives + bread-initial ritual synthesizes into a fresh cultural-grief fable. Lens-as-black-light and edible mnemonic are non-obvious tools that charge the climax. Kids dancing to a single thawed harp note offers delicate payoff rather than spectacle. Familiar “art revives community” spine is re-inkeried through sensory specificity, earning moderate distinction without radical risk.</comment>
