<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The poet’s interiority is richly textured—his “scars on the tongue” and the “geography of silence” are embodied, particular, and felt. His micro-choices (aligning envelope with timer, re-sealing the letter) externalize the inner contradiction between speech and silence. The final decision to descend with the envelope is earned: it forecloses the safety of perpetual vigil and accepts the risk of re-entry, cost visible. Voice stays singular; no diagnostic label-speak; only hairline slip is the slightly abstract “furious tranquility” which is named more than dramatized in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the poet steps into dawn having chosen to carry the poem down the mountain, vigil ended, risk embraced. Cost is legible in the re-sealing of the envelope—he gives up the observatory’s immunity. Causal lens holds throughout: storm → rarefied air → timer click → envelope opened → poem written → descent. Orientation crystal by line 6; no lens ambiguity. Accumulation cap: one minor telegraph—message-in-own-hand is slightly telegraphed, but payoff still lands.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The observatory, timer, envelope, and timetable form a micro-setting ecosystem that directly limits action: only when the storm rarefies air can the envelope be opened; only the timetable’s ghost routes offer covert passage. Brass instruments, wax seal, and flickering lightning are tactile, never tourist-catalog. Final image—poet placing silent timer on sill—re-weights the whole space as vessel adrift, now abandoned. Environment, body, and tool jointly charge the closure; no 9+ gate missed.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will he break silence?—is signaled in paragraph 1. Single meaningful tightening: timer click + rarefied air forces envelope opening, narrowing options to “write now or forever hold.” Cost is visible: he forfeits the observatory’s safe distance, seals the poem back into a timetable that may never travel. Agency remains his at every beat; storm complicates but does not resolve. No reversal overload; one decisive turn suffices for this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges obliquely: censorship, silence, and the cartography of scars are never sermonized. The final image—scars as constellations he can “finally read”—reweights the premise without moral tag. Recurring motifs (timer, envelope, timetable) accrue meaning through use, not lecture. Storm-kissed wonder stays concrete, never drifts into pseudo-profundo. One hairline risk: “map of scars is drawn not on skin, but on the silence between stars” flirts with aphorism, but context earns it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to poet; no head-hop. Perceptual signature is consistent—“breath fogging glass,” “scars mapped on tongue”—details only he would notice. Syntax lengthens under wonder, contracts under timer tick, mirroring emotional cadence. No dialogue, so no voice convergence; internal diction stays within his plausible lexicon. Minor overuse of adjectival halo (“silver halo,” “storm-kissed wonder”) but patterned enough to read as intentional lyric accumulo.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm breathes with storm: long rolling clauses build, then fracture into white scars of fragments. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or stakes. Metaphors stay internally coherent—storm as rarefaction, scars as constellations—no mixed vehicles. One scaffold trace: “furiously tranquil” appears twice; second use could compress, but closural placement justifies echo. Read-aloud ear test passes; no template cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fusion of darkroom timer, censored poet, and ghost bus timetable is non-obvious and specific; transforms familiar “writer vs censorship” trope into tactile ritual. Sealed envelope bearing his own past handwriting freshens the self-encryption device. Observatory above clouds becomes literal and metaphoric safe-zone, yet he abandons it—stakes feel large because exit is irreversible. Conceptual integrity holds: no retreat to safer ground. Risk-taking (lyric accumulation, no antagonist but storm) heightens coherence rather than gimmickry.</comment>
