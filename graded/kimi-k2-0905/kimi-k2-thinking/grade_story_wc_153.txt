<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Grief-stricken narrator’s embodied micro-choices (kneeling, releasing letters) track a credible arc from paralysis to voiced apology; the interior contradiction between rage and tenderness is held in scene. The moment-before-decision is dramatized, not summarized, and the final renunciation costs the last of his silence. Sister’s death is revealed late yet works because the shard already externalized the wound. No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible waived; Mira functions as oracle, not pressure source.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of tidal return/reprise (letters, shard, moonlight) tightens until the apology is literally released into current. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—letters become flotsam, silence becomes song—felt cost is the irrevocable privacy now surrendered to the swamp. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive by line 3; deliberate lyric disorientation is waived because spatial labyrinth pays off at closure. No causality breaks; every image reweights stakes under the moonlit rule.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Mangrove labyrinth is not backdrop but navigation constraint: every paddle stroke narrows exit routes, forcing the apology outward. Shard-as-micro-setting constrains the ritual beat and reappears in pocket at closure, charging final image. Sensory hierarchy obeys crisis—salt scent, wet bark, broken-glass timbre—filtered through guilt-bleached perception. Spatial choreography clean: paddle, root, boat, tide line track without drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—voicing the unspoken apology—signals early and tightens through moonlight deadline (heal expires at sunrise). Escalation is textural: each reiteration of “unsent” adds weight until silence becomes physically unbearable; shard’s glow literalizes mounting pressure. Protagonist’s agency is the decision to read aloud; coincidence absent. Cost is legible: permanent public exposure of private grief to spirits and tide.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from tidal return: what is withheld does not stay buried—it grows singing teeth. No explicit thesis; instead, the final image of letters floating as leaves reconfigures apology as ecological offering, not private catharsis. Subtext resides in shard=broken gutter=broken voice; moonlight=silver tongue. Complexity upheld: apology neither redeems nor resurrects, merely transfers burden to wider world.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>First-person lyric voice sustains perceptual signature—salt-sorrow scent, wind-chime grief—without generic therapy-speak. Syntax lengthens during chant, fragments under shard pulse, mirroring breath control. No dialogue, so voice distinction judged via interior diction alone; consistent. Register stays within rural-Gulf idiom; no academic intrusion. Patterned elision (“the singing spirits hovered…”) taught early and paid off at choral echo.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud ear test passes: cadence varies between paddle-stroke iambs and spirit-chant anapests. Figurative density high but purposeful—moonlight as silver drink, apology as cracked bell—no mixed metaphors. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence adds new tactile or tidal information. Opening line anchors voice and stakes in one breath. Minor filter-verb cluster (“I felt the unsent letters flutter”) isolated, does not touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: gothic condolence letter meets coastal-ghost ecology. Risk of sentimental swamp-spirit trope averted by shard’s concrete plumbing origin and economic idiom. Apology-via-tide is non-obvious transport mechanism that feels inevitable once declared. Specific detail (gnarled root as reading desk, broken glass chime timbre) prevents generic Southern-gothic pastiche.</comment>
