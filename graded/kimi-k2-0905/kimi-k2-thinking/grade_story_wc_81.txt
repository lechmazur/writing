<comment>Mira’s calm-archivist persona is consistent, yet the interiority is narrated rather than dramatized; the only embodied contradiction is the lantern sputter, which she fixes with textbook efficiency. The final “reclaimed stillness” is asserted, not paid for by visible cost—she never risks anything tangible.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the stamped sheet becomes a new page, a legible before/after under the Accumulative lens. Causality is clean—each datum (watermark, registry, Aldric’s hand) tightens the hypothesis—but the blackout’s deliberate-shroud possibility is introduced so late that it feels retrofitted rather than earned.</comment>

<comment>The sunken library is never generic: water-stone-lantern triad constrains every move (oil keeps the hypothesis alive, darkness hides the sigil). Spatial choreography is flawless; the brass die’s gleam in returned light is the charged final image that reweights the whole archive.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Single dominant stake—authenticate the book—tightens through micro-choices: tilting glass, pressing stamp. The power-return rumble supplies coincidence, not resolution; cost remains conceptual (lost time, wet paper) rather than viscerally felt, so the tightening is present but modest.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Theme of reclamation emerges from the iterative stamping ritual, not exposition. The dappled light/dark motif reconfigures at closure when fluorescent tubes replace lantern flicker, making stillness a reclaimed artifact rather than a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person tight to Mira’s indexer gaze: perceptual signature is selective—watermarks, sigils, paper fibers—never tourist-catalog. Lyric compression (“silence around her was a dappled resolve”) is patterned early and paid off in the final image; no head-hop or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with scene needs—long clauses for submerged calm, staccato for lantern fix. No scaffold loops; only one near-paraphrase (“reclaimed stillness” iterated) but it accrues meaning. Figurative language stays sparse and accurate; no mixed metaphors.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Flooded-archive premise is familiar, but the indexer-protagonist’s forensic bibliophily and the brass stamp as authentication tool give a fresh procedural tilt. Risk is modest—no structural experiment—yet specificity of paper-stock provenance lifts it above stock waterlogged-world trope.</comment>
