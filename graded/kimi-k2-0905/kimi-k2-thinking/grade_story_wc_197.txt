<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Mara’s “carefully resourceful” trait is dramatized in every beat—swallowing the crystal, vomiting it back—so motivation stays embodied. Interiority is concrete (“key cold against her palm”) rather than abstract. The final endurance (key as totem) costs her bodily and socially, earning the arc. Yet the lone-hero structure keeps relational pressure off-stage, so status crucible and secondary-character pressure bullets are N/A; headroom remains.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: stolen code → ash → puddle map → lagoon → key triggers door → swallow crystal → scatter rest. Closure is a Decisive Change with felt cost: she is erased by the System but the data survives. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 4 and tighten at every shard break. One transition (city→lagoon) is legible; no teleporting props or retro-patches.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>“Potholes held puddles” grounds the micro-map; the key and lagoon water constrain every major choice. Sensory triage (smell of compost, golden algae) tracks with stealth urgency. Spatial choreography is clean across four hours of evasion. The key-as-micro-setting charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—uncorrupted memory—signals in paragraph 3 and tightens when the code turns to ash, removing the easy path. Swallowing the crystal is a visible, irreversible price that forecloses retreat. Pressure escalates under causal linkage; drone arrival is complication, not coincidence. One meaningful tightening suffices at this length; cost is legible on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of memory vs. erasure emerges through action, not thesis: ash code, golden water, key that refuses to die. Final image—“coordinates for the next survivor”—reweights the premise with conceptual cost: she is now the map. No explicit moralizing; resonance is earned. Ambiguity lingers (will the network survive?) without confusion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Mara’s perceptual filter: “dying stars,” “garden pruning,” “copper wires fairy tales”—idiosyncratic, class-marked. Syntax compresses under pressure (“She yanked…smashed…scattered”). No head-hopping; psychic distance stable. Voice modulation matches stealth tempo; diction stays within janitor-class lexicon except where grandfather stories license elevation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence runs. Figurative layer is selective (“concrete slab rose like a promise”) and never clogs high-pressure beats. Information density high: one line often does setting + emotion + stakes (“golden water flood the circuitry”). Zero paraphrase loops or synonym churn. Clean grammar, unambiguous pronouns.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The puddle-reflection map and swallowed data crystal transform familiar dystopia into specific mythic tech. Grandfather’s defunct phone key becomes a literal skeleton key to lost history—fresh synthesis, not gimmick. Risk (bodily data smuggling) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Transformation test fails if names are swapped; the key and lagoon are irreplaceable.</comment>
