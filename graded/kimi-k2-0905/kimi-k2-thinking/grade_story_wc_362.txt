<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Seraphine’s porous transformation from data-seeker to vessel is credibly embodied; the final relinquishment of the prism carries felt cost. Interiority stays concrete—“frequency she could feel in her teeth” anchors mystic bent in sensory specificity. The shift from proof to language-finding is visible, though the prior fourteen failures are only asserted, muting the internal contradiction that could have deepened flaw-driven tension.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: frost patterns, prism light, and quartz inhalation tighten the same stake rather than chaining causal turns. Closure is a Charged Poise—the arbor’s “less solid” after-image and her empty hands reconfigure the premise with undeniable conceptual cost. Orientation is clean by line 4; the 7-year backstory is brief and anchored to the present cue of colleagues’ contempt, satisfying BRR.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Quartz arbor, frost-constellations, and Volvo glass form a single constrained arena; the prism-as-tool and frost-as-lens dictate the only possible tactics. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true—she notes electromagnetic spikes, not touristic mist. The final image of the arbor “somehow less solid” is earned because the setting has been established as a recording medium that can lose density after transfer.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—proving objects absorb emotions—tightens once: the frost rewrites its patterns into words, foreclosing the path of statistical proof and opening the path of witness. Cost is legible in her three-hour stance and the phrase “She was already gone” which marks an irreversible shift from data to communion. No causal reversals, but the deepening under Accumulative lens suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges without thesis statement: the truthful lie that discovery uses the observer rather than vice versa. The frost-formed sentence and the arbor’s apparent weight-loss reprice the concept of absorption, making the social cost—loss of scientific credibility—undeniable. No moralizing closes the piece; the final image of tomorrow’s frost waiting for “another attentive soul” invites reflection on the ethics of witness.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Seraphine’s perceptual filter—“colors…painted the quartz arbor walls”—without hedging. Syntax breathes with the shifted hush: longer cadences for mist inhalation, clipped fragments for instrument readings. No dialogue appears; voice coherence is judged on interior texture alone, and it holds.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Dense lines carry triple duty: “frost painted new constellations each dawn on the windows of an ancient Volvo” seeds setting, stakes, and metaphor in one stroke. No synonym loops or template cadence; metaphors stay internally coherent—“silence rearranged” remains acoustic. Register remains within a field-scientist lexicon; “electromagnetic resonance” is accurate and motivated.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The fusion of cryogenic physics with hauntology feels inevitable because quartz as recording crystal + frost as data lace + abandoned Volvo as trauma reliquary are welded through Seraphine’s instruments. Risk—the entire plot hangs on frost forming readable text—is justified by prior establishment of frost as programmable medium. Removing any node collapses the resonance; the synthesis is specific, not checklist cleverness.</comment>
