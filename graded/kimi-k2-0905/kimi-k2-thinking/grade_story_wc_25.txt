<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Marek's interiority is concrete—his "calculated spontaneity" is shown through the folded-map ritual and sprint through darkness. The contradiction between order/chaos pulses in the same beat, embodied in the coin burn. Secondary pressure from the smuggler's whispered bet is immediate and status-laden. Final renunciation—keeping paper maps, smiling at next storm—carries visible cost of perpetual vigilance; the 9+ test is missed because the renunciation is stated, not dramatized in a micro-choice beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: storm → cranes freeze → bet accepted → acoustic plan executed → north-gate forced → manual alarm. Closure is a Charged Poise: "silence builds better bridges than thunder" reweights every prior map-fold; cost is the eternal return of storms and challengers. Orientation is anchored by word 60 ("Port Kessler"); no penalty. One scaffold loop—"He’d proven that whispers travel farther than shouts" is a near-paraphrase of smuggler’s premise; minor, does not dull final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Container labyrinth is not backdrop but instrument: seven-high amphitheater dictates whisper trajectory, rusted gaps shape Marek’s sprint route. Storm-time metal skin as resonating chamber is a live constraint that enables the climax. Tool/key-turned-tuning-fork is micro-setting that charges the final image. 9+ gate cleared: the corrugated wall the watchman leans on is still humming—environmental detail directly crystallizes the ending.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prove whisper > shout—tightens when the storm grants one-shot acoustic power; failure costs the northern corridor forever. Escalation is causal: storm intensifies → coin vibrates → key strikes → message reaches edge → smuggler caught. Price is legible: Marek forfeits anonymity ("only Marek knew the truth") and accepts lifelong guardian duty. Could edge higher if a personal tangible loss (tool broken, map torn) had been dramatized on-page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through acoustic metaphor: precision beats volume. Subtext is the dock’s rumor ecology—ghost walks, weight of steps—rather than explicit moral. Final image ("silence builds better bridges") is Conceptual Repricing that reweights every prior shout-heavy cliché. avoids sermonizing; one soft spot: "he’d proven that whispers travel farther than shouts" is a touch thematic-echo, −0.2.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Marek’s perceptual filter: "oil-over-glass walk," "corrugated path between containers." Sentence rhythm mimics sprint-breath: clipped clauses under storm pressure. No head-hops; watchman’s POV is external, reported. Diction stays within dock lexicon; "acoustic architecture" is earned by established expertise. Filter verbs minimal; when used ("he understood") they mark causal pivot.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><strong></strong><comment>High information density: "zodiac coin...Gemini, the twins" packs metaphor, stake, and character axis in four words. Figurative language is selective—storm as amplifier, containers as amphitheater—never crowding causality. One template cadence: "He’d calculated...He’d proven..." two sentences apart; minor, does not touch closure. Final line cadence mirrors opening "labyrinth keeper," creating ear-earned resonance.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: geomagnetic storm + shipping container acoustics + zodiac cartography yields a premise that feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk—using a key-as-tuning-fork—pays off because the acoustic rule is seeded early ("opening the way sound travels"). Dock-rumor cosmology ("ghost walks") particularizes this port forever. Could not swap setting or tool without collapsing logic; transformation complete.</comment>
