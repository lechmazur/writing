<question>1</question>
<grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Elara’s prism-minded trait is shown through spatial perception and memory palace filing, but interior contradiction is asserted (“refraction of loyalty”) rather than dramatized in a micro-choice. She takes one visible risk—snatching a seed—yet the cost feels prospective, not immediate, so the beat lands closer to functional than revelatory.</comment>

<question>2</question>
<grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Causal chain holds: gravity window → threshold crossing → pattern-lock → codes revealed → seed theft, each step because/therefore. Closure is a Charged Poise: she gains the codes but carries a live sentinel kernel, a reconfiguration with future cost that satisfies the lens.</comment>

<question>3</question>
<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Limestone mouth, chilled-honey mist, and inversion-activated stalactites are tactile and POV-filtered; the grotto’s orientation literally steers her bodily trajectory and charges the final image. One micro-setting—the doodle—functions as key tool, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—retrieve 12-digit codes before hour ends—is signaled early and tightened when the seeds recognize her, foreclosing stealth. The price (taking a seed guardian) is visible but deferred; escalation is singular yet coherent under causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Theme of memory-as-refraction emerges through prism imagery and the literal lensing of hidden text; no moral is stated. Final image of descending upward crystallizes the idea that truth direction depends on viewpoint, reweighting prior motifs with conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Elara’s perceptual warp—angles, spectra, lattice filing—without head-hop. Syntax remains controlled under inversion stress; occasional Latinate elevation (“clandestinely luminous”) fits archivist register without drift.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but legible, with high information ratio; no loops or scaffold detected. Metaphors (“mist like breath from some sleeping beast”) are singular and tied to POV; no mixed vehicles obscure causality at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Gravity-invert cavern that grows sentinal seeds feels fresh; inversion-as-archive-security is a non-obvious synthesis. Risk lies in sheer concept density, yet specifics (phosphorescent algae ink, spectral thought-matching) prevent generic overlay and charge the ending.</comment>
