<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias’s shift from anxious courier to patient myth-maker is embodied in micro-choices—glove adjust, pendant touch, stopping to speak—each tied to the vibrating talisman. Interiority stays concrete, but the moment he “understood then why Maren left” is slightly abstract; still, the final steady-hand image shows earned change with visible emotional cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: the ridgeway walk deepens through iterative pauses until the garden erupts, reconfiguring the routine into legend. Closure lands as Charged Poise—Elias walks on, jittery no more, the glowing garden persisting as conceptual cost. Causality is lyric rather than tight, but pattern holds and cost is legible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Aurora, permafrost, and dragonfly-wing iridescence are filtered through Elias’s hyper-attention, constraining his decision to stop and later charging the bioluminescent garden. Spatial choreography stays clean; cold, green light, and gravel texture recur to mirror internal thaw. No world-rule inconsistencies.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: transform routine deliveries into living wonder. Pressure escalates as pendant vibration + aurora pulses force the choice to linger; each extended encounter germinates flowers, foreclosing the old solitary path. Cost is the courier code’s abandonment, visible in the garden that must now be tended by others.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme—wonder germinates in deliberate pause—emerges through blooming light-flowers rather than statement. Final image reweights Maren’s absence from loss into collaborative legacy. Avoids explicit moral; resonance lingers in archivist tending the impossible beds.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Lush, rhythmic free-indirect prose mirrors Elias’s sensory hyper-awareness: “spectral green glow,” “ionized air.” No head-hopping; perceptual signature remains steady. A few near-purple phrases (“ancient silk”) are forgiven under accumulative lyric mode.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Strong varied rhythm, high density—most sentences move stake or image. One scaffold loop: “shared tea, shared silence, shared the story” could compress. No mixed metaphors or filter-verb stacks; clarity intact at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Transforms humble courier trope into myth-generating gardener via aurora-activated dragonfly pendant—fresh synthesis. Familiar mentor-vanishes beat is reweighted by mentor becoming the mythic soil. Risky lyric escalation pays off in glowing garden image that feels inevitable.</comment>
