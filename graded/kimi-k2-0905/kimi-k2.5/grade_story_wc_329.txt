<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority stays concrete—pulse inside the locust shell, bow tremor—yet the decisive shift from observer to insurgent is told more than embodied; the laugh on the swaying bridge is the first clear cost shown. A contradictory impulse (fear of falling vs. need to free the valley) is named but not played simultaneously in scene. Still, her value hierarchy (music > safety) is legible in the final forward step, earning a credible renunciation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the orchard’s geometry dissolves, statues dream, bridge sings— undeniable reconfiguration with conceptual cost (she walks east carrying dust, path foreclosed). Causal chain holds: heartbeat-music → root-rupture → guardians stall. Orientation is clean by line 6; no lens ambiguity. One minor causality bump: the statues’ sudden hand-raising to catch blossoms is not prefigured, but reads as miracle earned by sonic infiltration.</comment>

<comment>The sky-bridge, mechanical orchard, and amber shell function as micro-settings that constrain every choice: bridge sways under her weight, shell warms against bone, grated roots cage trees until rupture. Sensory hierarchy tilts from metallic clanks to splintering wood, mirroring her shift from fear to exultation. Spatial choreography is flawless—no impossible statue positions. Setting details evolve causally with each heartbeat note.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—free valley or keep silent—signals in para 2; pressure tightens when first root tears grate, narrowing her option to stay/play or flee. Escalation is Accumulative: each musical phrase adds vegetal insurgence until geometry snaps. Cost is visible—locust shell disintegrates, bridge maintenance ends—yet the price to Elara’s body (exhaustion, injury) is only implied, capping entry to 9-band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from image pattern: shell hollowness vs. swollen seed, oil vs. honey, straight line vs. serpentine root—no explicit thesis. Final dust-offering reweights “tarnished wonder” as something that must be scattered, not polished. Ambiguity lingers: will the freed valley devour her? Complexity preserved, no moral tag.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Lyric third-person tightly filtered through Elara’s somatic perception; perceptual signature is musical—everything is pitch, vibration, cadence. Syntax elongates then contracts to mimic crescendo/diminuendo. No head-hop; diction stays within her lexicon (no academic intrusion). Filter verbs (“felt,” “sensed”) are minimal and rhythm-motivated.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and stress pattern, propelling the musical ascent. No loops or synonym churn; each image does dual work (bridge sways / heart sways). One mixed metaphor edge—“gears of the statues’ minds” is abstract metal, but forgiven under lyric license. Closing line carries echo of opening bruised-silver sky, book-ending without scaffolding.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fairy-tale trope (enchanted orchard, stone guardians) is inverted through bio-mechanical graft and sonic insurgency. Heartbeat-as-seed-signal feels fresh, not a re-skinned magic system. Transformation test fails: swap violin for flute and story still runs, so not fully singular. Yet the synthesis of musicology, insect husks, and industrial pruning is memorable and risk-aligned.</comment>
