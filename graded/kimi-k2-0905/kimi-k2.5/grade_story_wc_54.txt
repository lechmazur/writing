<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Maya’s engineering eye and quiet refusal to surrender a dead place are embodied in every micro-choice—kneeling to trace cracks, pocketing the sextant, rerouting pumps at night. The final decision to stay and plant is the cumulative payoff of those choices, felt as personal cost rather than abstract victory. Interiority stays concrete, never drifts into label-speak. One flaw: the “equations for hope” line edges toward thesis, not lived contradiction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the terminal’s grammar of departure is permanently rewritten into sustenance, cost legible in the solitary dawn vigil. Accumulative lens holds—each salvage action layers density until the cadence shift of dripping hydroponic rails. Orientation is anchored by 120 words; no spatial drift. One causal hinge could be sharper: the carnival’s auxiliary pumps are mentioned only once, yet become the critical bypass—slight convenience tax.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Crushed popcorn kernels, cracked terrazzo, brass sextant arc, condensation on revived processors—each tactile fragment is filtered through Maya’s engineer gaze and steered toward choice. The terminal itself migrates from mausoleum to photosynthetic lung, environment actively constraining the finale. Micro-setting (sextant as angle-measure) charges the last image. Skylight geometry could be pinned one beat earlier for 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—translate abandonment into life—tightens once via the night-long reroute that risks the last fuel and her internship reputation. No reversals needed under Accumulative lens; escalating pattern of revived subsystems incrementally forecloses the option to walk away. Cost is visible: blistered hands, generator fuel countdown, personal exile from career path. Stakes remain intimate, avoiding telescopic inflation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges as redirection > resurrection: hope is a pressure differential you plumb, not pray for. Final note—maps held down by a broken navigator’s tool—reweights “navigation without destination” into stewardship of what remains. No moralizing, only embodied insight. One near-penalty: “equations for hope” flirts with abstraction but is saved by the immediate engineering follow-through.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited clings to Maya’s metric attention—angles, flows, condensation beads—syntax mirrors her steady calibration. No head-hop; psychic distance tightens under stress (“she worked through the night…” collapses reflection into action). Distinct perceptual signature sustained. A single register spike—“stoic wonder settle into her chest”—leans poetic against her engineer diction, but the voice earns it as culmination.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>High information density: each sentence either maps a system or records a tactile micro-victory. Rhythm breathes—long accumulative clauses build to short, luminous payoff (“the terminal could breathe again”). No loops, no mixed metaphors. Minor caution: two successive sentences open with “She…” in the reroute paragraph—template cadence almost emerges but is broken by next beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Post-spaceport greenhouse is fresh, yet the deeper ingenuity is treating ecological salvage as literary structure—each redirect literalized in prose accumulation. Sextant-turned-paperweight embodies the repurposing theme without symbol overload. Risk of quiet ending is embraced and paid off with resonance. Could swap carnival for any pop-up event, so half-point deduction for partial swappability.</comment>
