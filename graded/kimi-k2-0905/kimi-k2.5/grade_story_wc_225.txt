<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Kaelen’s interior contradiction—guilt vs. the need to absolve—is dramatized through micro-choices (thread extraction, mirror revelation) that embody his flaw and culminate in credible renunciation. Embodied emotion (“fierce repose,” rain-laugh) stays particular; no therapy-speak. The shift from compulsive mapping to still acceptance is earned by the decoded truth that the prince was lost beforehand, visibly costing him his exile identity. Closure forecloses return to royal service and charges his new pedagogical purpose with residual solitude.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of thread/labyrinth matching intensifies density until the mirror reweights the premise. Orientation anchored by word 50; no debt. Closure—Earned Stasis with Charged Poise—lands on-page as thunder resumes and he decides to stay, carrying the empty labyrinth; cost is the irreversibility of time’s restart and his self-exclusion from court. No causal breaks; coincidence (mirror reveal) complicates rather than saves.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Time-frozen village, platinum labyrinth, and tapestry border function as micro-settings that constrain every tactic; snow, suspended lightning, and chapel selvedge are filtered through Kaelen’s hyper-precise attention. Spatial choreography is clean; objects track. Final image—rain on upturned face—recharges the earlier frozen sky with palpable release. Environment directly shapes the climax by supplying the mirror-exit mechanism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—self-forgiveness—tightens as each decoded thread reduces Kaelen’s manoeuvring room within his own narrative. One meaningful deepening: realizing the prince’s fate was pre-determined narrows options from “fix mistake” to “endure truth,” paid on-page. Cost is legible: exile becomes permanent choice, thunder resumes, labyrinth pocketed empty. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens; no reversal needed at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particular tactile acts: decoding threads externalizes the impossibility of revising past moves, reframing guilt as humility toward imperfect agency. Mirror image reweights the tapestry’s nostalgic weave into acceptance—no moral stated. Subtext in “fierce repose” and empty pocket carries residual ache. Ambiguity lingers: he is free yet remains alone, teaching others to avoid his path.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Third-person POV stays tightly aligned to Kaelen’s perceptual signature—metal coldness, geometric mapping—without head-hop. Syntax mirrors compulsive precision in paratactic thread/labyrinth clauses, then widens into open cadence as thunder rolls. Diction (“winnow,” “selvedge”) is character-bound, never academic posturing. Compression in “seven years” elision is taught early and paid off when time unfreezes.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening, accelerating during extraction beats, then breathing at mirror click. No loops or scaffold; each clause advances image, atmosphere, or knowledge. Figurative language is sparse, surgical: “woven hush” sustains without purple drift. Final rain line resolves cadence and motif cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Frozen-time village + tactile code-breaking synthesizes fresh angle on exile tale; labyrinth-as-rosary feels inevitable in hindsight. Prince-loss twist is prefigured by “impossible constraints,” avoiding late rule change. Risk in lyric stasis pays off through earned thunder restart. Could edge higher with one more concrete village detail to ground sociopolitical stakes.</comment>
