<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elias’s grief-driven alchemy is visceral and embodied; the ash-scattering beats show micro-choices that visibly cost (mask cuts, breath restriction). Interiority stays specific to his perceptual world (“charcoal powder clung…black and irreducible”). The final renunciation—leaving the mask on the empty chair—earns its charge because every prior shard carried her rage. Only one POV on stage, so relationship/status bullets N/A; no convergence issues.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/lyric lens holds: spiral of ash deliveries intensifies meaning rather than plot reversals. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration—mask abandoned in stillness reweights all prior ash acts as both preservation and farewell; cost is legible in the stopped chair and bleeding cheek. Orientation taught by second sentence; no teleport props. One causal micro-turn: final handful converts gallery into reverse-photograph, crystallizing emotion. No meaningful escalation cap triggered.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Gallery geometry acts as pressure engine—walls inhale ash, perspective lines force Elias toward vanishing point. Porcelain shards serve as micro-setting that slices skin and stores heat of maternal rage, constraining the final mask placement. Sensory selection stays filtered through his charcoal-caked fingers and ash-clouded breath. No occupational detail required; spatial choreography coherent throughout scattering spiral.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake: transform grief into permanent artifact before memory vanishes. Pressure escalates via each ash handful that narrows future options—once scattered, ash cannot be reclaimed. No antagonist; cancer remains off-stage complication, not resolver. Final spiral tightens stakes to zero: “crystallize a fleeting emotion was to acknowledge it would never return.” Visible cost paid in blood and breath.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through material alchemy rather than thesis: ash = memory, mask = shattered tenderness, vanishing point = irrevocable loss. Final image of mask on empty chair reweights prior “preservationist” label as elegy, not boast. No moralizing; complexity intact—he both saves and erases her. Subtext carried by porcelain heat and charcoal black that “time was already erasing…like waves smoothing stone.”</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Elias’s perceptual syntax: “ghost of the sitter’s breath,” “language without translation.” Rhythm accrues through anaphoric ash scatterings that teach the accumulative pattern. No dialogue, so no voice convergence risk. Lexicon keyed to his artisan diction—“gypsum,” “vanishing point,” “reverse-photograph”—without register drift. Compression in final clause (“a constellation of broken things made briefly beautiful and still”) crystallizes voice at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Sentence variety strong; no template cadence or synonym loops detected. Figurative layering is dense yet purposeful—each metaphor (waves smoothing stone, dark snow, reverse-photograph) pays off in closure image. Information density high: single sentences fuse ash physics, memory erosion, and emotional cost. Micro-scaffold only in “the old rocking chair creaked its final rhythm / slows to a stop” restatement, not severe enough to obscure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Concept of preserving by destroying—portrait must burn to be saved—feels fresh and inevitable. Ash-as-medium and porcelain-as-armor synthesize grief-craft into singular ritual. Risk of accumulative lyric pattern pays off in final stillness. Could not swap “charcoal” for “paint” without breaking material logic. No derivative premise detected; avoids stock cancer melodrama by focusing on alchemical aftermath.</comment>
