<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied (“weight…settling between her ribs”), but the epiphany is stated rather than dramatized in real time; the final renunciation is legible yet leans on abstract summary rather than a last observable micro-choice that seals cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the delete-key refusal and pearl-crowning reconfigure her official duty into subversive custodianship with lasting professional risk; the Accumulative/Textural lens holds, the spatial/temporal anchors are clear by word 100, and the final image multiplies her silhouette with undeniable cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Geode acoustics, salt crunch, and tool checks are filtered through Elara’s professional gaze; the pearl-as-micro-setting constrains the climactic alignment and charges the spectral projection, meeting the 9+ gate even though broader geopolitical context is rightly off-stage.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten from regulatory compliance to moral custodianship; the single deepening beat—delete-key hover→commit—narrows options under the Accumulative lens, but the price (lost career/identity as inspector) is implied more than etched in a sensory after-image.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of inherited vulnerability emerges through spiral confessions and crystalline refraction without authorial summarizing; the ending image of “walls…crumbled like salt in rainwater” reweights earlier bunker metaphors into a resonant, non-moral answer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment> third-person hovers at a lyric middle distance that matches Elara’s trained yet wonder-struck perception; rhythmic compression (“spectral harmony…projecting…in luminescent fire”) is pattern-taught early and pays off in the final cadence without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>High figurative density is justified by the textural premise; only one mixed metaphor cluster (“latent radiance…crystalline prison…spectral harmony”) risks overwriting, but it occurs pre-climax and does not obscure causality; sentence variety and propulsion remain strong to the last line.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Post-apocalyptic bunker inspection merged with geode-cathedral aesthetic feels non-obvious; the inscribed nautilus as confessional device freshens the “abandoned oligarch” trope, though the core pearl-crown activation echoes familiar light-ritual patterns, keeping it just shy of the highest band.</comment>
