<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s prosopagnosia and artistic gift create a sharp, usable contradiction; the interiority stays concrete (“her hands knew how to render them”) and the final thaw is earned by the quarry session. Still, the rival’s identity arrives as external data, not through her blind-spot blunder—so the flaw doesn’t quite bite her. A stronger causal mistake would have pushed this past 8.0.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the ribbon’s weave reweights the case and Elara’s empathy revives—visible cost is the emotional thaw on the last line. Causal chain holds: ribbon analysis → sketch → recognition of witness; no off-stage cheats. Orientation is swift (quarry rim, damp notebook, dawn). One micro-turn suffices for this length; lens stays Accumulative/Textural and pays off.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Limestone mist, wet shale, black pool—all tactile, filtered through Elara’s professional eye for texture. The quarry’s “furrowed hush” doubles as emotional pressure, and the easel placement beside the pool directly enables the breakthrough. Weather and rock constrain movement and echo memory without ornamental overload. Micro-setting (ribbon against stone) charges the decisive beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—give the vanished woman a voice—stays front-and-center. Pressure tightens when methodical analysis fuses with emotional exposure; the sketch session itself is the narrowing beat. Cost is felt in the final thaw. No coincidence resolves; the ribbon’s contradiction was seeded early. Could use one more intermediate obstacle to hit 8.5+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme of “restoration through paradox” emerges from action: blind artist sees truth, violent quarry becomes site of repair. No explicit thesis; final image reweights earlier coldness without moralizing. Subtext of class silence threads the rival’s jacket lining. Ambiguity remains—no neat justice—yielding lingering resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Elara’s tactile cognition; perceptual signature is consistent (“glittered like broken glass” seen through an artist’s value scale). Syntax lengthens during reflective beats, then compresses when she spots the weave—rhythmic control under pressure. No filter-verb clutter. Voice-driven metaphor (“memory refusing to dissipate”) feels organic to her profession.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence detected. Figurative language is selective—one simile per beat, each serving atmosphere or character lens. No mixed metaphors or scaffolding loops. High information density: “ribbon’s microscopic weave matched not the heiress’s documented gown, but the custom lining of a rival’s jacket” does forensic + emotional work in one stroke.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Face-blind portraitist solving a masquerade disappearance is a fresh synthesis; the quarry-as-restoration site repurposes extraction geography into emotional counter-spoil. Specific textile forensics rather than generic clue. The paradox method is set up early and pays off, avoiding gimmick. Risky compression at 700 words succeeds, but a hair more personal consequence for Elara would push 9.0.</comment>
