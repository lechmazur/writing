<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Maya’s “creeping normality noticer” trait is vividly shown through tactile micro-choices—fingers on driftwood, kneeling at the foundation—yet interior contradiction is thin; she never hesitates or fears the aliveness she uncovers. The final smile feels unearned because no prior beat exposes a personal cost or risk to her. Still, her embodied perception and the orris-root micro-choices keep her above the mid-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the moment she sets the orris root against the house, the cottage’s interior glows “newly awakened and watching,” reweighting the premise from observation to mutual recognition with visible cost—she leaves the scene altered, fence posts already continuing their slow migration. The accumulative/textural lens holds: every displaced object is a beat that thickens pattern until the crystalline “shard of hush” catalyzes the reconfiguration. Orientation is anchored within 120 words; no causal breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Bay, cottages, and orris root are filtered through Maya’s synesthetic bias—violet scent bridging wood and silence—so environment becomes tool that constrains her final gesture. The slow migration of fence posts and the backward tide clock provide tactile, testable weirdness that feels lived-in, not touristic. One slip: “streetlights daydreamed in their half-awake hum” is lovely but floats unmoored from spatial grounding.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stake—understand why houses feel alive—tightens once she finds the crystalline silence; her choice to place the orris root beside it crystallizes mutual recognition, foreclosing mere spectatorship. Pressure is textural: each displaced object adds density until the final moment reweights options. Cost is conceptual but legible: she exits knowing the houses now watch her, a felt surveillance that alters her future “noticing.”</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme—attention as creative act—emerges through gesture, not thesis: her noticing literally awakens the cottage. The violet scent bridging organic and mineral becomes a quiet symbol of that co-creation. No moralizing; the final glow invites reflection on how perception sponsors being.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Maya’s perceptual signature: synesthetic, patient, slightly haunted. Syntax lengthens during contemplation then clips—“She understood now”—to mark beats. No head-hopping; diction stays within her plausible lexicon while reaching for lyric height.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with scene pressure: long accumulative sentences build texture, then短, percussive articulations mark recognition. Figurative language is dense but patterned—“salt forming on glass,” “grammar of rearrangement”—so it teaches its own logic. One near-loop: “displaced objects” is repeated twice in close proximity without new inflection. Otherwise high density without clutter.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The conceit that architectural awareness grows from accumulated hush is fresh, yet grounded in specific sensorial mechanics—backwards tide clocks, spoon in garden—so it feels discovered rather than imposed. Risky lyric density pays off in the final bioluminescent glow. Could edge to 9+ if the protagonist’s personal stakes were sharper.</comment>
