<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elara’s “quietly driven” trait is shown through tactile micro-choices—tracing grooves, trembling fingers, re-lifting the whistle—so the interior pressure feels earned. The final renunciation (map-maker steps into the map) carries visible cost: she forfeits the safety of observation. One slip: the transcendence of the lost twelve is told, not embodied, so the emotional price is slightly abstracted.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the city moves, the lens shifts from cartography to participation, and the cost is the irreversible loss of outsider stance. Pattern language is taught early (Fibonacci whistle ↔ shell etchings) and pays off in the rupture beat. Orientation is anchored by word 85; no debt applied.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The calcified turtle-boulevards are not backdrop; their shells absorb history and literally crack open under sonic pressure, forcing Elara’s choice. Sun-bleached dread is filtered through her selective attention—salt wind, rust smell, blinding sheets—so atmosphere constrains perception. Micro-setting rule satisfied: the nautilus reed and shell-peak alter tactics and charge the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will the watchers answer—tightens once: the sky-crack forecloses passive observation. Escalation is Accumulative: each shell placement layers resonance until the threshold ruptures; the price is the city’s anchorless future. Agency stays with Elara; coincidence only complicates.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges as “knowledge demands embodiment”: mapping ends when the mapper steps inside the spiral. The watchers-as-questions image reweights earlier shell-maps from records to invitations. No moralizing; the final whistle note leaves ambiguity—farewell and arrival coexist.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person POV stays tightly latched to Elara’s perceptual filter: “sunwashed dread,” “geometry made audible.” Syntax lengthens under wonder, shortens under vibration; no head-hopping. Distinctive diction (“mathematical spirals rather than words”) remains within her lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Zero loops; sentences layer job and atmosphere without scaffold. Metaphors stay coherent—“geometry made audible” extends the shell-pattern logic. Occasional elevated Latinate diction (“transcended,” “conceptual repricing”) is the only micro-drift, but it aligns with the abstract revelation beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Turtle-city as memory-storage device fuses megafauna infrastructure with data archaeology—fresh, inevitable in hindsight. The watchers-as-questions twist reframes silent monuments into living epistemology. Risky cosmic scale lands because personal cost (loss of cartographic distance) remains legible.</comment>
