<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s muteness, excavator past, and acquiescence to the ghostly transfer are concrete; the “astonished recluse” label is shown via frozen stillness rather than declaration. Interiority stays embodied (“weight that pulled at his ribs”). The final endurance—accepting custodianship of silence—carries visible cost (open box, lifelong vigil). Yet he never actively tests or revises the covenant; the ghosts act, he receives, capping change short of 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of ghostly pauses + sensory clues tighten meaning until Elias’s stance crystallizes. Orientation anchored by line 4; transitions clean. Closure is Charged Poise: open box refracting dawn light reweights the premise—he is bound to witness, not restore. Cost is felt in the indefinite future of caretaking silence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Valley of Thorns, burnt hives, and the stained-glass box function as micro-settings that constrain action: ghosts avoid the fire quadrant, Elias sits within the box’s rainbow radius. Sensory triad of light-bent specters, clover scent, tooth-hum is selective and urgent. Spatial choreography holds as ghosts orbit specific hives. Environment + charged object directly shape the final image, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: preserve the mass of unspoken memory. Pressure escalates through accumulating ghost visitations and sensory anomalies; Elias’s agency is the decision to stay and keep the box open—an attention-based renunciation that forecloses departure. Cost (indefinite custodianship) is legible. However, no live option for escape or resistance is dramatized, so tightening is moderate, not severe.</comment>

<grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of unspoken obligation emerges through comb, wax, silence, and the unbroken seal; no authorial thesis stated. Final image—sunlight fracturing through open box—non-literally answers what survives fire: the burden of unheard words. Ambiguity persists: is this duty healing or curse? Complexity embraced; resonance lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elias’s perceptual grid: “humming that vibrated in his teeth,” “colors shift as figures moved behind panels.” Syntax grows more elliptical under wonder, mirroring his breath-held stillness. No head-hop; patterned elision (“gravity of everything never voiced”) taught early and paid off at closure. Voice distinct, consistent, and modulated with pressure.</comment>

<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Lyric density serves accumulative design; metaphor chains (waxen cathedrals, sediment in chambers) stay coherent and terrain-bound. No mixed vehicles; rhythm breathes with scene cadence. Minor scaffold: “honey, bitter as smoke” and “heavy as honey, bitter as smoke” restate the same sensorial twist within two sentences—paraphrase loop −0.2. Otherwise high information density; closure line clean.</comment>

<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Ghost-beekeeper covenant reframes eco-grief through apiculture aftermath; stained-glass reliquary for silence feels fresh. Specificity of burnt acacia, sapphire bees in lead, and tooth-buzz pollen memory anchors the concept. Final custodian-of-absence role grows inevitably from setup. Not wholly unprecedented, but synthesis and risky quiet ending elevate it; transformation evident.</comment>
