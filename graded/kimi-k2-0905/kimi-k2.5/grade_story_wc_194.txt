<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Kael’s dynasty-ending mission is clear, but interior contradiction is only asserted (“righteous pursuit” vs. silent complicity) rather than dramatized in a micro-choice; the final act of copying symbols is too safe to feel like a costly renunciation. No embodied emotion undercuts the stakes—heartbeat, breath, sweat are absent even as the room vibrates. The character functions as a mythic archetype, not an individual whose flaws complicate the victory.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Closure lands cleanly: the dynasty collapses through unveiled truth, a Conceptual Repricing with social cost signaled by “by dawn, the Aureate name would be ash.” Causality is lyric-accumulative; each crank-turn deepens textual density until airborne letters crystallize. The orientation anchor (who/where/when) is taught by word 60; no penalty. One minor elasticity: the gramophone’s acoustic physics is introduced as fait accompli rather than earned constraint, but it does not break the lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>The sepia reading room is not postcard scenery; its dust, vanilla deceit, and resonant air actively constrain how Kael can extract truth (speech would shatter the field). The gramophone crank doubles as micro-setting/tool whose missing state drives the inciting retrieval. Spatial choreography is immaculate—cylinder pocketed, crank inserted, dust letters suspended—tracking every object without drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—expose mass graves beneath the palace—is signaled early and tightens with each crank rotation that reveals coordinates. Agency is present yet abstract: the “eloquently silent” choice not to speak maintains the acoustic field, a credible tactical restraint. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral; the price (dynasty’s erasure) is large-scale but not personally felt by Kael on the page, keeping the score below 8.5.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme—history as acoustic residue that can be re-sung into justice—emerges through image, not statement. The final image of “quiet turning of a handle” reweights earlier “golden shadows” into moral exposure without moralizing. Subtextual irony: the dynasty that used sound (propaganda chronicles) is destroyed by sound, but the insight is left for the reader to complete.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric voice sustains a controlled archaic cadence (“dynasty ender,” “amber light”) that matches the mythic register. Perceptual signature is consistent: Kael notices texture, scent, vibration, never slipping into modern analytic diction. No dialogue, so no voice convergence risk. The compression of time (“evening stretched its first yawn”) is taught early and paid off in the final dusk dissolve.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm modulates from long breathy accumulations to staccato revelations (“coordinates of mass graves”). Figurative layering is dense—almost every sentence carries metaphor—but the pattern is established as lyric mode, not overload. One scaffold loop: “each rotation…each oscillating mote…” repeats concept without new pressure. Otherwise clean, no mixed metaphors or register drift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The acoustic-archaeology premise feels fresh: a gramophone crank that writes truth in mid-air dust is a specific, non-obvious synthesis of steampunk and forensic activism. Risk is high—physics-as-manuscript could have collapsed into gimmickry—but the piece commits fully, embedding the rule into every beat. The only near-echo is Eco’s library mysticism, yet the sonic twist reconfigures it beyond recognition.</comment>
