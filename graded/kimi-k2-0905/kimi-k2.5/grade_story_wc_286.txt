<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Kai’s interiority is specific and embodied—her fingers “finding the rhythm of the earth,” the vibration “in her teeth”—and her renunciation of honey is credibly foreshadowed by the meditation on acceptance. The only lapse is the late, overt diagnostic line “Kai understood then,” which momentarily abstracts what the body has already shown.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens is declared early via overlapping timelines and holds to the final Charged Poise: the lantern glass left behind reweights every prior image. Orientation locks by line 5; the single deepening at the hive stand tightens stakes without forced reversals. Closure cost is legible in the glass abandoned and the path foregone.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The cracked clay cylinders, lavender husks, and lantern glass act as micro-setting that constrains every beat; the oasis’s phototropic response is the final environmental vote on Kai’s choice. Sensory selection narrows to vibration and filtered light, mirroring her meditative focus. Spatial choreography never drifts.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“why do some places resist change?”—is signaled in paragraph one and deepened when the thrumming reveals the bees’ temporal net, forcing Kai’s renunciation. The tightening is singular but sufficient: she forfeits extraction and instead becomes another resonant node. Cost is visible in the abandoned glass.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the oasis’s refusal to erode, reweighted when Kai realizes resistance is acceptance. No explicit thesis is stated; the final image of the glass beacon offers a resonant, non-literal answer. The conceptual repricing lands clean: permanence is multiplicity, not stasis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays tight to Kai’s perceptual filter—sun patterns that contradict light, vibration in dental bone—without head-hopping. Syntax lengthens under contemplation, then shortens at the renunciation beat, mirroring the shift from search to stance. No register drift or filter-verb clutter.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but patterned; metaphor clusters (“sun patterns that shifted like fault lines”) are taught early and paid off. One paraphrase loop—“sharp gentleness” repeated in closing paragraph—dulls the cadence slightly, yet the final line re-establishes propulsion. No mixed metaphors or scaffolding obscures causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The kintsugi lantern as temporal prism, the bees’ zen collective, and the phototopic oasis synthesize into a fresh meditation on time and care. Risky lyric accumulation stays coherent; the concept feels inevitable in hindsight. No trope is recycled without transformation.</comment>
