<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Mara’s contradictory impulses—grief for the lost auditory world and fierce refusal to surrender music—are dramatized through embodied micro-choices (striking forks, controlling breath). The final Earned Stasis, her recognition of herself in the winterglass, is fully prepared by the escalating thermal palette and costs her the last illusion of ever “hearing” again. Interiority stays concrete, never drifts into label-speak. Only the brother’s off-stage presence keeps it from 9+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the white-gold major chord reconfigures silence from prison to instrument with undeniable conceptual cost. Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout—each fork-strike deepens the thermal pattern until the final cadence. No teleporting props or orientation drift; winterglass, forks, and heat-map are anchored by word 80. Persistent constraint (permanent deafness) shapes every tactic and the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Winterglass panels and frost-bloom condensation actively filter and amplify the thermal projections, constraining Mara’s choices—she must move slowly to avoid disrupting the heat patterns. The conservatory functions as micro-setting that charges the final mirror-image. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: temperature and vibration dominate, color is translated emotion. Specific silica origin and twilight spectrum ground the world without encyclopedic dump.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reclaim music after deafness—tightens through each fork-strike that forecloses the old auditory path and deepens the thermal one. One meaningful escalation: teal envy shifts to tangerine thaw, visually confirming the risk is working. Cost is legible in the final white-gold flare that burns the last bridge to her former sensory life. No external antagonist needed; internal pressure suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges silently: listening can be re-invented as seeing/feeling. The winterglass cathedral reconfigures from tomb to instrument without a moral stated. Final image of her “silently singing in colors” offers resonant, non-literal answer. Only the brief “rectify the trauma” line flirts with Echo, but it is embedded in action, not tacked on.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains tight psychic distance; perceptual signature is temperature-first, vibration-second, color-as-emotion. Syntax lengthens during thermal blooms, contracts during fork-strikes, mirroring breath control. No head-hopping or register drift. Distinctive diction—“winterglass,” “thermal cartography”—stays within Mara’s plausible lexicon as inventor of the system.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High information density: single sentences paint fork, breath, color, and emotional valence. Metaphors are coherent—“frost flowers,” “phantom limbs”—and never stacked. Rhythm accelerates with ascending scale, then releases on low-A crescendo. One paraphrase loop (“silence itself possessed texture and temperature and weight”) is minor; no artifacts touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: deafness solved by heat-map music performed on tuning forks inside a frozen glass conservatory. Premise is followed to logical, sensory conclusion without retreat. Risk-taking (no dialogue, no sound) heightens coherence. Could not swap setting or method without collapsing the story.</comment>
