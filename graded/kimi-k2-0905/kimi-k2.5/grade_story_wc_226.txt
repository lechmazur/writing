<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Kael’s interiority is lyrically particular (“forged hush,” “prismatic shards”), but the decisive surrender to Lira’s distortion of their art arrives as an articulated epiphany—“True refraction required surrender”—rather than a dramatized, embodied contradiction under threat. The cost is poetic but abstract; we feel the voice merging into bone, yet the prior resistance is mostly summarized. Still, the flaw-motivation link is legible and character-bound.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: Kael’s sacrifice liquefies the Overseers’ monolith, turning “single truth” into proliferating possibility. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each refracted echo thickens atmospheric stakes until the ritual loses anchorage. Causality is internal/lyric rather than event-based, but the before/after is unmistakable and the cost is on the page: “Kael felt their voice fading, becoming part of the bone itself.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The bone towers function as both macro-setting and micro-instrument: porous surfaces absorb and re-emit sound, directly enabling Kael’s tactic and charging the final hum that unseats the ritual. Spatial choreography stays clean—fingers on calcified wall, jars circling, Overseers at rim. Selective sensory detail (“hollow sound swallowed immediately”) keeps atmosphere taut without cataloging. The spire’s glow supplies a visible clock that tightens the scene.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—unseating fixed history—signaled early and tightened through echo-density rather than external reversals. Kael’s agency is perceptual/creative: surrendering narrative control to Lira’s nonsense refracts the Overseers’ anchor. Cost is poetic but legible: loss of authorship and physical dissolution. One meaningful cadence shift—raw, doubtful lines replace polished verse—qualifies as sufficient deepening under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: history as living, plural echo rather than edict. Subtext lives in gesture—opening jars, spire dimming—never thesis. Final image of “many paths” reframes prior monuments without moralizing. The idea that “forgiveness costs the story” is enacted, not stated, through Kael’s self-erasure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person POV stays tight to Kael’s perceptual filter: wind against cloak, finger on porous bone. Syntax lengthens under lyric pressure yet retains control—“refracted against the curved walls, splitting their forbidden history into countless tonal variations.” No head-hop; Lira’s voice surfaces only as reported sound. Register remains consistent with a mythic-lyric mode taught from line one.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Rhythm modulates from hushed sibilance to cascading polysyndeton as echoes multiply; no template cadence detected. Figurative language is dense but patterned—“seeds,” “shards,” “mist”—and pays off when the spire’s dispersal reveals “not one path forward, but many.” A few adjective stacks (“innocently mischievous child”) minorly clog, but closure image stays clear. Zero paraphrase loops.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fuses anti-authoritarian art-making with fossilized canyon that literally metabolizes sound—fresh synthesis. Surrendering authorship to a child-collector refracts standard rebel-hero arc into something stranger and riskier. Risk-taking (lyric accumulation over plot reversals) heightens meaning without obscuring stakes. Feels inevitable in hindsight yet not derivative of familiar dystopias.</comment>
