<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Interiority is lyrical and body-bound (“clay under her nails and marble dust in her hair”), but the want—freeing creativity—stays abstract; no contradictory impulse is dramatized on the page, so the final stillness feels pre-ordained rather than wrested. The micro-choice to lie down is the only visible fork; earlier “mapping” is summary. Still, the embodied payoff lifts it above mid-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each meteor adds density until the final cadence shift (“silver snow” descent) reweights the stake with felt cost. Closure is a Charged Poise—creativity returned, body marked—legible under the lens. One transition (walk → arch) is clean; orientation anchors by line 5. No causality break.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Brass sextant functions as micro-setting: frost-heaved stones, violet gleam, and tool-warmth constrain each step. Aurora is not postcard but pulse-timer—fade signals portal seal. Sensory hierarchy mirrors POV bias: sculptor’s fingers read temperature and texture first. Environment directly shapes the final rest.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—retrieve lost creativity—signaled early; pressure tightens as each meteor narrows the window. Protagonist’s agency is accumulative (trace, map, rest) rather than a single reversal; cost is the cold ground and bodily dissolution/reassembly. Sufficient for 600-word scope.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges via image pattern: stardust as externalized art returning home. No moralizing; final image of clay and marble dust reconfigures the premise without statement. Ambiguity lingers—whose voice spoke?—inviting reflection. Avoids tidy closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays tight to Elara’s perceptual filter: “moonstruck dreamer” is narrator’s epithet, not self-label. Syntax lengthens under aurora dazzle, shortens at rest—rhythmic mimicry of breath. No head-hop; diction within plausible lexicon. Distinct texture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentences carry double duty (information + image). Two near-adjacent “stardust” mentions create minor echo but do not stall closure. No filter-verb stacks or mixed metaphors in peak beat. Clean copy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Familiar “aurora grants visions” trope is re-angled through sculptor’s sextant-cartography of lost ideas; brass instrument as dowsing rod for creativity feels fresh. Specificity of “unwritten calendar” and “fifth star’s voice” lifts material beyond generic sky-magic. Risk is moderate, payoff clean.</comment>
