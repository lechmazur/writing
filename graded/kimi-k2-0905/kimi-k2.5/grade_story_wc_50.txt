<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Elias’s quiet obsession with quantum-quartz acoustics is under-typed yet embodied every time his fingers test a tooth; the trembling mainspring wind crystallizes a believable cost. Interiority avoids label-speak, keeps locksmith craft in muscle memory (32° angle, dawn tally). Only lapse: 9-day montage remains summary, so we glimpse no mid-process micro-choice that visibly tightens stakes; this caps the arc short of 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Causal linkage holds: quake → loss of echo → frozen timer → reflection mapping → reverse-engineered gear cut → voice restored. Orientation is clean by line 8; lens stays causal; closure lands with audible, conceptual cost (cavern’s exhale + Elias’s smile). One meaningful tightening: the violet-oblique beam reveals the decisive escapement crack.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Marble acoustics constrain every move; body-as-setting surfaces when Elias’s trembling hand becomes tool and obstacle. Micro-details (alabaster vein, crystalline hollows, diagonal fracture) concretely guide the goal, not just decorate. The ending’ resonant click charges the marble itself as final image, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—return cavern’s song—tightens once via the cracked escapement; quit or persist is never fuzzy. Protagonist agency drives each step (mapping, filing, winding). Cost is visible: dawn angle study drains dawn after dawn; the final click releases frequencies months-imprisoned, shifting from emptiness to resonance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Concept of "storing wonder in reason’s cellar" threads through gear-logic without overt thesis. Final re-emergent echo reframes preceding caliper work, achieving conceptual repricing. Theme resists moralizing; the quiet smile trusts reader to feel science-magic fusion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Elias’s locksmith perception: toothed wheels are read like rusted tumblers; sound "pools," light "skitters." Syntax flexes with pressure—long reflective coils yield to hammer-beat fragments: "He wound ... click resonated." No dialogue = no voice-convergence risk; metallic idiom feels particularized.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Density: "harvested temporal resonance in its mainspring" collapses physics into image without scaffold. Rhythmic variety—spondaic chips ("copper corpse") beside liquid participial chains—matches pulse of discovery. No loops, no synonym churn; final sentence braids core motifs elegantly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The conceit that a timer harvests hours to tune geological acoustics feels fresh yet inevitable; premise committed to fully. Temporal locksmithing marries hard craft to mystic resonance in a synthesis rarely seen. Only derivative strain is the autumn-quake trigger; otherwise bold risk pays off.</comment>
