<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is concrete—her hands ghosted by carpenters’ shadows shows embodied learning—but the “perpetually learning” trait is asserted more than dramatized; the final renunciation of GPS guidance is earned yet its emotional cost is stated (“she no longer needed”) rather than felt.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the lantern slide reweights her art from assembly to conversation with the dead, with visible cost—she abandons satellite certainty. Accumulative lens holds: each slide projection thickens pattern until storm-forced yielding becomes inevitable. One causal micro-turn—cedar beam fit while ghosts flicker—tightens stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stone arch’s turbine-hum and wet walls act as micro-setting that constrains joinery choices; driftwood grain encoding weather data charges the final pavilion plan. Orientation anchored by 120 words. Selective sensory triage under storm narrows to touch and sound, filtering through sculptor’s professional eye.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will she master the wood’s language or impose hers—tightens when storm denies escape, forcing collaboration with natural force. One meaningful deepening: lantern slide reveals knots contain navigation math, foreclosing old assemblage method. Cost is conceptual but legible: surrender of artistic control.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from slide’s timewoven alliances: survival equals yielding, not resistance. Final image of projecting ancient slides onto new sculptures offers non-literal answer without moralizing. Particulars—rope-coil crest, barnacle constellation—keep abstraction grounded.</comment>
<question>6</question><<grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Mara’s sculptor perception; turbine-hum reverie motif modulates from threat to metronome, mirroring internal shift. Syntax mirrors action—long clauses for storm chaos, clipped fragments during joinery. No head-hopping; diction remains within artisan lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High information density: “knots…contained navigational mathematics” does triple duty. Occasional lyrical stack (“medieval bones vibrating with turbine-hum reverie”) risks purple but pattern is taught early and paid off. No loops or paraphrase; rhythm accelerates with storm, slows with joinery.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: magic lantern slide as portable intergenerational apprenticeship manual transforms familiar storm-survival arc. Driftwood read as text message from dead craftsmen is specific and memorable. Risk in lyric accumulation succeeds because closure reweights premise rather than explaining it.</comment>
