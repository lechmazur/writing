<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fear as adaptive tool is dramatized through tremor-legible decoding and railing-calculated evasion; every beat weaponizes the phobia rather than merely labeling it. Micro-choice chain—kneeling despite acrophobia, tracing cast while shaking, stepping aside to wobble rail—earns the final autonomy. Interiority stays embodied (“stars above seem like a crushing weight”) and avoids diagnostic talk. Cost is visible: the wobble forces father to cling in vertigo, mirroring Kai’s daily ordeal.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: because the tremors reveal code, therefore coordinates are sent, therefore sirens arrive. Orientation crisp within 50 words; single-scene default met. Closure is Decisive Change with felt cost—father clinging, Kai walking away, autonomy stolen back. Persistent constraint: the inherited trembling body remains, shaping future life.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Rusted railing, wobbling beam, and star-crush weight are not backdrop but tactical variables used to position and unbalance the father. Telescope array as “skeletal fingers” filters through acrophobic gaze, integrating metaphor and stakes. Micro-setting (child’s cast under telescope base) literally anchors the decoding beat. Environment constrains the final move; no caps triggered.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—identity theft vs. engineered fearlessness—tightens once: decoding the cast turns passive victim into active accuser. Escalation is causal and visible: each tremor clarifies coordinates, narrowing options from flight to confrontation. Cost legible in father’s panic cling and Kai’s retained trembling. No coincidence; agency drives turn.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: vulnerability as power source, not flaw. Recurring seashell reweights from death relic to voice credential; cast scribbles reweight from child’s terror to legal weapon. No moralizing; final line crystallizes stance without sermon. Ambiguity remains: Kai is neither original nor automaton but new hybrid, embracing trembling as asset.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person hovers close, filtering every image through Kai’s phobia: “stars above seem like a crushing weight,” “rusted railing” as trustworthy instability. Syntax mirrors pulse—long clause build-up, then fracture (“It did not break, for Kai was not a murderer”). No head-hopping; diction stays within stunt-world lexicon. Voice distinct and sustained.</comment>

<comment>Sentences carry double duty: “They knelt, their acrophobia making the stars above seem like a crushing weight” fuses action, perception, metaphor in one sweep. No loops or scaffold; figurative language sparse, pattern-taught (“skeletal fingers”), paid off. Rhythm accelerates at confrontation, breathes at exit. Clean grammar, precise pronouns, strong verbs.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Stunt-double-as-life-replacement flips familiar impostor trope into body-horror identity theft. Using phobia tremors as decryption key is non-obvious and inevitable once set. Seashell voice memo freshes the “object holds truth” device. Specificity of rusted observatory and plaster cast grounds the premise, preventing abstraction.</comment>
