<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—yearning for sound in a mute world—drives every micro-choice; her bow-stroke is a renunciation of silence that costs her tears. The “symphonically minded” trait is not label-speak but embodied in how she maps wood grain as score. One flaw: the hedgehog’s agency is over-credited; the creature never truly pressures her choice, so the external crucible is soft. Still, the final weep is earned stasis: she pays in solitude for the first note.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the sub-cello groan reweights the Hush, felt cost is the tear that falls on the crack she has just stroked. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: each fracture read adds density until the porcelain node vibrates. Orientation is clean—grove, dawn, frost named by line 4. Hedgehog cue/uncurl logic holds and pays off in the last line’s temporal hinge. Causality is intact: because she listened to every wound, therefore the tree consents to speak.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The porcelain insulator functions as micro-setting that constrains the final vibration; its glaze network mirrors the alder’s cracks, charging the resonance. Alder grove is sketched with eco-specificity—siskins, cambium, lignin—never catalogue. Spatial choreography is tight: bow, wire, root system track without drift. Weather is causal: frost retreat triggers uncurl, sun angle times her first stroke. One minor slip: “valleys” is a vague electricity relic, but it never reappears so no credibility break.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“will the world speak again?”—is signaled in paragraph 2. Escalation is textural: each crack read tightens the density until the porcelain node amplifies. Visible price: her personal hair bow is sacrificed, scalp implied. No external antagonist needed; pressure is the mute earth itself. The tightening forecloses silence forever—she can never again pretend sound is impossible—so the cost is conceptual and felt.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as the moral cost of listening: to hear the world is to inherit its wounds. Subtext lives in the porcelain’s crazed glaze—an image of fragile retention that finally vibrates. No editorial echo; the final line’s “remember how to listen” is action, not thesis. Ambiguity remains: will others hear or only she? That counter-reading is invited, not resolved, satisfying complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric close-up sustains a dendrological lexicon without rupture. Syntax lengthens and contracts like breathing—long sentences for frost melt, fragments at the first vibration. No head-hop; hedgehog stays externally focalized. Filter verbs are voice-motivated (“she visualized”) because the act is conscious composition. Rhythm mirrors musical phrasing; crescendo lands on the one-word sentence “Then.”</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances analysis or atmosphere. Metaphors are biologically precise—“grain like sheet music”—no mixed vehicles. Information density high: one sentence can layer tool, history, and bodily risk. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line offers resonant image that recharges the uncurl motif. One tiny register drift: “symphonically minded” appears twice; the second use could compress, but it is earned by then.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Premise—soundless earth healed by arboreal empathy—is non-obvious yet fully followed. The porcelain insulator repurposed as bridge pickup is a fresh mechanical turn that feels inevitable after the glaze=cracks mirroring. Trope of mute post-catastrophe is refreshed through haptic musicology rather than gadgetry. Risk taken: no dialogue, no antagonist, no violence—quietness itself becomes stakes. Transformation test fails if names change—only this alder, this insulator, this woman could produce this note.</comment>
