<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elias’s contradictory impulses—poverty as freedom, giving as keeping—are present but stay largely abstract; the embodied cost arrives only in the final ash fall, so renunciation feels more asserted than dramatized under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the ash burial is an Earned Stasis with conceptual cost, reweighting “philanthropy” as self-sacrifice. Pattern is Accumulative/Textural; causal glue is light but coherent, taught early by the synchrony motif and held to the final light-poem.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Obsidian sand, sulphur-stained boots, and bioluminescent voids constrain stance and camera; the volcano’s infrasound hum narrows perceptual field and charges the final ash blanket. Micro-setting beats macro-description, keeping spatial choreography legible.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“texture of transformation”—tightens once: releasing the jars shifts from control to surrender, foreclosing any further orchestration. Cost is conceptual (extinction/renewal) rather than viscerally felt on the body, capping escalation just below high-band punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through reciprocal images of containment versus release; the final ash-to-green-field reprices “giving everything away” without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers: fertility purchased by anonymous death, inviting counter-readings.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lyric third-person hovers at a calibrated distance, compressing syntax to match celestial/geological cadence; no head-hop, no filter-verb clot. Diction stays within Elias’s weathered lexicon while reaching for cosmic register—risky but controlled.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm accelerates with jar releases; sentences vary opening vectors, no template cadence. Occasional stacked metaphors (“threadbare coat pooling like spilled ink”) flirt with density but serve the accumulative pattern and never obscure causality at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Synthesis of volcanic ecology, accidental prophecy, and bioluminescent ritual feels non-obvious; the “Catalyst of Ash” trope is refreshed through anonymous poverty rather than heroics. Risk in cosmic/ geological framing pays off without breaking plausibility.</comment>
