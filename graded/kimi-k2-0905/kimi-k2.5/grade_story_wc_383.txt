<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elara’s skeptical armor and grief-driven precision are vivid, but her interior contradiction—needing to archive the memory while fearing its loneliness—only surfaces in summary. The final shift from compulsion to choice is declared, not dramatized; no micro-choice in-scene costs her anything visible. Skepticism remains intellectual posture; we never feel it fail in her body under the garden’s shimmer.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each crystalline note layers density until the garden itself becomes the archive, a resonant reconfiguration that isolates sorrow inside silver petals. Dawn’s arrival supplies the single cadence shift; cost is legible in the crumbling shell and the flowers’ permanent glow. Orientation is immediate; no causality breaks. Closure lands as Charged Poise—Elara walks toward light carrying new weight—felt, not explained.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Velvet petals, silver moss, and bioluminescent stems are filtered through Elara’s grief-sharpened senses; every floral gleam mirrors her interior state without declarative nudging. The crystal lattice functions as micro-setting: its facets refract both light and memory, constraining how she can sing the archive into place. Spatial choreography is clean—shell, lattice, petals, horizon track lucidly across the beat. Garden’s transformation into a living library charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—prevent memory’s escape before dawn—is signaled early and tightens with each ultrasonic phrase. Pressure escalates accretively: frequencies stack, flowers silver, shell hums louder, time bruises purple; no false reversals. The protagonist’s agency is the singing itself—each tone forecloses delay. Cost is visible in the garden’s irreversible glow and the salt residue on her palm.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges: isolation turned into independence requires bearing others’ pain without fusion. Image-pattern of quarantine migrates from shell to garden to Elara’s stride, reweighted at closure when the garden becomes sanctuary, not prison. No moralizing; the final line’s “ocean of human experience” is earned through the archive’s hush. Subtext lingers in the salt dust—what remains after preservation is also loss.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited maintains steady psychic distance; perception is filtered through Elara’s tuned, skeptical ear. Syntax lengthens and compresses with the singing, mirroring ultrasonic climb without breaking clarity. No dialogue, so voice carries all tension; diction stays within her lexicon—“spectral geometries,” “memory-dust”—precise, unshowy. Final cadence drops into human range, aural poise crystallized.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm pulses with the singing, sentences waxing and waning without template drift. Figurative layering is high but patterned—every velvet or silver image returns charged, so density earns its keep. Zero paraphrase loops; no filter-verb stacks. Occasional elevated Latinate diction (“metastasize,” “topography”) nicks authenticity yet remains consistent with her archivist precision.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Memory-as-virus archived into a singing garden fuses sff trope with lyric accretion; execution feels specific, not grafted. The transformation of quarantine from pathology to preservation offers fresh moral calculus. Risk in lyric escalation pays off: no cheap twist, only intensified light. Could edge higher if the shell’s whispers carried an idiosyncratic voice rather than generic lament.</comment>
