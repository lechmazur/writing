<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Vey’s quiet refusal to accept impossibility is shown through embodied action—spinning until shadows stagger—but the interior contradiction between grief for the poet and professional duty stays summary. The final smile registers cost, yet the hair-ribbon’s loss feels symbolic rather than a personal wound that forecloses any future path. Enough micro-choices (spinning, whispering the star-name, releasing the light) align with motive to earn the change, but one more beat of interior friction would have pushed her into 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the nexus geometry reconfigures so roads now lead to “potentials,” a conceptual repricing paid for by the empty ribbon and the poet’s irrevocable absence. Causal chain holds—star-hint → disorienting spin → fear loses grip → idea freed—without lapse. Orientation is taught late (120-word line crossed) but the disorientation pays off by making shadows stumble, so waiver applies; still, the slight delay keeps it just under 9.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The hair filament, silver polish stains, and starlit nexus are tactile micro-settings that constrain tactics: only the hair’s warmth cues when to snap the ribbon. Spatial choreography is liminal but coherent—seven roads, void between, ascending light—tracking clean across moves. Sensory economy favors touch and kinesthetic over visual catalog, keeping pressure high. The lock of hair as portable setting object charges the final image when it burns out, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“free an idea trapped behind fear”—is signaled early and tightens once: the fear’s grip loosens only when Vey’s counter-intuitive spin disorients certainty, narrowing options to release or retreat. Cost is legible in the spent ribbon and the implied irreversibility of the freed longing. No external antagonist needed; the singularity of dread supplies coherent situational pressure. A slightly sharper on-page price (ache in teeth vanishes without note) would have lifted it higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: vulnerability as cosmic currency. The motif of “longing bridging distance” is not declared until the freed idea sighs it, making the insight feel discovered rather than imposed. Final image of roads leading to “potentials” reweights earlier nexus geometry with conceptual cost. Avoids moralizing; ambiguity lingers about who will dare spend that currency.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays tightly fused to Vey’s perceptual bias—stardust stains, frequency that makes teeth ache—without head-hopping. Rhythm widens then compresses during the spin, mirroring disorientation. Diction stays within her artisan lexicon (“mechanisms that breathed”) yet lifts into mythic register without register drift. One hairline slip: “improbable longing” edges toward thesis, but it’s the freed idea’s quality, not the narrator’s pronouncement, so voice remains intact.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sentence texture varies from long breathy coils to fragment sparks (“The ribbon snapped free”). Figurative language is selective, never more than one image per beat, keeping causality clear. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold. Two near-mixed metaphors—“pinprick in velvet” beside “singularity of dread”—pass because they occupy different perceptual layers. Propulsion stays high; no line could be cut without dilating pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Cosmic locksmith who speaks to breathing locks is fresh, yet grounded in tactile tool-use. The inversion that memory, not metal, opens a lock transforms familiar trope into thematic engine. Risky choice to make the antagonist an abstract singularity pays off by forcing stance crystallization rather than fistfight. Conceptual repricing finale feels inevitable yet not pre-visible, satisfying transformation test.</comment>
