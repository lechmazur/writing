<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is textured—her breath misting in starlight, her fingers on warped glass—yet her contradictory impulses (exposure vs protection, truth vs fracture) are summarized rather than dramatized in real time. The cost of “weaving truth carefully” is asserted, not felt: we never see her momentarily overload a dreamer or feel her own mind crack. The captain’s flicker is a fine external mirror, but her decisive promise to write the truth arrives without an on-page micro-choice that shows the price she will personally pay. Still, her perceptual signature remains consistent and atmospheric, keeping her above the generic “wreck-diver” label.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The causal spine holds: because Elara decodes the dreams, she confronts the captain; because she names the child, the ghost yields; therefore she vows to write. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—the melted globe reweighted from “wreckage” to “holy cradle”—with visible conceptual cost: the historical lie will be dismantled, exposing the town’s myth of greed. Orientation is clear by line 30; no lens ambiguity. The single shard structure (continuous shrine scene) fits 600–800 word default. A hairline slip: the final line “the glacier groaned” is a touch convenient, not earned by her choice, so the cost feels 90 % pure, not 100.</comment>

<comment>The glacier shrine is not wallpaper: the candles’ heat warps the snow-globe glass again in miniature, the ice walls borrow starlight that literally filters her pages, and the cold drops with each ghost visit, forcing her to flex numbed fingers before writing. The melted snow globe functions as micro-setting—its distorted ship inside constrains her interpretation and finally reweights the stake. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: a wreck-diver ghost-whisperer notices pressure cracks, salt-crystal “tear tracks,” and the way glass flowed like water under deep-sea pressure. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible body shifts. The environment charges the final image without overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</question>
<comment>Dominant stake—“salvage something pure from the wreckage”—is signaled early and tightens when the captain warns “you cannot salvage what the ocean has claimed.” The meaningful deepening occurs at the globe-hand-off: Elara realizes the distortion is not damage but transformation, narrowing her options to exposing the redeeming lie, not the greedy myth. Cost is conceptual but legible: she will publicly destroy a settled narrative and likely face communal backlash. Agency is cerebral—naming the child, touching the globe, choosing to write—but still a stance crystallization under pressure. No reversal, yet the single cadence shift suffices for 700-word scope.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: purity is not what remains intact but what is transfigured by sacrifice—the glass flowed to cradle the toy, the crew’s guilt transmuted into protective love. Subtext resides in the silence about the living daughter; the story lets readers feel the ethical calculus of exposing her existence. The final image of borrowed starlight refracts the idea that truth, like light, is loaned from distant sources and can fracture minds. No tidy moral—just the cost of rewriting history. The motif of “windows” recurs only twice, but each time it shifts meaning forward, earning its keep.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric, compression purposeful: “she spoke to the drowned dead who clung to their final moments” teaches the pattern early and pays off when the captain drips phantom seawater. Syntax flexes with pressure—“the glass warped by some ancient heat”—without obscuring causality. Perceptual signature is consistent: Elara notices pressure, salt, distortion, borrowed light, all filtered through her wreck-diver lens. No head-hopping; POV stays interior and stable. Dialogue is minimal but ghost-voice is cadenced—“like cracking ice”—distinct from her own narrative texture. Register never drifts into academic meta-commentary; diction stays within her plausible lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “the concentrated essence of a father’s love that had protected her escape” packs event, metaphor, and emotional stake in one clause. No paraphrase loops; each sentence adds new angle or pressure. Figurative language is controlled—three metaphors in closing paragraph, each extending the glass/liquid/purity axis without muddle. Rhythm breathes: long sentence for shrine arrival, fragment for globe turn, crescendo for promise. Minor tick: “like tear tracks” is a near-cliché, but saved by specificity of salt crystal pattern. No filter-verb stacks; actions stay in vivid past. Opening and closing lines book-end with starlight, earning resonance.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses wreck-diving, ghost-whispering, and dream-cameo forensics—an unlikely triad made plausible by granular sensory detail. The melted snow globe as holy relic is a fresh inversion: usually symbols of innocence survive intact; here the melt itself is the sanctification. Risk is taken: 700-word single-scene lyric ghost story stakes its climax on a cognitive realization rather than explosive event, and the bet pays off. No close cultural echoes; the “Sovereign” is generic enough to avoid Titanic trap yet specific enough to feel real. Conceptual integrity holds—every rule about dream residue and ghost pressure is followed to the end.</comment>
