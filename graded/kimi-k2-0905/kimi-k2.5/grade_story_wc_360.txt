<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s obsessive need to quantify emotion drives every action; the interior contradiction—seeking precision through theft of selves—peaks when she feeds the cartographer’s page into the halo. Bodily detail (“fingers ink-black,” “sweating”) grounds her manipulations, and the final cost is visible: the cartographer reduced to a drawer-font. The borrowed-personality trait activates twice (workshop trickery, halo transposition), forcing a tactic shift each time, so the quick test is met.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The halo transposition delivers a decisive conceptual change: the cartographer’s structured grief liquefies into measurable emotion, the equation is completed, and the last star vanishes—undeniable CR with cost. Causal linkage holds: because Elara steals the journal page, therefore empathy floods and the theorem locks. No orientation debt; anchor (who/where) arrives by line 4. Persistent constraint—the halo’s glow—shapes every subsequent tactic and the final darkened image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The topaz workshop, amber-filtered starlight, and halo fragment constrain movement: walls “breathe” under the halo’s shadow, reorienting east/west and forcing the cartographer off his map-grid. Micro-setting (metal type drawers, Vandercook press) is handled tactilely and reappears as the drawer that now contains the cartographer. Environment is inseparable from the final image: when stars vanish, the halo alone glows—setting charges closure, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—derive the emotion equation—tightens once: the cartographer’s arrival offers the final “variable,” narrowing Elara’s option to transposing him or failing. Escalation is causal under the inferred lens; deliberate ambiguity intensifies pressure until the halo transposition exacts the visible price (cartographer lost). Cost is legible on-page: “only the hollow echo of stars.”</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme—empathy as consumable quanta—emerges through stolen fonts and the final drawer-sliding image; no moral is stated. The reweighting lands when the cartographer becomes another typeset soul, implying the equation is paid for by human erasure. Subtext in the vanishing stars mirrors the vanishing selves; resonance is earned, not asserted.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Lyric third-person adheres to Elara’s perceptual filter: mathematical diction (“calculus of loss”) collides with liquid metaphors (“drowning,” “viscous black ink”), reflecting her paradox. Rhythm swells under pressure—stacked clauses mimic workshop vertigo—then snaps to the cold final line. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is distinct and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>High density: “filtered the dying light above” does atmosphere + time in five words. Mixed metaphors are intentional (geometry vs. liquid) and coherent within the emotional alchemy premise. No loops, no filler; every sentence advances image or pressure. Final line achieves Charged Poise through terse inversion after lyrical surge.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: letterpress + disappearing astronomy + empathy theft; none are novel alone, but their intersection is specific and inevitable here. The halo-as-variable-coefficient repurposes a mystical MacGuffin into narrative physics. Risk—turning a living man into a font—pays off with conceptual cost rather than shock twist, earning the +0.4 risk bonus.</comment>
