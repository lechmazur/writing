<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The poet’s quiet tending and final gift to the boy trace a credible arc of “attending to fragments,” but interior contradiction stays lyrical rather than wrenching; the boy’s awe supplies the only external pressure, so the micro-choice to sacrifice the feather lands softly yet visibly costly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: each collected fragment layers until the kite rupture forces a pattern-break; the closing image of the lopsided kite reweights the stake with undeniable conceptual cost, satisfying Resonant Reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Salt-heavy air, mangrove drip, and the feather’s iridescence are filtered through the poet’s selective gaze; the lagoon’s wet sand literally shapes her arranging gestures and the boy’s hesitation, charging the final kite-launch with site-specific torque.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“find beauty in breakage”—tightens when the kite’s collapse forces her to surrender her own prized fragment; the price (loss of feather, alteration of kite) is legible, but escalation is single-note and coincidence-driven.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme of repaired imperfection emerges through tactile arrangement of shells, paper tears, and feather graft; the kite’s eccentric flight offers a non-literal answer without moralizing, though the insight is stated once in dialogue.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Lyric third-person lingers in consonantal hush (“burnished hush,” “cobalt lagoon”) yet stays anchored to the poet’s bodily attention; rhythmic repetition feels pattern-taught and pays off in the final cadence, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Sentences layer image without scaffold; occasional stacked modifiers (“quietly attended silences”) flirt with density but never dull the closure beat; zero loops, strong verbs, clean grammar.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Broken-shell assemblage and drake-feather graft give fresh inflection to the familiar “wabi-sabi” trope; transformation is specific to this shoreline ritual and would collapse if relocated.</comment>
