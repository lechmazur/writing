<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lyra’s interior contradiction—public vividness vs. private whisper—remains embodied in every beat; the final renunciation of her grief-map is earned because the cathedral glass forces her to re-see the postcards. One micro-choice chain (daily return, brush-stroke overlay, last stroke at melt-water) keeps agency alive. Cost is visible: the mother’s absence stays irreversible, the old palette is literally over-painted. Voice stays particular; no therapeutic self-labeling.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the last brushstroke reweights every prior “dark = retreat” assumption to “dark = pre-dawn vigil.” Causal linkage holds—because the sexton reveals the east-facing flower, Lyra over-paints—cost is the burial of her earlier grief-reading. Accumulative lens is taught early (postcards → glass → mural layers) and pays off in the final pigment pulse. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) hits by line 4; no debt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Cathedral glass layered with air pockets functions as a micro-setting that physically constrains perception and therefore choice; the amber pavilion’s steam-breathing floor mirrors the thaw inside Lyra. selective sensory triage (beeswax hands, drip-count rosary, burnt-sienna leaf) filters through painterly attention. Spatial choreography is clean: postcard table → garden wall → nave → curved mural surface track without drift. Final image charges from this glass-layer mechanic—without it the petals could not “reach through imagined glass.”</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“why bloom in darkness?”—is signaled in paragraph one and tightened exactly once: the tri-pane secret flips the meaning of night-bloom from retreat to anticipatory faith. That single deepening narrows Lyra’s interpretive options and forces the over-painting; cost is the irrevocable loss of her earlier melancholy reading. No reversal is needed; accumulative intensification is complete. Coincidence is absent; pressure is coherent under the textural lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: night-blooming as radical hope is realized through pigment and glass, never asserted. The stained-glass flowers re-priced from “moon-lit escape” to “east-facing trust” gives the reader a non-literal answer that reconfigures the postcards, the mural, and maternal memory simultaneously. Ambiguity lingers—mother never speaks again—yet the emotional aftereffect is concrete. No final-paragraph sermonizing; the last sentence is image-only.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Lyra’s painterly perceptual signature—color-as-emotion, synesthetic light—without leakage. Syntax lengthens under reflection, then fragments during the thaw-drip cadence, mirroring seasonal melt. No dialogue, so voice distinction bullet is N/A; narrative diction stays within her plausible lexicon (“umbral tenderness,” “spectral roots”). Patterned elision (“the building seemed to inhale”) is taught early and paid off in the dawning hush.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty: “pooling in the pavilion’s doorways like mirrors of sky” advances thaw AND reflects interior clarity. No synonym loops; figurative language is sparse except in two intentional clusters that echo mural layering. Rhythm breathes—long painterly clauses contract to single-stroke fragments at climax. Zero scaffolding or filter-verb stacks; props (postcards, brushes, glass layers) remain tactile throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses grief-work with architectural optics—fresh angle on the familiar “dead parent letters” trope. The tri-pane glass revelation feels inevitable yet non-obvious, turning stained-glass tour into hermeneutic key. Risky lyric accumulation is held coherent by the amber containment metaphor. Could not swap setting or object without breaking the closure logic.</comment>
