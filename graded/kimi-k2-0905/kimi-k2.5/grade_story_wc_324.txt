<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elena’s interiority is concrete—she smells twilight, feels moth-thumps in her ear, chooses descent without backup. The contradictory pull between archival duty and living rescue is shown, not labelled, and the final hand-clasp crystallizes a value hierarchy with visible cost. No stock therapy-speak; only the pulse of decision under ghost-pressure. The shift from tracer to rescuer is earned because the hearing-aid breadcrumb literally forks into two heartbeats that force her stance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the photograph settles on the basement floor, simultaneously ending the archive and beginning Thomas’s life above-ground—undeniable cost for both siblings of the case. Causal chain holds: curiosity → pulse trace → basement discovery → assurance → ascent. One soft spot: “he keeps the files in the basement” arrives as disembodied whisper with no prior cue that Thomas is alive, a micro-coincidence that slightly dilutes the because/therefore lens. Still, the final image reweights every prior beat under the inferred causal lens without contradiction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The atrium’s fogged glass, cooling marble, and seeping mist act as live circuitry—each breath Elena exhales is immediately swallowed by the building, literalizing threshold. The hearing-aid’s plastic and wire micro-setting constrains every tactical move: press deeper, catch rhythm, descend. Spatial choreography is immaculate: spiral staircase, basement damp, photo floating down in exact sequence. Environment plus tool together charge the final image, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“protect vulnerable voices”—tightens when the voice turns out to be alive and hiding; archival protection becomes physical extraction. One meaningful escalation: the stereo heartbeat moment collapses two eras into a single choice, foreclosing withdrawal. Cost is legible in the midnight bells and Elena’s silent lead-upward, staking her professional distance against a man’s first daylight in forty years. No extraneous reversals; pressure accumulates cleanly under causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Theme emerges from the double meaning of “tracing”: archival retrieval versus living rescue. The photograph’s final drift reweights every prior act of documentation into an act of liberation without moralizing. Subtext resides in silence—Elena’s assurance is short, Thomas’s bird-bone grip speaks forty years. The resonant non-literal answer: sometimes the dead call only to deliver the living.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays welded to Elena’s sensorium: visible breath, moth-thumps, marble under silent shoes. Syntax lengthens during descent, then fractures into short clauses at the reveal, mirroring pulse. No head-hop; Thomas’s interior is available only through bird-bone fingers and weeping, keeping psychic distance clean. Distinct perceptual signature—sound as tactile—holds to the final line.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies: sibilants in “twilight bled into the mist-clad atrium,” then clipped beats for basement shock. Mixed metaphors are controlled (“breath disappeared into gray” stays within physical logic). One scaffold phrase—“she hadn’t come here to be a hero”—could be trimmed without loss, a minor loop. Otherwise high density: each sentence moves camera, body, or stakes; no filter-verb clusters; closure line is uncluttered.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>“Contact tracer for hearts” is fresh, yet the story immediately complicates the gimmick into moral stakes: what happens when the heart is still beating? The hearing aid as both recording device and séance circuit transforms a tired ghost trope into rescue technology. Risk is taken with the living-basement reveal; groundwork (foster-system vanish, persistent curiosity) makes the twist feel inevitable in hindsight. Specificity of the Gable home-turned-museum keeps the concept from feeling portable.</comment>
