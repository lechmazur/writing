<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elena’s tapping motif and archive dive embody her obsession; the final folding/transmission of the atlas page shows a renunciation that costs her the last private relic. Interiority is concrete—“silent, collective gasp” of coral—but occasional diagnostic summary (“she understood now”) slightly dulls the contradiction under peak pressure. Still, contradictory impulses (cling vs. release) coexist in-scene and the choice is causally earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of tidal tapping + data gaps tightens toward the insight that navigational memory, not coral death, erased the routes. Closure lands as Charged Poise—atlas page sent, tide indifferent—cost felt in the relinquished witness. One minor scaffold: two successive “periodically eternal” phrases could compress, but beats advance without causality break.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Rig-turned-station, salt-soft paper, and the gray Pacific constrain every beat; the atlas page itself functions as micro-setting that literally directs the final action. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true—temperature logs, metal console vibration—mirroring internal desolation without overt symbolism. Spatial choreography holds as she slots drives, folds page, transmits. Environment charges the final image: transmission chute becomes the last portal between eras.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—why paths vanish—tightens when data gaps reveal social forgetting, not ecological collapse, as the true eraser. One meaningful deepening: atlas fragment shifts from nostalgic keepsake to actionable evidence, forcing the choice to archive it. Cost is legible: she forfeits private totem for collective memory. No reversal, but the single escalation satisfies under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through juxtaposition of immutable tide and mutable human maps; final transmission reweights the atlas from loss-token to living record, refusing moralizing. Subtext in tapping—human rhythm against oceanic indifference—accumulates resonance. Ambiguity remains: will future navigators reclaim the routes? Complexity honored, no tidy thesis imposed.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Distilled, marine-scientist diction—“zooxanthellae,” “chemical signatures”—remains within Elena’s lexicon. Rhythm modulates: staccato tapping mirrors rising urgency; longer cadence in tide closure creates poise. No dialogue, so voice contamination absent. Filter verbs minimal; perceptual signature consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty—e.g., “station creaked around her, anchored…drifting” fuses physical anchor and temporal metaphor. One paraphrase loop: “periodically eternal motion” echoes twice within four lines—minor, outside closure. Otherwise zero scaffold; figurative vehicles stay coherent. Strong information density propels without purple strain.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Reframes climate-loss story around epistemic rather than ecological extinction—fresh angle. Atlas page as memory vector feels inevitable in hindsight; trope transformed through specificity of shipping-lane obsolescence. No derivative premise penalty. Risk in quiet ending pays off via Charged Poise. Could push further into sensory risk, but already singular.</comment>
