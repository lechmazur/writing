<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Witness never acquires interior contradiction or micro-choice under pressure; she drifts through set-pieces summarised as “she understood,” so no earned cost or hierarchy of values is legible. Dictionary-handling is repeated gesture without stakes-based variation; no flaw complicates tactics. Final “she became the library” is asserted, not dramatized, so renunciation carries no visible price. Lacks any on-page beat where wants conflict with fears; thus the required change feels ornamental.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing (blank page = spiral unification) and carries cosmic cost, satisfying RR/CR form. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: repeated spiral walks + definition dust accrete meaning until final reconfiguration. However, causality between circuits is weak—“with each circuit she read another entry” tells rather than shows tightening; no new option is foreclosed visibly on the page. Orientation is clear by sentence four, satisfying the 120-word test, so no penalty applied.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Obsidian shelves, swollen pages, and collapsing geometry are vivid, selective, and mirror collapsing cosmos without overt symbolism. Micro-setting (dictionary as handled object) constrains the final gesture and charges the closing image, satisfying 9+ gate. Spatial choreography stays consistent—footfalls erase path, shelves fold like pages—supporting the folding conceit. Humidity-of-dead-forests and hiccup-between-expansion/collapse compress world-rule elegantly without exposition dump.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“unravel cosmic illusions before silence permanent”—is declared early. Pressure deepens by pattern, not causality: definitions crumble, shelves bend, options narrow to blank page. Protagonist agency is largely observational; spiral walking is repeated ritual without visible trade-off or failure risk, so cost feels ambient rather than paid. Escalation satisfies Accumulative lens yet never weaponizes a concrete loss that alters tactics inside a beat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly through circular definition-death versus linguistic endurance, never sermonized. Spiral, dictionary, and hush accrue shifting meaning—cross-reference “end” = “beginning” reweights premise without moral. Ambiguity lingers: illusions are “necessary approximations,” resisting tidy binaries. Final blank page offers resonant, non-literal answer that fuses witness with void, fulfilling 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Third-person lyric maintains consistent distance; perceptual signature focuses on lexicographical texture—pages swollen, synonyms bleeding—anchoring POV bias. Rhythmic control heightens pressure: long anaphoric clauses mimic spiral, then contract to “blank page” for cadence shift. No head-hopping; diction stays within witness’s semantic horizon. Filter verbs (“she understood”) appear but serve reflective mode; compression is purposeful and taught early.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm is musical, but figurative stacking in consecutive sentences (“luminous dust,” “resounding hush,” “cosmic illusions”) creates purple-tinged density without pattern-teaching payoff. Occasional template cadence (“she walked… she reached… she wrote”) mildly flattens propulsion. Mixed metaphors absent; spatial choreography clean. No artifacts touch closure line, so 9+ not disallowed, yet overwritten peaks keep score sub-9.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Combines heat-death eschatology with lexicographic ritual—fresh synthesis not seen in slush. Spiral arbitration as enacted method rather than metaphor is bold risk that mostly coheres under accumulative design. Risk heightens stakes without breaking clarity; collapse-into-reader is memorable reconfiguration. Minor reliance on lyric trope of “last reader in dying universe,” but specificity of swollen dictionary pages and cross-reference collapse transforms familiar conceit.</comment>
