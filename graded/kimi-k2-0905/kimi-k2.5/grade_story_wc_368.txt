<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Porous receptivity vs self-protective caution is dramatized through the wing-handling and sunrise tracking; the moment she releases the wing is earned by the preceding micro-choices and embodied scar-pulse. Interiority stays concrete, avoids label-speak, and the donor-heart “translator” image gives credible emotional scaffolding. Still, the shift from passive observation to final release could use one earlier actionable risk to make the renunciation feel steeper.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: releasing the wing crystallizes her new stance of porousness, reweighting the premise with undeniable cost—she forfeits the compass that kept her separate from the stories. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sunrise patterns and color-shifts tighten toward the final flash. Orientation is clear by line 8; the single shard rotates gracefully. Only nit: “quietly explosive truth” is named, not dramatized in-scene, slightly blunting causality at the pivot.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Floating tea-house, magnetic tether, and cedar-floor sun-pools are tactile and filtered through her dye-master eye; the body-as-setting (scar, heartbeat) constrains her reach and charges the final image. Selective sensory triage—indigo scent absent, light-sight privileged—mirrors her professional bias. Spatial choreography stays clean as the pavilion turns; no world-rule violations. Setting could pressure her one notch more—perhaps a real drift-angle risk—to earn the 9-band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—how to let stories stick without erasing self—surfaces early and deepens via color-shift warnings; the final release narrows her future method, paying a visible cost (she gives up the wing-filter). Pressure escalates under Accumulative lens: each sun-trail density increase reweights the danger of absorption. No external antagonist needed; internal conflict suffices. Middle could use one sharper micro-choice that risks bodily complication to push above 8.5.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of permeability vs self-protection emerges solely through light-dye imagery and the wing’s fate; no editorializing. Final image reprises “star” motif seeded in “captured sky,” recharging earlier material without moral tag. Complexity remains: porousness is both gift and jeopardy. Subtext in scar-heat versus wing-coolness layers the thematic tension.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Lyric third-person hovers at intimate distance, syntax elongates then snaps short in the release beat, mirroring breath. Diction stays within a color-worker’s lexicon (“fixing bath,” “mineral stain”) without jargon spill. No head-hop; perceptual signature consistent. Single POV default met; voice modulation under pressure is flawless.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with pavilion rotation; sentences vary in length and opening. Figurative layering is dense yet coherent—no mixed metaphors. Tiny loop: “watching, always watching” echoes thrice but serves mantra-like fixation so forgivable. One passive (“was waking”) could trim, yet propulsion never stalls.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fusion of organ-transplant dysphoria with textile color-work is fresh; morpho-wing as epistemic tool rather than symbol feels non-obvious. Risk of lyric stillness pays off by making the release feel explosive. Premise could belong to no other character; specificity defeats swap test. No derivative echoes detected.</comment>
