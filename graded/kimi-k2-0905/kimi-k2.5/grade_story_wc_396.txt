<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s calm intuition is embodied in micro-choices—angling mirrors, letting the fragment warm—so her final refusal of the binary is credible. The shadow-coat reacting to danger is a vivid, continuous externalization of interiority. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene, only stated; she never visibly wavers, so the cost feels intellectual rather than visceral. Closure is earned, but the absence of a moment where she almost chooses sacrifice keeps her just shy of the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: because she studies the mirrors, therefore she sees the third path; because she aligns them, the crystal reconstitutes and projects a solution that stops the ice. Closure is a Decisive Change—ice ceases groaning, nomads ascend—paid for by the crystal’s warmth in her palm and the shadows’ visible strain. Cost is legible in the final line: “the weighted breath… finally released,” a bodily price tied to the act. No teleporting props or unmotivated knowledge leaps; mirror mechanics are taught on-page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The lighthouse-orchard above grinding ice is not backdrop; its geothermal roots and mirrored fruits supply the literal tools that re-route heat. Spatial choreography is clean: she walks from pier glass to vanity glass to triangle of reflection while ice creaks beneath. Sensory hierarchy obeys crisis—aurora light is “sickly,” crystal edge “warm,” shadows “writhe.” One notch from 9+ only because the environment never physically threatens her; the stakes are abstract atmospheric collapse rather than immediate bodily peril.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—save nomads without destroying the biosphere—is signaled in paragraph one. Tightening occurs when she realizes the mirrors can refract a new geometry; this narrows the choice from burn/don’t-burn to re-align. Cost is present but conceptual—she risks the Council’s silence and the shadows’ strain—rather than a concrete loss that alters later tactics. Agency is high; coincidence is absent; escalation is single, decisive, and lens-coherent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the refusal of either/or violence; no character states “mercy must be active.” The vintage mirrors—fragments of drowned cities—quietly reprice time itself as malleable, so the final image reweights the premise: broken things can heal systems. Subtext lives in gesture: shadows “settle like satisfied serpents,” implying peace through predatory imagery. No tidy moral; reader left with the hum of mirrors and the after-echo of “map drawn from empathy into action.”</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person omniscient stays close to Elara’s perceptual filter—gnarled limbs, Art Deco silver, mid-century chrome—without drifting into Council interiority. Syntax lengthens under contemplation, then fragments at the light eruption: “Light erupted.” Diction remains within a peacekeeper-poet lexicon; no corporate register intrusion. Shadow-coat as externalized organ is a fresh, sustained metaphor that modulates with pressure. No head-hopping; voice is singular, rhythmic, and taught early.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm is controlled: long anaphoric clauses build, then a four-word sentence ruptures. Metaphors are internally consistent—dying giants, paper boats, satisfied serpents—no mixed vehicles. Information density high: “crystal ball fragment… caught the aurora light that pulsed in sickly greens” does three jobs (prop, sensory, stakes). One paraphrase loop—“weighted breath before reply” repeated—dings slightly; otherwise zero scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Synthesizes climate-fiction, time-mirror magic, and pacifist ethics into an organic whole that would collapse if any layer were removed. The orchard-as-carbon-lung and lighthouse-as-starlight-rod are fresh, yet inevitable once revealed. Risk is taken by refusing a sacrifice melodrama; tension resolves through geometric reconfiguration rather than death. Specificity of era-marked mirrors prevents generic “magic mirror” trope. Conceptual integrity intact: broken fragments literally rebuild choice, not just symbolize it.</comment>
