<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is concrete—tracing slate plates, reading ice cracks, adjusting her pitch under pressure; embodied emotion (“trapped bees” under her palms) sustains credulity. The final renunciation— maps now useless, immobile vigil—costs her agency and is earned by the prior conjuring beat. No contradictory impulses are shown live, only sequential focus, and the epiphany about “must conjure myself” is declared not dramatized, keeping her just shy of the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: silence blooms outward, energy beings recoil, Mara passes into earned stasis with tactile cost—“maps now useless,” body fixed beside the stone. Causality holds: each frequency adjustment because/therefore alters the ice meter until the null-song crystallizes. Orientation is anchored within 120 words; no lens ambiguity. The price is visible in the final image, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Harmonic caves deliver selective sensory density—D-minor stalactites, algae glow pulsing against darkness—while the echo-chamber stone functions as micro-setting that literally enables the climax. Spatial choreography is clean: descent, kneel, palms to stone, frozen pool as live gauge. The stone’s “calcium layers recording every whisper” reweights the final silence, nudging into high band. Environment could have constrained her body more under stress to breach 9.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—generate silence to quell sky chaos—tightens when cracks reveal bedrock discord, forcing Mara from passive search to active inversion. One meaningful escalation: sing-to-cancel, monitored by shifting ice fractures; energy beings’ recoil shows visible payoff. Cost is conceptualized (“hammered repose”) but not viscerally felt by her body; hence stops short of 8.8+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme—silence as forged resistance—emerges through inverse sound geometry rather than statement; final “hammered repose” reweights earlier cave resonance. Image refrains from moralizing, inviting reflection on vigilance versus conquest. Ambiguity could be sharper: does silence equal erasure or refuge? Still, resonance lingers without tidy thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Mara’s perceptual filter—ripple-marks read as runes, algae glow “gently luminous,” sonic vocabulary throughout. Syntax is controlled, rhythmic, waxing with crescendo of verbs (“thrumming,” “shifting,” “sealed”). No head-hop; psychic distance narrows under pressure. Voice could risk even more idiosyncratic diction to breach 9.0.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose propels: sentences carry dual duty (action + sensory texture). Mixed metaphors avoided; “ink in water” fits physical logic of expanding sphere. A few near-adjacent abstracts (“natural symphony,” “psychic shrieking”) mildly dilute density. High information load, no loops or scaffold, clean grammar, and final line cadence satisfy 9- gate.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Acoustic geomancy and silence-as-physical-substance feel fresh; inversion trope (amplify to null) is grounded in tactile procedure. Specifics—slate ripple plates, ice-runes—prevent generic cave quest. Risk is moderate; could push further into unexplored consequence of perpetual vigil, but avoids gimmickry. Synthesis is memorable yet foreseeable.</comment>
