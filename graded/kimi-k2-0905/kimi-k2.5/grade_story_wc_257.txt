<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—archiving grief while refusing permanence—drives every micro-choice; the moment she teaches the youth to fold a crane that will guide the next stranger, her renunciation of private grief is earned and costs her solitude. Secondary pressure is light (only the youth), but her calm, ink-stained hands and deliberate falseness of the tattoo stencil embody a hierarchy of values that is never explained, only shown.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The accumulative lens holds: each origami left at gates, each stencil projected on the dome, adds density until the youth’s recognition reweights grief into cartography. Closure lands as Charged Poise—Elara folding a new crane while dawn stains the glass—where the cost is the endless repetition of her own wound as map for others; the price is legible in her stained fingertips that never stop moving.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The brass telescopes, sepia ink, and fossilized wood are not backdrop but tools that constrain choice—only vellum can carry the false tattoo, only the rotating dome can project extinct starlight. The observatory’s copper dome becomes a micro-setting that literally charges the final image when moonlight fuses stencil with constellation, reconfiguring personal loss into celestial navigation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</question><comment>The dominant stake—whether grief can be transmuted into guidance—tightens when the youth arrives clutching the soggy crane; his need forces Elara to relinquish her private ritual and fold a new coordinate, narrowing her life to perpetual stewardship. Cost is visible: she gives away the origami that once anchored her own survival, foreclosing the option to ever leave the timeless observatory.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</question><comment>Theme emerges from the oxymoron “genuinely artificial”: permanence is impossible, yet the fake tattoo’s honesty becomes the only reliable memorial. The final image of dawn staining the windows reweights the premise—decay is not failure but the map itself—without moralizing, leaving the reader to feel the inverted bloom inside collapse.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</question><comment>The lyric third-person hovers close to Elara’s selective perception—she notices ink on skin, longitude in creases, starlight that arrives centuries late—while syntax grows slightly breathless under the meteor shower, mirroring her subdued ardor. No dialogue is required; the voice’s rhythmic control of elliptical memory (“curtains of intention”) teaches the reader the observatory’s rule and pays it off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</question><comment>Sentences vary from long, comma-pressed accumulations to fragment-caliber beats (“This is genuinely artificial”) that tighten with the stencil’s reveal; no loops or register drift. Figurative language is sparse but precise—light “stained” the windows, grief “mapped”—so metaphor never muddles the physical act of folding or projecting.</question>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</question><comment>The mourning-jewelry maker who refuses to anchor ink in skin, instead projecting tattoos onto a dome that catches extinct starlight, synthesizes grief-craft and astronomy into a fresh emotional engine. Risky compression of time (“three winters ago” to “timeless observatory”) is justified by the taught pattern of light arriving late, making the concept feel inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
