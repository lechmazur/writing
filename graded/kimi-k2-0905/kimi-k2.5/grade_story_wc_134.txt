<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—clairvoyant blind to the pilgrim—grounds every beat; her micro-choice to witness rather than foresee costs her certainty and earns the ending’s earned stasis. The pilgrim’s flattening into a vessel keeps the relationship crucible from fully igniting, a hairline slip that bars 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Closure as Charged Poise (“true clairvoyance lay…present”) reweights premise with conceptual cost; causality holds under accumulative lens—each harmonic shift tightens uncertainty until the final image crystallizes options. No teleport, no soft reset; the one transition (dawn→cave interior) is legible and pattern-taught.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The cave’s quartz, fungi, and shifting refractions are not backdrop but instruments: the pearl’s levitation and shadow-merging choreograph the climax. Sensory hierarchy filters through Elara’s auditory vocation—every drip and overtone guides choice. Spatial ground never wavers; bodies track cleanly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—control vs. surrender of prescience—tightens when static foresight collapses into live improvisation. The pearl’s spin and shadow convergence force the irreversible trade: certainty for wonder. Cost is visible: Elara’s “liberated” smile carries the ache of relinquished mastery.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the inversion of prophecy: presence > prediction. Subtext lives in gesture—palms on quartz, shadows sliding “like oil on water”—never in thesis. Final line’s “magnificently, steadily unpredictable” re-weights the concept without moralizing; ambiguity lingers as felt charge.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person intimate sustains a lyric, resonant register whose syntax mirrors harmonic cadence: clause-phrasing mimics overtones. No head-hop; perceptual signature stays rooted in Elara’s auditory bias. The one-line pilgrim reply carries multivocal layering that justifies temporary diction lift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with scene tension—long sentences swell during harmonic swells, fragment when vision blanks. Figurative language is patterned (“silver laughter”) and paid off; no mixed metaphors. Minor scaffold: “humming…cave” twice in 50 words;不足以触碰closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: clairvoyance as acoustics, prophecy as musical score. Inversion of “steady unpredictability” from flaw to epistemic virtue feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk—lyric static over plot—is earned by accumulative design. No trope recycling; crystal cave transcends New-Age cliché via sonic mechanics.</comment>
