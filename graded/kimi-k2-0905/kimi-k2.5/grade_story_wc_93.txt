<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The eel herder’s vow to the astronomer anchors every micro-choice; his interiority stays concrete (“futures unfolded…burning”) and the final dispersal costs his very self. No secondary characters appear, so status/relationship bullets are N/A. The only drag is a touch of diagnostic self-labeling (“His curse arrived unbidden”) mid-beat. Earned renunciation lands with visible price, satisfying the 9+ quick test for single-POV.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Closure is a vivid CR: the herder’s consciousness scatters, permanently charging the stones with friction—cost undeniable. Causal chain holds: promise → decades of rock math → field activation → self-sacrifice. Orientation is sketchy until ~130 words (“Now he navigated…”), but the delay serves the later payoff, so no penalty. One minor telegraph: the sled-stopping “binding words” appear only at the instant they work, yet the beat still reads as earned ritual.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The frictionless bluff, violet star-dust, and eel-slime boots constrain every step; the painted rocks become micro-setting that literally enables the climax. Aurora touching the horizon at 4:47 is a lived clock, not postcard. Sensory hierarchy—visual, tactile, kinetic—filters through the herder’s priorities. Environment directly shapes the final image, clearing the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“understand the sacred patterns”—is signaled early and tightens when the final alignment forces a pay-or-perish moment. The painted-rock field is the single meaningful escalation that forecloses retreat; cost is the herder’s dissolution. No outside coincidence; pressure is purely situational/accumulative under the lyric lens. Could edge higher if an intermediate beat showed a prior failed attempt or incremental loss.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges as the mathematics of loss: friction, stars, and self all smooth away. No moralizing; the final image of stones glowing with memory reweights the premise without commentary. Recurring motifs (painted rocks, eel paths, star dust) accrue meaning rather than decorate. One hairline slip: “sacred patterns” verges on thesis-label, but context keeps it submerged.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person lyric maintains a consistent cosmic-mythic register; cadence swells and contracts with auroral light. No dialogue, so those bullets N/A. Compression (“Hold”) and elision (“vanished whenever spoken of”) are taught early and paid off. Perceptual signature—mathematical yet elemental—remains character-specific throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, and image-dense; no loops or scaffold. Mixed metaphors are intentionally cosmic (“borrowed hues of morning,” “collapsed star dust”) and stay within the herder’s lexicon. Opening and closing lines anchor and resolve by concrete image. High-band control with only hairline risk in stacked cosmic descriptors.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Frictionless apocalypse herding eels through topology-made-traction is a fresh synthesis; the premise commits fully without flinching. Familiar motifs (precog curse, star-dust relic) are re-forged into an inevitable ritual payoff. Risk-taking (lyric-accumulative structure, conceptual dispersal ending) heightens resonance without obscuring clarity. Transformation test: swap any element and the entire fractal collapses.</comment>
