<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Julian’s interiority—cataloguing light refraction, calculating 37 Hz—shows a consistent, character-specific mind; the closing renunciation of “salvage history” feels earned because every beat has been filtered through his analytic gaze and grief-tempered friendship with Death. The only minor slip is that Death’s on-page presence is more atmospheric than pressure-bearing, so the crucible effect is slightly muted.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Julian surfaces having chosen transfer, not salvage, and the cost—leaving the globe’s copper ghost below—is explicit. The causal spine (Earhart funding → Demeter dive → globe resonance → letting go) holds; the single 1939–present time-cut is legible, and orientation is anchored by 120 words via depth, rebreather, tilted shelves.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The salt-illuminated manuscripts, pressure-resistant glass, and 37 Hz pendulum are not ornamental; each constrains Julian’s tactile choices and charges the final image of “snow settling with analytic grace.” Micro-setting (snow-globe interior) literally houses the stakes, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“will Julian extract or release the last transmission?”—tightens once when he adjusts the globe to heart-stop frequency and consciously leaves it behind; the external pressure of crushing depth mirrors internal relinquishment, so cost is legible. No reversal overload; one meaningful trade-off suffices for 600–800 words.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of surrender as measurable physics emerges from the specific math of buoyancy, frequency, and the captain’s “anchors” metaphor; no tidy moral is stated. The reprise of “slow-settling snow” reweights earlier cataloguing into quiet acceptance, achieving resonance without abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyric-analytic diction (“elegiac library,” “specific gravity of grief”) stays inside Julian’s observational lexicon; rhythmic control accelerates during the 37 Hz calibration then softens for the ascent. No head-hop or register drift; compression like “Death had taught him every ending possessed a physics” is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Sentences perform double duty—“light refracted through salt-preserved portholes to illuminate floating spines”—propelling both image and goal. One minor scaffold loop (“the way...the way...”) appears mid-piece but does not touch the closure beat; figurative vehicles cohere around pressure/resonance.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The snow-globe black-box and “frequency of the human heart slowing” fuse maritime ghost-story with hard science; the synthesis feels inevitable rather than gimmicky. Risky deep-sea library concept commits fully and pays off via exact harmonic mechanics, transcending familiar lost-wreck tropes.</comment>
