<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mara’s claustrophobia and need for sky-silence are palpable; every beat of the trellis walk is a micro-choice against her father’s bunker-world. The porcelain doll as stillness-vessel externalizes the conflict without turning the character into a label. The closing ear-press shows earned, costly endurance: she keeps the hush, but must descend back into steel. Interiority stays concrete—“her lungs expand in ways the bunker never allowed”—never drifting into diagnostic speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Accumulative/textural lens: each silence-collecting step adds density until the gilded hush fills the doll and the inversion hour snaps. Closure is a Charged Poise: the hatch closes, gravity re-asserts, the held silence becomes ballast—“a second heart” pressed to her ribs—reconfiguring both bunker life and future sky-theft. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 3; no debt. The inversion rule stays consistent; no late cheats.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The xenial trellis is not backdrop but tactical terrain: planks sway, beams creak farewell, flowers root only during the reprieve—every botanical detail pressures Maras’s sixty-minute theft. Body-as-setting is equally acute: her sternum receives the intangible weight, her ribs house the new silence. The ozone taste and inverse rain are sensory signals that the world rule is tightening, not decorative. Final image—porcelain pressed to ear—re-uses the micro-setting of the doll as charged landscape.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“harvest the gilded hush before the sky slams shut”—is signaled in paragraph 4 and tightens every minute. Escalation is accumulative: each metallic/ozone silence captured increases the cargo in the doll, making the final sprint riskier. The hourglass of inversion supplies the visible price: linger = irreversible ascent. Agency stays hers: she chooses to trap the maternal breath and accepts the ballast cost when gravity flips.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the inversion trope turned inward: safety can be a coffin, brevity can be fertile, silence can be seed. The gilded hush is never abstracted into “motherly love”; it is tasted as honey-dust and carried as ceramic weight. Final ear-press offers a non-literal answer: liberation is portable but pocket-sized, smuggled back into the bunker. No closing sermon, only the charged image of a daughter listening to her mother’s stillness inside a doll.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric-scientific: “flowers chose to sprout by limiting exposure to the crushing weight of normal physics” marries botany and philosophy in one breath. Perceptual signature is consistent—Mara thinks in pressures, tastes, densities, never psychotherapy clichés. Rhythmic control peaks under stress: “The silence tasted of honey and dust… only the gilded remains” compresses grief into gustatory data. No POV slippage; no filter-verb clutter.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Sentences do double duty: “She too must endure by limiting exposure” simultaneously states theme and foreshadows closure. Mixed-metaphor vigilance: “intangibly tangible” is repeated deliberately, taught early, paid off when the hush settles in sternum. No scaffold loops; only one near-paraphrase (“stretching contracted rhythm” used twice) but it functions as motif beat, not churn. Final third is artifact-free, letting the porcelain-ear image land clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Inverts standard gravity-trope into emotional smuggling; no prior inversion story hinges on harvesting silence as seed. Micro-botany of hour-only flowers feels inevitable yet fresh. Risk: lyric repetition of “stretching contracted” could read mannered, but here it threads physics to pulse. Concept commits fully—no safety exit; the bunker still waits below. Specificity of “gilded hush” as maternal last-breath silence could only belong to this piece.</comment>
