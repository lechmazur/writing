<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interiority is textured and embodied (“the ice had shifted inside her”), but the final beat of release is declared rather than dramatized through a visible choice; the appointment still waits in the pocket with no overt act to counter or embrace it, so the cost feels inferred, not paid on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the protagonist’s stance toward her own ending is reweighted by the parasol’s warmth and the heard exhalation, with conceptual cost legible under the Accumulative lens; drive pattern holds, and the single transition from marina to interior shift is legible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Drift-ice marina constrains movement and supplies the resonant sound of release; the parasol tip micro-setting functions as tactile lineage that charges the final image; spatial anchors arrive by ~90 words, satisfying orientation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—the scheduled death appointment—tightens once through the parasol’s warmth and the child-shoe moment; the fold in patience opens, narrowing options from rigid tourist resolve to airy grace, with visible conceptual cost under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of release versus control emerges through the parasol’s lineage and the soft exhalation; final image of broken things made beautiful reweights prior wreckage without moralizing, achieving earned resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is distinct—“sky gripped reality loosely”—with rhythmic control that modulates under pressure; no head-hopping; lyric elision is taught early and paid off in the singing ice cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>High information density, varied sentence rhythm, no loops or scaffold; figurative language is selective and patterned, never overtaking urgency; final line breathes cleanly without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Euthanasia tourist + lace parasol + disaster relief yields fresh synthesis; parasol tip transforms from quaint relic to continuity talisman; risk-taking in lyric accumulative structure heightens meaning without obscuring clarity.</comment>
