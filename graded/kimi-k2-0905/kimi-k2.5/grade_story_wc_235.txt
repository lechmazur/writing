<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elias’s interior contradiction—envying his own past certainties while chronicling chaos—drives every beat; the jealous-as-wing epiphany is earned because the scroll has already served as tactile anchor and the stance reversal costs him his last illusion of linear control. Emotion is embodied (trembling fingers, lungs bitten by air) rather than labeled, and the final smile carries the visible price of accepting perpetual recursion. No secondary character appears, so status tests are N/A; the single-POV crucible holds.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: Elias lands on the porch having traded chronological certainty for narrative detachment, the cost legible in the “gentleness of a snowflake” touchdown that concedes fragility. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each spiral of memory increases density until jealousy detonates into flight, a pattern taught early and paid off in the final image. One transition (cabin → air → cabin) is legible; no orientation debt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mountain cabin, birch scroll, and night wind are not backdrop but equipment: the scroll’s grain mirrors his palm, the wind carries decades of scent, the cabin walls press physically to trigger lift-off. Spatial choreography is flawless—porch boards, valley grave, constellated life-tapestry tracked from above. Micro-setting (scroll) constrains the final choice: only when the charcoal stops can he ascend. Environment charges the closing image without symbolic overreach.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will he surrender to fragmentation or distill it into story—tightens when jealousy converts from passive resentment to active lift fuel. One meaningful deepening suffices: the grave’s date forecloses future escape, forcing the aerial reframe. Cost is visible: relinquishment of sequential identity. Accumulative escalation under the chosen lens; no false reversals.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges obliquely: narrative distance as the only immortality available once death is foreknown. The scroll’s reprise—closed, clutched, reopened—reweights the motif from archive to parachute, letting jaded wonder replace terror without moralizing. Ambiguity remains: tomorrow he may envy today’s self. No thesis stated; resonance arises from tactile particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Lucid-dream chronicler diction permeates syntax—recursive clauses, hyphenated time-images, tactile ink verbs—yet stays restrained under pressure. No head-hop; psychic distance compresses credibly during flight. Pattern-taught elision (“feral nostalgia that clawed…”) pays off in final domesticated-wolf image. Voice is irreplaceable: swap lexicon and the altitude metaphor collapses.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with altitude—long ascending clauses in flight, staccato landings on porch. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or pressure. Figurative density is high but patterned (jealousy → heat → balloon → wings) so it teaches its own physics. One mixed metaphor risk—“rotated prematurely” beside “amber” preservation—only hairline.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Combines time-loop trope with dream-chronicler profession and jealousy-as-propulsion: a synthesis that feels inevitable yet unseen. Grave-site visit as inciting ascent rather than dread-point is fresh; scroll-as-anchor-and-wing reconfigures familiar object. Risky second-person flirtation (“you might be the past self someone envied”) lands cleanly inside accrued voice. Specificity throughout prevents template drift.</comment>
