<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Grief, guilt, and scientific perception braid convincingly; the micro-choice to lift and offer the chrysalis crystallizes her shift. Interiority stays concrete—foam = polymer chains—yet the final “I hear it now” drifts toward tidy epiphany rather than embodied contradiction. Earned cost is felt, but emotional cadence softens a hair too soon.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: river foam, monarch shell, and musical motifs layer until a single cadence shift (“I hear it now”) reweights grief into memory. Orientation is anchored by word 60; causal logic is loosened but coherent under lyric accumulation. Closure lands as Charged Poise with clear conceptual cost—she departs to synthesize a forgiving polymer—so the non-closure accumulation cap is waived.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Canyon geography is sensually precise and filtered through chemist perception; schist, surface tension, and braided channels all constrain her metaphors and final design insight. The chrysalis acts as micro-setting that charges closure. No spatial drift; every tactile detail serves the thematic braid.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—loosen grief’s choke—tightens when foam patterns echo Maya’s scherzo, forcing Elena to reinterpret separation as necessary counterpoint. Pressure escalates via accretion, not reversal; one meaningful intensification occurs when the chrysalis proves “completion, not absence.” Cost is legible: she leaves the shell to the current and commits to a polymer of forgiveness.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges inductively from polymer science, music theory, and river hydrology; no explicit thesis. Final image reprices the core equation—divergence = connection—without moralizing. Subtext in foam-to-symphony mapping sustains ambiguity yet feels inevitable.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Elena’s sensory ratios; syntax flexes into longer polymer-suggestive chains then shortens under emotional pressure. No head-hop; diction is scientist-precise yet lyric. Dialogue absent by design—voice coherence remains pristine.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Varied sentence rhythm mirrors braided currents; metaphor density is high but pattern-taught early and paid off. No paraphrase loops or filter-verb stacks. Minor elevated register (“conceptual ghost”) is earned by POV. Clean mechanics, zero typos.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Synthesis of materials science, music composition, and riparian morphology feels fresh and specific to Elena. Risky lyric structure holds under accumulative lens; transformation beats could not transplant to another setting without collapsing. No trope recycling.</comment>
