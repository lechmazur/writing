<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is concrete and embodied—“pulse flutter with dreamlike apprehension,” fingers vibrating “like a trapped bee.” Her contradictory impulses (whimsy vs. diagnostic urgency) coexist in-scene, and the final chalk mark on the wall is an earned micro-choice with felt cost. No secondary character appears, so status bullets are waived; her socially perceptive read of the lonely grotto is dramatized, not labeled. The only micro-drag is a faint therapeutic tinge (“architecture of doubt”) but it is quickly grounded in tactile sand and chalk.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens held throughout: each sensory accretion (chalk dust, tile heat, sand spiral) reweights the stake until the silence crystallizes. Closure is a Charged Poise: the tile crumbles, the grotto exhales, and Mara’s breathing synchronizes with the new pattern—cost is the irretrievable dust of both tile and mandala. No orientation debt; who/where/when anchored by line 3. No causal gaps; every escalation is a density shift rather than a plot twist, fitting the lyric design.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The grotto, tile, mist, and chalk stubs function as micro-settings that constrain movement and tools. The tile’s rising temperature literally burns Mara’s palm, forcing the interjection beat; the mist presses eardrums, narrowing perception to the acoustic crisis. Final image: chalk trace on limestone—setting becomes page, pattern becomes cure. Spatial choreography is flawless; no impossible positions or floating props.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“heal the grotto’s babel before erasure completes”—is signaled early. Escalation is accumulative: each sensory layer (violet dust, ceramic heat, sand alignment) intensifies the acoustic pressure until the spiral disruption tightens options. Cost is the destroyed mandala and pulverized tile; forfeiture is visible on the page. No external antagonist needed; the conflict is situational pressure translated into sensory density.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges as pattern vs. noise: communication is not the absence but the reordering of static. The tile’s stored centuries, the mandala’s grammar, and the grotto’s parabolic curve all echo this without exposition. Final image reweights earlier motifs: the lilac unease becomes amethyst understanding—conceptual repricing with undeniable tonal cost. No sermon, only resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person intimate POV remains stable; no head-hop. Perceptual signature is whimsical yet diagnostic—“questions she had forgotten how to ask,” “geometry of forgotten names.” Syntax coils like the mist: long sentences for diffusion, abrupt fragments for turns (“She knelt”). No dialogue, so voice distinctness is judged by narrative texture alone, which is sustained. Filter verbs are sparse and voice-motivated.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence either advances image or intensifies texture. Figurative language is patterned early (“mist coiled like questions”) and paid off at closure. No register drift; diction stays within Mara’s plausible lexicon of shapes and sound. High information density—one sentence often carries color, tactile data, and metaphor without crowding.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The “whispering grotto infected by chaotic static” is a fresh acoustic inversion of the classic healing quest. Sand mandala as diagnostic instrument is specific and non-obvious. Lilac as both color and affective state is a risky synesthetic choice that pays off in the final taste of amethyst. Slight overlap with “artist heals broken architecture” trope keeps it just under the 9+ gate, but the acoustic spin feels memorable.</comment>
