<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Mara’s shift from leash-bound anxiety to self-carried courage is embodied in the final refusal to re-clip Atlas; prior micro-choices (hand to star punch, carrying the dog) earn the renunciation. Interiority stays concrete—trembling fingers, warm sternum—avoiding diagnostic labels. Flaw functions: the leash is simultaneously safety tether and cage, a clean contradiction. Missing secondary pressure keeps it from 9-band.</question>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the star stamp on skin becomes a visible covenant whose warmth pulses cost—“she did not reach for the broken leash.” Accumulative/Textural lens holds: fog, lullaby, and stamp accrue until the dawn image reweights meaning. One transition (shore → ridgeway) is legible; orientation anchors within 120 words. No causal break; steady tightening via doubling path and stamp ritual.</question>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Veiled ridgeway, tide pools, driftwood archways, and bioluminescent grotto are filtered through Mara’s narrowed threat-attention; each feature either impedes or enables the traverse. The star stamp tool literally marks skin and final image, satisfying micro-setting gate. Sensory hierarchy favors touch and temperature over visual catalog. Spatial choreography stays coherent—guides front/back, dog curled at end.</question>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“find the woman she had been before anxiety caged her”—is signaled early and tightened when the leash is refused at climax. Agency manifests in the choice to carry Atlas unclipped; cost is the irreversible surrender of the safety tether. Escalation is textural: fog thickens, path doubles back, stamp burns, each increment reweighting fear toward self-trust. No external coincidence resolves the conflict.</question>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme—courage as continuance inside fear—emerges through image pattern (shoreline lullaby, star light, rising dawn) rather than statement. Final image of walking into “waiting light” reconfigures earlier twilight vigil without moralizing. Subtextual irony: the broken leash, meant to protect, had been the true cage. Ambiguity lingers: sunrise promises no permanent cure, only the next step.</question>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays tightly adhered to Mara’s perceptual filter—salt-wood voice, fog at ankles, stamp warmth. Rhythm swells and contracts with ascent/descent, mirroring breath. No head-hop; guides remain opaque, voiced only in whispered aphorism that feels tidal, not human. Diction stays within her embodied lexicon; no register drift.</question>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm varies from long fog-woven clauses to short declaratives at peak beats (“She moved…”). Figurative language is selective—constellations rotating in silver teeth—never clotted. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or decision. Minor scaffold: “shoreline lullaby” repeated three times; pattern taught early and pays off in fading hush, so no deduction.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Ferry guides coated in seaweed and wielding astral ticket punches transform familiar quest-mentor trope into something salt-ancient and dream-coastal. The inverse quest—losing the dog to find the self—flips “service animal” expectation. Indirect-route geography feels invented yet internally consistent, not gimmick. Risk taken in lyric accumulative structure heightens resonance without obscuring closure.</comment>
