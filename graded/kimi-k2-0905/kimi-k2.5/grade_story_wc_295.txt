<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elara’s grief-propelled quest is concrete; her micro-choice to press the telegram to the dome crystallizes a believable renunciation. Yet the interiority leans on abstract labels (“weight of human sorrow”) rather than moment-to-moment contradiction. The shift from lone scholar to communal dream-sharer is legible but the cost feels intellectual, not visceral.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: “we survive… by sharing them” reweights the premise with social cost. The accumulative lens (pattern of grief → star pulse → inscription) holds; one tightening beat at the telegram gesture suffices. Orientation anchored by word 90; no causality breaks; meets mosaic shard count but transitions remain fluid under the lyric drive.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Observatory dome, brass eyepiece, and telegram petals are tactile, cold, fragile—selective sensory triad that mirrors interior thaw. Micro-setting (telegram against glass) directly charges the final image, satisfying 9+ gate. Spatial choreography stays clean; time-of-night cues track with stellar cycle.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—decode inscription to heal grief—signaled in paragraph one. Pressure deepens via pattern recognition: each star-pulse = syllable tightens options from academic puzzle to communal confession. No reversal, but the cadence shift at “she began to write” forecloses solitary path with visible cost: her private archive becomes public lullaby.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges inductively from star ledger → shared grief without moralizing. Final lullaby image reconfigures prior data into communal ritual; ambiguity remains whether comfort erases or merely distributes sorrow. Avoids thematic echo; no late thesis statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Elara’s perceptual filter—brass chill, daylily fragility—without head-hop. Syntax lengthens under wonder, shortens at “she began to write,” mirroring pulse. Diction keeps within her scholarly lexicon; no register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythm modulates naturally; metaphors (star pulses as syllables) cohere without stack-up. One scaffold loop: “she wrote of…” trio is purposeful litany, not artifact. Information density high; no mixed vehicles. Final third clean, permitting 9-band elsewhere.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fusion of variable-star astrophysics with lucid-dream archive feels non-obvious; grief-to-pulse encoding reframes Cepheids as emotional Morse. Temple-as-process rather than place reweights existing trope. Risk in lyric accumulative structure pays off; transformation survives name-swap test.</comment>
