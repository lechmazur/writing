<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Marcus’s contradictory impulses—meticulous appraisal vs. mercy-driven falsification—play out in one continuous beat; the “confidently uncertain” lie costs him professional integrity on the page. Interiority stays concrete, rooted in tactile memory of rigging amps and the metallic ghost of applause. Micro-choice at climax (authenticating the fake) crystallizes hierarchy of values: mercy > accuracy, with visible cost to credibility. Flaw complicates choice without tidy redemption; voice remains specific to ex-roadie turned appraiser.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Marcus affirms the fake, irreversibly foreclosing his hard-won credibility; cost is legible in the boy’s exhale and Marcus’s own recognition of lifelong echo. Causal lens holds—because he failed publicly, because the cloth revives unbearable memory, therefore he chooses mercy, narrowing future options. Orientation clear by 80 words; no teleporting props. One minor loop: “failure had come last Tuesday” repeats essence of prior sentence; doesn’t touch climax.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Quarry trailer’s asbestos tiles and corrugated metal whistle constrain Marcus’s isolation and acoustically mirror the ringing silence of post-applause life. Speaker cloth functions as micro-setting, its tweed weave filtering memory and decision. Spatial choreography clean: boy enters, cloth passes back, no ghost limbs. Environment narrows perception—wind swallows sound like limestone—charging final image where trailer stands “vast and reverberant,” reweighting the stake.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—professional credibility vs. compassionate mercy—tightens once when Marcus utters “It’s genuine,” trading future appraisals for the kid’s relief. Pressure grows under causal lens: each factual recitation raises the cost of lying. No reversals needed; one decisive tightening suffices. Cost visible in Marcus’s chest-ache and the echo he accepts as permanent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges without dictation: value is resonance, not verification. Subtext carried in cloth’s silent vibration and quarry’s limestone swallowing sound—commodity vs. memory. Final image reweights premise: authentication abandoned, witness chosen. No moralising; ambiguity lingers whether mercy justifies professional suicide.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Marcus’s perceptual signature—metallic ghost, amp-rigging diction, wheat-weave loupe. Syntax lengthens under reflection, compresses at climax: “It’s genuine.” No head-hopping; boy’s desperation shown through Marcus’s reading of exhale. Dialogue minimal, indirection strong: “Is it real?” carries tuition, medical bills, hope.</comment>

<comment>Rhythm mirrors subject: long reflective sentences swell like feedback, then cut to clipped appraisal specs. Figurative language sparse, purposeful—no mixed metaphors. One paraphrase loop noted above; otherwise zero scaffold. High information density: “OEM Fender-style wheat weave” does character, world, and plot work in five words.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Ex-roadie turned antiques expert evaluating speaker cloth in a quarry trailer offers fresh intersection of music myth and post-failure purpose. Transformation test fails if swapped to generic antiques dealer—roadie memories drive resonance. Wall-of-Sound relic + limestone echo create non-obvious acoustic metaphor for unverifiable past. Risk taken: quiet falsification instead of redemption, avoiding feel-good arc.</comment>
