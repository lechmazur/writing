<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—linguist forced to unlearn language to navigate the mountain—drives every micro-choice; the diary-hand-off renegotiation shows visible cost. The single caveat: the “acceptance over intervention” shift is articulated more than embodied in final beat, keeping her just shy of 9.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a crisp Conceptual Repricing: the mountain rewrites its own rules as Elara trades the diary’s floral cipher for the chrononaut’s release; the staircase descent crystallizes before/after with conceptual cost. Accumulative lens holds throughout—each semantic gap she fills reweights what “library” means—and the ending image locks the reconfiguration on-page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Crystalline shelves, fossilized manuscripts, and lichen compass lines are filtered through Elara’s linguistic sensorium; every environmental cue doubles as navigation code. The setting actively withholds and then yields the staircase once the diary is decrypted, satisfying the 9+ constraint that environment constrain final tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Stakes tighten from “find the vault” to “re-price knowledge itself”; the middle beat—realising fungi map ventilation—narrows options under the Accumulative lens. Cost is legible: her prior expertise devalues, payment extracted in fluent silence rather than blood, but the price still registers as felt forfeiture.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Theme of preservation-through-loss emerges from the floral negatives and the final crystallized-error garden; no character moralizes it. The unheard symphony image reweights all prior silence, offering resonant ambiguity: humanity learns by listening to what it chose to forget.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person lingers inside Elara’s polyglot perception without head-hop; diction warps syntactically when pressure rises (“semantic voids where translation failed and meaning pooled”). The patterned elision of causal connectors is taught by the second sentence and paid off in the conditional-tense doors, keeping lyric compression legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>High information density—one sentence often maps botanical cipher onto spatial direction—while rhythm modulates from long cascading clauses to staccato stair-step fragments. Only a single mixed metaphor (“water in stone basins” beside amber light) nicks the peak beat, preventing 9+.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade>
<comment>Florally encoded topography, conceptual ransom of a time traveler, and library-as-garden-of-errors synthesize into an angle I haven’t seen; risk is maximal yet causally coherent. The speculative premise could not survive replacement of any core metaphor without collapse, meeting inevitability-in-hindsight test.</comment>
