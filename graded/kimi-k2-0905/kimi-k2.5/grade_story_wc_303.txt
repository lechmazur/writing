<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is palpable: the jasmine contact makes her jerk back, the coffee stains bloom like “dark continents,” her hierarchy of values—truth vs. safety—gets dramatized in the trembling lift of the violin. Contradictory impulses (melt it / keep it) coil inside every beat; the final renunciation is earned because we have felt the cold bite and the “mulberry ache” long before she sings the perforating note.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/lyric lens holds: each image (ice, coffee, roots) layers density until the final cadence when the violin dissolves and meaning re-weights. The decisive change—the instrument’s physical loss but mnemonic survival—lands with visible cost: her “particular sorrow of mulberry stain” is the lingering price. Pattern taught early (coffee prophecy) pays off in closure without causality break.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The velvet observatory’s greenhouse heat literally melts the artifact, forcing her choice; the jasmine and oak roots are not backdrop but co-agents that transmit the monk’s song. Micro-setting (the violin itself) constrains every move: its cold bite, its weeping strings, its disappearance into xylem. Spatial choreography stays clean—no floating props—as she lifts, sings, and relinquishes.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.1</question><comment>Dominant stake—truth vs. imperial lie—tightens once: the rising temperature breaches the ice’s threshold, collapsing her options to two legible paths. Escalation is driven by her agency: she opens the case, sings the perforating note, forecloses safety. Cost is unmistakable—career, funding, the instrument itself—paid on the page as “the particular sorrow of mulberry stain.”</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: archives lie, but lignin remembers. The final image—every future tree humming the forbidden melody—reconfigures the meaning of both “provenance” and “empire.” Subtext lives in gesture (ivy tapping Morse) and silence (empty case). No moralizing; resonance is visceral, bittersweet, alive.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is distinct: synesthetic botanic terror (“sharp, green, photosynthetic terror”), scientific eye (“fissures in the transparent violin”), and lyric compression (“patience of melting time”) coexist without register drift. Rhythm modulates—long breathless sentences under heat, then the single crystalline note that “vibrated in her teeth.” No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens with temperature.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Information-dense lines: “water carrying dissolved crystals into the soil… archiving the dissent in woody tissue” does three jobs—image, stakes, closure setup. One mixed metaphor (“dark continents bleeding”) is minor and doesn’t touch closure. Zero loops or scaffold; sentences vary opening and length. Read-aloud rhythm accelerates into the final note, then falls into the hush of “bittersweet and alive.”</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade>
<comment>Fusion of botanic telepathy, coffee-ground prophecy, and ice violin is non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. The monk’s breath frozen into music propagates via mycorrhizal internet—fresh synthesis of climate gothic and biotech resistance. Risky lyric compression is sustained without clarity loss; the empire’s archival violence is subverted by living xylem. Specificity makes the concept stick: “ring-patterns of trees… humming the monk’s forbidden melody.”</comment>
