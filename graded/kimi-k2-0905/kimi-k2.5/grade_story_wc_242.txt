<question>1</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is evocative—"teach endings how to begin"—but she never risks a micro-choice that could fail; every call ends in the same calibrated hang-up, so no visible cost or contradiction sticks to her. The absence of a beat where she nearly keeps a caller flattens pressure and makes her philosophy feel pre-proved rather than tested.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The mosaic of wrong-number vignettes creates an accumulative pattern that lands in a resonant reconfiguration: the city’s loneliness exhaled but never attached. Closure is legible, yet because each call resolves by identical severance, the tightening is felt only as conceptual, not as a lost option for Mara herself; the cost is off-loaded onto unseen callers.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The tunnel, rotary phone, and glass disc are tactile, sound-rich, and filter every beat; water drips sync with disc rotation, making the booth itself a throat that meters the metropolis’s grief. The disc’s cracked skip literally inserts the flaw that shapes the music, charging the final image with lived-in specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Stake is thematic—prove estrangement as garden—not personal; no beat narrows Mara’s options or risks her solitude. Pattern repeats rather than escalates, so pressure is atmospheric, not causal; the cost is vicarious, never felt as forfeiture on her side of the line.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through iterative severance: goodbye as hello’s architecture. The refusal of attachment becomes an anti-redemption arc that feels fresh and ethically uncomfortable; the final image of the metropolis exhaling loneliness reweights earlier calls without moralising.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person lyric maintains a spectral, glass-toned cadence that modulates with lamp-flicker transitions; diction stays within the lexicon of harmonics and rails. No head-hop; perceptual signature is consistent, and the experimental compression is taught by the second sentence and paid off in the last.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Sentences do more than one job—"the booth stood beneath the third rail’s corpse" marries setting, danger, and metaphor in one stroke. Occasional loft—“cultivated estrangement,” “architecture of hello”—verges on aphorism but stays patterned enough to feel voice-driven rather than overwritten.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The wrong-number afterlife switchboard is an original synthesis; the glass harmonica disc as looping graveyard of voices gives the concept sensory flesh. Risk is high—static as intimacy—but the execution keeps the conceit from collapsing into gimmickry.</comment>
