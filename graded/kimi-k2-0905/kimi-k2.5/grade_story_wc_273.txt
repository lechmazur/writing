<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Single-POV immersion is total: pink eyes, “serene anger,” the vial warmed against ribs—interiority stays corporeal and conflicted.  No second character means no status crucible, but the self under pressure is sharply drawn.  The final dispersal is an earned renunciation seeded by seventeen-year obsession; cost is the body itself.  Diagnostic label “consciously wild” is the only self-tag, but it is quickly re-embodied in slowed muscle and evaporating flesh, so the slip is minor.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: eclipse→ink→fractal→dissolution tightens through density, not causal plot.  Anchors clear by line 3; orientation test waived because spatial vagueness (where in desert?) pays off in dissolution.  Closure = Charged Poise: tracker gone, drone left holding memory—undeniable conceptual cost.  One scaffold (“the wind howls…”) repeats near end but does not dull the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sandstone ribs, tearing-silk wings, mercury ink—each sense is selective and POV-filtered.  Wind-carved grooves physically guide airstreams that lift the drone and ink, so setting constrains the climax.  Micro-setting (body-heat vial, stone that refuses absorption) carries final image.  No occupational realism required—physics breach is explicitly temporal magic.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Single stake: understand why time dilates in crisis.  Middle beat—ink pools instead of soaking—materializes the question into visible anomaly, tightening pressure.  Agency: he uncorks, then surrenders; cost is corporeal dissolution, foreclosing return.  Escalation is density/awe rather than antagonist, appropriate to Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme—time’s mercy to the fully attentive—emerges only in the vanishing; never preached.  Disappearing ink as mutable fate reweights from “tool” to “salvation” without moral.  Final line leaves reader inside the stretched moment, invited not instructed.  No thematic echo sentences; drone’s stillness is silent coda.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person hovers at elastic psychic distance—inside tendon-slowness, outside at vapor.  Syntax lengthens then fragments to mimic dilation: “He breathes slowly…cultivating…”—controlled cadence.  No dialogue to distort; prose itself is character-specific flute-of-time.  One glitch: “consciously wild” is the only canned phrase, but it is immediately enfleshed.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm ripples without algorithm; sentence openings vary.  High density—each clause adds sensory or causal layer.  No filter-verb stacks, no mixed metaphors; “tearing silk” and “warm taffy” coexist in separate beats.  Minor paraphrase loop “after the eclipse ends” used as deliberate anaphora framing dissolve—acceptable pattern.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Combines quantum-temporal theory, nomad ink, albino tracker—fresh synthesis.  Dissolution-into-moment reverses standard sci-fi time-dilation tropes.  Risk of zero dialogue and plotless awe succeeds because texture itself becomes stakes.  Final wind-drone image feels inevitable yet uncitable—no prior echo in mainstream fiction.</comment>
