<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Interiority is lyrically dense yet remains anchored to embodied action—tr fingers the sundial while grief and wonder coexist without therapeutic gloss. Micro-choices (spiral walk, bone-by-bone search, kneel in shadow) externalize the “warmly curious” trait and foreclose the option of leaving the valley unchanged. The final prayer emerges causally from tactile discoveries, so renunciation of exile is earned with visible cost. Flaw: late paragraph emotional summary (“genuine prayer move through her”) drifts toward label-speak, clipping full 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds from first sensory image to final charged poise: each artifact adds density until the rebuilt sundial re-weights exile/return as lived time. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—shadow touching root shows cost of severed generations without exposition. Causality remains interior yet legible: because she wanders the grid, she finds each gnomon shard; because she rebuilds, the shadow reconnects lineages. Orientation is taught by word 70 (“valley’s air”), well inside 120-word waiver.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Catacomb orchard is not backdrop but navigational puzzle—roots block footfalls, bones dictate spiral path, calcium-fed fruit perfumes air, all filtering through Elara’s tactile exile memory. Granite sundial retains centuries-old heat, a micro-setting object that constrains final alignment and literally casts the closing image. Spatial choreography is immaculate: lantern, root, femur, pedestal track cleanly across every move. Environment forces her slow gait and thus the accretion of found fragments—setting shapes tactics and charges closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore severed ancestral continuity—signaled in paragraph two and tightens each time she unearths another fragment of diaspora debris. Mid-story deepening occurs when she realizes the trees are literal time-markers; this re-prices her goal from personal closure to collective re-inscription. No external antagonist needed: pressure is accretive loss made palpable. Cost is visible in the closing shadow that stretches across great-grandmother’s root, foreclosing further wandering and sealing her commitment to stay.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of interrupted journeys emerges from calcium-to-apple transmutation rather than authorial thesis; each unearthed relic quietly asks who completes a voyage the dead could not. Final image reweights earlier “lost faith” trope into embodied practice—time measured only between exile and return—delivering conceptual cost without moralizing. Subtext operates in silence: unharvested fruit implies future generations may yet taste continuity. Complexity remains: valley is both invitation and warning, refusing tidy redemption.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person lyric remains tightly focalized through Elara’s perceptual filters—“pale, sweet fruit that no one harvested” reads as her judgment, not exposition. Rhythmic control mirrors act: long, root-like sentences for excavation, then crisp clause at sundial completion. Filter verbs appear sparingly and only when voice-motivated (“she felt her heart shift”). No head-hopping; diction never exceeds her plausible lexicon. Minor slip: one “architecture of bone and branch” leans toward oratory cadence, trimming 0.3.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Every sentence performs double duty—sensory anchor plus thematic nudge—while avoiding metaphor pile-up. No loops, paraphrase, or scaffold; nouns concrete (“razor-wire borders,” “brass compass”), verbs kinetic (“snake,” “drink up”). Rhythm modulates with discovery urgency; no monotony even in catalogue of relics. Clause order stays sequential, eliminating simultaneity errors. Line-level craft sustains clarity through peak closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Combines diaspora return, ossuary orchard, and dysfunctional sundial into fresh constellation that feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk of lush gothic excess is balanced by grounded archeological procedure, preventing gimmickry. Specificity—“water-stained merchant’s ledger,” “compass rusted perpetually pointing toward a border that no longer existed”—guards against generic exile trope. Conceptual integrity holds: the piece commits fully to bones-as-timekeepers rule without late cheat.</comment>
