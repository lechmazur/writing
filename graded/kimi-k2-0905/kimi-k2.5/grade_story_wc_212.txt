<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is lush and continuous—her sensory memory of grand-mother, the burn of patience under bark, the spiral staircase decision—yet the “furiously tranquil” trait is declared more than dramatized; we watch composure but not the war inside it. A single contradiction under pressure would push her to 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the up-flowing fountain re-prices the covenant with undeniable conceptual cost—she is now perpetual entropy-debt servant. Causal chain (cap → vortex → staircase → stay) holds without teleport; orientation clear by line 4 and lens (Accumulative/Textural) taught by fractal breath pattern, held to last image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Icebound glass, starlight indexing time, fountain depression mated to acorn cap—every tactile surface constrains the reopening ritual; the upward stream re-charges the micro-setting. Selective chill-to-dew progression mirrors internal thaw, no sensory checklist.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“reopen what time sealed”—tightens once: the vortex descent forces her irreversible descent/pledge. Cost is legible (eternal entropy labour), but escalation is single-pulse; no secondary narrowing.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of borrowed time emerges via lignin reknitting, seed embryos stirring, stars seeming to sprout—no abstract sermon. Final up-flowing fountain reweights all prior frost without naming the lesson, leaving resonant after-image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyric-accumulative voice taught early (“breath crystallizing in fractal patterns”) and sustained; perceptual signature filters every phrase through chlorophyll-memory bias. No head-hop; entropy-decreasing songs keep lexicon within plausible mythic register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>High figurative density but pattern-taught and payoff-clean; zero paraphrase loops, no mixed metaphors. Rhythm breathes with thaw cadence; final upward stream sentence is propulsive capstone.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Vortex-inheritance as non-land legacy, entropy reversal via song, and seed-vault time-borrowing synthesize fresh mythic botany. Risk in physics-defying fountain earns +0.3; slight over-reliance on lyric cosmic imagery keeps it sub-9.</comment>
