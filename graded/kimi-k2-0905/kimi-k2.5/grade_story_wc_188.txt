<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elian’s contradictory impulses—solemn ritual vs. playful caper—are dramatized in the tightening spiral on the tower, body and chant in sync. Interiority remains concrete (“gravity of hopelessness in his knees”), but the siege-despair is abstracted to mercury-pool shorthand, softening cost. The final renunciation—burning the map to reveal territory—earns its beat through prior causal weight, yet the absence of any post-show collapse keeps the price lighter than premium bands demand.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the sky stays empty yet the courtyard glitters with note-shards that children will whistle, undeniable social cost and reconfiguration of siege mentality. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each chant-circle and color pulse layers density until the mosaic’s secret is transmitted through vibration rather than causal blow-by-blow. Orientation is clean by 120 words; no teleporting props; beat sequence spirals inward without retroactive fixes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Setting is filtered through Elian’s pyrotechnic senses—temperature shifts, pollen-iron air—guiding every footfall on the starless tower. The kerosene rag knot functions as micro-setting that constrains final tactics: its burn-rate, color chemistry, and ultimate exhaustion determine when the sky-writing ends. Spatial choreography is tight from courtyard to tower-top; flower-glow and torch-placements track consistently.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“defy the gravity of hopelessness”—is signaled in para 2 and tightened by each luminous footstep that forces defenders’ chins upward. Agency is accumulative: spiral-walking + chant + combustion deepens the pattern rather than pivoting it; still, the final shard-rain materially narrows social possibilities, priced on-page. One meaningful intensification suffices under lyric lens, but a sharper micro-turn could have pushed higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: beauty as insurgent physics against despair. No moralizing—children’s future whistles carry the reweighted meaning. The laughing-fire image crystallizes earlier “serious playfulness,” fusing sacred and ridiculous without abstraction overdose.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited clings to Elian’s pyro-senses; perceptual signature is distinct—“ambient awareness” as synesthetic weather. Chant rhythm permeates syntax without drumbeat monotony; compression (“burning the map to find the territory”) is taught early and paid off. No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens in step with spiral walk.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm modulates with spiral tension; figuratives are selective, not stacked. One paraphrase loop (“filtering…through ambient awareness” twice inside 40 words) and a filter-verb cluster (“could feel…”) slightly dull immediacy at peak. Otherwise high-density, clean grammar, zero scaffold; final ash-hand image is crisp.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Fusing fireworks-craft with siege-recovery through vibrational mosaic is non-obvious and inevitable in hindsight. Trope of artist-healer is re-embodied via chemical color theory and ceramic acoustics. Risky lyric escalation pays off without obscuring stakes; no derivative echoes.</comment>
