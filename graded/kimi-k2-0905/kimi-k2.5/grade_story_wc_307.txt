<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The regressing-body device externalizes an interior contradiction—memory as future, certainty as erasure—that fuels every micro-choice; the final renunciation of answers for questions is earned by the lifetime of withheld ripples. Embodied emotion is precise: softer palms, heavier stone, tooth-ache hum. One flawless detail—“his memories becoming predictions”—compresses the arc into a single, painful pulse. No slips; cost is visceral.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each synesthetic image layers density until the final Charged Poise reweights the premise—he vanishes, but the questions stay, magnetized. Pattern taught in first 120 words; orientation never wavers. Closure line “waiting for the right hands to throw the right stones” crystallizes options and cost without exposition. No causal breaks, no soft resets.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The floating platform, grotto, and river stone function as micro-setting that literally constrains posture, blood iron, and final gesture; spatial choreography is immaculate. Selective sense cascade—starlight like silver milk, hush that smells of autumn—narrows to the stone’s weight in softening palm. World rules (magnetic draw, backward aging) are learned through action, never dumped. Final image requires the platform’s suspension—irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake: will he transmit usable knowledge before he regresses into null? Pressure tightens as each ripple read is also a future unread; the withheld meanings foreclose his last chance to own them. Cost is legible—he chooses absence so the questions can exist—visible in the line “leaving only his questions behind.” One meaningful deepening suffices; no reversal needed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges as the paradox that vanishing is the only durable pedagogy; no character moralizes. The withheld ripples reconfigure meaning at close, proving absence can be generative. Image-system (stone, rings, magnet) keeps particulars anchored; no drift into abstraction. Resonance lingers as conceptual cost: future readers must pay the effort he refused to spare them.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays tight to the researcher’s decaying sensorium; perceptual signature is unmistakable—“green whisper that smelled of autumn and endings that were really beginnings.” Rhythm swells and contracts with trance depth; no filter-verb stacks. No dialogue, so voice carries all; diction never exceeds regressing lexicon. Patterned elision (“sycamore hush”) is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm breathes with trance: long hypnotic coils tighten into staccato perceptual shards. Zero paraphrase loops; each image adds new pressure. One mixed metaphor—“perfect violence” of a pond ripple—is instantly redeemed by physical logic of expanding rings. No artifacts in final third; closure image stays crystal.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>The backward-aging guru who plants questions instead of answers flips the mentor trope into something unsettling and new. Magnetic grotto as classroom, ripple-reading as pedagogy, regression as methodology—synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk is high—quiet lyric ending, no antagonist—but coherence never frays. Specificity throughout (“iron in his blood anchoring his spirit”) prevents abstraction.</comment>
