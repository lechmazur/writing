<comment>Elara’s insomnia and painter-identity drive every beat: it explains her night vigil, her compulsive sketch at the end, and her willingness to trade months of food for art’s raw material. The contradictory hunger for both stasis (amber) and witness (journals) is dramatized in the physical exchange, not summarized. Only minor erosion: Maren’s function is expositional foil rather than pressure source, keeping relationship-as-crucible light. Still, the final micro-choice—sketching the sinkhole from memory—pays the insomnia/painter thread with visible cost: sleepless clarity weaponized into record.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands cleanly: the amber leaves her possession, the journals enter, and her insomnia is re-priced from curse to vigil—an earned conceptual reframe signaled in the last two sentences. Causality is causal-lite but sound: because she cannot sleep she seeks preserved witness; the exchange therefore gives her a new artifact to witness with; consequently she sketches. Orientation is anchored by line 3 (who, where, when), no penalty. One transition (isle to sinkhole) is legible via rain-trail syntax. No lens ambiguity; the inferred lens is Causal, held to final image.</comment>

<comment>Setting detail is selective and POV-filtered: salt-eaten canvases, granite spine, temporary rivers as grammar—all steer her descent toward the sinkhole. The tidal clock is more than backdrop; it times the causeway and the coming re-burial, tightening the exchange urgency. Micro-setting (body, brooch, tube) is handled in motion. A single over-rich phrase (“prehistoric wings”) drifts toward purple but does not occlude action. Environment meets the 9+ gate by constraining her path and charging the final sketch.</comment>

<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—thresh meaning before the tide erases it—is declared early and tightened by the sinkhole’s exposure clock. Escalation is modest but sufficient: amber (fossilized memory) traded for journals (human memory) narrows her options from hoarding to sharing witness. Cost is legible: she forfeits three months’ kelp and the brooch’s talismanic comfort. No reversal, yet the final sketch crystallizes a new tactic—creation instead of collection—fulfilling the stake under Causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme of preservation versus erasure emerges through concrete alternation: amber entombs, canvas rots, journals resurface, sketch re-records. Subtext in dialogue (“plant it where the tide can’t reach”) quietly argues that selective burial may be necessary for future meaning. Final image reframes insomnia as guard duty without moralizing. Line “trying to thresh meaning from experience before the tide returns” is the closest to thematic echo but is diegetic self-mockery, not authorial sermon. Complexity acknowledged; no tidy maxim offered.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Elara’s perceptions, lexicon (“cataloging erosion”), and wry earnest modulation. Syntax mirrors her exhaustion—long sinuous sentences interrupted by terse observations. No head-hopping; Maren’s interior remains opaque. Filter verbs (“she understood”) are minimal and voice-motivated. Rhythm accelerates into the final sketch beat, then snaps to crystalline short clause—“the lesson remained”—fulfilling the perceptual signature requirement.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Line-level craft is dense but breathable: figurative layering (“salt ate her canvases”) is sparse enough to avoid purple clusters. One paraphrase loop (“water gives and the water takes” echoing earlier tide refrain) is purposeful tribal idiom, not scaffold. No mixed metaphors or register drift. Opening and closing lines act as resonant bookends. Minor filter-stack in “she understood now that…” but occurs in reflective beat, not under peak pressure. Closure image remains sharp.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Post-sea-rise barter-for-memory plot is familiar, but execution is particularized: rain-trail navigation, kelp currency, canvas rot from salt backing, wry earnest stance. Amber-brooch-as-time-capsule is not new, yet its planting decision reverses expected hoarding. Insomnia repurposed from affliction to archival method feels fresh in context. Specificity of mentor’s sketchbooks submerged then traded raises personal stakes above generic apocalypse. Risk is present but controlled; no gimmicks obscure clarity.</comment>
