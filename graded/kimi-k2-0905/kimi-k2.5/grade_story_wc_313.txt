<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elias’s guilt-sharpened vigilance is credibly lived-in, but the climactic “spin stories into shared meaning” turn is telegraphed more than dramatized—the interior pivot arrives as a single reflective paragraph rather than a pressured micro-choice visible on the page. The embodied emotion is strong early (gnarled fingers, trembling on the label) yet levels off once he begins gathering photos; contradiction under pressure never re-ignites. Closure is still earned because the satchel load visibly forecloses silence, but the cost feels conceptual rather than viscerally re-enacted in the moment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>A solid Accumulative/Textural arc: drought-expose photos-label-archive. Each new artifact tightens the ethical pressure without external reversals. Closure lands cleanly—archive plan reweights meaning and carries civic cost. However, the causality hinge is internal reflection, not a tested on-page choice; visible price is deferred to future readers, keeping it just shy of 9.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Selective sensory fillets (glossy corner of paper, viscous mud, sapphire peeling label) tether every beat to Elias’s hand and knee. The mirrored hush of reservoir-sky reprises as environmental Charged Poise that charges the final image; the lowered waterline literally determines what objects he can reach, hence constraining choice. Micro-setting (label in palm) satisfies 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—truth vs. oblivion—surfaces with the first photo and deepens as each image contradicts the “precisely humane” myth. Escalation is textural: every revealed artifact adds moral weight rather than narrows external options. The lack of an antagonist or test-of-plan keeps pressure intellectual; cost is civic aftermath, not immediate peril, capping it below 8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without sermon: official history vs. sedimentary memory. The town’s gradual resurrection literalizes erasure, letting silence and silt do the moral math. Final archive image elegantly re-prices “progress,” resisting tidy uplift. A touch of thematic echo (“relocated with minimal disruption”) is woven through objects, not authorial tagline, so earns its weight.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elias’s perceptual filter—“porch wind chime dissolved into stillness,” “clock face stopped at midnight.” Diction is weather-worn, never ventriloquing academic register. Rhythm modulates from languid dusk cadence to shorter clauses as he pockets evidence, mirroring rising conviction. No dialogue, but voice coherence is exemplary.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Strong propulsion: each sentence advances discovery or atmosphere; no paraphrase loops. Metaphors stay physically coherent—mirror hush, bruised sky, sediment settling. Occasional elevated latinate clauses (“archaeological patience,” “conceptual repricing”) nudge slightly above dam-warden vernacular, but the pattern is taught early and consistent, so forgiven at 8+ band.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Drowned-town premise is familiar, but inversion through drought-resurrection and photo-trail detective work feels fresh. Specifics—Blue Hour gin label matching October sky, mayor’s furniture vs. Sarah Chen’s ambulance—tilt the historical heist into intimate morality tale. Risk lies in lyric stillness rather than plot pyrotechnics; it pays off in resonant hush.</comment>
