<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira’s guilt-driven precision is embodied in every tactile motion; the link between repairing the drone and lifting her own guilt is palpable. Blind competence is shown, not told, via the water-basin decoding and steady hands. Internal contradiction—penance versus lingering self-blame—hovers but never crystallizes in a second micro-choice, keeping her shy of the 9 gate.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: crashed drone → need repair → water-reading → vector fixed → ship saved → guilt anchor lifted. Each beat tightens options; the ticking Vespertine horn supplies lived clock. Closure image of dual anchors rising carries clear moral cost under causal lens. No teleporting props or causal gaps.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fog, steam, copper basin, and micro-alloy fractures are filtered through touch and sound, anchoring blind POV. Depot’s iron heartbeat and rain-tapped skylight constrain her method and timing. The hummingbird’s refracted light functions as micro-setting that determines the final vector, charging closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—prevent another reef wreck—signals early and tightens with each horn blast. Middle choice to trust the water-tone north-pulse forfeits fallback time, visible cost on page. Escalation is causal: broken relay → water test → patched wing → launch, each step shrinking margin. No coincidence rescue; pressure stays coherent.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme of transmission—turning broken signals into guidance—emerges through action, not statement. Refraction-as-translation motif accrues meaning: personal guilt refracted into communal rescue. Final image reweights loss into forward motion without moralizing. Quiet, earned resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Tactile, sound-first diction mirrors blind POV; sentences lengthen under calm, compress during wing-sewing. No head-hop; knowledge stays Mira-bound. Filter verbs (“she could feel”) occasionally intrude but preserve rhythm. Voice remains distinct and modulates with task intensity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; figurative language is spare, avoiding density creep. Information density high: basin, alloy, sinew, tone all carry dual jobs. Minor scaffold: “the sound resonated through the depot’s iron beams” restates prior beat. No mixed metaphors or loop artifacts in peak beats; propulsion intact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Reef-avoidance via blind drone-repair is fresh nautical tech-layer. Water-as-Braille method grows from disability rather than gadgetry. Risk of lyrical refraction pattern pays off in closure. Not transformative, but angle feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
<question>9 A</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setup: “ran her thumb along… alloy” signals craft pride; Development: micro-patching under horn deadline; Closure: successful launch lifts her guilt anchor—cost felt. Irreplaceable.</comment>
<question>9 B</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Drone appears first line, mediates two beats (diagnose, patch, launch), delivers final vector that reweights Mira’s loss. Story logic collapses without it.</comment>
<question>9 C</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Shop anchors spatial memory, houses basin method, enforces ticking clock via horn echoes. One of multiple viable workspaces, but its iron acoustics enable the water-reading—strong but not absolute.</comment>
<question>9 D</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Blindness taught early, enables water-refraction technique, limits options to tactile tone-confirmation, costs her extra minutes—visible tradeoff. Drives every turning beat.</comment>
<question>9 E</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Patch action fixes wing actuator, consumes scarce fiber and time, directly precedes successful launch—causal lynchpin. Could swap materials, but act itself is structurally vital.</comment>
<question>9 F</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Water-refraction decoding is introduced by 120-word mark, diagnoses relay, calibrates compass, confirms vector—three distinct beats plus closure use. Method is story’s core insight; removal breaks plot.</comment>
<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Mist provides acoustic damping and twilight palette, signals harbor proximity, but does not block or enable specific moves. Atmospheric, slightly swappable—mid-high utility.</comment>
<question>9 H</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Horn sequence at start, anchor-chain clank, and final silent hull create live countdown, forcing Mira’s pace and forfeiting rechecks—tangible clock pressure.</comment>
<question>9 I</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Need to translate “garbled distress signals into a clear vector” stated early, conflicts with limited time and her fear of repeating past error; choice to trust water-tone shows cost.</comment>
<question>9 J</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Magnetic calm governs prose rhythm, steadies under horn urgency, and crystallizes in final weighted breath. Tone modulates: calm → pressured → fulfilled calm, charging closure.</comment>
