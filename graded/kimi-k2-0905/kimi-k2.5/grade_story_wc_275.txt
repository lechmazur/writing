<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maya’s pacifist conversion from bounty legacy is embodied in every micro-choice—pruning with a former-surgeon’s blade, etching creeds into ballast, refusing the pistol—yet the text occasionally drifts into lyrical summary rather than letting contradiction erupt in a single, painful beat that would push her to 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each returned object (ballast, pistol, blade) re-weights meaning until the final image of “tranquil blaze” crystallizes Earned Stasis with visible cost—the pistol unused, the dome cracking, her father’s calculus sheathed forever; no causal leaps, no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Spider-webbed glass, altitude-mineral canvas, and thorned roses act as micro-setting that literally constrain irrigation choices and charge the final amber refraction; the dome’s curvature tempers twin suns, making environment an active participant in her pacifist experiment.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“grow peace inside falling wreckage”—tightens once: external tower debris accelerates dome fracture while her etched sandbags must still nourish roots. The cost is legible (she accepts imminent collapse rather than take up the pistol), but only one meaningful pressure spike appears; a second tightening would reach 9-band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through iterative inversion of warfare artifacts into life support; no abstract sermon, only the final “tranquil blaze” re-pricing violence into composted witness. Ambiguity survives: reader cannot tell if peace will outlive the dome, keeping complexity alive.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays inside Maya’s perceptual signature—minute barometric shifts, sandbag pitch memory—without head-hop; rhythmic elongation mirrors her slowed horticultural time, then tightens into blade/sheathe cadences. Distinct, consistent, and paid off in the closing image.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>High density throughout: single sentences fuse sensory, historical, and ethical layers (“shed skin,” “calculus of blood-price”). One mixed-metaphor risk—“tranquil blaze”—is pattern-taught early and earns its place; no loops, no filter-verb stacks, clean mechanics.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Post-collapse horticultural pacifism using war-ballast as growth medium feels novel yet inevitable; trope inversion (weapon → planter, hunter’s child → cultivator) is grounded in tactile procedure and specific minerals from “a hundred altitudes.” Risky lyric density heightens coherence rather than gimmick.</comment>
