<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara’s desire to “hear” the petrified trees is vivid and embodied; her moon-bound healing trait and ritual handling of the sextant give consistent micro-choices. The final shift from custodian to “gardener” is credible, yet the interior contradiction between scientific curiosity and spiritual need is told more than dramatized in-scene, keeping her shy of the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: pouring measured sorrow as fertiliser reweights the entire archive system and her job. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density of dream-images and sorrow-vials tighten until moon-lit bark “hums.” Causality is present but lyrically elliptical; cost is felt in the act of surrendering the sealed grief, foreclosing her former neutral custodianship.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Honeycomb corridors, amber vials, and heartwood architecture are selectively filtered through cart-bound attention; the stormlit tower supplies the final constrained choice as moon+lightning enable the sextant’s refocus. Spatial choreography is clean; the environment actively guides her climb and the precise angle of light application.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will she unlock the trees’ witness or keep the system sealed?—tightens once when she realises vials are fertiliser, narrowing her custodial ethic to active stewardship. The reversal is hers alone, with visible cost: she irreversibly empties catalogued sorrow, ending her neutral maintenance role.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><<comment>The theme—grief as living compost—emerges through image chain (vials → roots → oxygen) without sermon. Final “maintenance as worship” reconfigures custodial labour into sacred husbandry, resonant yet unsentimental.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains steady psychic distance; perceptual signature favours haptic detail (cart weight, bark hum) and astronomical lexicon consistent with an observatory labourer. Rhythm modulates from catalogue cadence to luminous long sentences as moonlight heals, mirroring her rising capacity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Sentence variation and information density remain high; only minor filter-verb clusters (“she understood,” “she realised”) slightly dull two beats. Figurative coherence holds—mixed moon/lightning refraction sustains physical logic without metaphor collision.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Grief-as-fertiliser archive built of fossil heartwood feels fresh and inevitable; broken sextant repurposed as dream-catcher supplies a memorable instrumental pivot. Conceptual risk (quantified sorrow) is fully committed to, not hedged.</comment>
