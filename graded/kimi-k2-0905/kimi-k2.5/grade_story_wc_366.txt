<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elara’s reticence and observant nature are vividly embodied through tactile micro-choices—sealing the jar, stacking stones—each revealing a hierarchy of values without label-speak. The contradiction between her hunger for anonymity and her need to be seen drives every beat; the final renunciation of the letter costs her the last chance to speak and is earned by the entire chain of withheld gestures. Interiority stays salt-cold and specific: “bottle the feeling of safety… where absolute vigilance met absolute vulnerability.” Only the absence of another living character keeps the crucible from full ignition.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of stones, glass, ghosts, and silence thickens until the jar-cairn crystallizes a Charged Poise—safety purchased by permanent muteness. Anchors (who/where/when) settle by line 5; the flicker-out lamp is the taught disorientation that later pays off in the phosphorescent dawn image. Closure lands with unmistakable conceptual cost: she chooses to guard the silence itself, foreclosing speech for good. No因果 breaks; every repetition tightens the same stake.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The haunted lantern room functions as micro-setting: rust blooms, shadow pools, salt-cold ghosts brushing elbows—all constrain her movements and decide the final placement of the jar. Sensory hierarchy is keeper-specific: gulls avoid the eastern window, the stair rhythm is older than the lighthouse. Environment mirrors internal state without overt symbolism: “shadows pooled… as if the darkness itself required protection.” The sea-glass lens and stone cairn evolve causally, charging the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—preserve the fragile anonymous covenant—emerges with the first toppled cairn and tightens when she re-stacks stones around the sealed jar, narrowing options to “guard silence” versus speak. No antagonist but entropy and exposure; each ghost-touch and dawn minute increases pressure. The decisive tightening is the black-wax seal: she trades voice for safety, paying with permanent anonymity. Cost is legible on the page; no reversal, but a deepening that forecloses speech.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme—safety through self-erasure—emerges from stone syntax and salt-cold elbows, never stated. The jar’s sealed silence answers the opening “warning she had learned to love,” reweighting anonymity from refuge to life sentence. Subtext lives in gesture: stacking stones instead of sentences, sealing wax instead of lips. Final image refracts the premise rather than moralizing: ghost holds the bottled absence of words.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is maritime-gothic, compressed yet lyrical: “vocabulary of currents,” “lighthouse breathed around her.” Syntax lengthens under contemplation then clips when she acts—“She would not add it to the chain”—creating tidal rhythm. Perceptual signature is keeper-poetic: noticing rust like coastal flowers, solitude’s angle in a spine. No dialogue, so no contamination; free indirect stays salt-grit and consistent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary from rolling cadences to single-clamp fragments; no template runs. Metaphors stay physical—“flat shale for sorrow”—and never stack into purple. Information dual-loads: “seventeen years of silence” marries cargo weight to emotional freight. Only minor loop: “absolute vigilance met absolute vulnerability” restates the same polarity twice; otherwise zero scaffold or filter-verb drift.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Lighthouse-ghost correspondence via stone cairns and sea-glass lens is fresh, not standard Gothic paraphernalia. Reticent female supply skipper as guardian of silence reverses the chatty keeper trope. Risk—lyric stillness in place of plot reversals—pays off in Charged Poise without gimmickry. Could edge higher if the stone cipher had one more enacted decode on the page.</comment>
