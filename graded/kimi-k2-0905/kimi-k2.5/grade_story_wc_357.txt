<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Kael’s motive to locate “resilience” is concrete, embodied in the altitude-sick lurch of her rig and the twelve-minute countdown; her single micro-choice—reaching to touch the arrow tip—crystallizes the internal contradiction between scientific extraction and ancestral caretaking. The beat carries visible cost: the rig is biomechanically rewired while she absorbs centuries of stewardship, a bodily inheritance she can never un-know. No contradiction in traits; the epiphany is earned by prior sensory stacking rather than label-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the broken arrow tip’s harmonic is now stored in her console, making her the carrier of a memorial technology that re-weights every future terraforming mission. Causal lens holds: every beat (clamping to arch, tracking up-flowing water, touching the stone) is linked by therefore/because logic; the cost is the irreversible fusion of machine and memory that ends her detachment as neutral observer. No orientation drift; anchors (who, where, gravitational phase) are fixed in the first 90 words and paid off when the same waterflow reverses to lower her home.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Environment is never backdrop: the upward-streaming river dictates her flight path, the moss-coated arch underside becomes a temporary floor, and the broken arrow tip literally seeds the cathedral of stone with accelerated biomass that rewrites her hull. Micro-setting (the rig’s viewport, the mineral crust forming on the engine) constrains the final decision—she can’t pry the artifact free, only record its resonance. Sensory hierarchy obeys pilot priorities: magnetic clamp vibration, chronometer beep, waterfall spray on the windshield. No white-room lapse; spatial choreography tracks cleanly through inversion and re-inversion.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—extract the secret of resilience—tightens when gravity inversion becomes a one-hour mortality clock; each upstream kilometre reduces her escape margin. Mid-story deepening occurs when spectral farmers appear: continuation of memory is now pitted against her single-minded sampling, forcing the climactic choice to become conduit rather than pillager. Cost is explicit: the rig’s metal is biologically alchemized, binding her craft—and by extension her mission—to the planet’s mnemonic cycle. Escalation is causal, not coincidental; the arrow tip’s pull intensifies exactly because she followed the water-course to the keystone.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme—resilience as inherited, memorial persistence—emerges through inverted imagery (roots drinking sky-water, fruit raining upward) rather than assertion. The broken arrow tip reweights from map-icon to gravitational keystone, turning the concept of “anchoring” into a living library without moralizing. Final image of orchards “singing with the echoes” offers quiet, non-literal resonance: survival is a choir, not a genome. Subtext operates in gesture (her gloved hand on stone) and technological consequence (console hum), avoiding thesis statements.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays welded to Kael’s instrument panel: every perception is filtered through pilot jargon (“magnetic clamps engaging,” “calibrating sensors”) and vertigo physiology. No head-hop; the spectral farmers remain opaque, seen as “layered transparency,” preserving POV modesty. Syntax lengthens during drift-sequences, then fractures into clauses under countdown pressure, mirroring g-force cognition. Distinct perceptual signature is maintained without register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Line-level craft is dense yet propulsive: “water flowed upward around her rig” fuses direction, setting, and motion in six words. Figurative layer is selective—only two metaphors per high-pressure paragraph—avoiding purple clutter. No paraphrase loops; each sentence adds sensorial or causal newness. A single mixed image (“frozen lightning suspended in impossible equilibriums”) is forgiven because it occurs in an expository slot, not the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses geologic inversion with agricultural memory, a synthesis not seen in familiar SF templates. The arrow tip as gravity-plus-time anchor transforms a trope (mysterious artifact) into a mnemonic irrigation system, making the concept of “tradition” literally petrifiable. Risk of lyric ellipsis is embraced—ghost farmers, chromatic growth waves—yet closure remains legible. Specificity (upstream waterfall as navigational highway) renders the innovation inseparable from this planet; transplanting would collapse the logic.</comment>
