<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vane’s contradiction—eco-destroyer who privately mourns—pins every beat: the egg-clutch, the dig, the walk-away. Interiority stays concrete (“feeling its weight like a second heart”), never label-speak. Final refusal to look back crystallizes cost under Accumulative lens. Only micro-slip: no embodied stress signature in the storm departure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is Charged Poise: egg buried, drought ending, crime to be washed away—cost legible in “hollow peace of completion.” Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of mirrored surfaces (lake, salt, sky) tightens until final rain-dark Rorschach reweights meaning. Causality intact: drought → exposure → burial → submergence. No orientation debt; geography anchored by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Salt crust singing like “shattered glass,” thunder as “footsteps of something vast” select sound-tactile detail that mirrors Vane’s fragility. Cracked-wing geoglyph constrains the dig site—environment literally shapes the final gesture. Weather shift from distant rumble to downpour paces the beat and charges the closing image. Micro-setting (egg shell) handled in beat 1 and beat 3, reweighted at closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—preserve echo of extinct birds—tightens once: drought exposes the nest site, forcing the burial choice. No reversal, but deepening suffices for 750-word scope; cost visible in relinquishing the egg to returning water. Coincidence (storm timing) complicates, not resolves. Agency remains Vane’s throughout; option to keep trophy is foreclosed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from mirror-imaging: destroy to cherish, drain to flood, kill to mourn. No moralizing; final “fractured grace” is image, not thesis. Subtext in the calcified shell as both relic and self-portrait. Ambiguity survives—reader cannot settle on redemption or damnation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-close psychic distance stable; diction (“surgical precision,” “acoustic shadow”) stays inside Vane’s corporate-poetic lexicon. Rhythm accelerates with clipped clauses during dig, then lengthens into elegiac cadence at exit. No dialogue, so voice carries all pressure. One hairline slip: “manufactured meaning” edges toward self-explanation, but absorbed by adjacent image.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Sentences multitask: “The manufactured drought had done its work perfectly, exposing the old riverbeds that spider-webbed across the flat” advances plot, sets geography, foreshadows wing shape. No loops or scaffold; metaphors (mirror, bruise, cathedral) stay consistent to glass/reflection pattern. Strong verbs (“crunching,” “nestling,” “relinquishing”) propel. Final line lands with echoic consonance without calling attention to itself.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: eco-villain creates drought to grieve species he helped erase—turns standard eco-apology inside out. Wing-shaped crack as map feels inevitable yet unforced. Risk in lyrical eco-elegy paid off via concrete industrial detail (cobalt mines, bribed engineers). Could swap names, but emotional calculus is specific enough to leave mark.</comment>
