<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mara’s contradictory motives—resentful exile and covert caretaker—collide in every physical act; pruning the trees she once cursed is a lived contradiction. The quartz eyes see fractures she cannot mend in herself, and the final gesture of leaving ribbon and knife together costs her the fantasy of full reconciliation. Interiority stays specific to her profession (“stress fractures in the stone”) rather than diagnostic labels. The only drag is that the daughter remains off-stage, so the relationship crucible is implicit, not dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the cathedral breathes as ruin-garden, ribbon re-tied around grafting knife, seasonal contract unwritten—cost is the irreversibility of change accepted. Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout; each sensory layer (sap, dust, rust, quartz-rainbow) tightens the stakes until the final image reweights the premise. Causality is intact: because she abandoned the site, the orchard grew; because it grew, she returns; because she prunes and releases, she can leave without fixing. No orientation debt; spatial track across tower and nave stays coherent.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The orchard-through-stone is not backdrop but load-bearing structure: every pruning cut balances tree against masonry, micro-setting and macro-setting are the same. The forgotten bag functions as mobile micro-setting whose cedar scent and iron blade trigger present choices. Quartz lenses refract sunset into rainbow across nave—setting literally colors the closing image. Environment constrains every move; remove the aerial orchard and the entire mending logic collapses.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake: can Mara relinquish the need to perfect-restore and instead steward a hybrid ruin? Pressure tightens when each pruning cut risks splitting stone—persistence now equals acceptance of impermanence. No antagonist except entropy and her own compulsion; that suffices. Cost is tangible: sap-stained hands, abandoned scaffolding, and the unwritten vow that forecloses permanent repair.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through recurring vegetal imagery: deciduous vows, grafting, seasonal returns. Final image crystallizes the idea that sacredness survives by metabolizing loss, not sealing it out. No thesis statement; meaning arrives via the ribbon’s re-weighting from souvenir to seasons-marker. Subtext of maternal failure stays in what is not said to the absent daughter.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-limited clings to Mara’s perceptual signature—quartz-mediated sight, iron resin scent, pigeon-curses—without spillage. Syntax lengthens under reflective beats, then chops short during ladder-climb, mirroring breath. No dialogue, so voice carries all; diction stays within artisanal lexicon. Occasional lyric uplift (“green prayers”) risks poetics but is earned by prior grounded detail.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Strong read-aloud rhythm; sentence variety propels without scaffold. Density high: one sentence often performs sight, memory, and tactical choice (“Using the antique knife, she pruned…”). No mixed metaphors or filter-verb stacks. Minor paraphrase loop on “breach” (contract, human, wall) but occurs early and feeds motif, not closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Flips abandonment-into-orchard from eco-metaphor to literal structural force, making freshness intrinsic. Combines craft disciplines—masonry, grafting, optic prosthetics—in a way that feels inevitable, not eclectic. Risk of lyrical overload is courted but controlled by concrete tool-work. Would break if transplanted to another ruin; specificity is the innovation.</comment>
