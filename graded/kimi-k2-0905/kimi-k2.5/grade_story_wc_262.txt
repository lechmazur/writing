<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—seeking to archive love yet risking her own emotional exposure—remains vivid; the embodied “celluloid teeth” and heat of the strip make her gift tactile. Micro-choices (coiling the film, marking coordinates) enact her hierarchy of values: knowledge over safety. The renunciation—leaving the strip asleep on the platter—costs her immediate possession of the archive, earning credible stasis. Flaws (obsessive mapping of others’ pain) complicate the quest and stay active to the final image.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of sensual detail and repeated “hushed thunder” cadence tighten until the beam of light itself is reweighted as the archive. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Elara’s notebook entry crystallizes options (she can now “release deposits”) at visible cost: she exits alone, carrying knowledge she cannot yet spend. Set-up anchors within 60 words; no orientation debt. Causality is interior and lyrical, appropriate to the lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Projection booth as micro-setting constrains every move: ladder, platter, sprocket teeth dictate how Elara handles the strip and where she can stand. The “beam of light” becomes the charged final object, its immateriality the precise locus of stored love. Ozone and dust evoke 1948 without catalog dump. Spatial choreography is immaculate—bodies, strip, and light tracked continuously.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</question><comment>Dominant stake—locate the warehouse of unused love—signaled in paragraph one and deepened when Elara realizes the archive is the light itself, narrowing her future to guardianship rather than consumption. One meaningful tightening suffices under the Accumulative lens. No external antagonist is needed; pressure is ontological. Cost is legible: she forfeits immediacy—tomorrow’s return is obligation, not triumph.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges from motif cluster: celluloid, light, warehouse—love as transferable but never possessed. Final image of the lobby “remembered songs finally finding their melodies” offers non-literal repricing: archived emotion can re-enter circulation. No explicit moral; complexity preserved—Elara’s power can also hoard. Subtext in silence: the projectionist’s letters speak loudest when the strip goes “silent.”</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person psychic maintains consistent tight interior access without over-explaining. Perceptual signature—“mapping emotions as architecture”—threads every sentence; syntax flexes from sinuous long coils (mirror of film strip) to clipped final descent. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk null. Register stays within Elara’s lexicon; “quartz veins pulsing” is mystical yet plausible for a crystal gazer.</answer>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies: lyrical anaphora (“while forgotten lyrics search…”) creates incantatory cadence that pays off when melody is found. Metaphors (warehouse vertebrae, neural pathway) cohere under anatomical-architectural schema. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence adds sensory or causal bite. No filter-verb stacks; verbs are strong (“bit,” “coiled,” “snapped”). Opening and closing lines bookend with sonic echo (“tune” / “melodies”).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fusion of psychometry + cinema mechanics is fresh; “love stored in the beam” re-weights familiar ghost-in-the-reel trope. Risky second-person echo (“you realized”) avoided; insight stays anchored to Elara. Specificity of 1948 leader-tape handwriting etched into emulsion feels non-portable. Conceptual integrity sustained—no retreat into soft metaphor; archive logic followed to literal light. +0.3 for bold luminous corridor premise that lands cleanly.</comment>
