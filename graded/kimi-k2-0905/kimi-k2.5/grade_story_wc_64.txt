<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Mara’s solitary POV is vivid: her tactile intimacy with thorns, the ladder “memorised in dreams,” the recursive hum that threads her lineage. Interior contradiction is light—she wants answers yet savors solitude—but embodied emotion (soil under nails, heart quickening at weave) keeps her credible. The final renunciation—folding the tapestry back into the case—lands as earned stasis: she accepts the circular burden of tending echoes. Missing only a sharper cost on the page (tremor, hesitation) to breach 8+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the cemetery blueprint reweights every prior rose she planted, making her labor an acoustic instrument. Causal chain holds—tapestry selvage → coordinates → acoustic garden—without gaps. Orientation clock starts at word 5; no penalty. Cost is conceptual (she must keep gardening the grief-machine) but felt through the final “listen differently,” satisfying 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Cobalt silo swallows starlight, roses map acoustic paths—details are selective, sensuous, and filtered through Mara’s gardener eye. The micro-setting of the tapestry’s warp/weft acts as living architecture, charging the final image. Spatial choreography is clean: ladder, hatch, stool, case track without drift. Environment directly constrains her next-day tactics, meeting 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: decode ancestor’s sacrifice to understand her own compulsion. One tightening: the sovereign case proves decoy, shifting pursuit to textile code—options narrow from treasure hunt to ancestral duty. Cost is legible—she accepts endless caretaking—but external opposition is absent; pressure is internal & conceptual, fitting Accumulative lens. Sufficient for 8+ but not multiple reversals.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of circular sacrifice emerges through patterned imagery—chess clock, circular paths, returning hum—never stated. The ancestral choice to trade wealth for acoustic grief-work reconfigures Mara's blithe humming as inherited instrumentation. Final image offers non-literal answer: stewardship is the fortune. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in starlit silence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited hovers close to Mara’s synapses: “fingers knowing each thorn by name,” “velveteen gloom” echoing inside her skull. Rhythm swells and subsides with her pulse; diction horticultural yet night-soaked. No dialogue, so no voice drift. Patterned elision (“after the chess clock ran down”) is taught early and reprised at closure, cohesive under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud cadence varied; sentence lengths contract under discovery tension. Few modifiers, strong verbs—“swallowed starlight,” “frayed selvage spoke.” One mixed metaphor cluster (“chess clock…game continued”) but cleared before closure. No scaffold loops; every paragraph advances knowledge or stakes. Minor purple flicker (“velveteen gloom” twice) not reaching artifact threshold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: acoustic cemetery as grief-instrument decoded via textile map—genre elements bent toward lyric anthropology. Inheritance trope flipped; treasure is architectural empathy, not gold. Risk in abstract premise pays off through concrete gardening praxis. If names/places swapped, core fails—proof of specificity. Close but not quite 9.0 due to familiar “ancestor’s secret blueprint” spine.</comment>
