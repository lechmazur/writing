<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses—exile’s ache vs refusal to rejoin either side—surface early and stay active; the moment she presses the postcard to her sternum and curls deeper into the shell crystallizes a micro-choice that forecloses escape. Interiority stays concrete, salted with tear-softened edges rather than labels. The final dissolution of her bones into reef-calcium is an earned renunciation whose cost (permanent fusion, lost human form) is visible on the page. Voice never slips into diagnostic self-explanation; grief is tended, not anatomized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens taught by the second sentence and held: each lullaby layer adds floral density that reweights the stake from solitary endurance to ecosystemic peace. Orientation is anchored by ~100 words (iridescent wall, gargantuan shell, three-centenary insomnia). Closure lands as Charged Poise—flower-barricaded entrance, no bones, jasmine rising—reconfiguring meaning with undeniable conceptual cost: the singer has become the architecture she seeded. Persistent constraint (fused skeleton, tidal heartbeat) shapes every tactic and the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Shell interior functions as micro-setting: calcium chambers narrow her movement and finally swallow her human frame. Sensory triangulation is selective—salt-softened paper, off-key wind, jasmine through water—never touristic. The reef’s light-negotiation mirrors her internal state without overt emblem. Final pearl-lined hollow and jasmine scent are specific, evolved details that charge the closing image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—turn personal grief into living beauty—signaled in paragraph four. One meaningful deepening occurs when polyps open as petals instead of stingers, narrowing her option to remain and keep singing; cost is the permanent loss of human mobility as bones fuse. Pressure stays coherent under accumulative lens: each song adds floral mass, physically barricading return. No coincidence resolves; the armistice is literally grown.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from accumulated particulars: grief-gardening, calcium treaties, blossom signatures. No overt thesis—peace is not stated but flowered. Final jasmine scent through water offers a non-literal answer to the opening exile: the rejected singer becomes home for others. Ambiguity lingers—fish generations know only flowers, not war—without confusion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays tightly bound to Elara’s perceptual filter: “ocean dream in currents older than language,” “calcium carbonate of loss.” Syntax lengthens and contracts with breath-pattern of lullabies; fragments feel like half-sung phrasing rather than error. No head-hop; even the divers’ discovery is focalized through sensory residue she left. Register never exceeds the lexicon of poet-insomniac fused to shell.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm pulses with tidal variation; sentence openings avoid algorithmic drumbeat. Figurative language is dense but patterned—lullaby/wind/spiral—paid off when blossoms clog the entrance. No mixed metaphors; calcium logic stays coherent. One paraphrase loop detected (“centuries of longing” echoed twice) but does not touch closure; still caps 9+.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Premise—insomniac exile sings coral into petal-peace—feels inevitable yet un-clichéd. Risk of lyric accumulation over causal plot is embraced and rewarded: the reef itself negotiates. Specific detail (postcard edges salted by tears and stone) prevents abstraction. Transformation test fails if names/places swapped; the shell-cathedral, mother-of-pearl bones, and off-key wind are inseparable from this voice.</comment>
