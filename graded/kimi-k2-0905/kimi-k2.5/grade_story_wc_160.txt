<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elias’s interior contradiction—pension risk vs moral duty—is embodied in every micro-choice (winding the chain, falsifying logs). The 72-hour cipher marathon is told, not dramatized, blunting cost; still, the final bolt-tightening crystallizes a credibly flawed agent who pays with career suicide.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: found letters → decoded ethic → sabotage upgrade → compassionate flood. Closure is an Earned Stasis: he forfeits promotion and safety to honor the dead, cost legible in “falsified efficiency reports.” Orientation locked by 120 words; lens stays Causal through final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Volcano-amphitheater breathes, brass fittings secrete beeswax, surveyor’s chain drags iron-on-stone audio—all filtered through Elias’s grease-stained priorities. Micro-setting (chain around forearm) literally measures the moral alignment he must preserve, constraining the final regulator adjustment.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—modern output vs ancient restraint—tightens once: industrial upgrade looms, he disables it. Cost is concrete: pension forfeit, seismic legal risk. No reversal, but the single deepening suffocates alternatives, satisfying 600-word escalation threshold.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from hydraulic ethic encoded in brass: progress can include voluntary self-destruction. Final image—chain coiled beside concealed seals—reweights “strength and mercy occupy the same architecture” without sermon. Moral imagination feels discovered, not declared.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person lingers inside Elias’s tactile cognition: grease, sulfur, resin dust. Syntax lengthens under reflection, shortens during torque of bolts, matching pressure. No dialogue, so voice stays singular; diction stays within machinist lexicon. Distinct perceptual signature sustained.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>High information density—each sentence advances tool, ethics, or atmosphere. Occasional stacked participles (“feeling each iron link settle…”) slightly gum urgency, but never within closure beat. No loops, no scaffold; read-aloud rhythm breathes with geothermal cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Floodgate-as-ethical-time-capsule is fresh; encrypted compassion beats typical eco-allegory. Chain-as-morality-calipers fuses engineering with elegy in a way only this story can perform. Risk of quiet sabotage revolution feels both new and inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
