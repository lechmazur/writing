<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation—mapping lost dreams—remains consistent and embodied through tactile micro-choices (inkwell, epoxy, silt-brushing). Interiority is concrete, but the single-POV isolation means no relationship crucible; the only pressure is environmental. The final “quiet triumph” is credible as Earned Stasis, yet the absence of a second on-page character caps depth at this length.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the drawbridge lowering reconfigures city/isolation while her soaked body carries felt cost. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each submerged artifact thickens the pattern of absence until the ink-sealed note crystallizes it. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no causality breaks. One minor scaffold: “she will return tomorrow” is future-telling that slightly softens the final image’s permanence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Submerged ballroom is rendered through cold boots, barnacled bar, anaerobic toy—details that constrain movement and supply the epoxy’s necessity. Micro-setting (inkwell in pocket) reappears at closure, charging the final touch. Spatial choreography is flawless; no impossible body positions. One hairline slip: “Victorian bones” is metaphorically vivid but technically off by era; not enough to breach credibility.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—rescuing forgotten aspirations—tightens as each foundation crack narrows her window to record. The act of sealing the final note into stone is the single meaningful turn that forecloses further access, paying the cost of permanent separation from the site. Pressure is accumulative; no external antagonist needed. Could use one earlier tangible loss (broken pencil, numb hand) to raise tactical stakes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of “permanence versus water” emerges through image chain: crystal chandeliers → broken skylights → ink sealed against tide. No explicit thesis; final image of drawbridge reconnecting city to harbor reweights the premise that only written traces resist erosion. Subtext in the toy horse implies parental loss without stating it. Avoids sentimentality; one near-moral—“people once believed in permanence”—is saved by being embedded in future-diver speculation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains tight psychic distance; perceptual signature is surveyor-precise (“coordinates, measurements, fissures like broken staves”). Syntax lengthens underwater to mimic viscosity, shortens on shore for chill. No filter-verb clusters; metaphor engine is disciplined. One register drift: “conceptual repricing” is evaluator lexicon, not Elara’s, but it occurs outside story text; interior voice stays consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with dive/ascend cycles; no template cadence. Figurative density is high but patterned—water, music, textile—so it accrues rather than clutters. Information dual-loads: “seaweed drapes the balcony where a soprano sang her final aria” fuses sensory, history, and loss. One paraphrase loop: “interlaced absence” is repeated twice without new inflection; minor −0.2.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Premise—archaeologist of drowned dreams—is fresh synthesis of maritime gothic and archival impulse. Toy horse, inkwell, epoxy are specific objects not interchangeable props. Risk taken in lyric accumulative structure pays off in final drawbridge image. Only hedge: Victorian date feels slightly familiar; 1892 specificity and architect-fiancée backstory just manage to transform the trope.</comment>
