<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is consistently embodied and particular—her “translucent hands,” the gear’s “brass teeth biting vacuum,” her gradual dispersal into luminescence—yet the final renunciation (she “press[es] the gear into the nebula’s heart”) is so lyrically compressed that the exact cost she pays (identity? agency? memory?) is felt but not sharply dramatized, keeping her just shy of 9+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the gear’s lantern–not–key re-prices every prior cycle of fire. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density of petals, sonar echoes, gear rotations tighten until the cadence shifts to lullaby. The −0.3 bump is the slight causal gap between “she understood” and the physical act that seals the new pattern; the cost is legible but could be one beat sharper.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The nebula garden is not backdrop but instrument: petal-dust settles on shoulders, gear locks into “invisible machinery older than atoms,” sonar maps density that forces her path. Micro-setting (the gear, her translucent body) literally constrains her final insertion move. Sensory economy is flawless—every hydrogen flake either mirrors entropy or becomes data in the new soft constellation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“share light without fire”—is signaled in paragraph one and tightens when the cavity of past immolation appears. One meaningful deepening suffices: the gear’s shift from power-key to lantern reweights her options. The price is conceptual (she becomes part of the diffuse light) rather than visceral, keeping it just below the 8.8 gate for a sharper felt cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges entirely through image pattern: burning vs. gentle luminescence, gear rotation vs. serenely frozen petals. The final “gentle radiance” re-prices all prior conflagrations without a single overt thesis. No moralizing, only reconfiguration—reader left to feel the cost of not-burning in the body of the dispersed sentinel.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Perceptual signature is distinct: star-whispers, watercolor-ghost sonar, “cathedral of gas.” Lyric compression is taught early (“compressed longing”) and paid off in the lullaby-frequency shift. No head-hopping; cosmic scale stays filtered through Elara’s sentimental sensorium. Rarest diction (“scorch marks… black veins of shame”) is justified by her predecessor-memory burden.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence either thickens texture or advances transit. Metaphors are mutually coherent—gear math, petal entropy, charcoal shame—culminating in the “soft constellation” that re-images infinity. Rhythm accelerates with longer anaphoric cadences then exhales into the final single-sentence paragraph, mirroring the shift from recursion to repose.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Familiar tropes—cosmic guardian, generational failure, chosen-one artifact—are re-forged through the specific inversion of fire-less illumination and the gear that approximates infinity by never finishing. The “lantern not key” reconfiguration feels inevitable yet non-obvious; the story risks a nearly static vignette but earns resonance through accrued image pressure rather than plot twist.</comment>
