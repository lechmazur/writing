<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s guilt and need for retroactive witness are viscerally embodied; the unsent letters and moon-healed wounds externalize contradictory impulses. The final kneel-and-speak lands as earned renunciation because every beat has primed the cost of silence. Minor slip: “anticipated grief masquerading as self-protection” flirts with diagnostic label-speak mid-crescendo, blunting peak embodiment a hair.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: she occupies the frozen instant, speaks the unsent words, and the letters dissolve into dream-condensation—cost is the shard left at Mara’s feet and the irreversible fact that Mara still dies. Causal lattice holds: shard → corridor → vision → utterance → dissolve, each step a because/therefore under moonlight. Orientation is taught by deliberate disorientation early and pays off in the folding-time image; no teleporting props or retroactive rules.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mangrove roots, cabin glass, and moonlit mercury function as micro-settings that actively constrain movement and channel the corridor; the shard’s limestone pores react to spirit vibration, charging the final image. Selective sensory hierarchy—salt-air sting, thorn-gash silver, condensation syntax—keeps description woven through action rather than catalog. One tiny overreach: “drowned cathedral walls” edges toward familiar trope, but immediate tactile suck of mud restores specificity.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will she speak the apology into the folded moment—tightens once: shard raised → corridor opens → door pushed → words spoken, foreclosing lifelong silence. Cost is visible shard sacrifice and the irreversible death; no coincidence resolves. Pressure escalates under causal lens; option set narrows to speak or forever carry the letters—she pays.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges as the irrevocable weight of unspoken love: condensation-bridge and dissolved letters reweight the motif from regret to witness without moralizing. Final image—shard at dead Mara’s feet—reprises rain-channeling saints, quietly repricing sacred conduit as secular reparation. No thematic echo sentences; meaning stays in object and gesture.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays tightly filtered through Elara’s perceptual signature—breath-fog, moonlit flesh, thorn-salt—without head-hop. Syntax lengthens under wonder, compresses under pain; condensation-as-syntax is taught early and paid off. One clause (“keening the melody of almost-regret”) nudges toward writerly flourish, but cadence rights itself.</comment>

<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: each sentence advances image or stakes—no scaffold, no synonym loops. Figurative layering (“moonlight pooled like mercury”) is sparse and purposeful; mixed-metaphor guardrails intact. Minor filter verb (“she watched her breath bloom”) is instantly redeemed by tactile next beat. Closure line is uncluttered, letting weep and moonlight resonate.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Folding an apology into a mangrove-haunted, moon-healed condensation corridor feels inevitable yet unseen; gargoyle shard as portable confessionary is fresh without gimmick. Risk—time-travel witness that cannot change outcome—could have felt recycled, but specificity of mediumship rules and spirit song transforms it. Story would collapse if any element swapped; that interlock earns the band.</comment>
