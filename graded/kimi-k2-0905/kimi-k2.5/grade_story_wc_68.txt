<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elias’s interior contradiction—rational rebel vs. myth-maker—remains vivid and embodied; the cog discovery forces an immediate, costly micro-choice to hide and rebuild. The final “quiet click” crystallizes Earned Stasis: he accepts exile from the healing myth, cost legible in the rising flood he refuses to flee. No second character on page, so relationship bullets N/A; backstay reflections are anchored to present tactile cues and tilt his stance. Flaw: occasional diagnostic label (“wannabe philosopher”) used as self-description mid-scene rather than dramatized perception.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: discovery of cog → agonize → decision to excavate truth underground, each beat tightening options. Closure is a Decisive Change with conceptual cost—he commits to a war of memory, papers left to flood, stakes sharpened. Orientation anchored by word 80 via salt-stiff sleeve and conduit taste; no penalty. One causal gap: councils’ power to confiscate/execute is asserted but not shown or foreshadowed in scene, a minor external stakes fuzz.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Sewer ruins act as micro-setting: submerged marble bench becomes workbench, water level dictates when he risks paper loss, flooding at end physically tests commitment. Sensory triage—rust, coral, salt, rat splash—mirrors internal corrosion and selectivity. Cog-as-moon image recharges at closure, constraining his choice to trust math over myth. Spatial track clean; no white-room moments.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—truth vs. healing myth—signaled early; pressure escalates when cog’s reality collides with councils’ anti-chronometry law, forcing him to choose secrecy or martyrdom. Final choice forecloses surface life, cost legible in rising tide swallowing his archive. No antagonist on stage, but internal and societal pressure braid cleanly. Could use one tactile hint of enforcement (drowned clock-hoarder skeleton?) to make threat visceral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through sedimentary metaphor: layers of narrative compress into weaponized memory, no authorial thesis stated. Final image—papers submerging while cog gleams—reweights “precision as crime” into “precision as survival,” resonance felt not told. Competing narratives stay complex: both myth and measure carry corpses. Avoids sermon; slight risk of thematic echo in “war over memory” phrase, but语境 saves it.</comment>

<question>6</question><<grade>8.8</question><grade><comment>Voice is distinctively erudite-corrosive: “abrasive calm,” “diamond of unbearable density,” syntax rhythmic and controlled. Perceptual signature filters world through mineral, maritime, mechanical lexicon—perfect for ex-financial-district sewer philosopher. No dialogue, so dialogue bullets N/A. One register slip: “conceptual repricing” reads academic-external to POV, but single instance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies from briny terse to rolling cadence; high info density—each line performs two jobs (world + interior). No loops or scaffold; metaphors stay coherent within maritime-mechanical field. Minor overwriting: three consecutive adjective stacks in “concrete leviathan” sentence, but beat is low-pressure, does not dull closure. Proofing clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Freshest synthesis: post-plague anti-clock cult vs. subterranean horologist—idea feels inevitable yet unseen. Sedimentary “excavation of truth” literalized through sewer digging transforms abstract epistemology into tactile quest. Risk taken with lyric essayistic tone pays off in final charged poise. Slight echo of Borges/Calvino DNA, but voice particularizes it.</comment>
