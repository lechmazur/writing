<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Maren’s fear-of-exposure versus hunger-for-solitude is embodied in the frantic burial of the eye; the final unshared smile shows a paid-for change. Interiority stays concrete (“her hands moved faster than her tongue”). The occlusion ritual works because her involuntary-truth trait makes shouted fear lethal; cost is legible. Minor slip: “psychological safety” is named more than dramatized after the burial beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: find eye → must hide → ritual → silence achieved. Closure is a Decisive Change with felt cost—she can now lie by omission, witnessed by the unshared smile. Orientation is clear by line 4; no teleporting props. One tight lens throughout. The textbook incantation is a motivated leap; still earns 8.6 because the price is on-page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The hanging orchard’s sway and creaking harness constrain every reach; storm-light on painted iris charges the final image. Micro-setting (peat, cables, lantern on swinging branch) is filtered through mycologist eyes. Weather narrows perception during the ritual, forcing shouted truth into gale. Environment directly shapes the occlusion tactic—mycelium blanket as biological scrambler.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—recover interior privacy—signalled in paragraph 2. Tightening occurs when the eye is unearthed: hiding it risks empathic exile, yet leaving it invites permanent surveillance. Agency drives escalation: she chooses forbidden ritual, pays with public self-denunciation (“I am afraid”). Cost—lifelong maintenance of fungal cover—made visible in closing image.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges: privacy as ecological niche, not right. Subtext in the eye’s “unobserved blinking” reframes solitude as relic. Final smile reweights earlier “shared grief” lines without moralizing. No thesis statements at end; resonance carried by unshared expression and mycelial silence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is perceptually specific—soil acidity meter as pendant, lantern shadows on discredited pages. Syntax lengthens under dread, then fractures during ritual. No head-hopping; psychic distance stable. Register stays within lone forager lexicon; no academic drift. Distinctive without mannerism.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence. Figurative language sparse and purposeful—“clung like a desperate prayer” justifies orchard stakes. No synonym loops or filter-verb stacks. High information density: one line can anchor body, tool, weather. Clean copy; pronouns track. Minor: “fractured grace” used twice, but second instance reprises with earned shift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Post-empathy-virus world plus suspended truffle grove feels novel yet inevitable. Black-market privacy relic, fungal signal-jamming, and involuntary-truth constraint synthesize into fresh moral calculus. Risk—mixing mycology with occult ritual—pays off because closure keeps ecological logic. Image of glass eye watching from mycelial grave lingers beyond page.</comment>
