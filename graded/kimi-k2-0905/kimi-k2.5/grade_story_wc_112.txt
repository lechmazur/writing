<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Kael’s obliging diligence and quiet defiance of Dr. Vex’s ridicule give him a believable interior contradiction; the moment he pulls the lever crystallizes his hierarchy of values, trading safety for vindication. Embodied emotion is strong (“icy warmth spread through his chest”). No secondary character on-page long enough to test relationship crucible, but single-POV interiority is rich and specific. The final micro-choice is earned and irreversible, satisfying the 9+ quick test for this length.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the hologram’s timestamps-from-the-future reweight the rule-set of time itself, with felt cost in Kael’s vindicated smile. Causal lens holds: each beat (“because he was mocked, therefore he risks the lever”) tightens options. Orientation is clean by line 6. One minor scaffold: “mechanically warm embrace” returns twice without new charge, but it never touches the climax.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The station’s “mechanically warm” vents function as micro-setting that constrains Kael’s decision to stay at console rather than suit-up. Detail is selective (frost lattice, titanium lever worn smooth) and filtered through mechanic’s gaze. Spatial choreography stays clean; no white-room syndrome. Weather evolves from violet twilight to density-pressure inside dome, mirroring internal shift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prove sideways time—signalled on first page and tightened when he overrides safety protocols; the holographic timestamps visibly foreclose doubt, paying the price of professional ridicule. Escalation is single but meaningful: lever-pull intensifies pressure from theory to irreversible evidence. No external antagonist needed; institutional scorn suffices. Cost is legible in the sudden auricular density and the smile that accepts future chaos.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme—time as traversable landscape rather than glacier—emerges through Kael’s embodied experience, never sermonized. Subtext of class tension (mechanic vs scientist) sharpens theme without overt statement. Final image of sleeping wings slicing chronology offers resonant non-literal answer. No tidy moral; ambiguity remains about consequences.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Kael; perceptual signature is engineer-precise (“thermal regulator,” “titanium lever worn smooth”). Syntax mirrors pressure: long accumulative clauses build to fragment “He pulled.” No dialogue, so no voice convergence. Free-indirect blends cleanly: “the mechanic’s motivation burned steady.” Register never drifts above protagonist’s lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet breathable; figurative language is sparse enough to avoid overwrite. One mixed metaphor (“thickens the air itself into something measurable and dense”) but it is brief and early. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or knowledge. Final line cadence perfectly mirrors sideways glide of time. Proofing clean; no typos.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: Vesper Drakes as evolved chrononauts viewed through holographic interferometry feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk taken—lyric stillness instead of action set-piece—pays off by reconfiguring meaning rather than plot. Specificity of “ translucent-winged creatures” and “ore deposits beneath permafrost” roots concept. Avoids template time-travel tropes; sideways time as compass direction is new inflection.</comment>
