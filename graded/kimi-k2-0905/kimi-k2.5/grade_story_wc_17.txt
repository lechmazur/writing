<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Mara’s vocation-driven interiority is vivid, but her decisive moment—tucking the negative away—restates earlier resolve rather than exposing fresh contradiction. The inherited guilt angle is strong yet stays intellectual; no micro-choice visibly costs her a live alternative, so the arc feels foreclosed by theme more than by earned renunciation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each shard layers sensory memory until the final image reweights “what walls dream.” Transitions are legible and closure lands as Charged Poise with conceptual cost (she now carries the past). However, causality between diary clue → cellar → negative is too smooth—no resistance tightens the middle—keeping it short of 8+.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Damp stone, rain-pooled corners, wax-sealed box: selective tactile detail is filtered through Mara's ear-for-walls bias, grounding orientation without exposition. The ivy-veined passage recurs at entry and exit, bookending the textural accumulation; it doesn’t constrain a choice but does charge the final image, satisfying the 9− gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will she recover the hidden truth—surfaces early. Pressure heightens texturally rather than causally: each relic adds historical weight, narrowing her emotional options. Yet no concrete obstacle (structural danger, rival seeker, physical risk) tests her resolve; the cost is atmospheric, felt but not dramatized, capping escalation at 6–7 band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of trans-generational guilt emerges through image chain: charred diaries → intact fireplace → children on lawn. No moral is stated; the closing line “she carried the past so the walls could finally rest” reconfigures the premise, letting continuity itself become the moral burden. Ambiguity lingers—does preservation liberate or imprison?—earning resonance without tidy closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains steady psychic distance anchored to Mara's sensory register; rhythm tightens under flashlight scrutiny and relaxes into dream cadence at camp. Filter verbs are minimal and justified (“she heard,” “she felt”) inside an observer’s vocation. Vocabulary stays within her plausible lexicon; repeated sibilance (“walls remember…whispered…slow breath”) patterns the textural drive without monotony.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening, propelling the silent listening beats then widening for sunset reflection. Occasional modifiers (“ivy-veiled,” “moldy darkness”) are purposeful; no metaphor pile-ups or mixed vehicles. A single paraphrase loop—“walls remember…walls had witnessed…walls dream”—is motif-driven and taught early, so loop penalty waived; clarity at closure stays intact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Echo-mapping as profession freshens the familiar ruin-exploration frame; coupling climate-collapse with celluloid preservation offers a quiet sci-fi tilt. The film negative functions both as evidence and as metaphor for inverted memory, synthesizing prior elements. While post-climate archetype is familiar, specificity of “corridor echo cartographer” and the acoustical metaphor lifts the piece above template.</comment>
