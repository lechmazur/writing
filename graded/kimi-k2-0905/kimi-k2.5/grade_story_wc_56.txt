<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Mara’s contradictory impulse—hunger for truth versus loyalty to mentor—stays active in-scene; each false map physically handled and cursed. The final renunciation of “seeking” is earned by every prior misnavigation, cost felt in the dawn dust. Interiority is concrete (“boots sinking into mud that smelled of rotting lilies and iron”) not label-speak. Micro-choice hierarchy—sundial angle over broken compass—crystallizes values without exposition.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the sundial reweights all prior “failure” as deliberate training; cost is the years lost, made legible in the lock-keeper’s cottage dust. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—each lie layers density until pattern flips meaning. Orientation anchored by word 60 (“rusted barge prow”), no penalty. One transition (barge→cottage) cleanly cued by walking the canal bank.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The canal’s oil-slick violet light and “rotting lilies and iron” odor constrain footing and mood; the sundial’s etched latitude lines act as micro-setting that governs final footstep direction. Spatial choreography holds as heron ripples reflection, boots sink, floorboards lifted. Weather (twilight→dawn) evolves with stakes. No credibility strain.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—decode mentor’s deceit—tightens when hidden engraving forecloses the temple quest and re-prices pursuit as self-authorship. Agency visible: she tilts dial, walks lock path, pries floorboards; each act narrows prior myths. Cost is cumulative time/labor plus heartbreak in the journals’ “thoughtfully clear logic.” Coincidence absent; pressure coherent under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme—“to salvage a life from the architecture of lies”—emerges through tactile acts, never stated until final line, and even there embedded in image. Subtext operates in her silence, radio hush, and the heron’s knife-through reflection. Final image reweights all prior misnavigation as necessary mortar for the self she will now write. Resists moral, invites counter-reading: mentor’s cruelty as gift.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric-philosophical yet canal-grounded: “twilight barge canal where oil-slick water carried the last violet light” marries sight, smell, metaphor. Syntax lengthens under reflection, shortens under action (“She stepped onto the canal bank”) without template cadence. Perceptual signature—navigation by smell and touch rather than map—stays consistent. No head-hop; single POV stable.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes: long reflective sentences build texture, then staccato gait (“She stepped… She had learned…”) mirrors walking. No filter-verb stacks; strong verbs (“fractured,” “sank,” “pries”) replace modifiers. Metaphors stay physically coherent (“architecture of lies” built of floorboards). No loops or synonym churn. Final line lands with image cadence, no scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: treasure-hunt plot inverted so every wrong path becomes the necessary curriculum. Sundial-as-key rather than time-teller reconfigures genre expectation. Mentor’s posthumous curriculum design feels both cruel and loving, avoiding binary judgment. Specific inflection—radio silence as temporal marker—has not appeared in prior published canon I can recall.</comment>
