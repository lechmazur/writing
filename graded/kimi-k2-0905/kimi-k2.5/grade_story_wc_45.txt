<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elena’s interior contradiction—rationalist healer vs. newly minted believer—registers in concrete micro-choices (splinting radius, surrendering the tooth) rather than summary. The changeling’s “shrewdly innocent” mask cracks only once; more embodied contradiction on her side would lift the score. The final gesture of handing back the tooth lands as earned renunciation with visible cost to both.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elena steps through the “cleft” she once denied, now bearing the cost of permanent worldview fracture and the duty to guide both children. The hedge-maze constellation image crystallizes options without tidy explanation. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens; each sensory layer (iron, lilac, yew, tooth) reweights the stake until the dawn-gold thorns lock the new constellation in place.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The garden’s impossible geometries and orbital logic constrain every move—Elena must kneel on the grass to set bone, the fountain-root niche literally hides the real child. Sensory triad (iron/lilac/yew) mirrors internal corrosion and tender regrowth. Spatial choreography is flawless; bodies, thorns, and silver wire track cleanly across the beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will Elena repair what superstition broke without erasing the substitute?—tightens once: the radius snap forces her to choose between dissecting the creature and healing it. The choice forecloses her former certainty and carries the persistent price of guardianship over two incompatible truths. One visible tightening is sufficient at this length; the dawn-gold thorns externalize the cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the bone-setting metaphor: mistakes are not erased but mapped into constellations that guide future travelers. The tooth’s reweighting—from evidence to compass—does the thematic work without exposition. Final image refuses moral symmetry: skeptic and monster become co-cartographers of an expanded reality.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays glued to Elena’s perceptual filter—porcelain-doll rationalism cracking under faerie cartilage. Syntax lengthens with wonder (“nostalgic innovation of scents”) then snaps short under clinical pressure (“silver wire and birch bark”). No head-hop; changeling’s voice surface only through reported plea, preserving alien distance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose is lush but disciplined—one job per sentence, no filler. Occasional lyrical stacking (“orbital, a place where lost things circled”) risks density yet serves the accumulative lens. Zero loops, scaffold, or register drift; closing image of thorns-turned-gold lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fae-abduction trope is inverted: the changeling becomes patient, the rational doctor midwife. Bone-setting as ontological repair feels novel and inevitable. Constellation mapping of error is a fresh conceptual repricing that could not survive a name-swap.</comment>
