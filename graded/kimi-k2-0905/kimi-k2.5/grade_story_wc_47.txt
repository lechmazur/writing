<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses—public shame vs. private nurturance—are alive in every beat; the pendant renunciation is earned by the prior 700 words of measured micro-choices. Interiority stays concrete (“humidity muffled the echoes of her digital ghost”) and never slips into diagnostic labels. The only keep-it-from-9.0 slip: a hair of safety-hedging—her flaws are named but never allowed to complicate the final act, so the cost feels pristine rather than dangerous.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens is taught by the third sentence and held to the last line: pattern of thaw-drip-pool-absorb reconfigures meaning rather than plot. Closure is a Charged Poise—the pendant’s shift from jewelry to “marker in a private cartography” reweights the stake with undeniable conceptual cost. No orientation debt; anchor (who/where/when) is clear by line 4. Causality remains intact because the accrual of moss, water, and silence is the causality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The abandoned server-moss biome is not backdrop; its calcium drip spiral literally guides Elara’s hand and determines where the pendant is offered. Sphagnum, rust, and thawing icicles supply both texture and tactical constraint—she presses moss into a hard-drive crack as her ritual act. Sensory hierarchy is POV-loyal: the amber glow and chlorophyll motes are noticed because they participate in her rewriting script. One hairline slip: “calcium trails” could be sharper science, but the metaphoric physics never break the beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will she surrender the last relic of her viral shame to the garden?—is signaled in paragraph 3 and tightened once: pendant placed on ledge, path foreclosed. The tightening is textural, not causal, perfectly valid under Accumulative lens; the cost is the pendant’s exit from her body and from digital currency. No reversal required; the single deepening is sufficient. Could inch to 9.0 if the garden pushed back (moss over amber?) but the hush itself is the pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges entirely through image pattern: erosion as language, preservation as transformation. No thesis is spoken; the final “golden grammar” re-prices the rule-set without moralizing. Subtext hums in what’s not re-shared—her silence is the active verb. Complexity is honored: the internet’s appetite remains ravenous outside the door, unforgiven, while composting is not redemption but slow translation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person intimate maintains consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature is botanical-lyric (“ferns unfurled between cooling vents”) without purple drift. Syntax modulates with thaw acceleration—clause lengths shorten as drops “strike the concrete with a precision that suggested intention.” No dialogue, so voice contamination is impossible. Filter verbs are minimal and voice-motivated. The hush itself becomes a character through rhythmic control.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Line-level craft is near flawless: every sentence does two jobs (image + pressure) and propels. Figurative language is patterned, not stacked—thaw, drip, pool, absorb becomes anaphoric engine. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold. The −0.2 keep-it-from-9.0 is a single mixed register moment: “conceptual repricing” feels academic against the fungal diction, but it occurs mid-story, not at closure, so artifact does not obscure the final image.</comment>

<comment>Premise—abandoned data-center as cloistral garden—feels inevitable yet wholly fresh. Risk is maximal: 700-word lyric accumulative plotless piece submitted to a market that usually demands causality, yet coherence is absolute. Transformation test passed: swap names/places and the emotional arc collapses because the moss, amber, and calcium drip are non-fungable. No trope recycling; viral-confession fallout is rendered as root-bound mycelium, not courtroom or therapy.</comment>
