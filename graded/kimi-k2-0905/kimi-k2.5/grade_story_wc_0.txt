<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elena’s interior contradiction—rejoicing in stripped-away drama yet mourning the butterfly—pulses in every micro-choice (kneeling, breathing slower, shelving pulsar papers). The final renunciation of “needless drama” costs her the language that once defined her; the neural rewiring is visible, earned. Minor slip: “she preprocesses reality” re-stated rather than embodied mid-scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Single-scene causal spine holds: storm → stripped lab → butterfly dust → pattern reading → acceptance of gradual decay. Closure lands as Earned Stasis: she accepts slow entropy and forfeits violent cosmology; cost is legible in the relinquished spectrometers and altered breath. Accumulative lens is cleanly taught by 25% and held to final line.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Greenhouse acts as micro-setting that constrains every move: moisture gradients dictate dust deposition, cracked panes fracture light into new “constellations.” Eastern-wall dampness is tactile, POV-filtered, and causally guides her mapping of flood path. Tool-as-setting (magnifying lens) focuses both literal and metaphoric attention, charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Central stake—how to relate to change once violence is gone—tightens when dust patterns offer a quieter but inexorable record of collapse. One meaningful deepening: realizing grandeur lives in miniature forecloses her prior high-energy cosmology; price is felt in the slow retraining of breath and abandonment of pulsar language. No redundancy or off-stage resolution.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: the humility of scale—cosmic violence vs. microscopic endurance—without any articulated thesis. Final image of mingled dust, pollen, rust reweights earlier pulsar screams into whispered surrender, achieving Conceptual Repricing. Ambiguity is preserved: reader feels both gain and loss in her new patience.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays bolted to Elena’s scientist perception: verbs like “stripped,” “lensing,” “equations” mirror her once-instrumental worldview, then modulate into sedimentary cadence. No head-hop; psychic distance contracts smoothly as she kneels. Occasional elevated diction (“conceptual repricing” moment) remains within her academic lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Lyric rhythm serves theme—long sentences swell like floodwater, then settle into shorter sedimentary beats. Mixed metaphors avoided; vehicles stay physical (dust = equations, moisture = dark matter). Two adjacent sentences paraphrase “gradual change” idea; minor −0.2. Strong information density: one sentence often performs description, emotion, and causal link.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: neutron-star scientist + butterfly-scale forensics as dueling epistemologies. Risk of quiet ending paid off—no pulsar explosion, yet stakes feel universal. Dust-as-data concept feels inevitable in hindsight, not gimmicky. Specificity of “eastern-side dampness” and “silver-gold gradients” prevents generic disaster story.</comment>
