<question>1</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Interiority is lyrically dense but abstract; no embodied contradiction under pressure. “Cheerful gloom” is asserted, not dramatized. Final acceptance is stated rather than earned through visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of seed-glass-memory tightens once into “necessary silences” realization. Closure is Charged Poise with conceptual cost. Orientation clear by word 60; no causal reversal, only deepening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Geode, seeds, crater glass rendered with prismatic sensory economy; each object re-appears and reweights meaning. Final image of etched glass among others crystallizes the reconfiguration. Micro-setting (glass) constrains action twice—seed dissolution and final inscription—meeting 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—why paths disappear—signaled early but pressure remains philosophical; no concrete option is foreclosed. “Before memory fades” functions as clock yet never narrows tactical choices. Cost is conceptual, not felt on page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme of erasure as creative space emerges through imagistic accretion rather than statement. Final “question” seed reweights prior motifs cleanly. Avoids overt moral, but insight stays cerebral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Third-person lyric voice sustains sea-foam metaphors, tidal cadence, and controlled repetition. No head-hop; perceptual signature distinct. Register consistent even at peak compression.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Rhythm breathes with scene motion; sentences vary. Sparse scaffolding—only “cheerful gloom” echoed thrice. No mixed metaphors or filter stacks; minor template cadence in “before memory fades” refrain (−0.3).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Memory-harvesting inside a geode via meteor-scar glass and gull-borne seeds feels specific and non-portable. Conceptual risk—erosion as gift—lands coherently. Slight over-reliance on “iridescent” and prismatic lexicon keeps it from full 9+.</comment>
