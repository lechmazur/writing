<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Kael’s alien POV is rendered with tactile specificity (thermal sensors, anti-grav hover, fossil pulse) and a coherent hierarchy of values: data-collection vs. meaning-making. Interior contradiction is absent—no moment where the mission conflicts with an emergent desire—so the arc is static. The “voice of the unknown” motivation is asserted, not pressure-tested; the fossil anchor never forces a sacrifice or rethink. Earned stasis is credible, but emotional cost is diffuse rather than embodied.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the golden flare records accumulated feeling, Kael’s stance crystallizes as archive-voice, and the cost is the solitary burden forever borne. Causality is lyric-accumulative, not reversal-driven; each heat-map layer deepens density until the final image reweights the premise. Orientation is swift (who/where/when by line 3). One lens ambiguity: the fossil’s “heartbeat” is poetic license not signaled as either metaphor or real tech—doesn’t rupture closure but keeps the piece just shy of 8+ purity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Cave network is kinesthetically lived-in: brackish pools spray, vessel skirts water, starlight shaft reorients scale. Bioluminescent fungi and tide-breath supply non-visual texture; fossil and anti-grav unit act as micro-settings that constrain movement and focal length. Spatial choreography is immaculate—no drift in body/vessel position. The environment’s two-million-year age is stated once without forcing exposition, letting aura emerge through Kael’s sensor-filtered attention.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—translate abandonment into human-audible memory—remains stable. Pressure escalates by accumulation: each thermal hue deepens the archive’s weight rather than narrowing tactical options. No decisive reversal or trade-off occurs; the final recording is an expansion, not a sacrifice. Cost is existential solitude, but it is confessed rather than dramatized in-scene, keeping tension below the 7+ threshold.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of custodial translation—silence into warmth, absence into voice—emerges through imagistic accretion rather than thesis. Fossil/leaf motif evolves from geological curio to metronome for the song-map, reweighting its meaning at the starlight release. Subtext avoids moral binaries: humans’ escape is neither condemned nor celebrated; Kael’s devotion carries no triumph. Final image of drifting archive-bearer offers resonant ambiguity: memory as both consolation and burden.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Kael’s sensorium; perceptual signature is cool, metric, yet lyric (“thermal sensors…hovering three inches”). Syntax lengthens under wonder, contracts during data capture, mirroring emotional modulation. No dialogue, so voice purity remains intact. Occasional elevated diction (“transitional object,” “conceptual repricing”) edges toward academic but stays consistent with AI-like observer persona.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is lush yet propulsive; most sentences dual-task (sense + metaphor + forward motion). Two adjacent near-repeats (“mapping sensory data…sensory map maker”) create minor loop; one mixed vehicle (“cave walls bloomed with colors invisible”) is permissible lyricism. No filter-verb stacks or scaffold clutter. Final paragraph maintains rhythmic lift without monotony; climactic golden flare is cleanly anchored.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Post-Anthropocene sensory-archivist POV feels fresh, avoids stock robot tropes. Heat-map-as-song device synthesizes climate grief and archival poetics without gimmickry. Fossil leaf re-use is organic, not check-boxed. Risk in lyric-accumulative structure pays off: emotional cost lands without conventional plot reversals. Could edge higher if one unforeseen constraint or sacrifice had surprised the reader.</comment>
