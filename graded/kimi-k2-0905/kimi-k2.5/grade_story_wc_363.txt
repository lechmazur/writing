<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maya’s grief-hardened resolve is embodied in every micro-choice: selecting the bead, cutting her finger to glue the puzzle edges, finally surrendering her substance to the weave. The interior contradiction—clinging to memory while dissolving self—plays out in scene, not summary. The final smile crystallizes an earned renunciation whose cost is her extinction, legible on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the completed border lifts, the bead departs, Maya becomes thread—an image that reweights the premise with undeniable conceptual cost. Causality holds: because she bleeds, the puzzle binds; because she unravels herself, the message flies. The loom’s rule is taught early and paid at the end; no late rule change.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The bamboo forest’s “silver needles” of light, the skeletal apple trees, and the loom itself function as micro-settings that constrain action: darkness limits visibility, rot supplies dye, the loom demands blood. Spatial choreography is clean—bead, puzzle edges, and shuttle remain trackable. The final image of the hovering bead is charged by the orchard’s long-cultivated silence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>One dominant stake—reach the vanished daughter—tightens when each failed weave costs blood and years. The seventh recommencement forecloses every remaining option: only self-sacrifice can finish the shuttle’s path. Pressure escalates under causal lens; no coincidence resolves the gap.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the particulate image of amber trapping sound and mother trapping herself in thread—no statement required. The final dissolution answers the central question: love’s voice can cross death only by becoming silence itself. Ambiguity remains whether the daughter hears, keeping the moral complex.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays tightly fused to Maya’s perceptual filter: “sunlight fell only in silver needles,” “sound of empty sleeves.” Syntax lengthens and frays as she ages, mirroring the unraveling. No head-hopping; diction never exceeds a solitary weaver’s lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary from short gasps to winding threads; no template cadence. Figurative layering—“raveling silence,” “copper and gold cyclone”—is dense but patterned, taught early, and paid off in the hovering bead. Zero paraphrase loops; each clause advances image or stakes.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The jigsaw border as time-gate, amber beads as phonograph fossils, and self-as-thread sacrifice synthesize into a fresh metaphysical engine. Risky conceits stay grounded in tactile process: blood adhesion, salt fixative. The concept feels inevitable yet non-obvious, impossible to swap out without collapsing the story.</comment>
