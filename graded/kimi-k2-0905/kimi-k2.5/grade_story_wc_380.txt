<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mara’s lantern-lighter vocation gives her a believable eye for fissures, and her decision to pour out ritual coffee is a concrete, value-revealing micro-choice. The recovered wildflowers embody a credible cost: her trembling hands and the knowledge that “nothing about her lantern lighting would ever feel routine.” Interiority stays specific (“vibration in the marrow”) and avoids label-speak. Only minor flaw: the sister’s disappearance is referenced, not dramatized, so the emotional contradiction remains one-note.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the whale’s death gifts her the meadow flowers, rewriting absence into migration. Causal chain—whale song → fissure → coffee divination → salt vault → recovery—holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens, each beat adding density rather than because/therefore turns. Orientation is clear by word 60; gravity oddity is taught early and paid off in the “gravity-neutral hollow.” Persistent constraint: the chamber’s logic now shadows her nightly rounds, cost felt in final line.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setting is never backdrop: gravity pockets literally alter her gait, and the salt rib-cage guides her knees to dig. The beached-whale time-anchor and barnacle-matched tin root the grotto in dockside ecology. Micro-setting (the tin box) constrains the climax—its barnacle etchings confirm whale provenance, re-weighting memory. One hairline slip: spatial relation between dock and chamber left approximate, but never confuses action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“find where deleted memories go”—is signaled in paragraph 1 and tightens when coffee spirals foreclose alternative routes. The midpoint gravity shift forces a stance crystallization: she must dig or forsake answers. Cost is visible: crystalline dust under broken nails, heart synched to a dying whale’s dirge. Escalation is single deepening rather than reversal, sufficient for 700-word arc.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: deletion as migration, not erasure, re-priced by salt and cetacean sacrifice. Wildflowers shift from relic to proof that oblivion is porous. Final image—“gleaming silence below”—answers the thematic question obliquely, leaving moral complexity intact. No late moralizing; resonance is earned through tactile recovery, not assertion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays glued to Mara’s perceptual filter—“vibration in the marrow,” “frozen lightning”—creating a distinct salt-cathedral idiom. Syntax lengthens and contracts with gravity flux, a rhythmic enactment of weight. No head-hopping; knowledge stays character-bound (“she understood” arrives only after physical evidence). Dialogue is absent by design; narrative voice sustains subtext alone.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty: “she adjusted her gait to compensate for invisible tides beneath the stone” simultaneously reveals physics, body, and metaphor. Figurative language is selective, never denser than one image per high-pressure beat. Zero paraphrase loops; opening and closing lines echo “gleaming silence” with recharged meaning. One microscopic scaffold: “salt crystal growing chamber” is repeated noun-phrase, but it anchors orientation and reads intentional.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Fusing beached-whale geology with memory-salt deposits feels inevitable yet uncatalogued; the whale as courier of lost meadows is a fresh synthesis. Concept commits fully—no retreat into metaphor; gravity pockets and coffee geomancy are dramatized, not ornamental. Risky lyric accumulation paid off in closure image. Could not swap whale for shipwreck without breaking causal skin.</comment>
