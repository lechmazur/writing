<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Interiority is lush and idiosyncratic—“gripping reality loosely” is lived through synesthetic perception rather than label. Yet no contradictory impulse is staged in scene; the keeper only observes, never chooses under pressure, so the arc is static. Earned stasis is signaled (“gripping the moment loosely”) but cost is atmospheric, not dramatized on her body or future options.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the flattened swan-map reweights the library’s decay as generative, felt cost legible in “seed of silence” she carries. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern of folding/unfolding threads micro-shifts rather than causal reversals. Orientation wavers: “untold seasons” delays temporal anchoring past 120 words, but disorientation pays off in the river-twilight stasis, so penalty waived. Single transition (library→river) is legible, no prop drift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Obsidian refuge, river silt, and vine-cracked masonry are tactile and constrain her stance—she must sit, absorb, write on the swan itself. Sensory hierarchy mirrors mental loosening: visual reflections give way to haptic coolness and the river’s “microscopic increments.” Proper-noun discipline maintained; scale stays micro without encyclopedic drift. Environment charges the final image—the seed of silence is physically pressed into her spine.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Stake—witness without judgment—is declared early and reiterated, but pressure is ambient, not tightening. No beat narrows her option to interpret or flee; the swan merely reveals what she already accepts. Silence deepens as texture, yet no trade-off or reversible choice is forced. Meets single-intensification rule for lyric mode but lacks visible price that alters tactics.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme of composting knowledge emerges through recurring folds, silt, and pulp rather than statement. Final image of “seed” inside her reweights prior motifs without moralizing. Accepts complexity: decay is neither tragic nor triumphant. Avoids thematic echo; no character sermonizes the thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays tight to keeper’s perceptual drift: “stone to breathe,” “library crumbles around her in peaceful decay.” Syntax elongates then contracts, mirroring fold/unfold rhythm. No dialogue, so no voice contamination. Diction remains within arcane yet consistent archivist register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose is dense but patterned; repetition (“across the drift of untold seasons,” “regenerative silence”) functions as mantra, taught by 25% mark and paid off. Some sentences carry triple duty (image, theme, sensory anchor). Minor loop: “microscopic increments” is echoed immediately; does not touch closure. No mixed metaphors; river and paper logics stay coherent.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Folds of time-through-paper and library-as-compost feel fresh yet inevitable. Central metaphor (origami swan as living map) synthesizes memory, geology, and text. Risk in quiet stasis ending is committed, not gimmicky. Could not swap obsidian or swan without collapsing conceptual chassis.</comment>
