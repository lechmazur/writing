<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elena’s interiority is concrete—her gloved hands, the fingertip on the vine-work—but the “emotionally rational” label is asserted more than dramatized; we see her decide, not feel the cost in body. The micro-choice to frame Ashford’s love rather than condemn is sharp and stakes her reputation, yet the prior three-year wait is summarized, not lived, so the flaw/cost feels administratively rather than viscerally earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: petal drop → obligation transfers → decision to publish while framing the mayor’s guilt as love. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the station-to-memorial plan and the letter against her heart crystallize a new public story with felt civic cost. One causality micro-gap: the diary’s “final bloom” rule is stated but not sourced in any on-page botanic evidence, a hairline warp that keeps it just under 9.0.</comment>

<comment>The ivy-wrecked station is not backdrop but timeline: rosebush marks conscience, rusted departure board hosts the wren’s nest, vines mirror the manuscript border. These living parallels literally guide Elena’s methodology and final decision to preserve the site, satisfying 9+ gate. Sensory hierarchy is biased to historian’s archival gaze—glossy leaves filtering sun into “fractured emerald light”—a selective, professional lens that never slips into brochure prose.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</question><comment>Dominant stake—restore victims’ dignity before last witness dies—tightens once: the petal fall triggers publish-or-silence. Escalation is intellectual rather than adversarial; options narrow from “expose” to “expose with merciful frame,” a meaningful but quiet tightening. Cost is present—the town’s myth will shatter—but because opposition stays off-page, pressure is more conceptual than visceral, holding it under 8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</comment><comment>Theme emerges from the parallel ivy/letter vines: mercy and truth are not binaries but entwined growth. The final reconfiguration refuses villainization, offering Ashford as tragic gardener of civic peace—an angle that re-weights the massacre without excusing it. No moral is stated; the wren nesting in the departure board is the resonant image of rebuilt life atop recorded horror. This complexity lands with emotional honesty and avoids sentimentality.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</comment><comment>Third-person intimate maintains consistent psychic distance, filtering perception through Elena’s archival meticulousness: “she arranged photocopies… beside the illuminated manuscript.” Syntax grows clipped only in the final walk—“Each step echoed”—mirroring her narrowing focus. No head-hop; diction stays within a scholar’s lexicon without academic inflation. Voice is distinctive enough to carry the lyric ending without dialogue.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</comment><comment>Prose is clean, rhythm varied, no scaffold loops; figurative language is selective (“fractured emerald light”) and doesn’t clog beats. One near-muddle: “emotionally rational historian” is abstract tagging; the phrase recurs without re-embodiment, a −0.2 snag. Otherwise information density is high—every sentence layers time, object, and moral calculation—making the 8.3 ceiling safe.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</comment><comment>The conceit that a mayor planted ivy to externalize his guilt, then encoded confession in marginalia, is fresh; it fuses botanical and bibliographic clues into one investigative engine. Risk—intellectual rather than thriller—is taken and paid off: the story argues compassion can coexist with exposure, a non-ob ethical synthesis. Specificity of the 80-year-old waterproof tube and tempera massacre detail roots the premise so it can’t be swapped out wholesale.</comment>
