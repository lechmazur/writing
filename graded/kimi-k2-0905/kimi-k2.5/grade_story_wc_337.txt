<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is vivid—her cracked mask as self-inflicted lens, her acceptance of silence as weight—but the story keeps her at a single, static register of tragic clarity; no contradictory impulse ever complicates the beat-to-beat choices. The final “she had become the net” lands as conceptual, not earned by a visible shift in her tactics or emotional cost. Reflection dominates action; we’re told she understands fracture, yet the only micro-choice on stage is the unvarying needle motion. Still, the voice-specific perceptual filter is strong enough to lift her above stereotype.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens is declared early and held: each unknotted spirit layers silence into Mira’s mask until she crystallizes as the vessel. Orientation is taught rather than explicit—prism sanctuary, obsidian table, starlight blades—but the pattern is coherent and pays off in the final stillness. Closure is a Charged Poise: the silence settles, options reconfigure, cost is felt. One minor slip: the “sharing of their secret” timeframe is announced but never visibly tightens decisions; it functions as ambient confession rather than causal clock.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The prism sanctuary is not backdrop; its refracted starlight literally carves the shadows that watch and guides the needle’s glint, constraining her attention and final image. The centuries-old fisherman’s net functions as micro-setting—every knot is a soul intersection—so the body, tool, and table together form the crucible. Sensory economy is ruthless: salt-tightened knots, spectral geometries, accumulated silence as crush-weight. Environmental detail never stalls; it is threaded through each unweaving motion and mirrors her internal sedimentation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—ground the twelfth ghost or be crushed by silence—is signaled immediately. Escalation is textural: each loosened knot thickens the silence inside her mask, a deepening rather than a reversal. No secondary reversal is needed under Accumulative lens; the final settling of the last spirit reweights her existence to permanent vessel. Cost is conceptual but legible: she forecloses her own escape into death and becomes the container she once sought to empty.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: brokenness as prerequisite for holding others’ trauma. The cracked mask fills with the very silence she releases, an image that reconfigures the meaning of restoration. Subtext operates in the paradox—restorer destroys her own protection to function. No moral is asserted; the final image of absolute stillness invites multiple readings, all anchored in the concrete act of unweaving.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is dense, lyric, and consistent: syntax elongates then contracts like breath under starlight, mirroring the unweaving rhythm. Perceptual signature is specific to Mira—she sees silence as substance, starlight as blade, her own fracture as portal. No head-hop; compression and elision (“the lucid unrest,” “interlaced hush”) are taught early and repay in closure. Register never drifts into academic detachment; every clause is stained by her bodily attention.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is high-density figurative yet coherent; vehicles converge on light, silence, fracture, sediment. No synonym loops or template cadence; sentence lengths vary to mimic the tug-and-release of knots. One mixed metaphor risk—“starlight splitting darkness into manageable colors”—but context keeps it legible. Final line lands clean, no scaffolding, absolute stillness earned.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Premise—restorer unravels ghost-net silence into her own broken mask—feels新鲜 and inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric accumulation could have collapsed into purple abstraction, yet it holds under the Accumulative lens. Specificity of the fisherman’s net and ceramic mask prevents generic trauma allegory. Not quite a 9 because the core arc (self-sacrifice through absorption) retains a faint mythic template, albeit transfigured by sensorial detail.</comment>
