<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Mara’s skeptical drive is vivid from the first line, and her refusal to accept “comforting myths” propels every action. The contradiction between her contempt for superstition and her growing protectiveness toward the settlers gives her interior friction that peaks when she must persuade the very people she has unmasked. Micro-choices—tweezer-reassembling letters while her fingers blister—embody the cost of truth. The only slack is the off-stage settlers, who remain a fearful chorus rather than individuals who could pressure her status.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Causal spine is clean: because she finds shredded letters, therefore she rebuilds them, therefore she discovers the stillpoint mechanism, therefore she can recalibrate the diamond. Each beat tightens her options until the final moment when “the wasteland held its breath.” Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the protective dome expands, but the price is the settlers’ dependency on science they barely grasp, and Mara’s exile into the next storm. No orientation or lens drift; the sf logic stays internally rigorous.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The orchard is not backdrop but tactical terrain: the iron-skinned trunks she palms for radiation, the root cellar that becomes her lab, the perfect storm-circle she paces to measure the dome’s diameter. Sensory triage—amber grit in goggles, pulp under fingernails—mirrors her narrowing attention. The diamond’s “screaming mouth” crack is re-seen at the end as a frequency aperture, recharging the image. Only the wider wasteland beyond the circle stays generically sketched, keeping this just under the 9-band gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—can the grove survive once superstition is stripped away?—is signaled by line three. Escalation is incremental-scientific: each reconstructed fragment reveals the failing lattice, tightening urgency. The decisive turn is her decision to build the scavenged resonator; failure would collapse the dome in months. Cost is visible: radiation-blistered hands and the settlers’ hostility that will dog her afterward.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as an anti-morality fable: truth is salvageable but socially expensive. The cursed diamond reweights from evil talisman to cracked instrument, enacting the idea that “comfortable lies” are easier to maintain than fragile engineering. No explicit sermon; the final image of her walking “into the radioactive dark” lets the reader feel the loneliness of being the messenger who can’t stay. Subtext in the settlers’ averted gaze carries the cost better than any speech could.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Voice is hard-edged scientific romance: “iron-skinned apple trees that defied every law of nuclear physics” fuses wonder with physics violation. Syntax lengthens for hypothesis, then clips into staccato under radiation burn. Perceptual signature—Mara notices angles of dust avoidance before she notices people—stays consistent. One minor register wobble: “biological stillpoint” slides toward textbook diction, but the paragraph regains idiom through “time and mutation ceased their relentless march.”</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry triple duty: “She held the reassembled letter in her trembling hands, understanding now why the trees bore fruit without seeds and why the storms circled like hungry wolves denied entry” advances knowledge, image, and stakes in one breath. No scaffold loops, no filter-verb stacks. Metaphors stay physically coherent—storms as wolves, diamond crack as mouth—then reify into measurable frequency. Read-aloud rhythm accelerates into the final clause without tumbling into drumbeat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Post-apocalyptic “cursed orchard” could be cliché, but the stillpoint-as-frequency concept reframes it into hard-SF biological control engineering. Turning a flawed diamond’s lattice defects into a broadcast antenna is a concrete, non-obvious payoff. Risk is taken—science replaces magic—yet the story earns the shift by foregrounding Mara’s empirical mindset from line one. Freshness dips slightly because “settlers fear the scientist” arcs are familiar, but the specific calibration mechanics override the template.</comment>
