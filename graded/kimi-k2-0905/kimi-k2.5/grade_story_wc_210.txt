<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s solitude, intellectual ferocity, and refusal of nostalgia are dramatized through embodied choices—crunching shells, palms warming the bottle—giving her a sharp, particular interior edge that escalates to the renunciation of false resurrection; the earned cost is legible as the lanterns rise by human friction alone. Interior contradiction and knowledge-bound perception stay clean; no stock labels intrude. Micro-choices reveal a hierarchy that prizes invention over comfort, closing the arc with credible endurance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The causal spine holds: discovery of sealed bottle → memory compression → inward collapse → material rebirth by understood physics; each beat forecloses the prior option and lands a decisive conceptual change with visible cost—the amber dissolves, magic stays dead. Orientation is anchored within 120 words; closure delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration that reweights the world-rule. One minor slack: the “soundless” shatter could use earlier acoustic cueing to tighten causality to 9+.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Salt-rotted planks, calcified wishes, and impossible-seam glass are filtered through Elara’s analytic gaze; every tactile detail (lantern tensile strength, harbor chemistry) later feeds the reconstruction beats, constraining her final method. The cove’s post-miracle desolation and rising rational structures evolve causally, charging the final image with copper-flavored invention. Environment literally shapes the tactics that replace divine light with chemical flame.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can meaning survive after magic’s death—tightens once: the temptation to smash-to-restore is explicitly rejected, narrowing options to pure human ingenuity; the price is the permanent loss of wish-ease, felt as lanterns wobble under uncertain friction. Escalation is causal under the lens; no coincidence resolves. One deepening suffices for this length and is cleanly landed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: transcendence through limitation, luminosity earned after grace expires. The amber’s inward collapse reconfigures the concept of “wish,” charging the final lanterns with organic irony—paper fire that can fail. No moral is preached; the image of children learning to strike sparks reweights all prior miracle-dependent culture with sober grandeur. Complexity survives: comfort is gone, yet community coheres.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice fuses lyric compression with alchemical precision—“salt-rotted shacks,” “naked architecture of cause and effect”—maintaining perceptual signature under pressure. Syntax lengthens during cerebral compression, then fractures into shorter beats at collapse, teaching rhythm without head-hop. No register drift; diction stays within Elara’s learned lexicon. Controlled psychic distance pays off in the copper-tasting singularity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Varied sentence openings, purposeful paragraph cuts, high information density: each line advances image, world-rule, or interior calculation. Figurative language is selective and pattern-justified—no metaphor muddle at climax. One near-loop: “lanterns” thrice in five lines mid-reconstruction, but the beat’s pressure tolerates the echo. Otherwise zero scaffold, clean grammar, strong verbs; closing line delivers cadence payoff.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Post-wish rationalist civilization built from compressed memory-seed feels non-obvious and inevitable in hindsight. Trope of ghost-town revival is inverted—dead magic stays dead, town re-boots as maker-space. Risky inward bottle-collapse geometry is executed without clarity loss. Specificity of phosphorescent-ink recipes and memory-fiber nets anchors the concept in lived detail that could not swap into another story world.</comment>
