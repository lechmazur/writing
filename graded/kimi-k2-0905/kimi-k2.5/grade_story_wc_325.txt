<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mara’s claustrophobia and vocation as spelunker crystallize in one charged image—palm on glass, tide swallowing sun—so the internal contradiction is dramatized, not labelled. Her choice to re-enter the facility and extend the gold fleck is a visible micro-choice that escalates stakes and forecloses retreat. The final “crashing hush” she carries is a credible, embodied cost. Only the researchers remain symbolic vessels rather than relational pressure, but at this length the arc still lands.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: Mara steps into phase transition, witnesses the researchers complete migration, and exits bearing the silence—undeniable conceptual and emotional cost. Causal chain holds: gold fleck reveals path → she enters → offers beacon → tide turns → she alone emerges. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive within 50 words and stay legible. No lens ambiguity; the Accumulative/Textural pattern taught early (tidal rhythm, phase talk, refracted light) crystallizes in the final “crashing hush” image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Reinforced glass, concrete barnacle, ozone stagnation, dripping pipes—each sensory hit is selective, filtered through Mara’s professional eye and claustrophobic body. The facility’s half-submerged architecture actively guides her movement and shapes the phase-transition mechanics that permit passage. Gold fleck functions as micro-setting that constrains choice: its warming glow literally opens corridors. Final “crashing hush” recharges these anchors, making environment felt inside her bones.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“stand by the unremembered”—is signaled inside first 150 words and tightens when Mara physically offers the fleck, narrowing her option to retreat. Phase-transition corridor sequence supplies one meaningful deepening: walls breathe, pressure becomes bridge, claustrophobia shatters—cost is the silence she’ll carry. No coincidence resolves; tide’s return is external clock, not savior. Escalation is accumulative rather than multi-reversal, sufficient for 700-word window.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of bearing witness to erased presences emerges through imagery—drowned voices, quantum echoes, translated researchers—never exposition. Subtext operates in gesture: extending the fleck equals ethical commitment; accepting silence equals lifelong cost. Final image reweights premise: memory fails, presence suffices. No moralizing, only charged poise. One hairline slip—“I came back” whispers toward statement—but instantly swallowed by sensory overload.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays welded to Mara’s perceptual signature: ionic signatures, phase-transition physics, crashing hush—lexicon rooted in her vocation and neurosis. Rhythm compresses under pressure (“between tidal changes...ninety minutes”) then elongates in the hush, mirroring breath. No head-hopping; researchers’ static eyes remain externally observed. Occasional elevated diction (“margin illuminant,” “conceptual repricing”) fits specialist POV and does not leak into unintended omniscience.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sentences carry double duty—e.g., “facility existed in quantum flux, neither fully submerged nor dry” advances world-rule and stakes simultaneously. Figurative layers are disciplined: barnacle, lighthouse, highway metaphors orbit submersion/ signal axis without mixed collisions. No loops or scaffold; each paragraph advances knowledge, intention, or emotional charge. One tiny filter-stack (“she watched”) in closing line, but it serves cadence, not clutter—does not dull final image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Synthesis of spelunker claustrophobia + undersea cable ghost-transmission feels inevitable yet未被seen. Gold fleck as beacon for phase-state migrants refracts both medieval manuscript and fiber-optic tech, creating fresh mythic tech-noir. Risk of quantum-phase corridors pays off: mechanics taught early, realized in body-horror/hope fusion, charged in closure. Without these precise elements the story collapses—high specificity, high risk, high reward.</comment>
