<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Maya’s “kindly methodical” trait is shown through tactile micro-choices—wrapping fragments, choosing cache spots—but her interiority drifts toward thematic label-speak (“visibility was not always about being seen”). No second character on page, so relationship crucible N/A; her motivation is legible and stakes personal, yet the climax is a soft gesture rather than a renunciation with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: each fragment caches adds density and re-weights the stake of communal memory. Closure is a Charged Poise crystallized in the final sentence—“finally visible through the artifacts”—with conceptual cost (she remains unseen but leaves undeniable evidence). One transition (dawn arrives) is legible; no orientation debt. Persistent constraint—the need to stay hidden—shapes every tactical choice.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Library infrastructure is rendered through lived motion: pipe chases, heating grates, thermos steam on cold pipes. Sapphire hush returns as charged reprise in the last paragraph, coloring the final image. The micro-setting (rusted junction box, philosophy-stack crawl space) constrains hiding places and cache logic; no spatial drift. Enough sensorial spread (dust taste, metallic curl, flicker-light) to earn high-band without over-cataloguing.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—make the invisible audible—tightens as dawn approaches and power stabilizes, narrowing her window. One meaningful deepening: shift from solitary remembrance to public gift-giving. Cost is conceptual (perpetual invisibility) rather than visceral; because lens is accumulative, that suffices, but price is abstract not bodily. Escalation is cadence-driven, not causal reversal; still legible under chosen lens.</answer>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through concrete recurrence of magnetic breath/voice fragments; no final-paragraph sermon. The idea that archives can outlive archivists is re-weighted in last image—her “evidence” hums in walls—achieving Conceptual Repricing without overt statement. Subtext of undocumented caretaker labor stays implicit, resisting tidy moral. Minor softness: “network of sustenance” edges toward abstraction, but image still lands.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person close keeps modest psychic distance; diction (“pregnant with possibility,” “sapphire hush”) poetic but consistent with a silent, literate observer. No dialogue, so voice distinction N/A. Rhythm modulates: long accumulative sentences mirror methodical work, then tighten at dawn. Filter verbs minimal; perceptual signature stable. Experimental elision absent; clarity preserved.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud cadence varied; no template runs. Figurative language dense but pattern-taught early (“metallic insects,” “arteries beneath the reading rooms”) and paid off. Minor scaffold: “she remembered why she had begun this work” could be cut without loss. Information density high—each sentence advances cache logic or memory theme. No mixed metaphors; closure line crisp.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Premise—undocumented caretaker weaponizing obsolete oral-history fragments—feels fresh and specific. Tropes of invisible labor & archival ghosts are transformed through tactile maintenance tunnels, not attic dust. Risk taken with quiet, non-confrontational climax; payoff is conceptual visibility, not spectacle. Details (ferromagnetic breath, 1970s refugee reels) are particular; story would collapse if fragments swapped for paper scraps.</comment>
