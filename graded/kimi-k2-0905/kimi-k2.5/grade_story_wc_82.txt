<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mira’s contradictory impulses—clinging to grief while forging release—are dramatized through the physical folding of gems; the final dispersal costs her corporeal self, a price legible on the page. Interiority stays concrete, never abstracting into therapy-speak. The lantern-maker identity is more backstory than on-page pressure, but her micro-choices under escalating loss feel individual and irreversible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Mira becomes the light she has released, a Charged Poise that reweights every prior fold. Causal chain holds—each gem-crane is earned by decades of polishing and the final dispersal is irreversible. The “descend while ascend” rule is taught early, paid off in the spiral staircase image of the ending. Orientation is anchored within 120 words; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The glass basilica, gem wheel, and upward-drifting cherry petals are not backdrop; they constrain how grief can be processed—only through mineral memory and vertical flight. The tea garden’s translucent floor and starlight function as micro-setting that charges the final release. Selective sensory detail (ink-pool shadow, chiming walls) mirrors internal descent/ascent without clutter. World rules remain consistent: shadow detachment, reverse petals, gem unfolding all obey taught logic.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</question><grade>Dominant stake—transform grief into flight or be consumed by it—is signaled in paragraph four and tightens with each fold. Each crane forecloses the raw gem’s original mass; the diamond crane completes the set and ends her physical tenure. No antagonist is needed: pressure is the accumulating weight of unflown sorrow. Cost is visible—hands turn translucent, life disperses—and escalates under Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the refracted motif of folding: grief must be creased, not erased, to become lift. No moral is stated; the final image of rainbows in descending/ascending flight reweights loss as communal blessing. Subtext resides in the unspoken decade of stolen dream-gems—Mira’s secret theft from her own sleep. The luminous torment tone is maintained without sentimental assertion, letting contradiction stand.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Mira’s perceptual signature—gem dust in lungs, spiral staircase of consciousness. Syntax lengthens and compresses with the grinding wheel’s rhythm, creating prose-as-character. No dialogue appears; absence is apt for a solitary ritual. Diction stays within artisanal lexicon; elevated phrases (“architecture of mourning”) are earned by earlier patterning.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm varies naturally; no template cadence or synonym loops detected. Figurative language is dense but patterned—every mineral metaphor returns transformed at closure, avoiding purple overload. Information density is high: each line advances folding, memory, or corporeal dissolution. Final paragraph contains zero scaffolding; the last clause “diving into the heart of light” lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The gem-into-crane alchemy fuses Japanese origami funerary practice with lapidary craft, producing a fresh grief ritual unavailable in stock fantasy. Reverse-gravity petals and shadow detachment feel inevitable once taught, not gimmicky. Risk is taken by making the protagonist vanish into her own art—an ending that could feel abstract yet here carries bodily cost. Transformation test fails: swap gems for paper and the entire metaphysics collapse.</comment>
