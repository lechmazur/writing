<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elio’s pacifist-obsessive interiority is vivid and embodied (“cataloging the varieties of silence” as tactile labor), but the arc is pure ascent—no contradictory impulse or error undercuts him, so the “earned cost” test is soft. The diary opens because he already possesses the exact empathy frequency; no flaw complicates the triumph. Still, his micro-choices under pressure (tuning oscillators while fireworks threaten to drown the room) keep the portrait specific and active.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the clasp’s sigh reweights the entire metaphor system—peace is no longer absence but attuned resonance—at visible emotional cost (“tears of theatrical sincerity” and the blank page waiting to record forgiveness). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: every sensory layer (cordite, whale-bone table, hertz numbers) tightens toward the single cadence shift when 4.5 Hz clicks the lock. No orientation drift; who/where/when is anchored within 50 words.</comment>

<comment>The workshop’s nested instruments, cooling metal scent, and resonating whale-song table constrain every action; Elio must stay silent enough to hear micro-vibrations while fireworks strain the sky. Spatial choreography is clean—velvet coat brushes telescope, diary meets piano-wood, oscillators slide within arm’s reach. The “shadowed workshop under stars” re-appears at closure, now re-charged as a sanctuary where metal learned to breathe.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—recover stolen silence through empathic attunement—signaled in paragraph one. Tightening is the incremental frequency hunt; each hertz step (7 → 12 → 4.5) narrows options and raises the aural stakes as fireworks near. Cost is felt: he surrenders his own broadcast frequency, left “cataloging the varieties of silence that persisted beneath the celebration.” No reversal, but the deepening pattern satisfies Accumulative escalation.</comment>

<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through concrete reversal: silence becomes an audible, measurable substance created by mutual reception rather than abstention. Subtext lives in gesture—flowers and soil samples are wordless testimonies that listening once disarmed violence. The ending image (“the silence that follows forgiveness” entered into the diary) reweights the entire catalog without moralizing. One hairline slip: “theatrical sincerity” is self-diagnosed twice, slightly over-articulating the emotional state.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited maintains crisp psychic distance; diction (“pregnant sky,” “fossilized whale song”) stays within Elio’s poetic-technician lexicon. Rhythm modulates—long acoustic sentences contract to the staccato of tumblers clicking. No head-hop; every metaphor is filtered through his perceptual bias (fireworks as “bright wounds”). Voice distinction meets the 9+ quick test.</comment>

<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Information density is high—one sentence often layers sensory data, scientific term, and emotional charge. Figurative language is selective: sustained acoustic metaphors avoid clutter. Minor template cadence in “He detected… he shifted… he adjusted” costs −0.2. Otherwise no loops, no scaffold, no mixed metaphors; the final line varies syntax and lands clean.</comment>

<grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The empathic lock-picking via sub-audible frequencies is a fresh synthesis of sound-art, pacifist ethics, and mechanical puzzle. No trope is imported intact; even “fireworks above quiet valley” is inverted into violent wounds overhead. Conceptual risk—treating empathy as measurable hertz—pays off when the clasp literally sighs open. Specificity makes the premise feel inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
