<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Maya’s interiority is richly particular—her “virtuously mischievous instinct” is shown, not told, and drives the decisive bolt-to-diamond transformation. The contradiction between savior and scammer is held in scene, not summarized, and the final micro-choice (planting the diamond) costs her the fantasy of escape, foreclosing the path of endless flight. No head-count or relationship pressure on stage, so bullets 6–8 are N/A. Single slip: “shadowseam wonder” is briefly label-speak, but it is immediately enfleshed by the glowing farm, so the diagnostic tinge is minor.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the diamond crystallizes every broken promise with undeniable conceptual weight—she pays with her trauma turned artifact. The lens is Accumulative/Textural: the mushroom glow thickens, the texts layer, the bolt heats, the diamond refracts—each repetition reweights the stake until the final image reconfigures survival itself. Causality is lyric, not linear, but the pattern is taught by line 5 (“glitchy text messages…seventeen days”) and never breaks. No orientation debt; anchors (who/where/when) arrive within 50 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The bioluminescent mushroom farm is not backdrop but instrument: its glow shifts from “marine blue” to “violet of compressed carbon,” guiding and witnessing the alchemical turn. The submarine bolt’s threads, “worn by pressures that could crush submarines into origami,” are tactile, specific, and literally constrain her grip before the metamorphosis. Spatial choreography is immaculate: bolt clatters between rows, diamond is planted among caps, glow fractures into spectra—every object move is tracked. Setting passes the 9+ gate by charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—translate survivor-guilt into survivable form—tightens once, decisively: the bolt’s heat forces the choice to become the vessel. Pressure escalates under Accumulative lens: each text shard adds weight, glow intensifies, air hardens—density itself becomes antagonist. Cost is visible and felt: her palm learns “memory of deep-sea containment,” and the faces of failed downlines are etched into the diamond she must forever carry. No reversals needed; the single deepening is sufficient and irreversible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: pyramids of debt are rewritten as geological strata—carbon lattice as ledger. The final image (diamond planted among mushrooms) answers the core question “can guilt be transmuted?” with a non-literal, irrefutable yes. Subtext is carried by gesture: the act of planting is both restitution and restart. No moralizing line inflates the score; resonance is purely visual and tactile.</question>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is synesthetic, compressed, and consistently POV-bound: “geometry of ruined investment portfolios” is a mind that sees numbers as shapes. Rhythm accelerates with heat—short clauses mirror rising temperature; final paragraph lengthens into calm reflectiveness. No dialogue, so dialogue bullets are N/A. Patterned elision (“Maya-7…Maya-12”) is taught early and paid off at closure when all Mayas merge.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; sentences do double duty: “pressure could be alchemical” marries physics and metaphor in one breath. Figurative language is dense but coherent—every metaphor is pressure-tested against submarine physics and mycelial biology. Opening and closing lines are ear-perfect anchors. Minor micro-tautology “glow intensified…light…light” is the only detectable repetition, too small to touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>The fusion of crypto-cult crash, quantum multilevel marketing, and bioluminescent agriculture is sui generis; no extant template hosts this triangle. The bolt-to-diamond transmutation feels inevitable in hindsight yet unforeseeable on first read. Risk—lyric causal chain instead of plot reversals—heightens coherence rather than gimmickry. Fresh inflection: survivor-guilt as geological process, not therapy session.</comment>
