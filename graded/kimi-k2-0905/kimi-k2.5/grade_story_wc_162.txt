<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is textured—thumb on the spiral, knees on oak—but her “featherly determined” trait is asserted, not embodied under pressure; no contradictory impulse is staged in scene. She makes one micro-choice (stepping into the maze), yet the causality feels pre-scripted by the father’s codes rather than forged by her own visible cost. The lost-child identity is atmosphere, not crucible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: she becomes threshold, corn rows await, cost is conceptual but legible. Accumulative lens holds—pattern of refracted light, wood grain, weather codes tightens into final image. Orientation taught late (terrace rules) but payoff at exit waives penalty; still, one beat of true tightening inside the scene would lift it higher.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The drifting prism terrace is not backdrop but navigated—glass panes cast spectral geometries that Elara reads like braille, guiding her to the eastern exit. Oak tabletop functions as micro-setting: its grain supplies literal coordinates, constraining her next move. Sensory hierarchy tilts toward tactile refraction, keeping description woven through action; spatial choreography stays coherent across the slow rotation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“discover why thresholds feel sacred”—is signaled early; pressure escalates through pattern density rather than causal reversals. No visible price is exacted from Elara on the page; the cost is atmospheric loss of certainty. One meaningful deepening occurs when grain = logbook code, but it reconfirms rather than forecloses options. Enough for mid-band, not 8+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of “necessary distance” emerges through recurring optics—light gaps, corn rows, weather intervals—never named outright. Final image reweights the premise: maze as invitation to almost-meet, not imprison. Ambiguity lingers without confusion; no moral is stated. Could reach 9 if one earlier beat showed Elara paying tangible cost for maintaining distance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays tight to Elara’s perceptual filter—spectral geometries, barometric tenderness—syntax stretches but remains legible. No head-hopping; psychic distance contracts calmly under pressure. Phrase “featherly determined” is the only diction that feels author-intruded; otherwise voice is distinct and sustained. Read-aloud rhythm controlled via comma-curved cadence that mirrors slow drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>High figurative density but pattern-taught early (prism refractions, spiral maps) and paid off at exit. No mixed metaphors or synonym loops; information dual-loaded (light = map = memory). One scaffold risk: “necessary distances” nearly over-repeated in middle third, yet line remains varied. Closure image clean of artifacts.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Corn-maze-as-sanctuary-of-intervals is fresh inversion; weather codes transposed into liturgical distances synthesizes meteorology with sacred geometry in a way that feels inevitable post-collapse. Risky lyric structure holds coherence under accumulative lens. Specificity of oak-grain cartography anchors concept in tactile reality, resisting allegorical thinness.</comment>
