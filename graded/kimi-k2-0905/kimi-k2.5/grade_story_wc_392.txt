<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Maya’s contradictory impulses—empirical detachment vs. grief—are dramatized in the tunnel; her micro-choice to photograph rust while trembling shows embodied cost. The final decision to write the report *her* way is earned by the lantern-weight image, severing Elias’s grip with visible price. Interiority stays concrete, never drifts into label-speak. Flaw: “fortified vulnerability” is named, not shown in body until late.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: drought rain → body revealed → Elias dead → Maya discovers cover-up → she claims verdict. Closure is a decisive conceptual reprice: the lantern’s weight becomes her ethical authority, cost legible in the pulse-like reverberation. One tight shard, no orientation debt. Minor slack: transit-authority villainy is reported, not dramatized, but the satchel reports are physically handled, keeping causality intact.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Tunnel mud, dripping concrete, and lantern patina are filtered through Maya’s investigator gaze; every detail does double duty—oxidation pattern both evidence and metaphor. Spatial choreography is clean: body, rope, telescope, satchel stay tracked. The lantern constrains the final choice, passing the 9+ gate. One slip: “Victorian-era tunnels” is told, not tactilely sensed.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—professional silence vs. moral witness—tightens when the satchel reports prove institutional neglect. Micro-turn: lantern lifted → sound pulse reframes accident as murder-by-neglect. Cost is felt in her trembling breaths and the final weight of evidence bag. Agency is cerebral (camera, report) yet forecloses complicity; could use one more external obstacle to push higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of inherited detachment vs. moral witness emerges through iron-to-rust imagery and the lantern’s re-weighting from artifact to ethical torch. No explicit thesis; resonance pulses in the final reverberation. Ambiguity survives: her “own conscience” is claimed but not spelled out, inviting reflection. Avoids sermon; only minor echo of “controlling influence” tag-line.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person intimate channels a forensic eye: “measuring the distance between rail ties” is a perceptual signature. Syntax lengthens under grief, shortens under method—“She sealed the lantern”—without drumbeat. No head-hopping; psychic distance steady. One clause drift: “fortified vulnerability manifesting as deliberate breaths” slips toward diagnostic, but recovers in next tactile beat.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with pressure: mud-squelch, drip, pulse. No scaffold loops; each sentence advances image or causality. Figurative control—lantern as “talisman against the darkness” is single, earned. Proofreading clean; only micro-repeat of “reverberating” twice in 700 words, not dense enough to penalize.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Fuses Underground Railroad relic with modern infrastructure neglect—fresh synthesis. Drought-expose device feels inevitable, not contrived. Risk: cerebral resolution, but coherence holds. Voice specificity (“preventable death investigator”) keeps it from feeling like prompt check-listing.</comment>
