<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Maya’s contradictory impulses—pragmatic technician vs. ghost-seer—surface only in the quiet final image; earlier beats remain in observational summary. The embodied cost of her “weightless burden” is felt only in the last two lines, so the arc reads as earned renunciation rather than active struggle. Competence is balanced with genuine patience, but the ringmaster ghost is more symbol than pressure. Still, her perceptual signature is vivid and sustained.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a CR: installing the mainspring reweights the elevator as a metaphysical clock, undeniable on-page. Causal lens holds—every dust spiral and crack leads to this single reconfiguration. Cost is the transfer of the ghost’s vigilance into the machine, felt in the final “singing cables.” No orientation debt; spatial choreography inside the ticket office is immaculate.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Micro-setting triumph: the mainspring barrel and the elevator governor literally charge the final image. Dust gradients and spider-silk crack are selective, purpose-driven, never tourist-catalog. Amber late-afternoon light and vintage ticket stubs establish era without date-dump. Spatial logic is flawless—ladder, counter, shaft form a single mechanical crucible.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—“what ceilings hide”—tightens once: the crack reveals the mainspring, foreclosing the option to leave the building unchanged. The price is the ghost’s transfer of vigilance into the machine, visible in the closing hum. Escalation is accumulative/textural: dust layers thicken until the façade surrenders. One meaningful intensification suffices; no reversal needed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from pattern: maintenance of time versus entropy. No abstract statement—only the image of a coiled spring keeping “moments preserved against entropy.” Final reprise of “weightless burden” reweights the premise without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers: is the elevator now a sanctuary or a trap?</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is technician-poet: “hairline fractures in steel cables,” “dust spoke in gradients.” Syntax mirrors tactile precision—short clauses when she climbs, elongated sentences when she decodes dust. No head-hopping; ghost’s dialogue is lip-read, maintaining POV modesty. Diction stays within elevator-repair lexicon until the final lyrical lift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Rhythm accelerates during ladder climb, then breathes into longer cadence for the install moment. No loops; each sentence either advances mechanism or atmosphere. Metaphors are internally consistent—dust galaxies, spider-silk crack—never mixed. One near-scaffold: “amber hush” is saved by sensory specificity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Premise fusion—elevator tech + ghost maintenance of time—is non-obvious and feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk taken: a quiet install beat as climax, yet the conceptual repricing lands. No borrowed circus tropes beyond the ringmaster; the mainspring as metaphysical heartbeat is fresh. Transformation test fails if Maya is swapped with any generic investigator—her trade crafts the lens.</comment>
