<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction is legible—she weeps while archiving, feeling the wall’s mnemonic shudder—yet the micro-choice that would foreclose a path (speak the next story aloud vs. seal the case) is only gestured at, not dramatized with visible cost. The perceptual trait is embodied through concrete wall-touch and dye-stained fingers, but the ending renunciation remains implicit rather than irrevocable on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the final sentence crystallizes the option to speak, reweighting the axis-shift premise with conceptual cost—“translating walls into words, dragons into deliverance.” Accumulative lens holds; the tapestry and diaries pattern-break the quiet into historical pressure. The single causal tightening—tapestry decoded as axial map—suffices for 700-word scale.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setting is micro-scaled to concrete, silk, ash; the fireplace as access point constrains the probe and charges the final image with smoke-smell. Spatial choreography is clean (cross-legged placement, palm-to-wall) and the reclaimed silo library mirrors internal vacancy. The bronze quiet tone saturates every sensory pick, evolving from descriptive texture to thematic pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“collect stories before silence petrifies”—is signaled early and tightens once: the tapestry fragment proves the axis is storiable, forcing Elara to decide whether to voice or archive. Cost is felt (dye-stained fingers, tears on dragon wing) but not yet paid in irrevocable loss; escalation is accumulative density, not causal narrowing. Sufficient for length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges as the transference of dream-storage from minds to architecture; no moral is stated—final image of spoken bronze quiet reweights the motif. Subtext operates in the dragon’s watching knot and the wall’s mnemonic shudder. Complexity is honored: restoration may be impossible, memory may be the only surviving axis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person free-indirect texture is steady, with perceptual signature—“sensitively perceptive nerves extending into the aggregate”—that colors every clause. Rhythmic control peaks in the final lyrical cadence without head-hopping. No dialogue to test, but narrative voice remains character-bound and pressure-responsive.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is high-density with no loops or scaffold; figurative language (“dragons coiled around a tree that bore fruit like stars”) is selective and paid off. Syntax breathes with scene tempo—long reflective sentences, then staccato “She pressed her palm.” No mixed metaphors or register drift under peak pressure. Clean mechanics.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses post-apocalyptic quiet with archival archaeology; tapestry-as-axial-diagram is non-obvious and inevitable once revealed. Risk-taking in lyric accumulation pattern heightens coherence without gimmickry. Specificity of undyed wool and crimson knot eye prevents genericization; transformation test passes—story fails without silo, dragons, axis.</comment>
