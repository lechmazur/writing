<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias’s guilt is palpably embodied in salt-raw hands and the stopped watch; his micro-choice to arrange the carvings rather than flee crystallizes a hierarchy of values. Interiority avoids label-speak, instead filtering remorse through tactile detail. The final renunciation—bearing witness instead of seeking absolution—earns its cost via the prior causal chain of erasure and recovery. Flaw: the decision to “find the daughter tomorrow” is declared, not dramatized, softening the felt price at closure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the watch hand punctuates a row of reclaimed truths, reweighting Elias’s crimes with undeniable conceptual cost. Causal lens holds throughout—each carving discovered tightens his obligation. Orientation is secure within 120 words. The sole slack is the off-page future meeting; consequences are legible but not yet paid, keeping the score below 9.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The cobalt terrace, salt-stung skin, and driftwood chronology function as micro-setting that actively constrains action: splinters slow the search, tide-line dictates time. Selective sensory detail (bleached oak, frozen 4:17) mirrors internal erosion. Environment supplies both evidence and penance, charging the final image. Spatial choreography remains coherent across the single-scene window.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—measuring the mass of a life stolen—tightens through each carving found; options narrow from denial to witness. Escalation is accumulative: every new wooden year intensifies the ethical gravitational pull. No reversals needed; the deepening density suffices. Cost is visible in raw palms and the watch’s accusatory stillness, though the ultimate price is deferred to tomorrow.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly: heritage is carved, not inked; erasure cannot survive material love. Subtext lives in the driftwood smiles that outlast forged certificates. The final image reweights “legitimacy” without moralizing. Ambiguity persists—Elias remains flawed—inviting reflection on reparations that can never balance the ledger.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person prose carries a perceptual signature attuned to texture and weight—salt, splinters, gilt—consistent with a genealogist who once traded in paper certainties. Rhythm swells and subsides with wave-crash cadences, mirroring emotional tide. No dialogue to distort voice. Filter verbs are minimal and motivated. Distinct diction sustains through the final sieved hush.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; information density is high. Occasional elevated phrasing—“conceptual gravity,” “specific gravity of his crimes”—edges toward register drift but remains within Elias’s reflective lexicon. No loops or mixed metaphors. One paraphrase loop: “weight of unspoken words” echoed as “weight of what he had learned.” Closure image remains clear.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Forging bloodlines via driftwood chronology offers a fresh inversion of archive-as-truth. The premise—black-market genealogist dismantled by wooden folk art—synthesizes familiar guilt and originality. No derivative echoes. Risk in lyrical compression pays off; the concept commits fully without retreat.</comment>
