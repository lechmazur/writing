<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid—"arms of steel… cradle empathy" embodies the contradiction—but the retrocognitive torrent is recalled more than enacted; no moment shows Kael overwhelmed or nearly mis-stepping, so the promised flaw stays off-stage. Final renunciation lands because the pocketed tessera carries tactile cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the act of fitting the chip renames the plaza and reweights the entire moral calculus under the Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is swift; causality is interior but legible. Persistent constraint—the retrocyclic visions—shapes the final quiet act.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Vitrified sand, blistered star-wings, lapis chip—each detail is filtered through Kael’s tactile mission and returns in the final image. The micro-setting (stepping-stone mosaic) literally guides the renaming gesture, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography holds across the single continuous scene.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—keep the wound visible vs. council erasure—tightens once when Kael presses the tessera into the crack, foreclosing the sanitize-versus-pave option. Cost is the perpetual retrocognitive burden they accept; pressure grows via density of overlapping time-visions rather than external antagonism.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of "aberrant mercy" emerges through concrete negatives—refusal to heal, refusal to memorialize—culminating in the charged poise of "Cradle." No moral is stated; the renaming reconfigures grief into endurance without consolation, inviting counter-readings on complicity and witness.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person voice carries a controlled liturgical cadence that modulates into spare declaration at the climax. Diction stays within Kael’s plausible lexicon; no filter-verb stacks. Distinct perceptual signature—time-layered synesthesia—remains consistent without head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentences open with shifting parts of speech. A single paraphrase loop ("mercy of bearing witness without flinching… holding pain so it does not metastasize") costs −0.2. Otherwise high density—each sentence advances image or moral stakes—and zero mixed metaphors in the climactic beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fusion of retrocognitive scifi with mosaic micro-repair feels fresh; the premise turns urban-renewal debate into ontic surgery on memory itself. Transformation test passes—story collapses without the tessera-as-seal mechanism. Risk in nonlinear time-stacking is purposeful and paid off.</comment>
