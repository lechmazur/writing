<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Maya’s investigative drive is vivid and embodied—every anemometer reading, every boot-crunch of crystallized residue shows her mind at work. The patch acts as both compass and moral tether, grounding her choices in Chen’s fate. Interiority stays concrete, never drifting into label-speak; her “smile despite the respirator” crystallizes the cost of knowledge. The only gap: we never feel a contradictory impulse that might complicate her relentless forward motion.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the fog’s “predictable spirals” reweight the entire maze—Chen died because these containers angled exactly so. Causal chain holds from rupture → wind shear → ignition; the patch’s thermal escape is the final, legible fluke. Orientation is clean within 120 words; no teleporting props. Cost is felt in the whisper she now hears—foresight bought with a man’s life.</comment>

<comment>Container walls, rivet counts, and sulfur-lit clearings are filtered through Maya’s metrological gaze, never touristic. The ten-meter scorched clearing constrains her final mapping and becomes the charged image that reconfigures stakes. Micro-setting (the patch, the anemometer) doubles as tool and relic, altering tactics. Spatial choreography is flawless: every velocity drop or spike is anchored to named corridors.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—decode the wind to prevent the next death—tightens when each measurement confirms Chen’s inescapable trap. One meaningful deepening: realizing the containers themselves are baffles, not neutral backdrop, narrows her moral option to witness and record. No false cliffhangers; pressure accumulates via data, not danger theatrics. Cost is conceptual but undeniable: the silence ends filled with currents she can now predict yet never undo.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as the murderous intimacy between human geometry and atmospheric chance—no sermon required. The patch’s survival versus Chen’s death embodies the cruel lottery of thermal updrafts. Final image reweights “foresight” from professional virtue to haunted obligation. A hairline slip: “hazily beautiful in its terrible inevitability” flirts with overt thematizing, though it remains anchored to visual data.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays welded to Maya’s perceptual lens—numbers, eddies, sulfur light. Syntax lengthens when she calculates, compresses when she moves, a rhythmic map of attention. No filter-verb stacks; “she photographed the wind measurements” is action, not exposition. Lexicon stays within her professional register without ever sounding like a manual.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet breathable: “rust-red and slate-gray walls forming unnatural canyons” does double world/character work. One paraphrase loop—“wind spoke of pressure differentials and thermal layers” followed immediately by “how the gas had pooled and eddied”—costs a tenth. Otherwise every sentence advances knowledge or atmosphere. Final line’s whisper is earned, not ornamental.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Industrial-disaster noir recast as forensic meteorology feels fresh; the container maze as wind-tunnel is a specific, non-obvious synthesis. Risk taken: climax is a data epiphany, yet the prose makes numbers visceral. Patch-as-talisman avoids sentiment by remaining a scrap of evidence. Could not swap setting or method without collapsing the entire causal lattice.</comment>
