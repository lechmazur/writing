<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s monomaniacal drive to unpick destiny is rendered through tactile micro-choices—winding counter-clockwise, fitting stone to axle. The contradiction between terror of death and exhilaration of erasure is kept active in scene, culminating in the costly renunciation of linear existence. Interiority occasionally drifts toward grand abstraction (“the tyranny of having one”), trimming the top band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a clear Decisive Change: the beam reverses, erasing her fatal chronology and leaving the rewritten stone. Causal chain—yoyo mechanics decoded → stone keyed → lens reversed → fate unwritten—holds without gaps. Cost is visible in her corporeal erasure and the inscription’s mutation; the lighthouse resumes without her, fate intact for the world.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Kelp, brass, tide-breath, and moon-guzzling stone create a coherent maritime micro-cosmos. The lighthouse interior is economically sketched through action—gears, shaft, beam—rather than catalog. Environment directly constrains final tactic: exposed hunger stone is reachable only at lowest ebb, anchoring time to space.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—escape pre-written death—cycles upward pressure: famine stone surfaces → offers key → demands irreversible gamble. Single meaningful tightening at the shaft-fit: proceed and risk non-being, or retreat and accept cancerous fate. Agency drives reversal; no external savior; the price paid is her physical continuity.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of determinism versus self-authorship emerges from mechanical inversion rather than sermon. Latent radiance, hunger stone, and counter-spin form a returning pattern whose final reweighting (“Weep no more”) reframes 1642 famine as surmountable. Ambiguity remains: transcendence or erasure—reader must decide, satisfying complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is sharp, marine, and clock-precise: “neatly inventive precision,” “geological sleep.” Syntax mirrors mechanism—balanced clauses like gear teeth—then fractures into luminous fragmentation at climax. Perceptual signature filters every image through engineer-calibrated attention; no head-hop or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Sentences are dense but propulsive; figurative layers serve concept (light that feeds). No loops, no mixed metaphors, no filler. Variation in cadence accelerates during unwinding sequence, slowing to awe-struck brevity at vanish-point.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fusing famine-marker with child’s yoyo to crack time is fresh, risk-laden, and inevitable in hindsight. Maritime gothic meets thermodynamic metaphysics without gimmick. Specificity of brass axle fitting carved groove grounds the fantastic in tactile engineering, preventing allegorical drift.</comment>
