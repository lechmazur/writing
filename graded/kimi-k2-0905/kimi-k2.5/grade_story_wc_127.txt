<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Kael’s professional thoroughness is shown through ritualistic vial-arrangement and methodical blotter use; the interior contradiction—commerce vs. bridge-building—surfaces only in final admission, never complicating a mid-scene choice. Static-alert cue is bodily, but emotional embodiment stays abstract (“affectionate detachment” is named, not felt). Because the decisive beat (offering the petal) repeats earlier procedure without new micro-choice or visible cost, the turn feels incremental, not fully earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the counterfeit becomes real via grotto resonance, reweighting Kael’s premise with undeniable conceptual cost. Causal chain holds—static surge → petal activation → genuine tears—though “ancient resin supplies missing authenticity” is slightly convenient. Orientation is clear by 120 words; one shard, no teleport. Accumulation lens dominates; the final image crystallizes options with felt cost, satisfying quick test.</comment>

<comment>Amber walls pulse like lungs, resin tears harden in real time, and static arcs provide tactile choreography; the grotto actively supplies the missing authenticity, charging the final image. Selective sensory triage—resin scent, crackling air, fossilized gold eyes—keeps description lean yet immersive. Environment directly constrains the emotional alchemy; no spatial drift or white-room syndrome.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—Kael’s secret wish to fuse insight with empathy—emerges early; pressure tightens when the grotto over-delivers, forcing recognition that half-truths may ossify into irreversible truth. One meaningful deepening: counterfeit empathy subsumes fear, then mutates into genuine wonder, foreclosing Kael’s comfortable detachment. Cost is legible in the client’s irreversible amber-tears and Kael’s shaken “uncertainty colored the words.”</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of authenticity vs. artifice emerges through resin that petrifies fake sorrow into real fossilized grief, avoiding explicit thesis. Subtext resides in the blotter petal’s color shift and the client’s resin tears—images, not exposition. Final line reframes earlier commerce as perpetual experiment, inviting reflection without moralizing. Echo of “half truth” in closing cadence reweights prior material with conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Lyric third-person channels Kael’s precise, alchemical lexicon—“synthetic sorrow,” “benzoin ghost-scents”—maintaining rhythmic compression. Static-sense motif is pattern-taught early and paid off in visible arcs. No head-hopping; internal stance stable. Occasional elevated diction (“conceptual repricing” moment) stays within Kael’s professional idiom.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive, each sentence layering scent, charge, and metamorphosis. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors; figurative language is controlled to three sharp images per beat. Opening and closing lines bookend with amber breath/pulse, creating cadence frame. Minor filter verb (“Kael felt it as…”) does not stall momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Counterfeit-emotion dealer in a breathing amber grotto fused with static-sense mechanic feels novel yet inevitable. Transformation of perfume blotter into substrate for genuine fossilized tears synthesizes concept and object. Risk in lyric speculative mode heightens coherence without obscuring stakes. Premise is specific to this voice; removal would collapse the entire narrative.</comment>
