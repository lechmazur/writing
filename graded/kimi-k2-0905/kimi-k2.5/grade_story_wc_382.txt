<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maya’s interiority (“I don’t know how to interrogate the walls without seeming mad”) is concrete and stakes her social self-image; her decision to press her own seal beside Elias’s crystallizes her arc with visible cost—accepting spectral complicity. The contradiction between craving knowledge and fearing lunacy is held throughout, embodied in tactile micro-choices (fingertips on molding, pressing copper). Elias functions more as oracle than crucible; because his ghost-state is never tested or jeopardized, he supplies pressure without personal risk, capping this just below 9.0.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Maya’s name set in mortar rewrites the building’s grammar and her place in it, cost paid by permanent ontological complicity. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each meteor shower and seal impression layers density until the final copper press reweights the stake. Orientation is clean by 120 words; causality remains coherent under “agreed-upon lies” logic. No meaningful artifact touches the final image; the bricks’ sigh is legible payoff.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Art-Deco grooves, brass seal, and rooftop copper flashing act as micro-setting that constrains Maya’s literacy attempts; the carnelian seal literally leaves dated impressions that change her next move. Sensory selection skews tactile and auditory—radiator hisses, warm concrete—filtered through Maya’s epistemic desire. Spatial choreography is clean across rooftop and hallway beats; meteor timing anchors global clock. The seal reappears in the final image, directly charging closure, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—learn or remain deaf to the building—is signaled on page one; pressure tightens when Elias demands “agreed-upon lies” that cost Maya normal social footing. Mid-story she risks credibility by returning weekly with empty sugar ruse, foreclosing straight-forward living. Final seal press narrows options: she is now inscribed in the structure, ontologically bound. Cost is legible in the mortar’s irreversible inclusion of her name.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through palimpsest grammar: history is readable only if one consents to spectral complicity. Subtext operates in silence about Elias’s death and the never-empty sugar bowl—objects carry the lie. Final image of two seals side-by-side reweights “truth” as communal inscription rather than factual accuracy, avoiding moral statement. The aftereffect is uncannyquiet—reader senses architecture now watches them.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays strictly with Maya; perceptual signature favors alphabetic metaphors (“grooves…like teeth in a key”) signaling her literacy drive. Syntax lengthens during descriptive awe, shortens at each seal press, mirroring breath. Elias’s dialogue—“We seal our letters to preserve intent”—carries subtext about death and preservation, rhythmically distinct from Maya’s tentative speech. No head-hopping or register drift; voice control heightens final copper flash without obscuring causality.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Sentences perform double duty: “The cornice brackets are questioning pronouns” advances both world rule and theme. Metaphors are architecturally coherent; no mixed vehicles. Zero paraphrase loops; each descriptor adds new informational layer. Occasional elevated diction (“ontological,” “palimpsest”) fits POV’s scholarly desire without cluttering peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses ghost-tutorial with architectural semiotics—fresh yet inevitable. Desk-seal-as-translation-device literalizes “impressed by history,” transforming mundane repair into epistemic trespass. Risk of gimmickry is averted by grounded sensory handling and consistent rule set. Specificity of extinct alphabets in seed-packet labeling makes the spectral linguist memorable, not archetypal.</comment>
