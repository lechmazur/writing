<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elena’s interiority is concrete—charts under her fingernail, headset badge catching sodium light—but “cautiously hopeful” is stated four times rather than shown through shifting risk calculus. Micro-choices (patching generator, pushing transmitter past redline) track her hierarchy of values; cost appears in trembling hands and ozone smell. The flaw: no contradictory impulse on the page—she never wavers or doubts the subsonic plan—so the arc is linear, not crucible. Still, the endurance costs her physically and socially, earning a credible Earned Stasis.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: because she maps the pulsar peak, therefore she rigs the sub-20 Hz counter-signal; because she overdrives the transmitter, the town wakes. Closure lands as Decisive Change with visible cost—sparks, rattling coffee cups, building nearly in two places at once. Orientation is crisp within 50 words; only nitpick is the 17-minute ticking clock is named once and never tracked, softening urgency. Cost is undeniable in the final image of her slumped against the scorched console.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The transmission room’s dust, sodium light, and ozone stench are filtered through Elena’s professional gaze—astronomical charts used as tactile tools, not décor. The university radio station is more than postcard: its ancient copper wiring and overworked cooling fans become the physical conduit that can be pushed past safe limits, shaping her final tactic. Micro-setting succeeds: the charts flap in the self-generated breeze, recharging the opening image at closure. Would need one more sensory anchor (temperature or vibration on her skin) to breach 9.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—stop the cosmic tricksters’ discord broadcast—signaled in paragraph three and tightened when she decides to weaponize the very array they exploit. One meaningful escalation: turning the transmitter past rated capacity, sparks flying, trading equipment life for dimensional anchor break. The cost is on-page (sparks, ozone, building phase-shift) and alters later options—the station may be ruined, the town’s trust already is. No redundant reversals; one decisive because/therefore pivot suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges obliquely: human-scaled ingenuity plus imperfect machinery can counter cosmic malice, but social fabric stays torn. Subtext lives in objects—charts first as academic props, finally as battle orders; the brick dropped by the woman mirrors the one that could have flown through the studio window. No moralizing line tells us “hope is costly”; the final image of Elena smoothing creased paper with trembling hands lets silence carry the weight. Ambiguity remains: will the town forgive itself? Theme profits from that open wound.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elena’s scientific perceptual filter: “celestial signal interpreter’s badge,” “harmonic resonance,” “quantum wavelengths.” Syntax lengthens under caliper-like observation, then fractures into shorter beats as overload hits—rhythmic mimicry of rising frequency. No dialogue, so voice distinction clause is waived. Academic diction never drifts into satire; it’s motivated by her training and undercuts itself with visceral cues—“thumbs pressed against her temples”—keeping proximity honest.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong read-aloud rhythm with varied sentence openings; no template cadence detected. Figurative language is selective: “galaxies in the stale air” opens, then yields to tactile verbs—“patched,” “rattling,” “slumped.” One mixed metaphor risk—“power plays of ancient cosmic entities” beside “gambling with civilizations”—but coherence recovers. Information density high; paragraphs advance physics, emotion, and stakes simultaneously. Minor scaffold: “cautiously hopeful” repeated four times; trimming two would sharpen.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: SETI horror meets community radio—subsonic sabotage as love letter to dying analog tech. Tricksters feeding on harmonic discord is mythic, yet the counter-weapon is grounded in transmitter specs and OSHA-overload sparks. Transformation test fails if relocated to Twitter feed or fiber-optic hub; the gritty copper era is essential. Risk taken—cosmic scale in <800 words—pays off via concrete micro-machinery, not abstract starlight.</comment>
