<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The oracle’s interiority is vivid—her cataloging reflex, her barefoot pacing, the booklet flaking onto her skin—but she never makes a micro-choice that risks anything; the “final coordinate” is only noted, not enacted, so the renunciation feels reported rather than paid for. Still, her perceptual signature is singular and consistent, carrying the piece.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the booklet empties, the night is internalized, the map now lives in her body—cost is the loss of external record and the self-subsumption into silence. The accumulative/textural lens holds: each catalogued hush layers density until the final star’s extinction reweights the whole frame. No orientation debt; pattern taught by 25% and paid off.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The fort’s wet stones, arrow-slit winds, and flooded courtyard are tactile and bias-filtered; the crumbling gold leaf becomes a micro-setting that ultimately constrains the final act (its absence forces internalization). Weather and architecture evolve with the oracle’s attention, charging the closing image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—complete the map before total darkness—tightens once when the last star winks out and the booklet gutters to fiber; options narrow to internalization or failure. Pressure is coherent under the textural lens; cost is the oracle’s surrender of external record and voice. No reversal, but the deepening is decisive.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges inexorably: history is knowable only through its absences. The reprise of flaking gold, submerged pebbles, and star-extinction reweights silence from void to substance. No moralizing; the final image of oracle-as-map offers charged ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person lingers inside the oracle’s perceptual circuitry—syntax lengthens or contracts with the viscosity of each hush, diction stays within her arcane lexicon. No head-hop; patterned repetition (“the ___ hush”) is taught early and pays off in the marbled cadence of the final paragraph.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Rhythm breathes with pressure—long sibilant sentences for viscous quiet, staccato fragments when pebbles click. Figurative layering is dense but purposeful, never muddling causality. One scaffold loop (“the ___ hush” intro) is intentional motif, not artifact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The conceit—cartography of silence via negative space—feels inevitable yet uncannily fresh; the flaking gold booklet as data-storage that transfers itself onto the cartographer’s body is a specific, un-stolen image. Risk in lyric accumulation is high, yet coherence is maintained without gimmickry.</comment>
