<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mara’s interior contradiction—healer turned betrayer—presses every micro-choice; the synesthetic ache, marrow clock, and final self-fitting of the device all body her guilt. Motivation stays singular and intensifies, culminating in the earned stasis of bearing witness rather than repair. No second character on stage, so relationship/status bullets correctly inert.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each recorded absence thickens pattern until the cold forge imprints silence into hardware, reweighting meaning. Closure is a Charged Poise—Mara slots the aid, hears her own exhalation as cost, orchard and wrecks vibrating in sympathy; options foreclosed, cost felt. Orientation anchors (greenhouse dome, shipwreck ring, aurora) arrive by line 5; no debt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The forge, oscilloscope, and synesthetic aurora constrain tactics: only the ashen surface can temper absence into physical sound. Pressure-governed perception—burning lungs, copper-tasting chord—keeps detail selective. Final image reuses forge and wrecks as re-weighted antennae of grief, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“find the sound of trust breaking”—is declared early; each collected silence tightens the pattern, narrowing to the sepia betrayal of the child patient. No external reversals needed; deepening suffices under Accumulative lens. Cost legible: marrow division, forge cooling, final exhale.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from accreted absences: intangible memories scar tissue. Final re-pricing—“memories do not fade; they change frequency”—reweights every prior silence without moralizing. Subtext in shipwrecks-as-betrayal and orchard-as-unfallen-fruit resonates unsaid.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dense, rhythmically controlled lyricism—“rust forming on steel” for trust breaking—stays inside Mara's synesthetic lexicon. No dialogue, so bullets correctly ignored. Patterned elision (“the ghosts of apples that never fell”) taught early and paid off at close.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and syntax; high information density—“compressed silence gathered from empty rooms” does double work. One paraphrase loop spotted (“she heard… she heard…”) mid-scene, minor enough to keep below artifact cap. No figurative muddle in peak beat; closure image crisp.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Synthesis of marine graveyard, synesthetic acoustics, and cold forge as memory-anvil feels inevitable and fresh. Risk in turning a greenhouse into a “library of silences” heightens coherence without gimmickry. Premise could not survive relocation; specificity anchors it.</comment>
