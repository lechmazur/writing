<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation to “transform scars into stories” is concrete and embodied; the crystallization trait forces micro-choices (writing on her own skin, holding breath) that escalate stakes. Interiority stays specific—no therapy-speak—and the final manuscript page is earned. The only drag is a slight over-calibration of competence: she never mis-writes or hesitates once the quill bites, so struggle feels managed rather than raw.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal chain is clean: held breath → quill ritual → scar-shed → manuscript → storm resumes. Each beat changes her physical options and the platform’s safety. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the tea ceremony is now charged with the text of her survival, cost paid in permanent skin and imminent weather. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The floating tea platform, bruised cloud-light, and quartz dust operate as micro-setting that literally supports and then holds her shed narratives. Sensory selection narrows to touch and sound under altitude stress, guiding the quill strokes. The ozone scent returns in the final thunderclap, re-weighting the “breath between storms” frame. One minor slip: spatial relation between platform and observatory below is mentioned once then abandoned.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—loss of manual dexterity versus need to complete inscription—is signaled early and tightens with each scar removed. The held-breath clock forces acceleration; the last sternum scar’s resistance provides the single meaningful tightening. Cost is visceral: smooth skin where crystals grew, plus pages that can never be revised. No external coincidence dilutes pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: trauma externalized as mineral, then re-authored as communal text. The childhood chant and tear-ink refuse scholarly detachment, letting superstition and body fluid co-author knowledge. Final image—tea served beside the rustling manuscript—re-prices the academy’s definition of valid evidence. No moralizing line tells us what to feel; the pages simply exist, flammable in the coming rain.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays latched to Elara’s perceptual filter: crow-quill softness, crystal fracture sound, “mineral fingers” metaphor. Syntax lengthens during inscription, then snaps short at release, mirroring breath. No head-hop; diction remains within a scholar-poet lexicon without drifting into faux-archaic. One tiny filter-verb cluster (“she felt,” “she watched”) mid-scene, but immediacy recovers.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet breathable: “saturated hush,” “bruised purple light,” each image doing double duty for mood and physics. No scaffold loops; sentences vary in length and opening. Metaphors stay coherent (storm/breath/crystal all phase-changes). A single mixed micro-image—“electric scent”—is borderline, but ozone does carry metallic taste, so physics holds. Final line lands with leaf-rustle auditory snap.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Body-as-manuscript is not new, yet the runic scholarship frame, altitude hypoxia, and tea-ceremony platform synthesize into a singular ritual. The inversion—academic inscription requiring childhood superstition—subverts rationalist fantasy tropes. Risk is taken: a whole magic system birthed in 700 words, but pattern is taught early and closure obeys it. Specificity of quartz scars and tear-ink keeps the concept from feeling generic.</comment>
