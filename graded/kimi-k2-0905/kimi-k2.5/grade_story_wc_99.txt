<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Mara’s slow-spoken, tidal interiority is consistent and embodied; the pruning micro-choices visibly enact her need for release, and the final “forgiveness” stance is earned through the compass-and-lace causality. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in scene—reflection dominates action—so the arc stays just shy of 9+ eruption.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each return of the compass/lace tightens the emotional pattern until the “forgiveness” knot reweights the stake; the final bonsai placement is a Charged Poise with felt cost. Orientation is anchored by word 50; causality is preserved inside the lyric pattern; no teleports or amnesia.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Salt-breath workshop, cliff-edge tide, rainwater on needles—every detail is filtered through Mara’s grief-attuned eye and constrains her pruning choices. The ghost-ship compass functions as micro-setting that literally steers her last walk and final placement; environment is inseparable from action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“find the color of unspoken apologies”—is signaled early; pressure escalates via compass spins and lace shadows that foreclose denial. The final wiring of the cascade bonsai is the visible price/forfeiture that crystallizes her stance; cost is legible, though single-threaded.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the tidal return of memory and the pruning-for-release counter-pattern; no explicit thesis is stated. The cerulean regret reweights from storm-color to cultivated hue in the final image—an earned Conceptual Repricing that invites reflection without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited cleaves to Mara’s slow, salt-weathered perception; rhythmic, oceanic syntax mirrors her cadence without monotony. No head-hop; diction stays within her lexicon (“rhythmically placid intervals,” “cerulean regret”); patterned elision is taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and tide-like surge; figurative language is dense but controlled by the accumulative design—no mixed metaphors. One scaffold loop: “rhythmically placid intervals” appears twice in opening and closing; otherwise zero paraphrase churn, high propulsion, clean mechanics.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Ghost-ship compass + bobbin-lace navigation code fuses maritime and textile lore into a fresh grief-tech; the bonsai-as-map image feels inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric structure holds coherence without gimmickry, though the premise’s core (grief as tide) is familiar terrain.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Setup: Mara’s slow speech seeded in line 1. Development: her cadence dictates the pruning tempo, buys time to read lace. Payoff: final whisper merges with surf tempo—cost is the time she needed to reach forgiveness. Removing the trait collapses the story’s rhythmic armature.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>Setup: compass introduced paragraph 5. Development: spins guide her to cliff, then to oldest juniper. Payoff: stills at “forgiveness” angle atop finished bonsai—reweights entire quest. Object is handled in three functionally different beats; story logic fails without its needle.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Setup: “tides of remembrance” named paragraph 7. Development: surge brings Elias vision, compels pruning style shift. Payoff: final acceptance that tides will keep returning—charges Charged Poise. Concept actively shapes tactics and final stance.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Setup: “rhythmically placid intervals” opens text. Development: pace steadies her hands during wiring, mirrors wave period. Payoff: final spoken words match surf rhythm—links grief to breath. Trait constrains action tempo and emotional regulation; removal breaks cadence arc.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Setup: afternoon light diffuses through lace early. Development: projected shadows teach her cerulean exists in negative space. Payoff: closing spectrum image of ocean/sky diffusion—redefines apology color. Single verb threads three beats and reweights theme.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Setup: lace pattern discovered paragraph 4. Development: kanji-like knot instructions dictate pruning-for-release, not control. Payoff: final wiring follows lace map to cascade shape—compass rests on bonsai. Method mechanics drive middle action and final form; story collapses without woven instructions.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Setup: “breezy islet after rain” line 2. Development: salt air corrodes grief, ozone scent triggers chest-ache memory. Payoff: same scent returns in last paragraph, now signaling healing. Setting supplies sensory resource that marks emotional shift; not indispensable but strongly causal.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Setup: “three weeks since the severance” anchors clock early. Development: time passage allows first lace discovery, then full tide cycle. Payoff: single afternoon completes forgiveness arc—temporal compression feels tidal rather than rushed. Clock is live but not a countdown; frames grief season.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Setup: color quest named paragraph 10. Development: mistaken search in water, redirected to space between waves, then found in needles. Payoff: cerulean regret cultivated, not survived—reweights apology from storm to palette. Desire drives every pruning cut and final image.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Setup: “cerulean” whispered mid-text. Development: tone modulates from aqueous sorrow to breathable pigment. Payoff: final spectrum of ocean/sky diffuses regret into lived color. Tone coherent across turns and charges the Charged Poise; removal drains the emotional afterglow.</comment>
