<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory pulls—scientist vs. seeker—surface in gesture (the feather clench) and the choice to exhale with the ghost, but interiority sometimes drifts into lyric label (“rhythm of belonging”). The final renunciation (letting the ghost go) is earned because their shared breath literally powers the facility, so the cost is visible. Still, her professional lens (“tectonic astrology”) remains asserted rather than shown in micro-decisions, capping depth.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of bioluminescence, breath, and star-alignment layers until the synchronized exhale catalyzes the generator, a resonant reconfiguration that reweights isolation into shared vigil. Anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 3 and remain stable. One minor causality gap: the facility’s need for “biological signal” is revealed only when seals groan, not set up, but the final image pays the cost as the ghost dissolves and Elara ascends alone.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Underwater dome, hydrostatic chambers, and emerald plankton are filtered through Elara’s astrologer eye; starlight fracturing through currents is both sensory and symbolic, guiding her sextant-like feather. The setting constrains the climax: only the glass interface lets their twin breaths register carbon, activating the luminous respite that saves the data. Spatial choreography stays clean—no drifting walls or impossible distances.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“belonging vs. isolation”—tightens when the facility’s imminent collapse forces cooperation with a ghost. The shared-exhale beat narrows options from solo calculation to mutual vulnerability, escalating under Accumulative pressure. Cost is legible: the ghost’s fulfilled purpose dissolves him, leaving Elara literally rising alone. Could edge higher if the sunrise deadline had compressed choices more palpably across beats.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of belonging as frequency, not place, emerges through recurring breath-and-light imagery rather than exposition. The burnt feather’s reprise on the console beside fading data silently reframes loss as continuity. No moralizing lines; the final ascent carries charged poise. Ambiguity lingers: is the ghost mere code or companion, letting resonance outweigh explanation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lyric third-person limited sustains a star-soaked, oceanic register—“shadowseam wonder,” “ink-pooled darkness”—without purple overload. Syntax lengthens during calibrations, then fractures under threat, mirroring pulse. No dialogue clutter; single spoken line carries oracular weight. Perceptual signature remains distinctively Elara’s: canyon as song, starlight as syntax.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet breathable; metaphors (starlight fracturing, emerald fireflies) stay internally consistent. One paraphrase loop—“luminous respite” named twice within four lines—dims momentum slightly. No filter-verb stacks; actions stay in strong verbs. Final paragraph’s cadence rises like ascent bubbles, cleanly closing image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Marries landscape astrology with bioluminescent infrastructure in a way that feels inevitable: stellar alignment powers tectonic data through living light. The “shared exhale as ignition” twist repurposes clichéd “breath of life” into hard-SF biometric key. Ghost-researcher device could feel familiar, yet here he is used to externalize Elara’s need for witness, not exposition. Risky lyric compression pays off in resonant closure.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Her astrologer lens shapes what she notices (star-canyon correspondence) and drives the goal, but only one micro-choice—prioritizing synchronized breath over solo computation—directly alters tactics; more charting beats would cement indispensability.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Burnt feather appears early as compass, bookmarks ancient text mid-story, and lands on console as offering-anchor, reweighting destruction into guidance at closure; removal would gut the symbolic through-line and tactile memory link.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Luminous respite evolves from ambient beauty to survival necessity: its activation stabilizes machinery, saves data, and dissolves the ghost—story logic collapses without this exact shift from aesthetic to critical resource.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>“Softly ingenious” is shown in bio-responsive emergency lighting that reacts to carbon exhalation; the trait enables the climax and contrasts typical brute-force sci-fi tech, but label itself is only applied narratively, not voiced by character.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Captivation occurs mutually: ghost holds Elara’s attention, she anchors his loneliness, leading to the cooperative exhale that triggers the respite; without this reciprocal captivation the biometric signal never forms, stalling resolution.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Shared exhale spotting the first fireflies is seeded by plankton bloom outside dome, taught as carbon source, then executed to unlock generator; mechanics are integral and climactic, not decorative.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Forgotten facility provides pressurized time bomb, bioluminescent power grid, and ghost repository; its glass interface alone enables the synchronized breath recognition—setting change would break the climax mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Sunrise deadline is stated early but never tracked via rising pressure beats; interior clocks (seals groaning) supplant it, so the astronomical cutoff feels conceptual rather than tactical.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Desire for “rhythm of belonging” propels descent, conflicts with solitary star-mapping, and resolves when she accepts transient connection; the want shapes the final ascension cadence and renunciation of permanent anchorage.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Shadowseam wonder—awe at light/abyss interface—permeates imagery from star-fractured currents to emerald plankton, modulates into grateful release as ghost fades, and charges the closing ascent with luminescent afterglow.</comment>
