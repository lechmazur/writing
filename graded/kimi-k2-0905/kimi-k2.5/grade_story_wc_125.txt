<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interiority is dense, embodied, and character-specific; the rope-handling, fossil-scraping, and final seated recitation all spring from the same restless, ethically playful poet. Contradictory impulses—retrieve her voice vs witness geologic time—coexist inside every beat rather than alternating in summary. The renunciation of both doors is credibly foreshadowed by his refusal to tug the rope and by the spiral he lays, so the Earned Stasis feels paid for.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the sideways step reconfigures the binary rescue/loss rule-set while the frayed rope across his lap makes the cost tactile. Accumulative/Textural lens holds from first moonrise to final poly-tense verse; temporal folds intensify by accretion rather than causal reversals. Orientation is anchored by grotto mouth/heat/third-moon within 120 words; no debt applied.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Terra-cotta radiating daytime heat, clay beneath fingernails, and rope fibers catching starlight repeatedly constrain stance and supply the final image. The grotto’s thermal memory and fossilized non-bird footprints are selective, not touristic, and directly enable the conceptual repricing of time-as-fraying-cord. Environment, body, and tool are inseparable by the ending beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“texture of time vs irrevocable forfeiture of either past or future”—is signaled early and tightens when touching the backward/forward chambers. The single deepening comes when he refuses to choose and instead lays the rope in spirals, foreclosing both exits; price is the permanent ambiguity whispering against his lap. Cost is visible and charges the final image under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the pattern of drafts and erasures—bird fossils, rope spirals, discarded timelines—so the final poly-tense recitation feels inevitable rather than asserted. No character moralizes; the grotto itself reweights virtue as a human conceit. Resonant after-effect: reader senses that every escape is also a binding, without the line ever appearing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is consistent: synesthetic starlight that makes teeth ache, clay “soft as the present moment,” rope moving “like a sleeping snake.” Rhythm modulates from long liquid accumulative sentences to the final clipped beat of “water and dust,” mirroring the shift into crystallized poise. No head-hopping; lyric compression is taught by line three and paid off in the closing verse.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>High figurative density is justified because the piece is a lyric accumulative text; metaphors stay coherent (fraying = temporal texture). One paraphrase loop detected (“time itself had texture… texture of time”) but it occurs early and is later conceptually repriced, so the closure beat remains sharp. Otherwise zero scaffold, strong propulsion, and vivid nouns/verbs.</comment>

<grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of prison-escape rope-as-temporal-drafting-tool is fresh and non-obvious; removal would collapse the entire closure image. Energy beings altering causality could feel stock, yet here they function as background editors of discarded drafts, a re-weighting that makes the familiar strange. Risk in sideways refusal of binary rescue pays off in a resonant stasis that feels earned, not gimmicky.</comment>
