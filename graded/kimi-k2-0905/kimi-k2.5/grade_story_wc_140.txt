<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The nameless archivist’s tactile obsession is vivid and embodied; every micro-choice (pressing stories to palms, pocketing the poison label) enacts the need to feel erased history. Yet the interior contradiction—whether collecting others’ fragments can ever restore the self—stays summary, never dramatized in a single beat where a collected story actually collides with the protagonist’s own void. The final smile in the dark is credible renunciation, but the causal path is lyric accumulation rather than a tangible fork where one option dies on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: “to discover the texture of memories was to become the texture itself” reweights stakes with undeniable conceptual cost—identity = palimpsest. Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout; each overheard fragment layers density until the negative-space self is legible. Orientation is taught late but pays off in closure image, satisfying waiver. No causal amnesia; the bureaucratic death error remains a persistent constraint that shapes the method of collection.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Container corridors, salt wind, and the softened poison-label tattoo are rendered with sensory economy; every tactile detail is filtered through the synesthetic POV. The steel labyrinth actively constrains movement and channels overheard voices, charging the final ear-pressed-to-container beat. Micro-setting (label in pocket) evolves from map to skin-tattoo, directly shaping the closing identity equation. No credibility breaks; port logistics stay minimal yet plausible.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can erased identity be re-felt through others’ stories—tightens when the archivist realizes they must become the aggregate texture rather than recover a name. One meaningful deepening: the poison label shifts from archive relic to dermal graft, signaling that embodiment is the only closure available. Agency is present in the decision to keep collecting despite the void, but no live option is foreclosed; the cost is conceptual, not tactical. Sufficient for 600-word lyric frame.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Emergent theme: survival after bureaucratic erasure demands transmutation into the very medium of forgetting—rust, salt, story-silt. No thematic statement; insight accretes through recurring images of layered corrosion. Final image reweights the opening death certificate as liberation rather than loss. Complex ambiguity: namelessness is both wound and womb.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Distinct perceptual signature—synesthetic texture-mapping—threads every sentence: “sounds had grain, silence had weight.” Rhythm swells and ebbs like tide, mirroring accumulative drive. No head-hopping; POV distance stays tight to the archivist’s nerve-map. Diction never exceeds the character’s self-taught lexicon of freight and weather.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>High信息 density; most lines twin sensory image with conceptual weight (“the way rust layers upon metal”). Figurative runs are patterned early and justified by synesthetic lens—no clutter. One scaffold trace: “layer upon layer, tide after tide” is deliberate accumulative cadence, not loop. Closing velvet metaphor crystallizes without muddle.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Premise—living death certificate in a container port—feels fresh, executed via synesthetic archive rather than noir trope. Transformation test fails only if relocated, because the port’s acoustic silt and corrosive layering are integral to the identity equation. Risk in lyric accumulative structure pays off in resonant closure. Minor dock-worker anecdotes verge on stock, but POV filter reconfigures them into tactile cargo.</comment>
