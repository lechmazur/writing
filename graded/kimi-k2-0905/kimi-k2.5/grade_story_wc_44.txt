<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elara’s obsession is concrete—she counts heartbeats against the key—and her final recognition that the seals were mercy, not punishment, is earned by the looping walk. Yet her interiority rarely contradicts itself; the prose tells “singular obsession” instead of showing competing impulses in the moment. The cost is felt (she now shoulders an open-ended task), but the emotional contradiction that would make her feel fully alive under pressure stays off the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the orrery’s reversal re-opens the fold, the custodian’s shadow returns, and Elara comprehends the rescue-as-seal. Causality is causal-chain: key → rewound planets → loop-walk → rupture, each step because/therefore. One minor scaffold—”she had discovered” summarizes method instead of dramatizing the breakthrough—but the ending image of noon persisting in a pocket reconfigures stakes with visible cost: eternal guardianship.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Frost on brass, silent boots on iron, silent explosion of released potential—details are selective, sensory, filtered through a scholar’s tactile precision. The floating isle’s eternal twilight is named but never constrains tactics; the observatory itself supplies only the orrery, whose stasis mirrors thefold. Environment does not actively complicate the loop-walk, so the 9+ gate is missed, but micro-setting (key, orrery, railing) charges every beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—free the sealed awakenings—tightens when Elara realizes they were preserved, not punished, forcing her to accept custodianship. Pressure escalates through causal beats: key insertion, backward spiral, syllable-timed steps, pocket-noon rupture. Cost is legible: indefinite labor. Yet the middle contains no live obstacle or opposition; escalation is purely knowledge-deepening rather than option-narrowing, keeping it below 8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges via image pattern: bending spoons (salvation through distortion), recursive loops (endings are beginnings), noon-shadow exile (self-sacrifice as preservation). No character moralizes; the final image of persistent noon reweights the entire premise. Ambiguity lingers—will the world ever “hold” the shadows again?—but the conceptual repricing is clear: rescue can look like erasure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Elara’s scholar-perception: sigils, geometries, water-damaged logs. Syntax lengthens during the ritual walk, then contracts at rupture, mirroring breath. No head-hopping; diction (“recursive loops of spacetime”) stays within her lexical range. Occasional elevated latinate clauses (“quantum of released potential”) verge on over-articulation but remain consistent with her academic lens.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Lines are dense, rhythmic, largely propulsive; mixed metaphors are few (“shadows peeling like wet skin” is visceral, coherent). Two adjacent paraphrase loops—“she had to relearn...she had to relearn”—in the middle beat deduct 0.2. Filter-verb clusters absent; figurative language thins during the high-pressure loop-walk, giving clarity. No scaffolding obscures the final image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Combining bent-cutlery apocalypse with runic recursion is fresh; the spoon event is never explained, keeping its fairy-tale logic intact. The loop-walk as time-engineering method feels novel yet inevitable once keyed. Some phrasing shadows Borges/Calvino, but the emotional stake (custodian forever) is specific to Elara. Risky compression at 742 words works; no safety-middle hedging.</comment>
