<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elian’s grief is embodied in tactile ritual (glass eyes pressed to lids, finger-tracing fractures) and his “gently inventive” trait drives every beat; the interior contradiction—yearning for mathematics of closure while surrendering to unquantifiable love—remains active in-scene. The final stance (carrying “the answer in his chest”) is earned: the mosaic’s new drip fissure visibly forecloses the fantasy of solving her absence. No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible N/A; headcount stays clean. Micro-choices (angle of eyes, pouching them at end) reveal hierarchy of values with visible cost, satisfying 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each drip, chip, and refracted gleam layers density until the final drop cleaves a new tributary, reweighting the stake from “find her” to “live with not-knowing.” Closure is Charged Poise: the cavern dark returns identical but the reader feels the reconfigured equation—love as gravity—via the velvet pouch beat. Orientation anchored by word 60 (“subterranean grove”), well under 120; no penalty. Causality intact: every image of mineral memory accrues to the last fissure. Cost legible in the hush that “had shifted,” satisfying 9+ test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Micro-setting supremacy: the stepping-stone’s chipped tesserae and fresh drip-fissure physically constrain the climactic perception shift; cavern orchard supplies the only light source refracted through the eyes. Sensory hierarchy obeys POV—taxidermist legacy, mineral geometry—never tourist catalog. Spatial choreography clean: body kneels, stands, exits east; eyes pocketed. Environment charges final image (new crack = new vector), meeting 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—convert ambiguous loss into soluble equation—signaled early. Single meaningful tightening: the drop creates a fresh crack that invalidates the prior “solution,” forcing acceptance of unquantifiable love. Pressure accumulates via refracted patterns; no causal reversals needed under Accumulative lens. Cost visible in the slowed breath and velvet pouch—he abandons tonight’s calculation. Sufficient for band; persistent constraint (damaged mosaic) shapes final poise.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from refracted damage: love bends space like gravity, mathematics must admit imperfection. No explicit thesis; final image reweights prior motifs without moral. Subtext in gesture—pouching the eyes = shelved delusion. Ambiguity lingers: equation “never broken” yet sister still gone. Earned, unsentimental.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Elian’s perceptual filter—mineral gleam, taxidermist lexicon, geometric longing. Rhythm modulates: long clauses for orchard cathedral, staccato for drop impact. No dialogue, so dialogue bullets N/A. Free indirect clean: “he had mapped the coordinates…” carries his diction. Velvet pouch beat crystallizes voice under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentence openings diversify. No loops or synonym churn. Figurative language sparse and purposeful—no mixed metaphors. Information density high: “dovetail joint formed in his understanding” fuses carpentry + emotion in one line. Minor scaffold: “the mathematics of emotion had become his obsession” tells what prior beats already show (−0.3). Closure image untouched by artifacts.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: taxidermist glass eyes + mineral fracture optics = grief spectrometer. Concept commits fully; no retreat to generic “hope.” Specific detail (wren mosaic, pale pears) prevents template drift. Risk in quiet lyric closure paid off by prior pattern. Transformation test fails if eyes swapped for any object—integration is total.</comment>
