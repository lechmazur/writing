<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Kael’s thief-with-compassion profile is vivid: the bread-for-orphans/gold-to-widows line crystallizes motive and the escalating chess-swap ritual externalizes it. Interiority leans poetic rather than embodied—no contradictory bodily cues under altitude stress—and the final “keeper of renewed wonder” feels bestowed rather than earned through visible flaw-cost. Still, the coherent moral hierarchy and playful-reverent micro-choices (white-king starlight release, cautious-abandon descent) sustain a believable arc. Capped below 8.8 because the decisive shift relies more on symbolic tableau than on-page renunciation or lingering price.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is unmistakable: the wrong sky fractures to blue, guardian dissolves, sundial ticks forward—Resonant Reconfiguration with conceptual cost. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; pressure mounts through loaded object exchanges until the cadence shifts, not through because/therefore chains. Orientation lands by ~100 words with spire, violet glaciers, pocket lid. A single causal micro-gap: how starlight vial “unbroken promise” physically re-tunes constellations is elided, but the pattern holds. Persistent price (guardian freed, Kael alone) is legible on the final line.</comment>

<comment>The icebound spire is kinesthetic—crampons bite, frost steams, parapet slickness steers Kael’s poised footwork. Violet glaciers, copper-ozone air, and jasmine rain evolve with beats, each sensory layer colliding with action rather than decorating it. The pocket sundial doubles as micro-setting, warming palm and aligning shadow at climax to constrain final timing. Environment actively withholds gravity-true directions and forces the chess-swap negotiation; without the altitude peril the ritual would lack urgency. Meets 9+ gate: tool (sundial lid) charges final image by ticking forward.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“restore a poisoned history”—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens as each chess swap forecloses another decades-old lie. Escalation is textural: density of revealed secrets (rook’s exoneration, bishop’s forgiveness, children’s laughter) progressively reweights the moral ledger until the black-king exchange triggers sky-healing cadence shift. Agency sits squarely with Kael; no coincidence resolves. Visible cost is present—guardian’s dissolution transfers eternal vigilance to Kael’s solitude—yet the price is more conceptual than viscerally felt, keeping it shy of 8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme of “sacred playfulness versus fear-driven rigidity” emerges through the ritual game rather than exposition. Subtextual turns—librarian-face guardian weeps meltwater, Kael trusts a fall that becomes flight—imply knowledge is safest when handled as collaborative play. Final image of ticking-forward time reconfigures the premise without sermon. Complexity is honored: no side is demonized, but false narratives still exacted generational blood. Only hairline slip: one ornamental “amend the hearts” phrase flirts with thesis-statement, yet context keeps it earned.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Lyric third-person limited maintains consistent perceptual signature—fractal breath, impossible shadows—aligned to Kael’s apprentice-of-wonder lens. Syntax lengthens under awe, then compresses during swap ritual, mirroring altitude clarity. No head-hopping; guardian’s dialogue is externally observed. Diction stays vaulted yet plausible for a man who carved 32 weighted chess pieces. One clause—“trusting the wind to catch him”—edges toward fortune-cookie cadence but fits the taught pattern of playful reverence and closes the arc cleanly.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>High information density: violet glaciers/copper air in same sentence world-builds, sets tone, anchors body. Varied sentence rhythm avoids drumbeat; paragraph lengths breathe with elevation pulses. Metaphors are purposeful (sky cracked like porcelain) and paid off by jasmine rain. No filter-verb clusters, loops, or mixed vehicles. Proof-level clean. Minor elision: “constellations shifted into impossible geometries” is tell, but immediate sensory follow-through earns it. Closure line retains clarity and lift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: sky-correction through secret-loaded chess negotiated with a librarian-faced ice construct feels inevitable yet unprecedented. Trope inversion—thief gives back truth, not treasure—grounds novelty in character values. Specificity throughout (starlight frequency, wood of World Tree, jasmine-scented rain) prevents abstract whimsy. Risk-taking (play as cosmological repair) heightens stakes without sacrificing coherence. No close echoes of canonical scenes. Transformation test fails if parts swapped, confirming integral originality.</comment>
