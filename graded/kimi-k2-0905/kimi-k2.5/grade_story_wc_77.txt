<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s interior contradiction—guilt over matricide and self-orchestrated drowning—drives every beat; the final renunciation of the clasp lands with embodied cost. Micro-choices (locking doors, confessing, pressing clasp to mirror) are legible and escalate under dream-logic. Only minor slip: “morbid artistic precision” is diagnostic label-speak amid otherwise visceral emotion.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Decisive Change: confession strips the luminance, cracked mirror signals cost, Earned Stasis achieved. Dream-logic lens is taught early and held; paradoxical notes act as because/therefore triggers. Anchor who/where lands within 120 words with deliberate disorientation that pays off at the end.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Funhouse glass, serpent clasp, and rotting-cotton-candy smell constrain choices and charge the final image. Micro-setting—the clasp against sternum—functions as heat/cold gauge that signals entity approach. Selective sensory triage under crisis narrows to mirror surfaces and hum of camera; no white-room lapse.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“trick fear into revealing its weakness”—is signaled early; paradoxical note mechanic creates meaningful tightening when confession poisons the parasite. Agency resides in the deliberate self-betrayal that forecloses denial forever. Cost is visible: loss of cursed camera, screaming souls released, clasp left in cracked glass.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme of self-devouring guilt emerges through serpent imagery and photograph-theft without explicit thesis. Final reconfiguration—ugliness of sin sets her free—reweights prior “repulsive allure.” Only muffled note: advisor’s moth-eaten dissolve edges toward allegorical convenience, slightly softening resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Distinct gothic-lyric texture: “wet silk,” “phosphorescent mold,” “luminance clung” all filter through Mara’s death-tainted perception. Compression and paradox are taught by line 4 and paid off in final cracked-glass sigh. No head-hop; psychic distance tightens under pressure without register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>High-density lines carry double duty—image + causality—without scaffold. Rhythm accelerates through fragment bursts at climax, then exhales into “morning light unburdened.” One metaphor-cluster beat in mirror-hall description grazes overwrite but does not touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Synthesizes after-death residue, photograph soul-theft, and dream-dictionary paradox into an inevitable whole. Risky dream-logic structure commits fully and lands cleanly. Fresh inflection: confession-as-poison weaponizes shame against fear itself—an angle not templated elsewhere.</comment>
