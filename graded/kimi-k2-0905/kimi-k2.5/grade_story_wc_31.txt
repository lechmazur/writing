<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elias’s quiet devotion to the submerged library and his grandmother’s cryptic charge feel lived-in; the 12-year night-shift endurance and the tuning-fork choice crystallize a credible renunciation. Interiority stays concrete—violet light on book spines, key warming in palm—avoiding label-speak. The only flaw: the “twelve years” summary is told, not dramatized, slightly blunting cost. Still, his final seated vigil among floating violet reads as earned stasis with visible emotional price.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the tuning fork’s violet bloom reweights every prior lamp-tending act as covert preparation. The causal chain—key tag → air-pocket ballroom → chromatic resonance theorem → sky-lantern chord—tightens neatly; no off-stage leaps. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (harbor lamp, pier, dusk) so the waiver applies; disorientation is functional, paid off when lantern light becomes the spectral chord. Persistent constraint: the flooded chamber can never be shared; that irreversible isolation charges the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The rusted Concordia’s flooded ballroom functions as micro-setting: water pressure, rotting shelves, and lantern light through portholes directly constrain movement and visibility. Selective sensory layering—brackish smell, copper stains, violet shimmer—mirrors Elias’s synesthetic quest without tourist clutter. Spatial choreography is clean: plank walk → promenade breach → aft cabinet → seated vigil; bodies and objects track. Tool-key tag is handled twice and recharges final image, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“will the color of sound reveal itself tonight?”—is signaled early and deepens when lantern releases thin the air-water barrier. One decisive intensification: tuning-fork strike → violet bloom; this narrows all prior caretaking into a single synesthetic proof. Cost is legible: Elias accepts perpetual isolation in the drowned library. Pressure stays accumulative/textural; no causal reversals needed, but the chord’s visibility is an undeniable reweighting.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: every human utterance leaves invisible pigment, and only those who drown in duty’s dark can see it. No explicit moral; final image of violet drifting among books offers a non-literal answer—“listen in the dark and light answers.” Motif of lamps/lanterns recurs with shifting valence: public beacon → private prism. Insight is earned through sensory struggle, not assertion; emotional aftereffect is wonder tinged with claustrophobia.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elias; perceptual signature is technician-poet—precise wick-adjustment verbs beside synesthetic color hunger. Rhythm accelerates into shorter clauses during descent, then widens into luminous suspension for violet bloom, mirroring breath under water. No head-hop; diction (“reef of rust,” “meteor hush”) remains within his lexicon. Filter verbs are few and voice-motivated; no committee voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentence variety is wide; no template cadence or synonym loops detected. Figurative language is sparse, taught early (“meteor hush”) and paid off in lantern ascent; no mixed metaphors. Opening and closing lines are propulsive and image-based. One minor scaffold: “luminous vows written in the margins” is abstract until later grounded; does not touch closure. Information density high—each sentence performs at least two jobs (atmosphere + motive, or setting + backstory).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Synesthetic harmonics inside a drowned cruise-ship library is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis; premise commits fully without late rule changes. Risky choice to hinge climax on a visible color of middle C pays off because prior ledger and tuning fork ground the physics. Grandmother’s deathbed “keeps the lights burning” subverts typical inheritance trope into chromatic covenant. If relocated to generic attic, story collapses—transformation test passed.</comment>
