<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s storm-recorder identity is lived-in: the lateral walk, the ink-mixing, the barometric memory. Interiority stays concrete, but the mentor-reveal triggers a near-epiphany (“began to intuit the pattern”) that flirts with diagnostic summary. The final resolve is earned: solitude reframed as greenhouse, cost felt in the rain on her skin.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Single continuous scene; causality clean: pigeon → coordinates → mentor-alive → dual-ledger invitation. Closure is Charged Poise: she writes while rain equalizes both worlds, cost legible in the open window. No orientation drift; lens holds.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Jasmine, moss, dry fountain, copper antennas—selective, POV-filtered. The courtyard’s trellis line literally shapes her evasive path, charging the final image. Weather is not backdrop but thematic engine; no caps needed.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: keep observation uncorrupted. Tightening beat: pigeon message proves surveillance is least of threats—quarantine itself is failing. She chooses complicity-in-recording, foreclosing innocence; price is future exposure. Agency clear, escalation once, no reversal overload.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme—truth as weather, indifferent to borders—emerges through rain image, never stated. Mentor’s survival inside rogue zone reweights “integrity” from isolation to distributed witness. Final image reconfigures solitude from retreat to conduit. No moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Elara’s meteorological perceptual signature: “specific gravity of surveillance,” “cloud formations shearing.” Syntax lengthens under contemplation, shortens during pigeon retrieval; no head-hop. Distinct without mannerism.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet breathable; figurative layering (“shadows pooled like ink”) stays purposeful. One scaffold loop: “lateral evasion that mirrored how storm systems circumvent…” restated twice. No artifact touches closure; rhythm modulates with pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: climatology + biosecurity + epistolary resistance. Rogue zone as atmospheric petri dish feels novel; mentor-inside-data, apprentice-outside-data dual ledger reframes quarantine trope. Risk taken with quiet ending pays off via rain image.</comment>
