<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara’s quiet perseverance and soil-whispering vocation feel distinct; her “heuristically gentle” restraint is shown in micro-choices (smuggling compost, rainwater bowls). Interiority stays anchored to tactile detail—no label-speak. The final refusal to announce but simply share bread crystallizes her values with visible cost (the relic loaf is gone). Secondary cast function as chorus, so status/relationship pressure is minimal, capping the score just below the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of “noticing → planting → sharing” tightens through sensory callbacks (anise scent reappears in pudding). Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—first harvest eaten with horn spoons—where the lost bakery is conceptually repriced as communal vigilance. Cost is unmistakable: relic bread consumed, garden now exposed to city wind. One transition (three-month ellipsis) is cleanly handled; no orientation debt. Meets 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sensory triangulation is disciplined: wisteria scent, ceramic-hard crust, frost on pumpkin vines. The cracked fountain micro-setting constrains planting choice and later supplies the wheat sprig snapped by the architect, charging the final image. Weather and season evolve with causal bite—October empties the wires, frost triggers the reveal meal. Spatial choreography holds through repeated秘密 visits; no floating bodies.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“will the neighborhood remember what it learned to forget?”—is signaled in paragraph one. Escalation is textural: each garden beat adds density until the bread pudding offers the first shared mouthful, tightening communal obligation. No antagonist needed; pressure is collective amnesia versus Mara’s stubborn cultivation. Cost is legible: relic lost, garden now known, vigilance required henceforth.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through accretion: absence can be metabolized into quiet sacrament. Subtext lives in gesture—spoons of horn, wheat sprig snapped, wind carrying scent beyond gate. Final image reweights “tenuous absolution” as daily practice, not state. No moralizing; silence after pudding does the work.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is consistent: close-focus botanical noticing, mild sentential elongation mimicking patient cultivation. No dialogue to test distinction, but free-indirect stays inside Mara’s lexicon (“soul erosion,” “ceramic crust”). Compression (“after the birds flew south”) is taught early and pays off in cyclical final line. Rhythm modulates—long breath for growth, clipped for stealth.</comment>

<comment>Prose is lean yet lyrical; metaphors (ivy swallowing iron, bread hard as ceramic) are spare and precise. No loops, no scaffold, no mixed vehicles. Sentence variety supports the accretive cadence—critical for textural escalation. Every paragraph either advances growth, stakes, or communal moment.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Fusion of guerrilla gardening + Eucharistic bread memory feels fresh; transforms familiar urban-loss trope into covert liturgy. Specificity of anise scent and cracked fountain anchors premise so it couldn’t swap settings unchanged. Risk in quiet ending is rewarded: no blaze of triumph, only tasted forgiveness. Minor half-step from 9+ because concept, while lovely, is a single inflection rather than double-layered surprise.</comment>
