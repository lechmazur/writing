<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Maya’s insomnia and “methodically hopeful” stance are concrete and embodied; every brush-stroke is a micro-choice that costs her wakefulness and sanity. The final renunciation—she stops, dawn arrives, glyphs hover—earns its hush because the text has hollowed her out on-page. No contradictory impulse is dramatized in scene (only in lyrical summary), so the interior conflict never quite sparks under pressure. Still, the visible fatigue and the brush’s glow suffice to show a paid price.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the greenhouse walls now hold “thirty-seven words for kindness,” dawn competes with industrial orange, and Maya’s vigil ends with the city re-seen as breathing—not broken. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each glyph adds density until the atmosphere itself is repriced. Causality is interior but legible—because she stays awake, because she paints, the air is scarred with mercy. No orientation debt; anchors (who/where/when) arrive within the first 120 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The rooftop greenhouse is not backdrop but instrument: humidity fogs glass, citrus scent mixes with extinct lullabies, and condensation becomes the canvas that keeps the glyphs alive. The smog-choked city below is filtered through Maya’s lungs and brush, its sodium lamps turned into “a broken constellation” that reconfigures at closure into “sleeping breath.” Tool-as-setting (the moon-tipped brush) literally charges the final image. Spatial choreography is immaculate—no drift in scale or impossible moves.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can she prove vanished kindness still matters?—is signaled early and tightens through each extinct word she rescues. Agency is present: every stroke costs wakefulness and psychic space; the escalation is the accumulation itself, a deepening density that forecloses the option of sleep. No external antagonist is needed; the pressure is the moon’s swell and her own hollowed endurance. Cost is visible in the “saffron quiet” that settles over her chest and the final gray smudge of dawn.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: languages die, but the emotional lattice of mercy outlives syllables, re-weighted as glowing humidity on glass. The final image—dawn industrial orange versus lunar amber glyphs—reconfigures the city’s meaning without moralizing. Subtext operates in silence: the nurse’s lullaby, the bus driver’s umbrella, never named aloud. The reader is left to feel the conceptual cost: modern air is now haunted by extinct gratitude.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays locked to Maya’s perceptual signature: moonlight is “warm” on eyelids, smog is “desperate breath,” turmeric in milk is the exact saffron quiet. Syntax lengthens and breathes with humidity; no filter-verb stacks or register drift. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk is zero. The prose’s rhythmic control—long humid sentences that finally settle into the clipped “She set down the calligrapher’s brush”—mirrors her exhaustion.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm is varied and propulsive; metaphor strings are dense but patterned early (“slow silver constellations,” “saffron quiet”) and payoff at closure. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn. One mixed-metaphor risk—“industrial haze that never cleared, not even in spring”—is minor. Information density is high: each sentence layers scent, light, and stakes without scaffolding.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The moon-tipped brush that writes only extinct kindness is a fresh synthesis of ghost-story and archive; no trope checklist here. The notion that lost words survive as “spaces between heartbeats” reweights linguistic extinction into atmospheric haunting. Risk is high—lyric accumulation instead of plot reversals—but the pattern is taught early and lands cleanly. Specificity of 1947 Tokyo umbrella-sharing or medieval plague-lullaby prevents abstraction.</comment>
