<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Mira’s contradictory impulses—her public mask of harmless embroiderer versus the covert strategist decoding futures—are dramatized in every piercing of silk; the final “synchronize your men” renunciation is earned by the prior causal chain of stitched warnings and costs her the safety of anonymity, visible in the eternal candle’s reflected glare.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a clean Charged Poise: the captain’s recognition reconfigures both Mira’s perceived foolishness and the empire’s survival odds under an Accumulative lens; the cost is legible in her continued solitude beside the flame, the price of foresight silently assumed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The cobalt dome filters light like “something deep and marine,” the eternal candle’s steady glow is handled twice to measure time, and the autumn chill literally tightens the conspiratorial window—each sensory anchor constrains Mira’s tactical pacing and charges the final purple dusk image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—empire survival via hidden foresight—tightens once when the binary-star tremor of the chancellor’s hands is stitched into the cloth, foreclosing the option to stay passive; the felt price is Mira’s exposure to the captain, an irreversible social cost under Accumulative escalation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: knowledge cloaked as art is still activism; the final image of the candle “preserving the fragile border between what was whispered and what was saved” reweights every prior stitch as insurgent silence, offering resonant ambiguity rather than a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Voice is textured through metallic metaphors and weaver’s diction (“celestial thread-counts,” “negative space of treason”); rhythmic compression under pressure (“She embroidered faster…”) stays legible; no head-hopping; perceptual signature is the stellar cartographer’s bias for angles and adjacency taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Sentences layer job—propulsion, atmosphere, and knowledge—without scaffolding; zero loops or synonym churn, metaphors stay coherent (“copper leaves fell in patterns that matched…footsteps”), and the final line varies cadence to crystallize the hush; no overwriting artifacts touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade>
<comment>The fusion of embroidery, astral divination, and espionage is a fresh synthesis; the “adjacent possibilities” mechanic is introduced early, used to read political tension, and reweighted at closure; risk of quiet coup story is transcended by turning textile craft into insurgent intel, making the concept inseparable from this narrator and setting.</comment>
