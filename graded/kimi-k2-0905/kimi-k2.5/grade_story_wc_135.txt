<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Kael’s interiority is vivid—visionary flashes trigger concrete micro-choices (handing over the valve). Yet the “ocean-spray archivist” label never shapes on-page tactics; he behaves like a generic empathic gatherer. Cost is felt when the valve passes to the widow, but Kael’s own stakes remain static; no path is foreclosed for him. The contradiction between exile trauma and calm cataloguing is stated, not dramatized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the widow’s upright stance reweights the valve from failure to connection, cost legible in her cracked voice. Causality under Accumulative lens holds—each artifact layers psychic residue until communal meaning crystallizes. One minor loop: “compile fragments into meaning” is mantra-repeated without tightening variation. Orientation is clean within 120 words; harbor, rain, and post-exile timeframe are anchored.</comment>

<comment>Ivory harbor after rain is tactile—waterlogged planks, salt-crusted chronicles, wet luminescence on bone-white stone. Micro-setting works: the valve’s green tarnish constrains Kael’s vision and later the widow’s posture. Spatial choreography is immaculate; no floating props. Weather stays live, soles sink, driftwood half-buries the customs house—choices are physically grounded.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—resurrect exile memory—declared early. Pressure accretes via visionary density, but Kael faces no narrowing choice; he merely witnesses and distributes. Escalation is lyrical, not tactical; the widow’s relief is collateral, not paid by him. No visible price alters his next move; options remain open.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Theme of “loss made legible” emerges through image, not dictum: the valve’s mute brass speaks louder than any thesis. Subtext in the widow’s cracked-voice silence carries unspoken grief. Final reconfiguration—failed retreat becomes enduring connection—earns resonance without moralizing. One echo drift: “compile fragments into meaning” edges toward prompt-speak but is rescued by sensory context.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited holds tight to Kael’s visionary sensorium; perceptual signature is salt-iron, rope-ghost, interval-stutter. Syntax flexes with pressure: long aqueous clauses break into staccato “He saw—” pulses. No head-hop; widow’s past is vision-projected, not ventriloquized. Filter verbs (“Kael watched”) are minimal and purposeful, serving witness stance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm is tidal—sentence lengths swell and ebb without mechanical pattern. Information density high: “ivory harbor after rain” packs color, texture, and era. Occasional scaffold: “compile fragments into meaning” recurs four times, each slightly reshaped, but the repetition edges mantra. Metaphors stay coherent (bones, cartography) and never collide.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Post-exile archive of absences is fresh; visionary antiquarian angle feels specific. Valve fragment as synecdoche for failed retreat is inventive, not gimmicked. Risk-taking is moderate—lyric accumulation over plot—but pattern is taught early and pays off. Could swap Kael’s profession title without structural harm, so originality is strong but not irreplicable.</comment>
