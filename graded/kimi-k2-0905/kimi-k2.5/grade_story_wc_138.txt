<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Kael’s “boredom heavier than despair” is vivid, but interiority repeatedly abstracts emotion (“mechanical existence,” “forgotten how to feel”) without embodied contradiction. The only micro-choice—stepping into the storm—arrives late and reads pre-decided; no live tension between fear and craving. Loss is stated, not dramatized; the lovers’ parting is three millennia off-stage. Earned smile lands, yet cost feels conceptual rather than personally tasted on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Closure qualifies as Conceptual Repricing: the shattered amulet dust reweights farewell from terminus to translation, visible in the final line. Causal chain is thin—storm peaks therefore reality rips therefore insight—but the Accumulative/Textural lens holds: crystalline refractions, folding corridors, and hushed thunder build a cadence that crystallizes into the reconfigured goodbye. Orientation is taught early via prismatic escondite and seventeen-billion-sunset anchor; no penalty applied. Persistent constraint (amulet destroyed) charges the ending, satisfying 9+ cost test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Prismatic escondite functions as micro-setting: its refracting facets literally supply the corridors Kael walks and the lens through which he sees mutiny. Solar storm magnetics are hand-waved, but the rule is consistent—fold geometry when field peaks—and guides the final step. Sensory selection favors sight and compressed sound (“hushed thunder”), mirroring the POV’s millennia-narrowed attention. Setting evolves from cathedral to origami collapse to stabilized silence, tracking causal mood shift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“discover what happens after goodbye”—is signaled early and deepens through pattern accumulation rather than tightening reversals. No live option is foreclosed mid-scene; pressure escalates via imagery density (walls refract → corridors fold → amulet shatters) culminating in conceptual reprice. Agency is present—he times his step—but the storm, not choice, drives shear intensity. Cost is conceptual (loss of compass, of old grief) rather than tactical; sufficient for Accumulative lens but shy of 8.8 threshold.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without moralizing: farewell as topological continuity rather than endpoint. Motif of “broken light” migrates from crystalline walls to shattered obsidian to dust slipping through fingers, reweighting loss into doorway. Final image offers resonant non-literal answer—“ready to say goodbye again, not as an ending”—charging prior seventeen billion sunsets. Avoids explicit thesis; ambiguity lingers, inviting reread.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Voice sustains cosmic scale without collapsing into purple: controlled hypotaxis, tactile verbs (“calcified,” “clawing”), rhythmic echo of spirals and folds. Lexicon (“escondite,” “topological”) sits inside immortal POV; no filter-verb clutter. Compression (“Space convulsed...like breaking glass”) matches peak beat. No dialogue to test, yet internal idiom remains singular and coherent across pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm modulates from languid cumulative openings to fragmented peak (“The fragment shattered...”). Metaphors stay consistent—light, folding, magnetics—no mixed vehicles. Occasional elevated diction (“spatial disobedience,” “Euclidean logic”) is voice-motivated. One paraphrase loop (“spatial mutiny...rebellious space”) but not at closure; no scaffold artifacts obscure causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Familiar tropes—immortal wanderer, reality storm, cursed token—are retooled through magnetic farewell philology and prismatic micro-setting. Fresh inflection: goodbye as topological translation rather than eschatology. Concept commits fully, no retreat to generic ascension. Risk in hushed-thunder lyricism pays off; could edge higher with more idiosyncratic character detail.</comment>
