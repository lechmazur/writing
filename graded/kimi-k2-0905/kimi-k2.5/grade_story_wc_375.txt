<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses—parlor-trick servitude vs. authentic creation—are dramatized in-scene through the lock-picking micro-choices; the final renunciation of the surface world carries visible cost (“charcoal fingers itching”) and is earned by prior causal chain. Memory gift is more label than embodied constraint until the watermark moment; slight softening of interior contradiction in peak beat keeps it from 9+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Decisive Change: she forsakes the elevator for the singing tunnel, foreclosing escape with felt cost. Causal lens holds: each beat (child’s question → watermark discovery → lock repair → tunnel) tightens options via because/therefore linkage. No orientation debt; spatial anchors land by line 40. Persistent constraint—broken lock left open—charges final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Crystal cave is not backdrop but tool: violet spectrum reveals watermark, basalt gives tactile resistance for lock-picking, auroral light reconfigures from sorrow to dawn in final image. Micro-setting (canvas backing, lock tumblers) constrains the decisive repair action. Selective sensory hierarchy—charcoal dust as lubricant—keeps detail purposeful. Environment directly shapes tactics and closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“uncork suppressed creativity”—tightens once when lock repair becomes the first authentic sculpture. Escalation causal: each failed caricature beat accumulates pressure until the child’s question triggers the irreversible repair attempt. Visible cost: she trades human audience for stone music, forfeiting tips and daylight. No coin-flip resolution; agency drives final narrowing.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of art as ascetic vocation emerges through action, not assertion: parlor trick vs. stone canticle. Final image reweights “auroral sorrow” into dawn without moralizing. Subtext in silence after lock clicks—no crowd applause, only cave breath—carries cost. Slight risk of thematic echo in “inescapable calling” phrase, but immediacy of sacrifice keeps it from archness.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays tight to Elara’s perceptual filter—charcoal dust, tumbler clicks, spectrum math. Syntax lengthens under feverish repair, then fractures into shorter units at tunnel entry, mirroring pulse. No head-hopping; unreliability nil. Distinct vocab—“mathematical poetry of the sequence”—belongs to artist-mind. Dialogue limited to child’s off-stage question, used as echo, not spoken line.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Zero loops; high density—“prismatic crystals catching stray photons and scattering them across the walls in bands of auroral sorrow” does three jobs in one line. Metaphor vehicles congruent: lock sighs, cave breathes, metal becomes foundation. Rhythm accelerates during lock-pick without monotony. No register drift or mixed metaphors in peak beat. Final line lands on concrete image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Forgotten-artist-in-cave could be cliché, but memory gift repurposed as lock-picking manual via spectrum watermark feels fresh. Risk of full descent rather than escape inverts expected “flight to surface” arc. Specificity of charcoal-as-lubricant and hairpin torsion turns trope into lived procedure. Not quite transformative enough for 9+ but avoids derivative aftertaste.</comment>
