<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elian’s contradictory impulses—ritual preservation vs. letting-go—are dramatized in the finger-blanching thread test and the projection ritual; the final bracelet choice costs him the comfort of denial, earning the renunciation. Interiority stays concrete and biased; no therapeutic self-labeling. Slight dip: Duchess remains a perfume-and-silhouette absence rather than a pressure that forces a new micro-choice mid-scene; she never surprises him, so the crucible is only one-sided.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of weaving absence into presence tightens once when the projected Duchess flickers and he writes faster; closure lands as Charged Poise—bracelet pulse re-weights the empty garden. Thread prop and harbor clock are cleanly tracked; no orientation debt. Cost is legible in the final image: “pulse…proof that…connection endured” forecloses amnesia. Minor slip: single-sentence risk of abstract thesis (“geography of healing required…”) but immediately grounded in physical action.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Garden’s iron-gray salt-rot wind and skeletal arbor act as micro-setting that literally disperses the apparition, forcing the final ink spill; the missing carpet thread is tracked as negative space that constrains the closing bracelet decision. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-colored (jasmine oil vs. salt-rot). One high-band gate met: recurring object (thread) charges final image. Spatial choreography holds; no floating benches.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can he finish the “elegy” before the apparition dissolves—is signaled early and tightens when wind ruptures projection; the cost is the irrevocable solo walk back through corridors that “no longer knew her footfalls.” Escalation is textural (density of absence) rather than causal reversal, fitting the lens. No off-stage rescue; the choice to bind the thread is his. Could use one sharper external obstacle to push score into 8.8+ band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of cartographing absence emerges through concrete ritual (thread compass, ink elegy) rather than statement; final pulse-image reweights earlier “explained absences” without moralizing. Subtext in the shared unspoken final evening lands via jasmine scent and silence. One echo of “geography of healing” skirts thematic thesis but is earned by prior tactile mapping. Complexity acknowledged: survival is lonesome splendor, not triumph.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains steady psychic distance; perceptual signature is textile-obsessed, salt-smell attuned, with syntax that lengthens under reverie then fractures into em-dashes as wind hits. No head-hopping or filter-verb clutter. Lyric pattern (“warp of distance,” “weft thread”) is taught early and repaid at closure. Dialogue absent by design; narrative voice carries subtext alone. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with emotional crests.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentences perform double duty (description + interior momentum); strong verbs (“spindled,” “cascaded”) replace modifiers. Only two adjacent paraphrases (“empty garden” / “vacant spaces”)—minor loop, not at closure. Mixed-metaphor risk (“geography…tapestry”) is anchored by consistent textile grammar. Final paragraph varies cadence, ending on monosyllabic pulse-word for resonance. Zero artifacts in last third; high-band gate met.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Premise—“living obituaries” for the not-dead—is fresh and fused to textile metaphors that permeate scene and body. Duchess-as-apparition avoids ghost cliché by functioning as negative-space projection the protagonist must concretely weave. Risky lyric accumulative structure pays off in charged bracelet image. Transformation test fails if thread swapped for coin; specificity is high. Slight proximity to “writing as cartography” trope but personalized through carpet-weft craft.</comment>
