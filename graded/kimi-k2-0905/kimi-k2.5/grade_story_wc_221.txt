<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—exile-born despair versus the need to map—remains embodied and active: each charcoal drag resists stretched physics. The compass rose and journal activate stakes across beats; the final smile-through-cracked-lips shows cost. Micro-choices (tearing the applique, pinning it to a sketch) foreclose surrender with visible price, satisfying the 9+ test. Motivation is stable, particular, and drives every beat; only the absence of another character keeps the score just below the top band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure is a crisp Charged Poise: the hatch reveals a new timeframe, the compass marks the coordinates, step is taken—cost paid in centuries of subjective isolation. The accumulative lens holds: star-smears tighten into a vector after beats of layered detail. No orientation debt; who/where/when are legible by 120 words. One causal micro-turn—the unmoving “fixed point” reframes her curse as cartographic gift—escalates and deepens the stake once, sufficient for 600–800 word scope.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The time-dilated deck, suspended ice, and smeared stars are sensory, selective, and mirror psychological stretch—yet they constrain her reach and final tactic. The gilded rose warms and aligns, a micro-setting that charges closure; the viewport’s distortion literally supplies the exit vector. Spatial choreography is clean: deck-plate scrape → viewport → hatch, no impossible moves. Only the broader institutional physics remains lightly sketched, keeping the score just under 9.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“map or succumb”—is signaled early and tightens once: the unmoving star forces a choice to sketch toward the hatch. Agency is present in every beat; the cost is felt biologically and temporally. No coincidence resolves; pressure mounts through accumulating sensorial distortion, then crystallizes in the exit image. Meets the 9+ test for agency-driven escalation, but only one main tightening keeps it below top band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: mapping as existential resistance to formless exile. The compass rose migrates from heirloom to waypoint—its final pinning reweights ancestry into self-authored salvation. No moralizing; the silence becomes canvas motif accumulates rather than states meaning. The closing step offers a resonant, non-literal answer: direction exists only after you draft it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person lingers inside Elara’s elongated sensorium: verbs stretch, metaphors breathe at her dilated rate (“taffy-like resistance”). Syntax lengthens then snaps in the exit moment, mirroring temporal tension. No head-hop; perceptual signature remains stable and charged. Diction stays within her engineer-cartographer lexicon, achieving rhythmic control without opacity—meets the 9+ bar.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>High information density: each sentence layers physics, emotion, and metaphor without scaffold. Figurative language is patterned early (“seconds expanded…sugar in acid rain”) and paid off at exit, avoiding late clutter. A few adjective stacks (“pneumatic finality…temporal storm”) flirt with excess but never obscure causality or dull closure. Clean grammar, no loops, strong read-aloud rhythm.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The “blessed pariah” trope is inverted: temporal mutation grants cartographic agency instead of mere survival. Star-smears and ancestor sketchbooks synthesize into a fresh spacetime-navigation premise. Risky compressed lyricism heightens stakes without gimmickry; true north as self-drawn vector feels inevitable in hindsight. Transformation is strong enough to avoid derivative-premise deduction.</comment>
