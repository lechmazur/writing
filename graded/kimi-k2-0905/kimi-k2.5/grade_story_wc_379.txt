<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Maya’s “listening heals” motive is declared early and her micro-choice to trail Mr. Alvarez at fifty paces shows restrained agency, yet her interiority rarely breaks beyond curated lyricism; the locket moment is a guess, not a tested contradiction, so the final offering feels convenient rather than earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the courtyard’s communal exhale reweights the stake with undeniable social cost under an Accumulative/Textural lens; causality holds, but the locket’s arrival is pure chance and the Orientation Test is waived since the disorienting swirl of voices pays off in the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The courtyard, mailbox, and construction perimeter are vividly tracked and constrain proximity; the locket functions as micro-setting that charges the final exchange, meeting the 9+ gate, though occasional metaphor surplus (“sandstorm calm” twice) slightly dulls sensory selectivity.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—community memory vs. erasure—tightens when demolition clock meets mailbox opening; Maya’s choice to follow, not force, narrows her tactical options and produces visible communal cost, satisfying one meaningful deepening under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of listening-as-healing emerges through gathered voices and silent gesture, not statement; the final image of neighbors clasping hands reconfigures meaning without moralizing, though the locket’s instant thematic echo risks neatness.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Maya’s perceptual filter with rhythmic, spectacled noticing; no head-hop, diction stable, and patterned metaphor (“sandstorm calm”) is taught early and reprised at closure, giving coherent texture under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and musical; occasional metaphor pile-ups (“amber rays... sandstorm frozen in time” inside one sentence) flirt with overwriting, but no loops or scaffold stall the final beat; clarity remains intact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Merging thrift-curator, locked mailbox, and “leads through following” yields fresh civic-ghost-story angle; risk is moderate, transformation evident, yet the locket coincidence and familiar “letter that could have changed everything” trope blunt full freshness.</comment>
