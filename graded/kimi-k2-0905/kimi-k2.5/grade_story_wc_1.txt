<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s contradictions are dramatized in the frost-guided walk: the compulsion to “retrace” versus the vow to “pause.” Interiority stays concrete—glass-maker’s eye for lattice, kiln-house smell—never slipping into label-speak. The ledger’s shift from debt to devotion is earned by the cave discovery, and her decision to carry it east crystallizes an Earned Stasis with visible cost: she forfeits the old blaze-of-glass identity. The only restraint from 9+ is that the suicide attempt is summarized, not enacted, so the flaw impetus is told, not felt in body.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal lens holds throughout: because the studio burns, therefore she flees; because frost reveals wagon ruts, therefore she finds the cave; because she reads the journals, therefore the ledger re-prices from shame to love. Orientation is anchored within 120 words (canyon rim, frost, truck). The closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: “map of devotion written in carbon and ash” reweights every prior beat, with the cost felt in her slowed, eastward drive—no rush to rebuild. One micro-turn (ledger = sacrifice, not crime) tightens stakes decisively.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Frost crystals, sandstone walls, and charcoal crates are filtered through a glass-artist’s gaze—light, texture, lattice—so every detail does double duty as atmosphere and tool. The canyon’s “frozen-flame” rock and silvering frost literally guide her feet to the cave, satisfying the 9+ gate: setting constrains discovery and charges the final image. Spatial choreography is flawless; no impossible positions. The only hairline slip is a single tourist-catalog phrase “red rock like frozen flame,” but it is instantly re-seen through her craft-biased eye, so the flare is absorbed.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether she can reinterpret the ledger and her own survival—tightens once when frost divulges the route, and again when journals reveal filial love. Protagonist agency drives both turns: she chooses to kneel, to read frost, to enter cave, to lift charcoal. Cost is visible: she accepts the slower, eastward return, trading blazing luminosity for “steady adaptability.” Under causal lens, escalation is lean but sufficient; no external antagonist needed. The only bar to 9.0 is that the suicide backstory is recounted, not re-lived, so the emotional price is slightly blunted.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: ash as hidden devotion, glass as visible fragility, frost as temporary revelation. The final image—ledger strip now “map of devotion”—reweights every prior mention of debt and fire, achieving resonance without moralizing. Subtext lives in gesture: lifting charcoal becomes an act of communion, not labor. No platitudes, no echo of familiar thesis lines; the insight stays particular to this canyon, this kiln-born daughter.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited maintains tight psychic distance; perceptual signature is specific—“luminous glass sculptures,” “silica and flame,” “molten glass” syntax mirrors artist’s lattice-eye. Diction stays within her lexicon: no corporate register, no filter-verb stacks. Rhythm accelerates under frost-discovery, then lengthens into contemplative cadence as sun melts crystals, mirroring her new tempo. One brief clause “the attempt—her own, three weeks prior—” compresses trauma without jarring shift; the elision is taught and paid off when she names the match.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops, zero scaffolding; each sentence advances knowledge or image. Metaphors (“red stone into something pale and lunar”) are precise, not mixed. High information density: “brittle edge of the charcoal smuggler’s ledger strip” fuses object, history, and tactile quality in nine words. Opening and closing lines book-end with fire/ash imagery, creating propulsive symmetry. No artifact touches the closure beat; the final clause “stars still burning in her mind” lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The charcoal-smuggler-daughter angle freshens the familiar “fire-as-rebirth” trope by making the illicit cargo fuel for childhood art. Frost-code as breadcrumb trail is particular and non-obvious. Risk is taken in quiet, accumulative structure rather than explosive turn, yet coherence holds. The synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight: glass needs fire, fire needs fuel, father supplied both—no stitched-together gimmickry.</comment>
