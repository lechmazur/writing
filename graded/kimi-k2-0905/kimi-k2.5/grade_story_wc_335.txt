<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses—tender caretaker vs. pitiless mentor—are dramatized in her backward walks and the hammer-hover; the child-shadow’s agency is shown through micro-gestures. Both arcs end in an earned renunciation (hammer lowered, forward step) that visibly costs Elara her isolating ritual. Interiority stays concrete; “ferocious love” is embodied, not labeled. Only the child’s interiority is necessarily veiled, so the slight asymmetry is acceptable.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a pristine Resonant Reconfiguration: the shard’s dust and the stilled swing reweight every prior beat under the Accumulative lens. The tea-leaf geometry pattern is taught early, returns twice, and its final spiral justifies the non-shatter decision with on-page cost (Elara’s forward walk, the swing’s silence). Causality is clean: because the leaves show survival potential, therefore the exile is extended until the shadow chooses readiness. No orientation debt; transitions are legible within the single-scene default.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The forgotten library’s dust, brass table, and samovar function as micro-setting that constrains every annotation beat; the exterior swing’s motion is tethered to the shadow’s emotional state and charges the final stillness. Sensory selection is urgency-filtered: cold glass bite, creaking swing, dust motes in dying light. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly as Elara circles/retreats. The swing’s final stoppage is an environmental mirror that passes the 9+ gate test by directly shaping the closing image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will the shadow develop resilience or remain exiled—tightens through each tea-reading annotation; the spiral pattern visibly forecloses the “break now” option and raises the cost of waiting. Agency is shared: Elara risks false hope, the shadow risks annihilation; both stakes escalate until the hammer’s withheld fall crystallizes Charged Poise. Coincidence is absent; pressure is accumulative deepening, not causal reversal. Price is legible: Elara surrenders her backward defense, the shadow surrenders safe limbo.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the inverse pedagogy of “cruel kindness”: resilience is earned by refusing rescue. The swing’s empty motion→stillness reprises exile→return without moralizing. Subtext lives in gesture: shadow palms pressed upward signal readiness more than any plea could. Final image reweights “walk forward” as both liberation and uninsulated risk, accomplishing Conceptual Repricing without statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited clings to Elara’s perceptual signature: dust tastes of decades, tea angles are measured like fractures in bone. Syntax elongates during annotation, compresses when the hammer lifts, mirroring heart-beat. No head-hop; child’s state is inferred through glass-behavior, maintaining distance control. Voice stays lexically consistent—no academic register creep—and the rhythmic swing-creak becomes a metronome beneath the prose.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence detected. Figurative language is rationed—dust “like a bruise,” velvet-wrapped blade—each image earns its place and recurs with added charge. Zero paraphrase loops; information density is high (one sentence often does description + interior shift + foreshadow). Minor filter verbs appear only when POV demands perceptual distance, never in climax beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The shard-mirror reversible exile flips the familiar “trapped soul” trope into a pedagogical dyad where teacher and student share mortal risk. Tea-leaf geometry as trauma telemetry feels non-obvious yet inevitable once taught. The backward-walk quirk is not ornamental—it enables the dance of advance/retreat that structures the whole scene. Risk is taken and paid off: withholding the hammer blow could deflate tension, instead it crystallizes Charged Poise, proving the gamble was structural, not gimmick.</comment>
