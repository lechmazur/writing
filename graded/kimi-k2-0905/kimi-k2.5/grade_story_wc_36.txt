<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mira’s contradiction—paralysis then deliberate correction—plays out on the page through embodied micro-choices (trembling fingers, breath-controlled steps). The final renunciation of guardianship is earned by the causal chain of failure, atonement, and visible cost: the flute is silenced, the range exhales. No label-speak; interiority stays concrete and sensory. Meets 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the “true peace” is legibly different from the earlier suffocating hush because the canyon’s sigh is released through her paid-for stitch-work. Lens is Accumulative/Textural—each image layer reweights the stake until the final cadence shift. Cost is visible in the last line: the instrument is retired, keeper’s role foreclosed. No orientation debt; driftwood compass is taught by 120-word mark.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Thunder-echo range constrains every move: the geometry of cliffs traps old thunder, the fissure dictates marker placement, the hush presses on eardrums. Driftwood, flute, and body function as micro-setting that charge the final image. Sensory selection narrows to touch and hearing under crisis. Meets 9+ gate: the range’s exhalation is inseparable from the closure beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—repair the breach—is signaled immediately and tightens through each note she plays; the driftwood lattice visibly narrows options. One meaningful deepening: the vision of her past hesitation reframes every prior marker into a path she must now walk backward. Cost is felt in the ache of teeth, the retirement of the flute, the foreclosed guardianship. Under Accumulative lens, density and cadence shift escalate stakes without causal reversals.</question>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the particular arc: guardianship is not stasis but endless, terrifying maintenance. The ending’s “promise of storms that would never again break the world” reweights the premise without moralizing. No symbolic convenience; driftwood and flute accrue meaning through use, not assertion. Resonance is built from the concrete failure→restoration cycle.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Perceptual signature is distinct: “avalanchingly quiet,” “geometry of cliffs,” “thread through linen” all filter through Mira’s relic-keeper sensorium. Rhythm swells and ebbs with breath and note placement; elision (“harvesting insights from failure”) is taught early and paid off. No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens under stress. Voice remains singular and coherent at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; sentences vary in length and opening. Metaphors stay physically coherent (stones into deep water, thread through linen). High information density: each line advances atmosphere, character, or stakes. No register drift; diction stays within her weathered, geological lexicon.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Premise—flute as reality-needle and driftwood as harmonic compass—feels fresh yet inevitable. The transformation of failure into craft via sound-weaving is specific to this voice and geology. No close genre echoes; the quiet apocalypse and sonic repair avoid familiar templates. Risk in lyric accumulation pays off in the earned hush of the final image.</comment>
