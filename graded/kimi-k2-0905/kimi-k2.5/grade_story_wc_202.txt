<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s vocation and childhood wound are cleanly fused; the lens-touch that releases “Mara” is a credible micro-choice. Yet her interiority repeats the same abstract cadence (“elusively tangible,” “anchors of intuition”) rather than evolving under pressure, so the emotional escalation feels looped rather than deepened. No contradictory impulse is dramatized inside the eternal instant—she simply succeeds—so the beat carries less cost than the premise promises.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the collective memory now carries Mara, and Elara’s swaying bridge body registers the price of translation. Causal chain holds—lens → reveal → name → loosen → bridge sway—within a single continuous scene. The Orientation Test is satisfied by word 60; no lens ambiguity at end. Accumulation cap not triggered; one residual beat of scaffold repetition (−0.2) keeps it from 8.5.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Rope bridge above rooftop market is sketched with wind, altitude, and social visibility; the lens fragment functions as micro-setting that constrains the final gesture. Selective sensory hierarchy—glass warmth, smoke-remembering-bone—keeps description inside POV priority. Spatial choreography is clean; no weather clichés. Environment does not evolve during the beat, preventing 8.8.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“honor overlooked histories”—is signaled early and tightened when Elara decides to speak Mara’s name, narrowing her option to walk away. Pressure is accumulative/textural: density of remembered sensations (bread, scrubbed hands) intensifies rather than external opposition. Cost is felt in the bridge sway and lens heat, but the absence of external resistance keeps escalation shy of 8.0.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through image pattern—hidden brushstroke, secret lace signature—rather than statement. Final image of dreams “suddenly knowing” Mara reweights the city’s memory without moralizing. Ambiguity remains: painter’s compassion complicates pure victimhood. One near-echo of prompt language (“overlooked histories”) in final paragraph triggers −0.2.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Elara’s perceptual filter; no head-hop. Distinctive synesthetic diction (“smoke that remembers it was once bone”) sustains lyric texture. Rhythm modulates: longer sentences for suspension, fragment-like bursts at name-release. No dialogue to evaluate; voice coherence survives climax without drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>High information density—most sentences advance image or motive. Figurative language is patterned and taught early (“elusively tangible” refrain) so density cap waived. Two paraphrase loops (“anchors of intuition” repeated with no new angle) and one synonym churn (“hidden details” / “concealed” / “invisible”) deduct −0.4. Closure line itself is clean, keeping score above 7.5.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Premise—memory archaeologist who reads ghost signatures in paint—feels fresh yet inevitable. Risk in lyric repetition mostly pays off; secret lace encoding is a specific invention that would collapse if swapped. No close echoes of canonical scenes. Slight safeness in lone-success outcome prevents 9.0.</comment>
