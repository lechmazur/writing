<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elara’s lifelong vocation and methodical pragmatism are vivid, embodied in micro-choices like pocketing protocol to set the fragment on the naked oscillator. The interior contradiction—empirical interpreter seduced by silence—drives the climax, but her predecessor’s fate is told, not dramatized, softening the felt cost of repeating it.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: perigee → fragment warms → she inverts gain → hush sings → cosmic birth-death imprint captured. Closure lands as Decisive Change with conceptual cost: the city’s abandoned rig becomes the only viable receiver once silence is accepted as signal. Orientation clear by 120 wds; lens stays Causal throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Iron catwalks, swaying towers, copper palms, and quantum silence are textured through Elara’s engineer gaze, guiding her risky placement of the fragment. The suspended gorge city supplies altitude danger and electromagnetic isolation that directly enable the inversion tactic, satisfying the 9+ constraint gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Single dominant stake—prove silence carries cosmic origin—tightens when conventional amplification fails and the lunar clock peaks. Placing the fragment on the oscillator sacrifices the last fail-safe, foreclosing retreat; price is legible in the towers’ collapse of baseline frequency. No antagonist needed; pressure is temporal and technical.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme—“the beginning in every ending”—emerges from the hush’s negative imprint rather than assertion; the final recording of stellar death-birth cycles reconfigures extinction as genesis. No moralizing; insight paid for by risking death/ failure like her predecessor. Subtext in the shard’s warmth hints life hidden in void.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-limited stays welded to Elara’s calibrated technician diction: “resonance goggles,” “gain stages,” “harmonic analysis.” Rhythm tightens into staccato prepositional phrases under peak pressure—“tuning not for signal but for the shape of the void.” No head-hop; perceptual signature remains methodical, even when listening to silence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Strong verbs and precise nouns propel momentum; sentences carry dual duty of world-building and stakes. Minor cadence loops (“the towers… the fragment… the shard…”) in paragraph 4 dull without obscuring causality. Mixed metaphor “serenely electric night air crystallized” survives because crystallization of silence literalizes the concept.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Inverting receiver logic to treat absolute silence as the carrier is a fresh engineering twist on SETI tropes; it weaponizes a theoretical material otherwise used as mere muffler. Conceptual payoff feels inevitable yet non-obvious, and the lunar-perigee deadline localizes cosmic scale to a swaying tower platform.</comment>
