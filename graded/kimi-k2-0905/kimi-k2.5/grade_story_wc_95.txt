<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Aldric’s mechanical arm, needle card, and duel with Silas together dramatize his credo that “questions can become maps.” The contradiction—fighting a friend to decode an invitation—gives him texture and cost, yet the interiority never tips into diagnostic speak. Micro-choices (aligning needles with shadow lines) fuse motive and action; the final gift of the needle to Silas crystallizes the changed relationship. Only the off-page loss of flesh is asserted, not embodied, keeping this just shy of 8+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The causal lens holds: duel → shadow measurement → coordinate discovery → alliance re-forged, each beat because/therefore. The unfinished sundial as cipher is set up in paragraph four and paid off in the needle alignment; closure is the visible “single shared purpose” exiting the atrium. Orientation is secure inside 120 words; no teleporting props. Cost is present but generalized (“previous philosophical disagreement”), not dramatized on this page, blocking 9.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Glass atrium, brook, half-painted bronze, and Danish tin form a micro-setting ecosystem that literally steers the duel’s footwork and the decoding act. Light angles, vine-draped iron, and crimson lacquer return in the final image, charging the reconciliation. Tactile specifics—“brass joints clicking against titanium ribs,” “blue enamel stork”—are filtered through Aldric’s maker eye. Spatial choreography is flawless; no sensory checklist bloat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can a question be forced into a map—tightens when the duel’s physical pressure becomes the method for reading the dial. One meaningful escalation: Silas’s lunge forces Aldric to wedge the card against bronze, turning combat into collaboration. Cost is legible but intellectual rather than visceral; the stakes never threaten more than missed insight. Sufficient for this length, but lacks a tangible price that would push higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the confluence of violence and invitation: chaos (half-painted dial, combat) dignified into structure (vectors, truce). No moral is stated; the final image of two philosophers walking toward mapped mountains reweights earlier abstractions into concrete destination. Subtext in blade work and needle alignment carries the conceptual freight. The stork-on-tin motif subtly knots birth/delivery to idea-birth without commentary.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Detached yet urgent omniscient voice mimics Victorian-scientific prose—“pneumatic precision,” “secret geometry”—matching the clockwork arm and cartographic obsession. Rhythm modulates: long Latinate clauses for contemplation, staccato parry lines for combat. No POV slippage; perception stays welded to Aldric’s engineer gaze. Dialogue is minimal but distinct: Silas’s sardonic “You still believe…” versus Aldric’s declarative “I intend to turn…”</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud cadence varies naturally; no template churn. Figurative layer is dense but patterned—light through prism, crimson regret—paid off in final gleam of needle. Information density high: “Danish tin sewing needle card” compresses nationality, material, purpose in five syllables. Micro-scaffold spotted once (“the two philosophers sheathed their blades, the dignified chaos…”) but does not touch closure; still blocks 9+ under artifact rule.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The fusion of fencing duel + unfinished sundial + needle-cipher feels inevitable yet unseen before; the duel is both argument and measurement protocol. Victorian steampunk trappings are refreshed by geocartographic metaphysics rather than gadget porn. Risk taken in letting climax be a decoding gesture rather than wound pays off via conceptual re-coding. Specificity of Danish tin brand and stork icon roots the novum in tactile reality.</comment>
