<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses—clinging to air vs. surrendering it—play out in embodied beats; the final exhalation is credibly prepared. Interiority stays concrete, never drifts into label-speak. Micro-choice hierarchy (sister-memory vs. survival) is legible on the page. One slip: the instant neural rewrite feels reported rather than dramatized, keeping it shy of 8+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the temple opens only after she pays with her last breath—cost is visible in the silver stream. Causal chain (vial → memory → surrender → passage) holds without teleport. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) hits by word 80. No meaningful escalation cap breach; one tightening is sufficient under 800-word scope.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Body-as-setting (oxygen gauge, lungs, suit) and the vial-as-micro-setting constrain every tactical choice. Coral-encrusted spires and bioluminescent algae are filtered through crisis-narrowed perception. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly as she moves from archway to altar to exit. Temple rules remain consistent, learned by action; no exposition dump.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—surface alive vs. preserve lost memories—tightens when the gauge drops below ten minutes and again when she must exhale to trigger the exit. Surrender is an irreversible trade-off that forecloses ascent on her own terms. Pressure stays coherent under causal lens; no coin-flip rescue. Cost is on-page (silver stream, dissolved vial) and persistent (rewritten neurons).</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the tension between possession and surrender of memory; no speaker ever names it. Final image—she will “hear the gathered hush in her dreams”—reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture: the dead diver’s gloved hand still clutching the vial implies identical failure awaiting her. Complexity is honored: survival is not vilified, yet chosen transcendence carries irrevocable cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tightly tethered to Elara’s sensory funnel; no head-hop. Syntax lengthens and compresses with breath-threat, creating a perceptual signature. Diction remains within a diver’s lexicon (“thermocline,” “preservation field”) without jargon drift. No dialogue to corrupt voice; compression and patterned repetition (“gathered hush,” “lonesome splendor”) are taught early and reprised at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Rhythm modulates from long cadences of wonder to staccato crisis beats. Sentences carry double duty (action + atmosphere) with minimal scaffold. Two paraphrase loops (“lonesome splendor” echoed inside three sentences) and one filter-verb cluster (“she felt / she saw”) keep it from 8.5. No mixed metaphors; clarity survives peak pressure. Final line lands clean without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Vault-of-bottled-memory is fresh, welded to deep-sea archaeology rather than generic treasure. The test—exhale to survive—flips standard panic reflex into gate mechanic. Transformation through perfume-of-consciousness feels inevitable post-vial vision, not late gimmick. Specificity (antique suit, crystal dissolving) prevents swipe-and-replace with another setting.</comment>
