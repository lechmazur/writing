<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maya’s interior contradiction—secrecy vs. the need to pass the torch—peaks when the child accosts her; the renunciation of anonymity is earned because every prior run dramatized the cost of exposure. Micro-choices (no torch, exact placement of insulin) reveal a hierarchy that prizes collective survival over personal credit. The only bar to 9+ is that her flaw/struggle is stated more than embodied in visceral beats.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the bell’s first audible peal reweights the entire distribution scheme from clandestine to communal, cost paid by Maya’s surrender of invisibility. Causal chain holds—anonymous runs → bell as compass → child’s discovery → public declaration—without off-stage shortcuts. Orientation is anchored by word 95; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Needle-strewn path, ceramic pot at the mortar line, and the bell’s cool silver recur as tactile anchors that constrain action (navigation without light, exact drop site). Terra-cotta arbor functions as micro-setting: it orients every exit/return and supplies the final stage. One small slip—“amplified quiet” is used twice without fresh sensory twist—prevents 9.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—keep community alive under sanctions—tightens when the child’s offer forces Maya to choose between operational security and intergenerational continuity. One meaningful turn: the declaration that redefines givers/recipients, foreclosing anonymity forever. Cost is legible (loss of protective secrecy), though sanctions themselves stay static rather than worsening within the scene.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme of collective self-reliance emerges through redistribution praxis, never slogan. Final image—citizens ascending to claim the bell—reconfigures exile into homeland without moralizing. Subtle irony: the “donations” were always their own goods, a revelation that revalues prior nights’ labor. One hair below 9+ because the child’s desire to help is stated, not freighted with subtext.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Maya’s sensory field; perceptual signature favors temperature and texture over sight (“cool against her fingertips,” “boots soft on needles”). Syntax lengthens under reflection, then fragments when the girl speaks, mirroring risk. No head-hop; diction stays within a ridge-dweller’s lexicon. The single spoken line carries adequate subtext.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no filter-verb stacks. High density: one clause often fuses action, setting, and emotional charge (“she left his insulin…exactly where the terra-cotta met the crumbling mortar”). One loop risk—“midnight food runs” is repeated thrice in 100 words mid-story—barely avoids −0.3. No mixed metaphors; figurative language recedes during the climactic bell strike, letting the sound itself land.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Inverts the secret-savior trope by revealing the savior is the collective itself; the bell’s silence-turned-sound is a fresh inversion of Chekhov’s gun. Specific exile detail (grandmother’s original flight, terra-cotta arbor) roots the premise so it cannot be relocated unchanged. Takes the risk of an almost entirely off-stage antagonist (sanctions) and still charges the finale—success without gimmickry.</comment>
