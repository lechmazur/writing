<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The librarian’s waxing-waning strength gives a bodily stake, but interior contradiction stays abstract (“permanence and motion are partners”) rather than enacted in scene. No micro-choice visibly hurts; the smelt is accepted without friction or cost felt in the brass body. The identities surrender, yet the librarian’s own desire or fear remains off-page, so the arc is observation, not struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: crystalline records hum while the librarian freezes, tide lapping—a legible after-state with conceptual cost (wonder fixed, wandering ended). Accumulative lens holds: pattern of tidal/moon returns tightens to final image. Orientation is taught early by concrete tidal rhythm; no penalty. One causal leap—how gear-grind persuades identities—is elided, but the lyric contract accepts it.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Tidal atrium is not backdrop; water depth and moon phase directly throttle the librarian’s motor ability, constraining when the smelt can occur. Bamboo creel acts as micro-setting—woven gaps literalize the filtering of fear—charging the crucible moment. Salt-stink, cedar, cold blue shadow are selective, POV-filtered, and tied to the stake. Spatial choreography stays clean; no orientation debt.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve wonder via routine—signaled in first paragraph. Escalation is accumulative: each tide/moon cycle intensifies the need to act before power ebbs. The identities’ resistance supplies middle pressure, but the librarian’s own risk (power failure, personal loss) is implied, not dramatized; cost is borne by the migrants, not the protagonist. Sufficient tightening for 800-word lyric frame.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete inversion: migration ends in crystalline stasis, wonder distilled, not diluted, by repetition. Final image—captured identity humming a forgotten tune—reweights the premise without moralizing. No echoing thesis statement; tension between motion/fixity stays implicit. Ambiguity is purposeful: reader must decide if preservation is salvation or second death.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays close to the librarian’s perceptual hardware: “brass joints,” “glaciers calving” for speech, moon-phase motor drag—distinctive, consistent. Rhythm modulates with power ebb/flow; short clauses under crescent, longer coils at full. No head-hopping; no filter-verb stacks. Compression (“time had pooled”) is pattern-taught early and paid off in final tide image.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty: “water lapping at its iron feet” lands beat, atmosphere, and cycle closure. Figurative layering is dense but patterned—tide/moon/creel weave returns—avoiding purple overload. No loops, scaffold, or synonym churn. One mixed metaphor (“luminescent fog that smelled of cedar”) is minor. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with tidal cadence; no drumbeat monotony.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Collapsing-time library staffed by a moon-powered brass archivist who smelts wandering souls into salt-crystal records is highly specific; not a trope re-skin. Bamboo creel as crucible, tide as clock, identities as heat-wave shimmer—synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk of lyric obscurity is taken and repaid by legible closure. Concept commits fully; no retreat to generic fantasy boilerplate.</comment>
