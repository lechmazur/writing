<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—archivist’s precision vs. dream-driven audacity—drives every micro-choice; her bow stroke is an embodied wager that forecloses sterile documentation. The antique program’s growing dampness in her grip is a tactile cost that scales to the ghost-collaboration. Passivity is impossible: each pulse of water and light demands she improvise under mortal risk. The final renunciation—letting the dissolved program drift away—reads as earned relinquishment of archival safety for artistic consummation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the water’s six-inch recession is an undeniable physical reconfiguration that costs Elara her archival relic and future certainty, crystallizing the before/after under an Accumulative lens. Causality holds: because she obeys every liquid hieroglyph, therefore the hydraulic ghost recedes. Orientation is anchored by word 60 ("Queen's Theater's decay") and the spatial map remains coherent. One tightening suffices; the rising density of water-borne instructions escalates stakes without causal zig-zags.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The flooded pit functions as a micro-setting that actively constrains foot-placement, bow pressure, and lantern angles; the water level’s final drop is inseparable from closure. Velvet seats, black water, and silver shimmers are filtered through Elara’s cellist ear—she “hears” ripples as rhythmic notation. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly: lanterns → intersecting beams → warped program → bow entry → water recession. One object, the translucent program, evolves from archive to score to dissolved offering, charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—break the 1923 silent loop or remain its archivist—is signaled in the first paragraph and tightens when each water-stain becomes an unplayable note she must choose to voice. Agency is absolute: she positions lanterns, draws bow, relinquishes artifact; no coincidence resolves the chord. Cost is visible on-page: “the antique program grew damp in her hands” and finally dissolves, trading archival permanence for acoustic exorcism. One meaningful deepening—spiral staves becoming real-time instructions—suffices to reweight options.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the particular act of turning archival decay into living sound: conservation mutates into co-creation across mortality. Subtext resides in silent gestures—Vane’s translucent raised hands acknowledge completion without spoken treaty. The final image dissolves the literal program into the receding tide, reweighting preservation as release rather than possession. No moral is stated; resonance lingers in the felt cost of letting the artifact go.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Perceptual signature is cellist-specific: “the hush of unstruck chords” translates visual decay into auditory potential. Rhythm accelerates with shorter clauses under lantern alignment, then stretches with sustained vowels during bow draw. Filter verbs are voice-motivated (“she understood this now with the certainty…”) and remain inside her sensory bandwidth. No head-hopping; Vane appears only as externalized apparition filtered through Elara’s gaze.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm modulates naturally: longer lyrical openings contract to percussive fragments (“She raised her bow”). Figurative language is selective—two metaphors per beat at peak—avoiding purple overlay. No synonym loops or template cadence; each water image serves distinct causal or sensory work. One minor scaffold: “the silence possessed a texture she had never encountered” could trim “she had,” but momentum survives.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of hydro-archaeology and acoustic necromancy feels non-obvious yet inevitable: water damage as living notation transforms a stock ghost-story into site-specific musicology. Risk—letting the sole archival proof dissolve—heightens coherence rather than gimmickry because the closure depends on that loss. Detail is irreplaceable: spiral staves, six-inch recession, silver shimmer between liquid and air could not transplant to another venue without breaking the plot. The premise commits fully; no safety-hedging conserves the artifact.</comment>
