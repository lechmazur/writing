<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Interiority is sensorily rich (“transliterate his anxiety into something heavy…read with his palms like braille”), but the fisher’s cool-headed trait is asserted more than embodied; no contradictory heat under pressure. Micro-choices (zigzag steps, voicing silence) are vivid, yet the final bearing of the fused spike feels slightly unearned because prior emotional risk is lyrically diffuse rather than dramatized as failure or loss. Still, a clear endurance with cost—“marked him as both hunter and hunted”—meets the 600-word threshold for credible renunciation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the goddess echo is captured yet the sky is “blank as a fresh page,” a felt conceptual cost. Causality is lyric-accumulative rather than strictly because/therefore, but the pattern is taught early (garden responds to intention) and holds to the final transliteration. No orientation debt; who/where/when are anchored within 120 words. One meaningful tightening—“the patterns were breaking themselves”—reweights stakes satisfactorily.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The sonic garden is not postcard backdrop; its reeds part literally in response to silence, constraining Kael’s footwork and enabling the climax. Micro-setting (rail spike, echo pool) functions as extension of body and mythic antenna. Sensory hierarchy skews to infrasonic touch and thermal script, matching the POV’s fisher-tactile bias. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from perimeter to center and out again under a sky whose dissolution directly charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—capture the goddess echo before patterns scatter it—is signaled early and tightens once: constellations “tumbled into one another, creating bright wounds,” narrowing Kael’s window. Agency is present (zigzag, spike plunge, null-song) with visible thermal and existential cost. Escalation is single-wave rather than multi-turn, sufficient for 700-word lyric mode. No coincidence resolves; the final blank sky is consequence, not deus ex machina.</question>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</question><comment>Theme emerges obliquely: translation as mortal theft of transcendence. The feral lullaby image crystallizes the idea that order contains wildness, never stated. Subtext operates in silence pockets and iron heat rather than exposition. Final reconfiguration—godhood rendered into mortal braille—avails multiple readings without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is distinct: bass roots beneath boots, thermal script, “voicing silence” as negative space—all filtered through a fisher’s haptic worldview. Syntax is lyrically compressed yet coherent; patterned elision (“moved by voicing silence”) is taught early and paid off. No head-hopping; single POV holds. Diction remains within plausible lexicon while reaching for mythic register without purple drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Rhythm modulates from long inhalation sentences to staccato clauses under peak pressure (“The garden screamed, then hushed”). Figurative density is high but purposeful, each vehicle extending the acoustic metaphysics (soundscape, fossilized vowels). No synonym loops or scaffold; every sentence advances image or stakes. Minor strain in “transliterate” repetition (−0.2) but does not dull closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Acoustic theology grafted onto rail-spike relic is fresh synthesis; not a trope checklist. Risk-taking—sleepwalking constellations, null-song as tool—heightens stakes without losing clarity. Specificity (“silver phonemes that tasted like mother's milk and ozone”) prevents abstraction. Transformation test fails if relocated to vanilla fantasy, confirming integrality.</comment>
