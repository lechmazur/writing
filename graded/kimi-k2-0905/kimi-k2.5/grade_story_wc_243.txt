<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is evocative but remains at an aesthetic distance; her “gentle thoroughness” is asserted rather than dramatized in micro-choices. The sister’s laugh is the only concrete spur, but it never collides with a present-tense contradiction that would force a visible cost. Closure is lyrical renunciation, yet the causal chain between photo-touch and decision to keep writing is implied, not embodied. Character therefore hovers in the 6-band: atmospheric, not crucible-forged.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: grief-density steepens atmosphere until blooms respond, yielding a Charged Poise ending (“carrying the past gently… into whatever context came next”) with conceptual cost. Orientation is swift; twilight, jetty, archivist task clear by 50 words. Central weakness: no micro-turn that materially threatens failure; the “one crushed flower” rule is named but never tested, so the covenant’s regeneration feels pre-assured rather than earned. Closure lands as resonance, not decisive change, capping the 7-band.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The mnemonic flowers, walnut ink, and salt-steeped pilings are tactile, specific, and filtered through Mara’s archival gaze. Fog, light, and concrete cracks guide her footfalls, turning setting into hazard and tool. The locket photo functions as micro-setting that warms against her sternum, constraining her path down the slope. Environment is inseparable from the stakes; remove the jetty’s slanted bloom-density and the entire ritual collapses.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—preserving small moments so the dead may speak—signals early and tightens via twilight deadline. However, escalation is atmospheric, not tactical: salinity shifts are asserted, not demonstrated through a beat that narrows Mara’s options. No credible risk of failure is activated; the flowers close on schedule regardless of her precision. Stakes resonate, but pressure plateaus rather than spikes, holding mid-6.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of memory-as-biochemistry emerges through blooms tasting of “old photographs,” avoiding thesis statement. Subtext whispers that archiving is a stay against personal erasure—Mara’s refusal to open the locket at the end reweights the photo from evidence to embodied scar. The ethic of “gentle thoroughness” quietly indicts heroic intervention, favoring slow witness. Moral complexity lingers: remembrance perpetuates grief yet abandoning it erases the dead.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person lingers inside Mara’s selective attention—she notices angles, silence between heartbeats, tannin scent. Syntax lengthens under dusk fatigue, then compresses as blooms close, mirroring ritual cadence. No dialogue, so voice carries entirely through weighted nominal phrases (“not-flowers,” “undifferentiated silence”). Register stays within an archivist’s lexicon; perceptual signature is consistent and pressure-responsive.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is lyrical but disciplined: each sentence layers sensory or cognitive detail without surplus modifiers. Occasional surplus nominalizations (“the archiving began”) could be trimmed, yet rhythm breathes. No loops, mixed metaphors, or scaffold; figurative vehicles stay coherent (“paper lanterns,” “wet sugar”). Final paragraph achieves quiet crescendo without artifact, sustaining momentum into the closing Charged Poise.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Grief-altered salinity causing mnemonic flora is a fresh physics-of-memory concept, executed with internal consistency. Archivist profession is repurposed as spiritual chemist, transcending trope. Risk-taking lies in renunciatory closure—no bloom saved, no sister revived—yet the covenant renews through attention alone. Specificity of walnut ink steeping in prior grief converts abstraction into sensory process, pushing beyond lyric template.</comment>
