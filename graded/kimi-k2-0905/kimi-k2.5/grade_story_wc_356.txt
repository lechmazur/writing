<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elara’s olfactory gift and ambition are concrete, but interiority drifts into abstract self-help (“endurance itself was a form of medicine”) rather than embodied contradiction. The seed-planting choice is steady, yet no micro-choice visibly risks or forfeits anything on the page; cost is asserted, not dramatized. Interior conflict is announced, not enacted in split-scene impulse. Still, her sensory POV is specific and the lineage dread feels lived-in.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure is a CR: the corpse-flower paradox reweights her premise—mimicry of rebirth, not death—cost is conceptual but legible. Causal chain is thin: doodle-map leads → hollow → plant; no obstacle or false turn tightens options. Orientation is clear within 120 words. Lens stays Accumulative/Textural: pattern of scent, doodle, sway; final stillness reconfigures meaning. One tightening suffices, but escalation is more texture- than choice-driven.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Treetop village is tactile—velvet moss, rope ladders, cedar heartbeat—and constrains action: altitude demands balance, acidic crook dictates planting spot. Sensory hierarchy obeys Elara’s nose; scent tracks time. Spatial choreography is clean; no floating platforms. Micro-setting (seed site) charges the final image. Weather and sway integrate with theme of motion vs. stillness. Meets 9+ gate: environment shapes tactics and final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—grow the infamous bloom without gagging on its stench—is signaled early. Pressure is atmospheric (sway, stench threat) rather than a narrowing choice; no reversal or trade-off complicates the planting. Serenity-vs-motion is asserted, not tested by an external hitch. Cost is future-threat (“would suffer”), not present-tense. One meaningful deepening (realizing mimicry vs death) reweights stake, satisfying lens, yet escalation stays mild.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme—enduring foulness to witness rebirth—emerges through scent imagery and grandmother’s doodle wisdom; no moralizing summary. Subtext in the doodle tremor hints at shared dread. Final CR reweights “putrefaction” as precursor, not endpoint. Resists tidy maxim, invites counter-reading: ambition masquerading as service. Could use one earlier sensory echo of rot to prime irony.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Third-person hovers close to Elara’s olfactory cognition; perceptual signature is consistent (“wildflower hush,” “damp earth and distant thunder”). Syntax lengthens during sway, shortens at seed placement—rhythmic control under pressure. No dialogue, so no voice bleed. Diction stays within herbalist lexicon; occasional elevated phrasing (“journalized,” “olfactorily sensitive”) reads as in-world precision rather than authorial flourish. Pattern-taught elision (tide-thought) paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Paragraph rhythm breathes with elevation changes; openings vary. Density is high—one sentence often does two jobs. Minor loop: “wildflower hush” repeated front and back feels purposeful reprise, not churn. One scaffold: “cultivate serenity within motion” is stated twice with near-paraphrase. Metaphors stay coherent (tide, heartbeat). No artifact touches closure. Filter verbs minimal and motivated.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Corpse-flower + aromatherapy + arboreal oracle culture is fresh synthesis; trope of ancestral map is re-inked as doodle on recycled wrapping—specific, eco-rooted. Risk taken in Accumulative/Textural lens over plot-heavy arc succeeds. Could push further: no scene where stench actually assails her, so paradox remains conceptual. Still, olfactory quest in swaying canopy feels memorably particular.</comment>
