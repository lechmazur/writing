<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is lush—her fear of the tablet, the viscerality of the moss, the tug of centuries—but the text repeats “fractured timelines” instead of dramatizing a single remembered death that could crystallize contradiction. The final self-integration is declared, not demonstrated through a micro-choice that costs her a live option; the tablet dissolves and she simply smiles. Emotion is richly embodied yet never refracted against another will, so pressure stays internal and circular.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise: the viaduct fades as tattoos pulse, showing earned fusion of selves. However, causality is lyric-associative; the tablet’s procedural rule is asserted, not tested in a beat where a wrong step almost kills her. Orientation is clear by ~100 words, but the drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of collapsing ghosts—so the single tightening is the dusting of the tablet; this lands, yet feels neat rather than costly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The rain-slick viaduct breathes: biolum moss brightens underfoot, stones warm, storm residue beads on skin—every sensory note filtered through Elara’s disorientation. Spatial choreography is immaculate; she hovers, descends, and the staircase generates beneath bare feet with wet-slap echoes. The glowing architecture is not backdrop but constraint: each step must be committed before it exists, literalizing the stakes; this charges the final image and satisfies the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—merge splintered selves or stay eternally fractured—is signaled early. Escalation is textural: ghost-images reach out, then collapse; brightness paradox intensifies. The procedural staircase tightens options—she can’t see the next step—yet the cost is conceptual (fear of void) rather than embodied injury or irretrievable loss. Sufficient for short-form, but the tightening would cut deeper if one misstep bloodied her or erased a beloved memory on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme of self-multiplicity emerges through recurrent images of reflection—glowing water, shifting runes, collapsing doubles—never authorial thesis. Final tattooed pulse reweights prior motifs: cartography is no longer external but skin-bound, signaling acceptance. The piece avoids moralizing, yet the insight remains cerebral; one grounded sensory cost (a phantom scar that stays numb) would push resonance higher.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays tight to Elara’s perceptual filter: synesthetic “darkening brightness,” “wet slap” of nascent stone. Syntax lengthens under awe, compresses during descent, mirroring breath. No dialogue, so voice carries all; diction flirts with excess but stays anchored to her awe. A singular rhythmic signature—long hyphenated clauses collapsing into blunt nouns—creates memorable texture without obscurity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Line-level craft is exuberant: stacked metaphors (“cartography of fractured timelines”) risk purple but maintain internal consistency. No loops or scaffold; each sentence adds new sensory angle or conceptual turn. Occasional abstraction (“impossible structure”) slightly dulls immediacy mid-paragraph, yet momentum survives. Closing image is crisp, letting the viaduct fade without verbal overkill.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The conceit—eternal woman procedurally regenerating her own psychic viaduct—feels fresh, executed via sustained lyric metaphor rather than twist. Familiar tropes (time-loops, living runes) are reanimated through tactile rain, glowing algae, and skin-ink terminus. Risk in dense lyricism pays off: the reader experiences the maze as sensory overload, matching Elara’s fragmentation. Could edge higher with one concrete rule-limit that surprises (e.g., a tattoo fading if she doubts).</comment>
