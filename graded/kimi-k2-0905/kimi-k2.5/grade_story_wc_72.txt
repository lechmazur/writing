<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Corvin’s contradictory impulses—statue-still duty vs. trembling doubt—play out in-scene through the foxglove ampoule crush; the cost of trading certainty for “polyculture of maybe” is embodied in his calcified fingers bleeding purple smoke. Interiority stays granite-hard yet porous, never drifting into label-speak. The final renunciation of absolutes is earned by the prior cascade of micro-choices and pays visible price: the dome breathes but no longer shelters him from pressure. Character arc and theme are inseparable, satisfying 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a crisp Conceptual Repricing: shattering the ampoule through the hairline fissure rewrites the garden’s epistemic rule-set from binary obedience to “gradient, spectrum, mercy with edges.” Causal chain is intact: reveal caretaker suicide → doubt → ampoule → crack → root spiral; each beat narrows options until the final image of bioluminescent question-marks. Accumulated lyric density teaches its pattern early and lands undeniable cost—“the dome did not collapse; it breathed.” Drive lens (Hybrid sliding to Accumulative) holds cleanly through the charged poise ending.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Underwater dome, hydrothermal vent, and calcified body function as micro-setting that literally constrain access and method; the fissure’s hairline weakness is Chekhov-anchored early and exploited at climax. Sensory triage favors iron-tasting blackwater and violet bruise-anemones filtered through Corvin’s mineral perception. Spatial choreography tracks his chest-deep drift eastward without drift or contradiction. Environment charges the final image—bioluminescent plankton spelling question marks—qualifying 9+ gate.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—whether to propagate the architect’s regret or let certainty stand—is signaled by word 50 and tightens when Corvin chooses the fissure over ritual. One meaningful reversal: certainty petrifies → doubt liberates, paid for by structural risk of dome breach. Agency is internal yet causative; the ampoule smash is irreversible and prices him with permanent cognitive noise. Cost is legible on-page: “granite heart accommodating the pressure of contradiction.”</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges via image string—foxglove poison/heal, coral scream/sing, cement/root—culminating in the non-literal answer that “mercy and judgment share the same stained-glass vessel.” No moralizing; the final line offers charged poise instead of thesis. Ambivalence is dramatized through tactile beats (shattering glass, spiraling roots) rather than abstraction. The reader leaves with concrete emotional after-effect: the taste of iron and the sound of a minor-major song.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Corvin’s perceptual signature—mineral, tidal, medicinal—governs diction (“calcified fingers,” “saline and regret”) and stays consistent under pressure. Compression like “incisively kind” is taught by repetition and paid off when he cuts dogma without wounding. Syntax lengthens then fractures in sync with the garden’s shift from rigid verticals to spiral doubt. No head-hopping; telepathic static is cleanly bounded to his granite sensorium.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose density is high—metaphor every second sentence—yet pattern-taught early (“bloomed like violet bruises”) so it reads as voice rather than overlay. No mixed metaphors; vehicles stay aquatic, lithic, or pharmacological. One paraphrase loop detected (“mercy with edges” / “mercy and judgment”) but it serves thematic reprise and does not dull closure. Rhythm modulates from long hydrothermal breaths to staccato root-spiral sentences, propelling the ending.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Synthesizes myth, pharmacology, and undersea biome into a coherent moral calculus that feels inevitable in hindsight. The “structural weakness as conduit” inversion is a fresh engineering of epiphany rarely seen. Risk—letting the garden breathe rather than collapse—heightens meaning without gimmick. Specificity of foxglove toxin as both salvation and sentence prevents abstract drift.</comment>
