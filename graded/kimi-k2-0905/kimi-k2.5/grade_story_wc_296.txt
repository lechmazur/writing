<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s guardedness is shown through her refusal to flinch and her readiness to keep the empty vial; the druidic vocation is embodied in the katas and seed-use. Interior contradiction is thin—no moment where her serenity cracks—so the “sorrow” of the final line feels announced rather than dramatized. Still, her micro-choices (planting feet, releasing seed) align with motive and carry visible cost, satisfying the 9- gate.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the lake’s spin reverses, orchard settles, and Elara’s stance shifts from warlike serenity to “simple peace” with the ash of the spent seed as felt price. Causal chain (mirror-trick failure → vortex → stillness) holds under the Accumulative lens; each widening circle is a beat that reweights the stake. Orientation is anchored by line 3; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The black water, saber-sound branches, and crystal vial are tactile and POV-filtered; the vortex itself functions as micro-setting that constrains every step. “Expanding circles” and “spiral rhythm” give spatial choreography that the final stillness pays off. Environment directly shapes tactics—she must match the spin—meeting the 9+ constraint test.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“discover what mirrors don’t show”—is signaled early and tightens when the vortex demands she unbend or break. The single deepening (stillness defeats spiral) narrows her options to absolute stasis, costing the seed and her guarded poise. Price is legible in the ash and the final hand on empty vial; escalation coheres under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through reversal of reflection: inward-spun illusion becomes outward release. The confession’s thaw reweights “cursed” to “imprisoned,” inviting reflection on who is truly trapped. No moralizing—final image of hand near empty vial leaves cost open. Slight abstraction in “correct angle of truth” keeps it from 9+.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person POV stays tight to Elara’s perceptual filter: “warm and hungry” seed, “sound of sabers drawn in slow motion.” Syntax mirrors her katas—controlled, rhythmic, then loosening into the final quiet. No head-hopping; diction remains within druidic lexicon. Distinct texture sustains through peak beat.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet lucid: each sentence advances image or pressure. Metaphors (“green tornado of roots and rot”) are vivid but never stacked; no mixed vehicles. One paraphrase loop—“expanding circles” repeated across two adjacent clauses—drops it 0.1. Otherwise rhythm breathes with escalation and closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Flips the familiar “cursed lake” trope into a recursive orchard prison that must be un-spun; the flesh-eating seed as key of liberation is fresh and inevitable. Conceptual re-pricing of mirror-direction is specific to this world logic. Risk in lyric escalation pays off without obscuring causality.</comment>
