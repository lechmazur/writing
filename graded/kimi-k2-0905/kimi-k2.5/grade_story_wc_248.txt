<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Maya’s shift from arsonist to translator of absence is embodied in tactile micro-choices—charcoal from embers pressed into canvas, hair woven with tapestry thread—so the renunciation feels earned. Interiority stays concrete: “volcanic tenderness” is felt on fingertips, not labeled. The only drag is a late echo of “analytically intuitive” that sounds diagnostic rather than lived, but the final tear through soot sells the cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the healed-yet-scarred portrait reweights every prior fire into invitation, cost legible in “tears cutting through soot.” Causal chain holds: burnings → silence → art → covenant revived. Mosaic structure (library ashes across three cities) is taught by the 25 % mark and spirals inward cleanly; transitions are dated by location, keeping orientation intact.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Limestone hollow, volcanic glass, and mineral air are filtered through Maya’s guilt-tuned senses; each gallery-of-ash site is anchored with a single sensory hook (smoke as incense, obsidian light). The tapestry fragment and the obsidian mosaic function as micro-settings that constrain her next artistic move. Spatial choreography is clean: she “steps back into the shadows” after placing the final piece—body position tracks.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—resurrect the non-interference covenant—tightens when each artwork forecloses her old tactic of erasure; the Portland mosaic’s “trapped light and warning” visibly prices her new visibility. One meaningful escalation suffices: the decision to heal the vandalized face rather than keep it gouged narrows options from destruction to curation. Pressure stays causal under Hybrid lens; no coincidence resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme—knowledge as connection, not domination—emerges from negative space: the scratched-away face, the hollow archive, the silence after fire. No character moralizes; the covenant is re-enacted through material choices. Final image of “volcanic tenderness erupting into quiet” reweights all prior violence as generative without sermon. Ambiguity lingers: who is “worthy” remains unanswered, preserving tension.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays tight to Maya’s perceptual filter: “air tasted of mineral regret” is idiosyncratic yet concrete. Rhythm modulates—long accumulative clauses for descent, staccato prepositional phrases (“against blackened stone”) for placement beats. No head-hopping; “we” never intrudes. Compressed diction under peak stress (“she set up her easel in the dim chamber”) keeps immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty: “charcoal from the library embers” embeds setting, material, and backstory in five words. Figurative layer is disciplined—one metaphor per beat, no mixed vehicles. Occasional elevated register (“conflagration erasing centuries of curated lies”) risks purple but is earned by overall density. Zero loops, clean grammar, strong paragraph cut test.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Premise flips colonial archive tropes: civilization hides to protect the future, not be rediscovered. Artistic trail as map-in-negative is fresh; the scarred portrait as coordinate system feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk—burning libraries to save wisdom—pays off without gimmick. Specificity of mother-of-pearl warning mosaic and hair-woven hands anchors universals in singular images.</comment>
