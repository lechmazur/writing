<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Elara’s interiority is lyrically specific—“time felt like rough linen dragged across wet skin”—but her decisions are largely receptive: she approaches, reaches, presses, understands. No contradictory impulse complicates the final surrender; she simply accedes to the urn’s dissolve. The beat-to-beat causality that would dramatize a genuine cost to her hoarded seconds is displaced into poetic paraphrase, so the renunciation feels preordained rather than earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>The mosaic of shards (garage-sale ads → emerald silo → urn dissolve) is taught by 25 % and lands a Conceptual Repricing: time is not measured but accumulated. Orientation wavers early—who/where/when arrive after 120 words—but the disorientation is later paid off by the green-tinted eternity image, so the Orientation Test is waived. Closure carries unmistakable cost: the urn dissolves into her, erasing her borrowed-time identity and archiving her in an eternal present. Causality under Accumulative/Textural lens holds; one tightening suffices.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The emerald silo’s oxidized jade finger, the urn shard that cuts without blood, and the prairie sky collapsing into chromatic shift all constrain Elara’s choices—she can only enter, accept, and be rewritten. Selective sensory hierarchy (smell of “grandmother’s unfulfilled promises,” tactile linen-lightning) mirrors her disintegrating metric of time. Environment and object charge the final image: the silo hums as the shard dissolves, reconfiguring her body into the new temporal fabric. Meets 9+ gate: setting/tool charges closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—can Elara keep stealing fragments of linear time?—is signaled in paragraph one. Pressure escalates once: the urn fragment offers “genuine sensation” versus her hoarded increments, forcing surrender. Cost is legible (her palm is cut, her identity archived), but the beat is compressed into a single lyrical gesture rather than a tested tactical trade-off. Sufficient tightening for 600-word Accumulative arc, yet the absence of a live antagonistic force or second tightening keeps it below 8.0.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges implicitly: measurement versus experience of time. The garage-sale nostalgia cipher, the urn’s rough-linen chronology, and the final “endless texture” reweight the premise without moralizing. Ambiguity is purposeful—numbers evolve, past/future collapse—and the emotional aftereffect is concrete: reader feels the linen-drag across skin. No final-paragraph thesis statement; resonance is earned through imagistic particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Perceptual signature is consistent: Elara thinks in tactile synaesthesia—“three became yesterday and seven transformed into the color blue.” Syntax lengthens then fragments under pressure, mirroring broken chronometers. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk is zero. Patterned elision (“borrowed-time existence measured in the gaps between heartbeats”) is taught early and paid off by the dissolving shard. Meets 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Rhythm modulates from languid clauses to staccato fragments without algorithmic drift. Figurative density is high but patterned, taught by first third, and charges closure. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn; each image advances texture or knowledge. One mixed metaphor—“wound of twisted metal”—slips through but does not obscure the final dissolve.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The garage-sale ad cipher for temporal coordinates is a fresh inflection; the cremation urn as vessel of “concentrated chronology” reweights a mundane object into ontological stakes. Risky lyric compression succeeds because pattern is taught and closure remains legible. Concept commits fully—numbers mutate into color, time becomes tactile fabric—without retreat to conventional clock imagery.</comment>
