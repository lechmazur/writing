<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mira’s shift from complicit performer to self-immolating truth-teller is rendered through embodied micro-choices (knife hand vs. shielding hand) and a credible internal contradiction—she destroys her own safety to expiate the fakery that enabled catastrophe. The final reading voice that “trembled neither with false drama nor with survivor’s guilt” crystallizes an earned renunciation; the cost is the applause-turned-warning ricocheting from the dome. Benevolent ruthlessness is not merely labeled but dramatized in the clean sever of leather cords while she shields the nurses’ pages—an action that forecloses her protected anonymity. Interiority stays particular to her ex-actor sensorium (“half-false, half-true light”) and drives every beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a textbook Conceptual Repricing: the three-minute shaft of pure sunlight makes the pawns’ absence legible to the crowd, reweighting the city’s narrative rule-set forever. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—each spelled step and drifting penumbra thickens the texture until the pattern ruptures into undeniable light. Causality holds: because she walks LIBER/REMEMBER, because she cuts the cords, the ledger’s voice reaches the square and the eclipse briefly lifts. Cost is concrete—her lifelong protective penumbra of performed ambiguity burns off in public view.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The whispering gallery is not backdrop but instrument: its acoustic throw makes her private breath communal, forcing the stakes skyward at the exact moment she opens the ledger. The nomadic penumbra operates as mobile lighting rig and psychological mirror, constraining her to half-light tactics until the oculus coup de théâtre. Even the chessboard’s missing row functions as micro-setting, its velvet-lined cavity the literal hiding place that enables the final reveal. Spatial choreography is flawless: we track her orbit, the shadow’s drift, and the crowd’s position beneath the dome without a single float.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“free the truth or stay safe”—is signaled in paragraph one and tightens when the cords are cut, foreclosing retreat. The meaningful deepening occurs when the whispering architecture converts her solitary voice into mass audition; the option to retract dies there. No coincidence resolves anything; the sun’s return is a timed environmental constraint, not deus ex machina. Price is paid on-page: permanent exposure, applause that may be threat, and the erasure of her own protective penumbra.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: erased commoners reclaim narrative centrality through the very medium—official history—that silenced them. The luminous absence of pawns becomes a resonant, non-literal answer to the story’s governing question: what is a city worth if it forgets its diagonal mercies? No character sermonizes; the final image of glowing empty squares reweights all prior metaphor without moralizing. Subtext lives in gesture: the hand that shields while it severs embodies the merciless mercy driving the piece.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person POV hovers at a calibrated psychic distance—close enough for visceral interiority yet wide enough to catch architectural acoustics and crowd motion. Syntax mirrors ex-actor precision: cadenced clauses like “left, pause, right-right, pause” stage the performance inside the prose itself. Diction stays within Mira’s lexicon of stages, scripts, and light; no filter verbs dilute immediacy. The final sentence’s diagonal metaphor lands as clean internal thought, not narrator editorial.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Every sentence performs double duty—e.g., “applause, or perhaps warning” advances plot while re-tonalizing the stakes. Figurative language is sparse, surgical, and pattern-consistent: penumbra as predator, light that reveals by obscuring. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; even the repeated “benevolently ruthless” recurs only after it has been dramatized, so it functions as reprise, not filler. Rhythm accelerates into the sunlight burst, then snaps to the quiet final clause—precise line-level control under peak pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>The crisis-actor-turned-crisis-survivor angle refracts a familiar post-catastrophe reckoning through a fresh theatrical lens; the walking-alphabet device literalizes “spelling out truth” without feeling gimmicky. Missing pawns as erased civilians is overt yet transformed by the ledger’s micro-gestures—yeast shared, tourniquets tied—particulars no other story would catalogue. Risk is high: a lyric, single-scene mosaic that stakes everything on a three-minute sunlight flare, yet coherence never wavers. The synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight yet unforeseeable at entry—hallmark originality.</comment>
