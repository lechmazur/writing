<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mara’s contradictory impulses—clinging to the garden relic while needing to leave it—are dramatized in embodied micro-choices (pocketing the gauge, gripping the oars). The final renunciation of the fire-escape identity is earned by the prior beats of calibration and rowing; cost is visible in the cold metal against her thigh and the dawn vigil. Interiority stays concrete, never drifting into label-speak. One hairline slip: “wistfully pragmatic” is used twice as authorial label rather than dramatized trait, slightly diluting the contradiction on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the lighthouse beam’s first sweep re-weights the bitting gauge from keepsake to public instrument, crystallizing her shift from private grief to guardianship. Causal chain is clean—petal drop → row → climb → calibration → beam—each beat foreclosing retreat. The 20-year backstory fragment is anchored to the present tactile cue of cold metal and immediately tilts her decision to climb. No orientation drift; spatial logic holds from fire escape to breakwater ladder.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The cracked lighthouse lens and moon-fractured water constrain her movements and supply the exact resource (reflected light) that resolves the stake. Micro-setting of the gauge tooth against thigh functions as tactile compass, charging the final image. Selective sensory hierarchy—rust, dust motes, salt air—mirrors her narrowed crisis perception without tourist catalog. One minor over-description: “silver light into pathways across the black waves” slightly repeats the already-established luminous harbor.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—restore the dark lighthouse—tightens once: the mirrors must be calibrated before dawn traffic appears. Agency is continuous: every oar-stroke forecloses return to the garden. Cost is legible in blistered palms and the irrevocable abandonment of the fire-escape sanctuary. No escalation reversal is needed; the single deepening suffices under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme of private grief transformed into public caretaking emerges through the gauge’s re-purposing and the beam’s first sweep, never stated. The rose petal and lighthouse mirror form a silent dialectic of surrender and reflection, re-weighted at closure. Final image of “vigilance that was… fragile and unbreakable” offers Charged Poise without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo; no character articulates the thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Mara’s perceptual signature—she notices soil temperature, mirror angles, harbor debris—never ventriloquizing what she can’t know. Rhythm modulates from long horticultural sentences to clipped mechanical adjustments, mirroring her shift from gardener to technician. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk is zero. One tiny filter-verb cluster: “she understood now why” could have been cut, but it occurs early and doesn’t recur under peak pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sentence music varies naturally; the oar-cadence anaphora is purposeful and paid off. Information density is high—each sentence advances stake or atmosphere. No mixed metaphors; “quivering hush” is taught early and sustained. One scaffold phrase: “the rhythm of oars in water” is repeated verbatim; trimming the second instance would sharpen propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The bitting gauge as lighthouse calibrator is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis that feels inevitable once revealed. Fire-escape gardener → moon-powered lighthouse keeper is a risk-laden trajectory executed without gimmickry. Specificity of concrete-and-soil winter surrender grounds the concept in lived experience. Slight proximity to “last petal” trope is transformed by the mechanical repurposing that follows.</comment>
