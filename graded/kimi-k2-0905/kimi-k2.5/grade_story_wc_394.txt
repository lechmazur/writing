<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Kip’s steadily-curious interiority is concrete, specific, and drives every micro-adjustment; the arrow-tip snap-off as tuning-fork/clapper is a perfect crystallization of trait-as-tool. No contradictory impulses are staged in scene, so the 9+ gate fails, but the single-POV endurance is vivid and the final laugh carries earned stasis cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the bell rings in unheard dimensions and Kip’s isolation becomes the very proof of success. The causal chain (algorithm → kaleidoscope → transliteration → snapped arrow → resonance) is tight; cost is the shattering of the decoder and the eternal unheard status. Lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern intensifies until meaning flips.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The workshop-acid-sea micro-setting is never ornamental: the swaying cart limits Kip’s reach, the acid clouds mirror the prismatic equations, and the snapped arrow tip embeds itself as clapper. Orientation is anchored by line 3; spatial choreography remains exact. 9+ gate missed because no environmental element alters a late tactical choice, but the central gear charged by arrow is final-image driver.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—ring the unheard bell—tightens through each transliteration beat; the escalating algorithm outputs force finer gear-etching and risk of workshop “indigestion.” Cost is legible: kaleidoscope shatters, arrow point sacrificed, bell audible only as unpopulated silence. Agency is present but the deepening is more textural than reversive; still meets 8+ threshold.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: curiosity as existential engineering—loneliness is not bug but feature. The unheard bell reframes solitude from failure to triumph; irreverent awe keeps sentimentality at bay. Final image (cart swaying over green waves) reweights prior isolation into sovereign completeness. No moralizing, pure resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is lush yet gear-precise: “rusted chains,” “brass and bile,” “reverent absurdity.” Rhythm modulates from languid glide to shuddering clang; compression under climax is clean. Kaleidoscope-as-decoder taught immediately; no head-hopping. Punctuation choices (em-dashes, fragmented final line) serve cadence, not glitch.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Zero loop or scaffold; sentences multi-task (“the acid sea…had been calcifying throughout the evolution of the continent”). Metaphors stay mechanical-coherent; no register drift. Information-dense yet breathe-worthy; final line is propulsive hinge. Only hairline slip: “vibrating just beyond the threshold of mechanical perception” skirts abstract, but is saved by immediate embodied transliteration.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise fusion—cart glider + yearning algorithm + acid-sea gearshop—is non-obvious and fully committed. The unheard bell as closure flips standard success metrics; risk heightens coherence. No genre templates scavenged; specificity makes element removal fatal. Fresh inflection: arrow tip becomes tuning-fork clapper—inevitable only in hindsight.</comment>
