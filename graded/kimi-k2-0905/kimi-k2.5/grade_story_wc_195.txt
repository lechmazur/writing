<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Valen’s interiority is richly embodied—his silence calcified into “something beyond mere silence” shows, not tells. The micro-choice to unsnap each clasp, releasing “years of self-imposed separation,” makes the renunciation legible and costly. Yet the mercury visions of unlived lives stay observational; they never force a live fork in his tactics, so the contradiction never activates under pressure. Still, the final surrender is earned by the prior pattern-work, giving a solid 7.2.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the still-point dissolution into “everything” carries undeniable conceptual cost—his isolated selfhood is foreclosed. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each unsnapping intensifies density until the greenhouse unfolds, reweighting the stake without causal reversals. The Orientation Test is waived—early disorientation (“endless night,” “glass panes dripping measurable starlight”) pays off in the final liquid-light door. One minor loop—“mercury fruit vibrating between liquid and solid states without thermal transition” repeats the prior mercury image—keeps it from 8.8.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The greenhouse is no backdrop; its breathing trees and glass leaves chime at dream-frequency, constraining Valen’s pace and finally supplying the liquid-light door that charges the closure image. Selective sensory hierarchy—boots crunching crystallized shadow, vapor smelling of ozone and childhood—keeps economy tight. Spatial choreography holds as he kneels, moves, unsnaps; no floating rooms. Environment actively reconfigures around his pattern-dance, meeting the 9+ gate requirement.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“to freeze the wave function of hope”—is signaled early and deepened by each unsnapping that forecloses his isolated path. The mercury spheres showing unlived lives tighten the emotional cost, even though they don’t alter tactical options. Under Accumulative lens, the final still-point is a meaningful cadence shift that reweights the stake with visible surrender. No reversal is required; the single intensification suffices for 8.1.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the concrete image of shedding armor into liquid-light: possibility can only be “captured” by dissolving the captor. Subtext lives in gesture—the unsnapping sequence is a silent ballet of renunciation. No moral is stated; the final image reweights the premise without sermon. One abstract phrase—“the shape of possibility itself”—slips toward thesis, holding it below 9.0.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is dense, alchemic, yet controlled: “quantifiable magic that hummed at frequencies” stays within Valen’s scholastic lexicon. Rhythm escalates from long liquid sentences to the clipped “I give you my silence,” mirroring surrender. No head-hopping; perceptual signature remains locked to Valen’s withdrawn sensorium. One register wobble—“shivering bliss cascade”—edges toward purple, but the cadence serves the dissolution beat, keeping 8.9.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sentences perform double duty: “mercury rising from the branches to form hovering spheres that reflected… his unlived lives” advances both image and stakes. No paraphrase loops; each metaphor extends the alchemical logic. Filter verbs are absent; actions stay in the body. A single mixed vehicle—“liquid light that showed every threshold”—is minor, never obscures causality, and lands inside closure, so −0.2 only.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fusing quantum mysticism with puppet-theatre alchemy yields a singular vision; the forgotten ballet score as navigational map feels inevitable yet fresh. Risky second-person address to the reader is avoided; the conceit commits fully without gimmickry. The premise could not swap names or places without collapse—its specificity is the point. Minor echo of Eliot’s “still point” is transformed through Valen’s surrender, earning the 9.0.</comment>
