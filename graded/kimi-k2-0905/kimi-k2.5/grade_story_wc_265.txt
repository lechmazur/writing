<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Kael’s interiority is evocative—bronze tooth pressed to temple, “discordant frequency” behind the eyes—but his choices remain observational. The gear-offer is the only micro-choice that alters tactics; everything else is drift, witness, epiphany. No contradictory impulse is dramatized in scene; the stranger does the active “unraveling,” Kael the reactive recognition. Cost is present but conceptual (“silence spread”) rather than embodied; Earned Stasis feels asserted, not lived.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: inserting the gear re-starts the heart-gear and re-weights the sixth-sense from storm to compass. Causality under an Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each shard adds density until the final image crystallizes. Orientation is waived because disorientation is taught early and pays off in the acoustic-map epiphany. One minor scaffold: “probable miracle” is repeated without incremental charge, dulling the final cadence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Mechanical Rainforest is rendered through sensory hierarchy—aluminum-palm whisper vs. hollow-iron-oak bass—each acoustic note tied to navigation stakes. The small gear and fiber-optic moss function as micro-settings that constrain the final insertion beat. Spatial choreography is clean across three shards; no geography drift. Environment actively shapes tactics (sound-as-compass), satisfying the 9+ constraint requirement.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—loss of cognitive wilderness vs. external desilencing—is signaled early. Escalation is textural: each shard intensifies network damage until the gear-insertion reverses the silence. Agency is mostly perceptive; the single active tactic (gear offer) arrives late but does foreclose the stranger’s pruning. Cost is conceptual (re-tuned perception) rather than tangible; pressure tightens once, sufficient for 600-word scope but shy of 8-band price visibility.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as “miracles are patterns not yet perceived”—a resonant reconfiguration delivered in the final image without moralizing. Recurrent acoustic motif (wind-through-trees) moves from disorientation to compass, re-weighting prior material. Stranger’s “pruning dead philosophy” risks thematic echo but remains subtextual because Kael’s counter-insight is dramatized through the gear act. Ambiguity lingers: is restored harmony progress or mere reset, inviting reflection.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays tight to Kael’s perceptual filter—gear-tooth bite, mercury rivers, fiber-optic moss—creating a distinct syntactic signature. No head-hopping; shard transitions are marked by sleep/translocation, legible under accumulative lens. Diction skews elevated (“photosynthetic whispers”) yet consistent with philosopher-persona; no register drift under pressure. Rhythm modulates: long breathless clauses for drift, staccato for acoustic map, controlled.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but purposeful; metaphor chains (copper leaves, gearbox vines) accumulate rather than stall. One paraphrase loop—“hum of insight vibrated wrong… ache behind the eyes” followed by “discordant frequency that made his expanded perception ache”—repeats without new pressure, −0.2. No mixed metaphors; clockwork/botanical vehicles stay coherent. Closing sentence breathes, resolving cadence cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Synthesizes biomechanic rainforest + Cartesian disorientation into fresh mythos; not a trope checklist. Acoustic navigation as cognitive compass is a non-obvious inflection that feels inevitable after the first shard. Risk taken in mosaic drift pays off via textural intensification rather than causal chain. Could edge higher if protagonist’s own philosophy were more than a label.</comment>
