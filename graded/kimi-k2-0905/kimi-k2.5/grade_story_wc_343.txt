<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s diligent curiosity and isolation are vividly embodied—she talks to the hull, sketches starlings, kneels in soot. Interior contradiction is light (no competing want v. need), and the final “smile” costs nothing visible; the arc is realization, not sacrifice. Still, her perceptual filter is consistent, and the micro-choice to kneel/decipher grounds the shift. Enough for a solid mid-7.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the airship’s bones re-set, Elara whispers thanks, the map is now inside her—conceptual cost (solitude confirmed, path fixed). Causal chain holds: dog-ear → hopscotch cipher → murmuration validation → route locked. Orientation is clear by word 60; no lens drift. A hair’s-breadth shy of 9 because the cost is felt but not painful.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Brass rail, sooty hopscotch, spiral starlings—every detail filters through Elara’s cartographer eye and constrains the next move. The airship itself migrates from “tired giant” to “bridge to revelation,” reweighting the final image. Selective, tactile, no exposition dumps; micro-setting (phrasebook, chalk grid) functions as navigation tool. Meets 9+ gate: the hopscotch grid literally steers closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Single stake—find the hidden route—tightens when murmurations mirror the board, forcing the final transcription. No antagonist, but loneliness and atmospheric opacity supply pressure; one meaningful deepening suffices. Cost is opportunity/solitude locked in, legible but soft. Clean accumulative escalation under Textural lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme: isolation as the price of seeing what others cannot. Emerges via starlings, dust, and the final whispered thanks—no statement, only image. The reweighting of child’s chalk into celestial chart supplies resonant non-literal answer. Ambiguity lingers: will the Archives redeem or deepen her exile?</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lush, rhythmic third-person hovers just above Elara’s sensorium; brass “groans,” starlings “whisper,” diction stays within a mapmaker’s lexicon. No dialogue, so no voice convergence risk. Filter verbs (“she realized”) are rare and motivated. Patterned elision (purple hours, ghost footprints) is taught early and paid off at dawn. Distinct perceptual signature holds under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies, imagery dense yet purposeful; only minor scaffold (“she began to note… she worked through…”) drags momentum. No mixed metaphors, no loops in peak beats. Register elevated but consistent with antiquarian airship tone. One paraphrase loop (−0.2) keeps it under 8.0.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Fusion of starling murmuration, children’s hopscotch, and lost celestial archive feels fresh and inevitable. Maritime-Basque astronomical dialect, “stranded luminance” as navigable river of light—specific, not quirky ornament. Risky lyric accumulation paid off in closure. Minor echo of “dusty secret board” trope, but transformed through living bird cipher.</comment>
