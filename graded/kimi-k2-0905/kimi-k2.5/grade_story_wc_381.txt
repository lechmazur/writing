<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>Interiority is lyrically sustained but remains at one emotional pitch; no contradictory impulse challenges her serene resolve, so the arc is static. The final “racing heart” is the first embodied contradiction, arriving too late to complicate her earlier poise. Motivation is clear yet monolithic; the absence of micro-choice undercuts earned cost.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the silence she maps becomes a palpable weight tucked into her sleeve, reconfiguring future threat into contained stillness with conceptual cost. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of hush increases until it crystallizes; causality is implied via lyrical accretion rather than because/therefore linkage, coherent under this lens. Orientation is anchored by line 3; no ambiguity at end.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>The brook, origami wing, and negative spaces of silence function as micro-setting that constrain her method and charge the final image. Sensory triage—liquid mercury light, velvet-shadow texture—reflects her narrowing perception under pressure. Crane wing’s material memory of “ancient stars” links soil to cosmos, grounding the terrestrially cosmic bridge in a tactile prop. Spatial choreography holds; wing’s rotation provides orienting pivot.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—prevent prophecy’s enactment—is signaled early and deepens as coded whispers grow tactile. One meaningful tightening: release of the wing redirects her quiet cartography from passive mapping to active vacuum, foreclosing retreat. Cost is conceptual—the silence now bears gravity she must perpetually carry—visible in the heavier sleeve at close. Escalation is textural accretion rather than causal reversal, sufficient under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges obliquely: the ethics of silencing destiny versus allowing chaotic possibility. Subtext resides in the paradox of stillness as violent suppression—static that crushes living words. Final image of seed-like hush germinating if needed reweights earlier “smoothed hush” from benevolent shield to latent weapon, inviting unease without moralizing. Avoids tidy verdict; ambiguity lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric voice sustains rhythmic control and perceptual signature—sound as geometry, silence as gravity—without register drift. Syntax elongates then contracts to mirror inhalation/exhalation of hush. No dialogue, hence no voice contamination. Compression (“terrestrially cosmic”) is taught by context and repaid in closure image, legible under patterned elision allowance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Density is high yet purposeful; metaphorical layering supports Accumulative mode. Occasional adjacency loops (“between heartbeats… between water droplets”) repeat syntactic slot without new pressure, minor drag. No mixed metaphors or clarity breaks at climax. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with scene tempo; paragraph cuts are taut.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Fusion of origami cosmology with negative-space cartography feels fresh, not checklist. Premise risks abstraction but grounds via tactile wing and mud-between-toes. Turn from mapping silence to embodying it offers non-obvious synthesis. Could stray closer to archetype if wing were mere talisman; instead its paper memory of stars particularizes the device.</comment>
