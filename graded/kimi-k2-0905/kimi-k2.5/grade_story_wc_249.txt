<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Kael’s grief-riven obsession is viscerally embodied through the drumming; the quietly rebellious trait motivates every beat. Interiority stays concrete, but the final “stay” plea drifts toward performed emotion rather than contradictory impulse. The earned cost is legible—he forecloses sleep, safety, and perhaps sanity—yet the phantom Elena remains externally observed, limiting interior contradiction at the climax.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the golden figure dissolves, reweighting the stake—resurrection is impossible yet contact is real. Causal chain holds: drumming locates harmonic → climbs tower → summons apparition → failed permanence. Ventilation exhale as ticking clock is taught early and breaks the spell cleanly. Cost is visible in stinging palms and slumped surrender.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Sound-garden and auric lagoon are sensuously specific, their acoustic/bioluminescent mechanics revealed through percussive play. The tower ledge and viscous water constrain bodily risk and possibility; the lagoon’s star-fed glow recharges the final image. Spatial choreography is clean—hand to pod to rail to water—anchoring the ascent. Micro-setting (reed, railing) doubles as tactile instruments, tightening agency.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—conjure Elena—signals in paragraph two and tightens when the harmonic aligns. One meaningful escalation: the lagoon rises into human shape, foreclosing retreat. Agency is percussive; failure costs physical pain and existential confirmation that she can’t stay. Ventilation restart externalizes the irreversible cutoff, avoiding soft reset.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of grief-as-instrument emerges through percussive metaphors rather than thesis. The lagoon-as-memory-residue reweights the lovers’ shared past into palpable medium. Final image—auroral sorrow blanket—offers resonant non-verbal answer: beauty that freezes. No moralizing; ambiguity remains whether the contact justifies the obsession.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Kael’s synesthetic perception; diction skews lyrical yet sensory—“hollow resonance,” “auric lagoon.” Rhythm accelerates with short percussive clauses during ascension, then exhales into longer mournful cadences. No head-hopping; knowledge bounded by his tingling palms and quantum haze. Filter verbs (“he felt”) are minimal and voice-motivated.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is thickly figurative but pattern-taught early: drumming = navigation, so extended auroral metaphors read as POV synesthesia rather than overwrite. No scaffold loops; each sentence advances sound, light, or body state. One mixed risk—“golden water lifted into the form of a woman”—hovers on cliché edge yet saved by subsequent “eyes made of starlight and sorrow” that recharges stakes. Minor alliteration drift in spots, not touching closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Memory-entangled grief externalized as playable garden feels fresh; drumming as resurrection tech merges music, quantum SF, and elegy. Specificity—ceramic reeds, sonic willows—grounds the concept beyond trope collage. Risk in lyric密度 pays off by crystallizing final Charged Poise. Could verge on sentimentality but undercuts with irreversible dissipation.</comment>
