<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s double life (gossip columnist / spirit-banisher) is compelling and well-signaled. Her shift from metaphor-armored columnist to raw apology is dramatized in the final kneel; contradictory impulses (reputation vs. remorse) coexist in the moment she breaks the circuit. Cost is visible—her column left unwritten, perfume bottle spent—but the interior contradiction could be embodied earlier; the first outright micro-choice under pressure is the apology line itself. Still, her unique occupation, specific flaw (half-true exposé), and final renunciation satisfy the earned-stasis bar.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: an Earned-Stasis apology whose cost is the shattered bottle and the chainsaw roar that ends both orchard and haunting. Causal lens holds—every theremin tweak escalates because she needs the spirit solid enough to forgive—and the 660-word window fits Track A single-scene default. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) appear by line 3; no penalty applied. One minor slack: the “imperfect miracle” rule isn’t foreshadowed as something that can fail, so the reader can’t pre-feel the risk, but the final image still reconfigures meaning.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sheet-music archive as converted cathedral is more than postcard: the steel shelving becomes the lightning-organ that enables the séance, and the orchard outside supplies the acoustic anchor whose dawn loss pays the cost. Sensory selection stays POV-true—Elara notices dust motes, silver fish of light, rosin-scented tone—never tourist-catalog. Micro-setting (perfume bottle on steel shelf) constrains the exact placement of the theremin terminals and charges the final shatter. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly; no impossible positions or white-room gaps.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—deliver apology before orchard demolition—signals in line 5 and tightens with each chainsaw cough at the end. One meaningful deepening: she moves from banishing to reconnecting, foreclosing her old columnist shield; cost is the spent bottle and the column she abandons. Agency stays causal under the theremin dial; coincidence never rescues. The escalation would feel sharper if the “imperfect miracle” risk were tested on-page (e.g., a flicker that almost collapses the form), but the final reconfiguration still carries felt price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme—redemption via imperfect reparation—emerges through the shattered bottle and the unwritten column, not sermon. Subtext lives in gesture: spirit’s finger to lips correcting her “trees” metaphor to “seeds” reweights the entire accusation cycle without exposition. No epigraphic thesis; the aria-in-glass motif returns charged. The final chainsaw growl offers Conceptual Repricing: progress cuts down both guilt and grace. Complexity is honored; no tidy absolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice owns “ethereal grit”: copper-wire metaphors and ink/ectoplasm hybrids feel unique to a gossip-column exorcist. Syntax modulates—long breathless cadence under theremin swell, then stark “I am sorry” drop—without losing control. Perceptual signature is consistent: she sees frequencies, smells rosin in sound. No head-hop; POV stays welded to Elara. Dialogue is minimal but ghost-static translated through ventilation maintains idiom. Patterned diction is taught early (“teach a bell to sing a different toll”) and paid off in the seed image.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Sentences do double duty: “dust motes swam like silver fish through shafts of dying sunlight” grounds both atmosphere and POV eye. No paraphrase loops; each new image advances pressure or object state. Mixed-metaphor watch: “chains of light” and “organs of lightning” stay within the musical/electrical frame, so permitted. One scaffold trace—“the imperfect miracle began to unfold” is tell-y—could prune, but it occurs pre-peak and doesn’t dull the final shatter. Rhythm breathes with the circuit surge, then cuts cold on bottle burst.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fusion of gossip columnist + theremin exorcist feels singular; trope inversion (apology exorcism) is non-obvious yet inevitable given guilt-and-aria logistics. Specificity throughout—perfume bottle as spectral gramophone, orchard as acoustic anchor—prevents generic urban-fantasy drift. Risk in lyric compression pays off: static-as-cello, rosin-scented tone. No close echoes of famous scenes. Transformation test fails if names/places swapped, proving organic genesis.</comment>
