<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interior voice is lush but abstract; “texture of connection” is repeated without ever being felt in her body. The final surrender is declared, not dramatized—no visible cost or hierarchy of values is tested. Micro-choices are absent; she simply keeps stitching until she dissolves.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the gallery unfolds into the city and Elara becomes its tissue—cost is conceptual but legible. Causality is accumulative/textural; each stitch deepens pattern rather than forcing because/therefore turns. The piece teaches its disorientation early and the payoff image holds. One paraphrase loop late (“the unsettling calm persisted…”) slightly dulls the final beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Optical illusions and whale-sinew are rendered with fever-precision; every surface doubles as perceptual trap. The gallery’s impossible geometry stays coherent in four-dimensional shorthand, guiding Elara’s surrender. Micro-setting (her own fascia) charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Stakes—“discover the texture of connection”—remain cerebral; no external or internal obstacle pushes back against the weaving. The only tightening is density of pattern, not a narrowing of options. Cost is paid passively by dissolution; agency is largely ornamental.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of perception-as-architecture emerges organically from the lyric accumulation; no moral is stated. The whale-sinew motif reweights from craft material to bodily fusion, giving a resonant final twist. Ambiguity lingers without confusion: connection tastes of “copper and salt,” an image that reconfigures prior abstractions.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays locked to Elara’s fevered perceptual filter; diction is ornate yet internally consistent. Rhythm swells and contracts with the act of stitching, sustaining propulsion. No head-hopping or register drift; the voice is unmistakable.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Sentences vary in length and texture; most lines do double duty (image + motion). Occasional stacked metaphors (“calcified into something harder than bone”) flirt with overwriting but never obscure causality. One paraphrase loop late keeps it from the 9-band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The fever-dream-architect premise is freshly synthesized: perceptual designer becomes her own medium. Rational enchantment and realistically imaginary space are braided into a single hallucinatory fabric rather than checked off. Risky dissolution ending feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
