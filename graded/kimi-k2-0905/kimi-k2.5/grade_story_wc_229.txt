<comment>Elias’s interiority is vivid—“screaming tenderness of withheld breath,” “sweating in his narrow bunk”—and his contradictory impulses (obedience vs. insurgent gentleness) act simultaneously. The vial cork choice crystallizes his hierarchy of values; the cost is the risk of Voss’s wrath and the irreversible shift from assistant to keeper of quiet. Micro-choices (climbing the spiral stairs, weeping against the glass) embody the arc. No stock labels; every emotional label is earned through sensorial embodiment.</comment>

<comment>Dominant lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of scent, light, and hush accumulates until the beam’s cadence shift reweights stakes. Closure is Charged Poise: the jasmine-scented sweep reconfigures meaning with undeniable conceptual cost—whisper replaces shout forever. Cost is legible in Elias’s “violence of his own quiet.” Orientation anchors (who/where/when) hit by line 3; no debt. One continuous scene; tightening lands at the lamp-room beat.</comment>

<comment>Cobalt walls, salt-cataract lens, post-storm Atlantic grey—details are filtered through Elias’s keeper gaze and constrain tactics (heat-warmed metal stairs slow ascent, condensation on glass signals thermal break). Jasmine cork micro-setting acts as pivot-object; its scent alters air density in the lamp room. Spatial choreography clean: pocket → spiral stairs → brass receiver → forehead on glass. Environment mirrors internal shift from fever to cool release. No filler; every sensory pick is purposeful.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—“prove whispers travel farther than shouts”—is signaled in paragraph 2 and tightens when Elias risks inserting the cork. Escalation is textural: each rotation of the lens deepens the quiet insurgency; the Maria Celeste’s course-correction is the visible price paid. No reversal, but a meaningful cadence shift from mechanical grind to lullaby resonance. Protagonist agency drives the final image; luck complicates nothing.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the concrete: scent as non-violent signal vs. horn as violent noise. Subtext lives in silence—Voss asleep, Elias weeping, beam asking not ordering. Final image reweights premise: tenderness as the louder force. No moralizing; the jasmine’s survival in dust is the only “commentary,” shown not told. Ambiguity lingers—will Voss wake to a world that no longer needs his shouts?</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person close lingers inside Elias’s sinews: “his fingers trembling not from cold but from the screaming tenderness…” Syntax lengthens in calmer beats, fragments under lamp heat (“Cobalt melting into gold”). No head-hopping; Voss stays opaque, dreamt silhouette. Diction stays within keeper lexicon—Fresnel, mercury, oil shed—without jargon dump. Rhythm mirrors lens rotation: long sentence, breath, short pulse. Filter verbs used only when scent is vaporized—motivated.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies: compound cadence for heat slog, staccato for cork insertion. No loops; each sentence adds new sensorial or causal layer. Metaphor vehicles stay coherent—thermal haze as fever dream, beam as lullaby through clenched teeth. Information density high: one sentence can depict heat, Voss’s delusion, and maritime death. Copy-clean except one possible typo (“master quarters” vs. “master’s”). Final line earns its lyric lift.</comment>

<comment>Fresh synthesis: lighthouse sci-fi powered by botanical perfumery. Jasmine cork as memory-vessel of intent feels inevitable yet unforeseen. Risk of gentleness-over-force is fully committed to; no retreat to ironic wink. Specificity of “root of the night-blooming jasmine” anchors the fantastical in horticultural truth. Conceptual repricing—tenderness as louder than storm—reframes the entire rescue genre.</comment>
