<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Maya’s inventive drive is vivid, but her interiority drifts into thematic exposition (“innovation required killing...comfortable expectations”) rather than embodied contradiction. No second character appears, so status/relationship bullets are N/A; her micro-choice to plant the seed is present yet cost feels prospective, not yet paid. The promised “genuine struggle” is deferred to future players; we witness planning, not crucible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the bud’s putrid potential reframes her entire design philosophy with visible stakes (“only escape came through surrendering to the storm”). Causal chain is thin—seed arrival unexplained, no resistance after planting—yet the accumulative pattern of mirrored bloom/innovation holds. Orientation is swift; single transition (night → three weeks later) is legible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Glass greenhouse above a whispering brook, storm-light reflections, hydroponic sensors—the textures are selective and POV-filtered. The corpse-flower stench-as-timer is a tactile constraint that will later dictate player communication, satisfying the 9+ gate. Occasional atmospheric padding (“bruised clouds gathered”) slightly dilutes economy.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—safeguard creative space—is announced early; escalation is textural (each sketch “merged botany with cryptography”) rather than a narrowing option. No reversal or trade-off is dramatized on-page; cost remains prospective. Pressure is thematic, not immediate; meets mosaic/accumulative standard but lacks a tightening beat that forecloses a path now.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme—transcendence through embracing grotesque beauty—emerges via corpse-flower logic rather than assertion. Final image reweights prior sketches (“surrendering to the storm”) without moralizing. Ambiguity is productive: innovation smells like death yet promises revelation. One near-echo (“possibility just born” repeated) softens thematic tautness.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Lush, cadenced third-person adheres to Maya’s perceptual tilt—precise mechanistic diction (“magnetic lock,” “hydroponic sensors”) braided with lyrical storm imagery. No dialogue, so those bullets N/A. Filter verbs are minimal; syntactic variety mirrors her oscillation between engineer and mystic. Occasional elevated phrases (“conceptual framework”) slightly protrude from her lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Strong read-aloud rhythm, high information density; many sentences dual-purpose. Metaphors stay coherent (“roots seek water through stone”). Minor scaffold: “storm-born silence” thrice, “orthogonal approaches” twice—patterned but not loop-paraphrased. One mixed moment: “ozone sang in the air” edges toward purple yet fits POV.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Synthesizing escape-room design with botanic cryptography via Amorphophallus-titanica countdown is fresh; not a trope mash-up I’ve seen. Conceptual risk—planning montage instead of live player scene—pays off in conceptual repricing. Could swap names/places with minor edits, so not fully singular, but the core metaphor is irreplicable.</comment>
