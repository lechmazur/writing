<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s paradoxical inheritance and recursive caretaking are vividly interior, but no concrete micro-choice under observable pressure changes her tactics; the final carving is still prospective, so the arc feels stalled at the cusp of decision rather than paid.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The piece lands a legitimate Resonant Reconfiguration: the orchard reveals itself as process, not place, and the shell’s blankness is re-weighted as the knowledge she already embodies—cost is felt in the eternal loop she accepts; causality holds under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Crystallized-moonlight bathroom, quantum petals, and time-fruit supply tactile, POV-filtered anchors; the translucent walls focus her reflection and constrain privacy, directly feeding the breakthrough beats—micro-setting carries the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Single dominant stake—preserve/understand the orchard—tightens once when the tree’s silver leaf reframes the orchard as self-perpetuating process; cost is legible (eternal bewilderment), but no secondary option is foreclosed, keeping escalation slender.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of recursive self-creation emerges through the shell, mirror, and orchard without sermon; the blank cameo’s final charge reconfigures knowledge as interior absence—an elegant CR that invites re-reading.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lyric, elliptical prose sustains a consistent cosmic-fairy-tale register; patterned repetition (“simply complicated,” “between the first and last page”) is taught early and pays off in closure, keeping voice distinct and controlled under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and clause, propel without scaffold; occasional adjective stacks (“brightened disquiet settled over her like dawn through stained glass”) are earned by voice and never clog causality or the final image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Nonlinear horticultural curator who inherits her own future orchard via pistachio talisman feels novel; the risk of circular narrative is fully committed to and paid off in a reconfiguring closure that could not be transplanted to another frame.</comment>
