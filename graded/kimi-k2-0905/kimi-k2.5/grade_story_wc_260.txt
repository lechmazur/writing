<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—gentle healer who enabled harm—stays embodied in the chameleon’s damaged tail and her own “raw” self-exposure. Micro-choices (removing gloves, pendant) externalize the hierarchy of values with visible cost. The shift from willful blindness to testifying is causally prepared; only the -0.3 for a faint therapy-speak echo (“she too was becoming something honest”) keeps it under 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as earned stasis: she will testify and keep working—path foreclosed with persistent social/legal risk. Accumulative lens holds: each shed layer (gloves, apron, pendant) tightens the pattern until the chameleon’s calm green verifies the reconfiguration. Orientation is anchored within 120 w; no causal or spatial breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The misty workshop functions as micro-setting: humidity condenses on terrarium glass, supplies the “shimmering stillness” tone, and constrains her methodical cleaning beat. Stars-overhead reprise in final paragraph recharges the image, crystallizing the new transparency. Only the faintest generic jasmine note prevents a 9.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—rebuild integrity without self-pardon—tightens once: each object shed and document verified narrows the option to hide again. Cost is visible (scarred tail, social exposure). Under accumulative lens the deepening pattern suffices; no external reversals needed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the chameleon’s irreversible tail: compassion without scrutiny is predation. Final image reweights “gentle” to include ruthless honesty, avoiding moralizing. Only a whisper of thematic echo in “true compassion required the backbone of self-respect” keeps it sub-9.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays close to Elara’s visceral register: humidity on glass, pendant’s weight, chameleon heart against palm. Syntax lengthens in reflection then shortens during action; no head-hopping. Distinct perceptual signature sustained under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density—each sentence advances image or decision; zero loops or scaffold. Metaphors (“shedding felt like stripping off her own skin”) are sparse, purposeful, and paid off. One mixed humid/stars overlap in final paragraph barely grazes closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Trafficking-as-backdrop is familiar, yet the chameleon’s non-regenerative tail becomes a fresh, inevitable emblem of permanent moral scarring. The “reconstruct by shedding” arc feels specific to this voice rather than template. Risk is moderate; synthesis strong but not breathtaking.</comment>
