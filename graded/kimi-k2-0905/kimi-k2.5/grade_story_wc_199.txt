<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is rich, embodied, and consistent with his lifelong vocation; the moment he reorders the miniature monuments into a mandala is a crystallized micro-choice that externalizes his shift from archivist to seed. The final laughter—“moss growing on stone”—is character-specific, earned, and shows transformation with visible cost: he becomes the new seed. No secondary character appears, so relationship/status bullets are N/A. The only drag is a trace of diagnostic self-explanation (“he understood…”) just before the prod; a tighter beat would push this into the 8.5+ band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive conceptual repricing: the arbor’s ash is recast as chrysalis and Elias becomes the seed himself, scattering ordered past into wild future. Causality is lyric-accumulative (lens inferred): moon-dust → prod → reversed leaves → Elias transfigured; each step intensifies texture rather than narrows options, but the final image reweights everything with undeniable cost. Orientation is clear by line 7; no penalties apply. One minor causality soft spot: the lore’s “Transfiguration” is named rather than dramatized before the prod, but the payoff is strong enough to keep the unit intact.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The arbor functions as both macro-setting and micro-tool: its bark crevice receives the moon-dust and its reversed gravity literally scatters spores upward, constraining the final transformation. Selective sensory detail (velvet trays, creaking branches, sideways-falling leaves) is filtered through Elias’s taxonomic gaze. Spatial choreography is clean; no floating rooms. Environment charges the closure image directly—no description is ornamental. Meets 9+ gate: setting-as-tool alters tactics and final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—translate the leaf message before the hush ends—is signaled early and escalates through texture: each spiral speeds up, reconfiguring into pictographs that foreclose the option to keep cataloguing. The cost is the loss of Elias’s human form, paid on the page. No coincidences; pressure is situational-coherent. One tightening is sufficient for this length and lens. Could edge higher if an earlier external obstacle (e.g., limited moon-dust) had sharpened the trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: memory must be re-ordered into forward-pointing myth rather than mausoleum. The monument-to-mandala shift is a concrete, non-literal answer to that question. Subtext is carried by image (ascending leaf, glowing vascular system) rather than assertion. Final paragraph avoids moralizing; resonance is charged through action. A hairline slip into abstraction (“understanding at last…”) keeps it just below 9.0.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person intimate maintains steady psychic distance; perceptual signature is botanist-poetic (“alphabetical precision,” “thimble-sized shrines”). Syntax lengthens under wonder, shortens under prod; rhythm is controlled. No dialogue, so those bullets are N/A. Diction stays within Elias’s plausible lexicon. Patterned elision (“the hush where past meets prophecy”) is taught early and paid off. Meets 9+ quick test: distinct texture, no head-hop, taught compression honored at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentence openings diversify. High information density—each sentence moves character, image, or atmosphere. No paraphrase loops; occasional modifiers (“wet, ancient joy”) are earned. One mixed metaphor cluster (“ribs becoming galleries for wind”) is vivid enough to pass. No artifacts touch the closure. Clean grammar and tense. Minor lexical elevation at “conceptual repricing” moment but justified by ecstatic transfiguration.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses apocalyptic arboretum with seed-archivist becoming germ—fresh synthesis, not checklist. Miniature cairns repurposed as antenna for future spores is a specific, non-obvious turn. Risky lyric compression is taught early and holds. Transformation test fails if names/places swapped; detail is irreplaceable. No close echoes of famous scenes. Bold structural choice (accumulative lyric) heightens meaning without gimmickry. Minor trope echo of “ash as rebirth” is transcended by visceral embodiment.</comment>
