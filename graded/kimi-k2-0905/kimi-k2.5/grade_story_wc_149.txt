<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Eira’s contradictory drives—vengeance and release—play out in embodied beats (the bead’s transfer, the command to plant). Julian’s instant comprehension and acceptance, though emotionally resonant, skips dramatized resistance, muting micro-choice hierarchy and costing full credibility.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the bead’s burial reconfigures both land and ghost with undeniable conceptual cost. Causal chain holds—betrayal → orchard → bead → Julian’s act → dissolution of curse—under a lyrical Accumulative lens. One minor orientation waiver: “three centuries” is stated before we’re anchored in present time, but the final image retroactively justifies the temporal sweep.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Mercury-fed fruits, phosphorescent glass, and winter-cracked fields are filtered through Eira’s bereaved gaze; every sensory note drives mood and stakes. The greenhouse’s iron ribs and mercury soil literally nourish the curse, so the setting constrains the final act of burial outside, earning its keep.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—lifelong karmic debt—tightens once: bead pressed into palm forces Julian’s complicity. No secondary reversal, but the single deepening is meaningful and visible (orchard withers, ghost dissolves). Cost is legible on-page; could edge higher with sharper pre-burial resistance from Julian.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of love-turned-curse emerges through soil, fruit, and returned heartbeat rather than statement. Final image of “second heart learning to beat” offers non-literal resonance without moralizing. The slight overtness of “debt across lifetimes” keeps it from the 9-band.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays tight to Eira’s spectral perception: “lovingly venomous,” “alchemical quicksilver” mirror her dual nature. Rhythm swells and ebbs with pressure; no head-hop. Occasional elevated phoenix-like diction (“resonant awakenings”) skirts register drift but remains ghost-appropriate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies, density high; imagery rarely repeats without purpose. Mixed-metaphor risk in “honey wrapped around broken glass” resolves through consistent caustic sweetness motif. Minor loop: “ephemeral cameo appearances” is stated twice in similar cadence; not fatal but keeps it sub-9.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Ghost-negotiates-repayment via alchemical orchard feels fresh; heartbeat-stone as unborn-child proxy reverses typical vengeance trope. Risky lyric compression is taught early and paid off. Core arc could transplant to new setting, but sensory specifics (mercury soil, frost-split earth) root it sufficiently.</comment>
