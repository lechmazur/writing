<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elena’s loss-driven persistence is embodied in every micro-choice (tuning the metronome to failing compasses, threading the reel). The film-Maya device externalizes memory so grief becomes navigable, giving concrete stakes to each keystroke. The final tempered “peace” is earned because the entire arpeggio sequence literalizes her refusal to surrender Maya’s coordinates. Only minor slip: “strategically creative” is named once rather than shown through contradiction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the station locks into the sky-eye, the clock ticks three lost years, cost is undeniable. Causal chain holds—each piano note → magnetic pulse → micro-correction; film frame 144 → Morse → coordinate—every beat advances drift correction. Orientation is taught lyrically yet anchors (who, where, stakes) by sentence two; no disorientation debt. One hairline slip: the restart trigger of the clock is inferred rather than shown in-scene.</comment>

<comment>The tidal arbor, cloud-ocean, and brass compasses create an aerial “room” whose physics directly constrain choice: cable groans ⇒ Elena retunes tempo; wind-shear ⇒ she plays harder. Piano coils, projector shutter, and Morse-beam lighthouses act as micro-setting objects that alter tactics. Sensory filter is POV-loyal—Elena notices haptic keys, metal strain, monochrome flicker—never tourist catalog. Environment mirrors interior without overt symbolism: purple-bruising horizon = approaching irrevocability.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—anchor the station or be swallowed by storm—signals in paragraph one and tightens with each compass flutter. Mid-story reversal: frame 144 converts passive decoding into active navigation, foreclosing surrender. Cost is visceral—she spends her last silver light, admits “final performance,” stakes survival on unpracticed chords. Under causal lens, pressure escalates note-by-note; no coincidence rescues her.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of persistence-as-love emerges through action: repurposing grief into cartography, turning film negative space into refuge. No explicit thesis; final “peace” is understated payout for defiant continuation. Subtext layers—clock restart = timeline forgiveness, piano encore = refusal of last-page metaphysics. Minor echo risk: “refuge” concept edges close to abstract label but is saved by on-page coordinate lock.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person lingers inside Elena’s perceptual bias—mechanical sound-to-magnetic thinking, monochrome film flicker idiom—without head-hop. Syntax lengthens during calibration beats, fractures in chord bursts, mirroring effort. No filter-verb clutter; free indirect slips in cleanly (“She had told herself…”). Distinct航空-engineer-poet diction sustains across 800 words.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentence fronts avoid drumbeat. Figurative layering is dense yet purposeful—each metaphor services navigation (cloud-mist, tidal arbor, aerial deep) and never contradicts physics. Zero paraphrase loops; only micro-repetition (“flickering compasses”) is motif-driven. Information density high—single sentences fuse sensorium, backstory, and causal push.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Sky-station-piano-as-sextant is fresh synthesis; footage-hidden-in-film-negative feels inevitable once revealed. Risk of over-engineered world is offset by emotional specificity—Maya’s foresight, Elena’s sleepless copper coils. Not a stitched prompt response; voice, tech, and grief cohere as singular stance. No close famous echoes.</comment>
