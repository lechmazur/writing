<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Marlow’s dry editorial precision, skepticism, and quiet reverence braid believably; the dog-eared page pressed to ice is a micro-choice that embodies both tool-use and spiritual concession, earning his thin smile. No contradictory impulse is dramatized in scene, so the 9+ bar is missed, but the characterization is otherwise clean and specific.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: satellite confirmation reweights every map and the lake’s “worrying tranquility” becomes possibility—cost is the unrecoverable solitude Marlow accepts. Causal chain (condensation pattern → coordinates → transmission) holds; orientation anchor (who/where/when) is present by line 4. No slips touch the ending.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Corrugated outpost, frost-rimed horizon, and condensation halo are filtered through Marlow’s cartographer gaze; the rust flakes and fractal mist constrain his method and charge the final image. Environment materially shapes tactics—he reads the glass like braille—satisfying the 9+ gate. Minor repetition of “rust” and “frost” keeps it just below exceptional.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—complete the survey before the thaw—is signaled early and tightens once: empty talons → final walk to vent. The single meaningful turn (condensation spiral confirms coordinates) forecloses failure and carries the visible cost of irreversibly publishing the correction. Agency is legible under causal lens; no escalation dip.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: precision versus mystery, cartography versus oral memory. The reconfiguration is conceptual—myth becomes data, yet the phrasebook page against ice recharges “the water remembers its birth” without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers in the falcon’s cry, inviting reflection beyond plot. No thematic echo penalty.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: editorial diction (“cartographic inaccuracies,” “hydrological truth”) woven with taciturn poetry; syntax lengthens under reverence, shortens under cold. No head-hopping; psychic distance stable. Free-indirect compression (“Yes, yes”) is voice-true and paid off. Rhythm control heightens pressure without obscuring clarity—meets 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High information density—lines twin sensory detail with method revelation (“condensation bloom…mirrored…tributary systems”). No loops, mixed metaphor, or scaffold. Read-aloud rhythm modulates from staccato steps to final sustained image. Occasional adjective richness (“worrying tranquility,” “crystalline”) stays purposeful and pattern-taught; no clarity loss at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fusion of cartographic precision with submerged mythic convergence feels non-obvious; reading condensation as braille re-enchants routine science. Risky lyric escalation pays off in a reweighted final image that could not swap into another tale unchanged. Specificity of “dog-ear as arrow” and satellite uplink in ruined outpost gives fresh inflection. Synthesis is inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
