<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s solitary devotion to measurement under extinction-pressure is credibly lived-in; her micro-choices (sampling, calibrating, ledger-closing) flow from the stated “gently meticulous” trait. The final stoic endurance is earned by seventeen years of shown habit. Interiority stays concrete, never slides into therapy-speak. Missing higher band because no contradictory impulse is dramatized in-scene—she never hesitates or considers stopping, so tension is purely external clock, not self-conflict.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: blank slide mirrored in ledger numbers reweights her ministry from salvation to witness with undeniable conceptual cost. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: escalating density of vanishing frequencies → final cadence shift. Orientation taught by “frost-rimed balustrade” @~40 words, anchors hold. Minor ripple: “the Fading was accelerating” is declarative tell just before climax; could have been shown through a last frequency that collapses mid-sentence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Athenaeum ice-spires, brass resonator, and photonic lattice are specific, tactile, and filtered through cataloguing gaze. Cold constrains tool use (frozen gears) and body (breath crystallizing), charging final image. Micro-setting (glass slide) functions as continent-to-map; its blanking is spatial loss. One hairline slip: “quartz hush” is lovely but re-used three times without re-instrumentation, slightly dulling edge.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“will anyone remember the vows?”—tightens as frequencies flatline one by one under her fingers. Agency is attention/registration itself, renouncing rescue for precision; each decimal she records forecloses the possibility of later repair. Cost is felt: slide warms then clears, leaving only distorted reflection. Escalation is observational not causal, fitting Accumulative lens; yet single vector feels thin—no surprise frequency, no equipment failure to force adapted tactics.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: measurement as love for the unmourned. Subtext carried by act—she keeps writing while illusions die, refusing meta-commentary. Final blank-slide / full-ledger image re-prices data as elegy without moralizing. Slight over-articulation of “meaning was not conjured from preservation alone” is the closest to thematic statement but is earned by preceding 700 words of concrete action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited sustains precise, cataloguing diction (“obsidian table,” “photonic resonance”) mirroring archivist mind. Syntax lengthens and compresses with sampling urgency; no head-hop. Filter verbs (“she realized”) are minimal and motivated. Distinct rhythmic signature in consonant clusters (“glacial silence,” “quartz hush”) that peaks in final blank-slide beat. Dialogue absent by design—appropriate for solitary vocation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Strong information density: single sentences deliver setting, tool, and emotional temperature. Metaphors stay internally consistent (continent-mapping, dying stars). One scaffold pair: “preserved only by the thermal inversion that kept the spires entombed in ice” could trim to “preserved by thermal inversion entombing spires in ice.” Final third clean; no figurative clutter at closure. Occasional adjectival elegance (“gently meticulous precision”) tolerated because it is motif-linked.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Frozen cloud-borne archive sifting light-vows through resonator feels fresh yet inevitable. Concept commits fully—no retreat to conventional rescue arc. Specificity of 432 Hz marriage bond, UV child-promise roots abstraction in lived texture. Risk of static solitary observer paid off by final witness-turn. Minor echo of “last librarian” trope, but elevation into optical physics and quantitative elegy transcends cliché.</comment>
