<question>1</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—architect of endless recursion yet desperate to calcify form—shows in her tender, tactile reading of calcified grief, but the text never lets her decision to keep harvesting burdens cost her anything; her stance is static, the micro-choice to finish the count is only a ritual reset, so the arc plateaus rather than crystallizes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Closure is a quiet Charged Poise: she extinguishes the lamp, holding the rosary of weights while dawn erases starlight, a reconfiguration that makes her eternal servitude legible. The cost is atmospheric, not personal; because the story never risks her losing the role or fracturing under it, the beat feels aesthetic rather than decisive.</comment>

<comment>Bronze grotto, lamp flame, and star-shaft are re-used as tactile instruments: the metal floor’s ancient scratches guide orientation, the lamp’s blue flame anchors her against whalebone reverie, the star-shaft supplies the warp geometry. Each object constrains the calcification ritual; the final dark after she snuffs the lamp reweights the grotto from womb to archive.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—harvest sorrow before chaos—never tightens; no new obstacle or fractal escape attempt surfaces, so pressure is flat. The text deepens texture instead of narrowing options; the only “turn” is dawn arriving to end the session, an external cue, not earned causality.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges via image pattern: recursion versus calcification, infinity forced into lead beads. The closing rosary image reweights earlier fractal language with bodily heft, offering non-literal commentary on the human need to weigh the unweighable. No moral is stated; resonance is oblique yet cohesive.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric-technical, fractal vocabulary fused with whalebone melancholy; perceptual signature filters every noun through loom-geometry and metalloid chill. Rhythm modulates from glacial gear-grind to hush-shingle overlap, mirroring her trance. Compression is taught early (“boundary-lessly trapped”) and stays legible; no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Sentences layer like the shingled hush—nested participial phrases that mirror recursive theme—yet remain precise; no mixed metaphors or filler loops. Clause variety breathes with loom strokes, propelling ritual momentum. Only minor scaffold: repeated “she” openers in paragraph 4, but pattern serves liturgical cadence, not artifact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: fractal cosmology meets Appalachian folktale cadence, sorrow collected like maple sap. Concept of calcified grief-beads is non-obvious yet inevitable once loom and star-math are set. Risk lies in lyric stasis, but grotto specificity keeps it from abstract nowhere.</comment>
