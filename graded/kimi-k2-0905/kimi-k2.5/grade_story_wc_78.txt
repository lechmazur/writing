<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The prophet’s obsession is palpable, her body and tool fused into a single instrument; the 17-year backstory is concisely anchored to present action. No competing on-page characters, so status/relationship crucibles don’t apply. Interiority is sensory and concrete (“salt-stained fist,” “music of the waves made sleep impossible”). The final renunciation—storm acknowledged as collaborator—carries visible cost in the fading sky-glow, satisfying earned stasis.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each strike layers density until the sky itself becomes a scored surface. Closure is a Charged Poise—storm dubbed, orchard singing, prophet poised for next blue hour—cost legible in the dissipating resonance. Orientation (who/where/when) is anchored within 60 words; no causality breaks. Persistent constraint: the floating orchard’s survival depends on her continuous music, a price shaping every tactic.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The driftwood orchard is simultaneously environment, tool, and resonant body; its concentric pitch-map constrains every strike. Micro-setting (xylophone mallet) is handled repeatedly and charges the final dub. Sensory hierarchy obeys POV: prophet catalogs pitch by ear, feels salt, sees “bruised cumulus.” Spatial choreography is exact—“outermost ring,” “central cedar stump”—no floating-room syndrome.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: transform lethal storm into chorus or lose the orchard. Escalation is iterative: each fractal strike tightens the sonic net until storm and music lock phase. Cost is visible—rain turns drum-skin, lightning becomes staccato accent—foreclosing retreat. Agency is continuous: she climbs, strikes, names; no convenient off-stage resolution.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as alchemy of terror into beauty; no explicit thesis. Sketched resonance shifts from threat-diagnostic to collaborative score, reweighting prior cloud-reading. Final image—“unresolved chord of a world forever becoming music”—offers conceptual repricing without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers: next storm may still sink her, yet she rows toward it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric-technical, coining precise neologisms—“fractal generating waves,” “restless euphony”—that teach their own pattern. Syntax mirrors percussive ritual: paratactic bursts, clause-echoes, no filter-verb clutter. Lexicon stays sailor-poet plausible. Rhythm accelerates with strike-count, then exhales at closure. No head-hop; single POV holds.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and cadence, propelling the ritual crescendo. Figurative language is dense but patterned—each metaphor extends acoustic physics (sound as visible geometry) rather than decorative trope. Zero paraphrase loops or synonym churn. Opening and closing lines are ear-worm memorable. Minor elevated diction (“indigo into the starving sea”) reads intentional to hymn-like register.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>Premise—floating orchard-as-marimba played to dub storms into instruments—is non-obvious yet inevitable under maritime physics and music theory. Tropes (lone oracle, storm-confront) are re-wired through acoustic alchemy. Risk in dense lyric pays off: closure legible, stakes heightened. Transformation test fails: swap orchard for any setting and the entire acoustic logic collapses.</comment>
