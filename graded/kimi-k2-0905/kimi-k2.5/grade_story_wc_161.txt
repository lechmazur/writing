<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory need for isolation and preservation of song drives every beat; the micro-choice to strap the chip to Orion dramatizes the earned shift from hoarding to release. Interiority stays concrete (“her fingers tracing invisible patterns,” “trembling fingers”), avoiding label-speak. The cost—her invented identity dissolving—pays off the backstory in the final line.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the bird’s ascent reweights identity, trust, and the stakes of survival under an Accumulative lens. Causality holds: dust-mote mapping → flight knowledge → Orion sent. Cost is legible in the final image (“waiting,” “true name ready on her lips”). One transition (attic → shop below) is coherent; orientation anchored by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The attic acts as micro-setting: pigeon nests in card catalogs and mildew on first editions constrain her choices (burn or fly). The Mars chip’s warmth and song both charge the climax. Spatial choreography is clean across the beam-edge stance and cage release. Light/dust reprise at closure reconfigures meaning.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve lost songs vs. survive detectives—tightens when she decides flight, not sale, foreclosing escape by money. Escalation is a single deepening: detectives’ arrival intensifies pressure; her agency narrows to one irrevocable act. Cost is visible: identity forfeiture, attic left behind. Under Accumulative lens, dust spiral at end reweights stakes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</question>
<comment>Theme emerges through pattern: decay (mildew, crumbling books) paired with flight and song; hoarding vs. release crystallizes without moralizing. Final image of facing the shopkeeper with her true name offers resonant, non-literal answer. Subtext in Orion’s head-cock and her trembling fingers conveys trust shift. No thesis statement; resonance earned via objects.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person intimate voice maintains consistent perceptual signature: dust motes as navigation tool, foxing-paper perfume, pigeon sounds. Syntax modulates with pressure—short clauses at release (“She whispered coordinates”). No head-hopping; POV stays tight to Elara. Dialogue absent; no penalty.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet breathable: “rust-red surface pulsing with impossible warmth” does triple sensory, symbolic, plot work. Rhythm varies from long reflective sentences to fragment beats at climax. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Opening and closing lines are image-anchored and propulsive. Zero artifact clutter.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Fusion of Mars meteorite music, pigeon courier, and bibliophilic decay creates fresh synthesis; not a trope checklist. The dust-mote navigation method is novel and internally taught. Emotional truth of trust-after-trauma feels lived, not template. Risk in quiet release rather than confrontation pays off.</comment>
