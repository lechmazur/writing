<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Mara’s “logically emotional” duality is dramatized in every beat: she calculates beam angles while feeling the key’s second heartbeat, rigs a sonic defense that fuses math and memory, then collapses with palpable cost. The final song is earned—her ten-year detachment and grief compress into one exact note that dissolves hunters and leaves her trembling, foreclosing any return to pure detachment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal chain holds without slack: accidental broadcast → hunters track harmonic signature → cannot outrun → must sing calibrated forgiveness → shadows liquefy into sunset. Closure lands as Decisive Change with felt toll—her shaking body and glowing key lock in the price—under a stable Causal lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Drift-ice planks, shifting plates, and lighthouse iron are lived-in tools: the key’s warming teeth steer her climb, the fresnel lens becomes resonant chamber, the marina’s acoustic properties make the final chord possible. Setting constrains every tactical move rather than decorating backdrop.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Single dominant stake—keep the boundary intact—tightens when silence at the tower base replaces earlier distant flickers; the sonic absolution chord is an irreversible trade that spends her composure and re-tunes the key forever. One meaningful deepening suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of engineered empathy emerges wordlessly: absolution is a solvable frequency, yet its solution demands she mortgage personal grief. Final golden mist reweights the premise—protection is not shielding but participatory mourning—without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is precise, maritime, lightly lyrical: “breath crystallizing,” “fresnel lens catching the last dying light” mirror Mara's calibrated perception. Syntax lengthens under stress then fractures into fragments as she sings, teaching the reader the pattern that pays off in liquified air.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, propulsive, no scaffold; figuratives are sparse and accurate (“azure coat flapping like a banner”). High information density—each sentence advances goal or atmosphere—without purple overload or mixed metaphors that could dull the harmonic climax.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Fusion of lighthouse optics with necromantic acoustics feels novel yet inevitable; “sonic absolution” could have read gimmick but grows from Mara's professional toolkit and emotional ledger. Risky concept committed to without hedging.</comment>
