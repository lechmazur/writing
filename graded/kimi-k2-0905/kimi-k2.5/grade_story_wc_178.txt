<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elior’s mingled parsimony and buried wonder are embodied in every beat (oil-drop counting, candle-hoarding, refusal of poetry). The final palm-to-quicksilver choice crystallizes his arc: he spends the faith he never knew he’d saved, visible cost in blood-mercury mix. Interiority stays concrete—“his voice cracking from disuse,” “heart had refused to believe.” Minor slip: the phrase “empirically ironic” is used twice as label, not dramatized friction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal chain is clean: accidental inventory → geometric discovery → schematic mapping → vocal activation → covenant seal. Orientation lands by line 5; palace/ziggurat anchors hold. Closure is a Decisive Change: the palace shudders, stars realign, Elior smiles—irreversible, paid with blood and lifetime frugality. One hairline lapse: “precession of the equinoxes” stated as prior measurement but never shown; luckily it’s not the activating data-point.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Obsidian tile drinking candlelight, cedar-rain wind through colonnades, throne-room sundial shadow—each tactile detail constrains placement of instruments and final activation spot. Micro-setting (globe remnants, bronze compasses) used as navigation tools, not décor. Spatial choreography is immaculate: tile at center, candles at triangle, observer circling. Environment actively participates in the climax—palace shudders, gardens drip, tile sweats silver.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake: preserve empirical self vs. risk everything on cosmic covenant. Pressure tightens once: geometric match forces either dismissal (safe) or vocal activation (irreversible). The tightening is causal—because the ratios align, therefore he must speak. Cost is legible: blood merges with quicksilver, palace accepts tribute, sky reconfigures—options foreclosed, faith spent.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges: measured austerity as unconscious faith. Subtext in gestures—counting oil drops while hoarding wonder—carries the argument. Final image reweights all prior frugality as devotional savings. No moral stated; resonance is in silver-blood pool reflecting next era’s constellation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited clings to Elior’s tactile, numbers-obsessed perception: “proportion of diagonal to side,” “seventeen years mapping.” Syntax lengthens under awe, then fractures—“each integer a step”—mirroring breathless ascent. No head-hopping; diction stays astronomer-precise yet lyric. Quasi-archaic cadence (“exhaled constellations”) is consistent, taught early, and paid off in star-realignment closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>High-density sentences carry triple duty: “tile…drank the candlelight and exhaled constellations” fuses sensory, metaphoric, plot function. Rhythm modulates from measured scholarly observation to incantatory list of integers. Zero paraphrase loops; each image advances. One clause risks purple—“geometries older than crowns”—but earned by prior concrete mappings, so clarity survives.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Fusion of Mesopotamian star-worship with spreadsheets-era austerity feels non-obvious and inevitable. Magic-square-as-precession-key transforms familiar Lo Shu into calendrical cipher. Frugality reframed as devotional storage is fresh emotional mathematics. Risky lyric register sustained without collapsing into pastiche.</comment>
