<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—professional fault-tolerance versus personal complicity—is dramatized in the moment she tapes the mutant edelweiss front-and-center; the trembling hand, smudged ink, and luminous sorrow embody cost without therapy-speak. Fever-aftermath weakness and residual perceptual smear keep her competence credibly limited. The swallowed-truth motivation drives every beat; no stock labels intrude. Micro-choice hierarchy is visible: hide anomaly → confront anomaly, with professional identity visibly forfeited.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: taping the impossible flower in the core log reweights the entire prediction paradigm and her complicity; cost is the foreclosed option of continued peripheral self-exoneration. Accumulative lens holds from first isobaric hallucination to final anemometer swing; each textual shard layers density until the pattern break crystallizes. Orientation is nailed in first 120 words (who, mountain station, predawn after fever). No causal break; the smudge is irreversible and charges all prior readings.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Frost-rimed desk, contracting struts, and auroral light function as micro-setting that constrain bodily movement and emotional temperature; the translucent edelweiss becomes the charged “room” she must inhabit. Triple-glazed window, anemometer shadow, and uplink hum track spatially without drift. Cold’s effect on steel and skin is repeatedly tethered to choice—she avoids the center because the floor “pitches.” Final image of spinning anemometer reuses the introduced tool to signify unreadable futures.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—integrity of data vs self-protection—is signaled in paragraph one and tightens when the wrong edelweiss migrates from margin to center. One decisive intensification: smudging the stem makes concealment impossible, narrows her options to complicity or exposure, and forces the public correction. Cost is the loss of her fault-tolerant alibi; price is legible in the ghost-blurred stem and taped admission. Pressure stays accumulative/textural—no causal antagonist needed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of complicity-through-averaging emerges from concrete acts: rounding decimals, swallowing anomalies, taping the aberrant flower where it cannot be statistically smoothed. Subtext resides in the shifting valence of “fault-tolerant,” culminating in self-indictment. No moralizing line intrudes; final auroral sorrow is image, not thesis. Edelweiss reweights from quaint curiosity to indictment without symbolic speech-making.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is scientist-poet: barometric precision (“isobars had danced”) fused with auroral watercolor lyricism, consistent under fever-smear. Syntax lengthens in caloric regret, shortens when she acts (“She took the smudged illustration and taped it”). No head-hopping; third-person hovers at intimate distance. Register never drifts into academic filler; diction stays within a climatologist’s ken yet allows “auroral sorrow.”</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary from 5-word pulses to 40-word fever-washes; no template cadence. Density high—“hollowed and luminous in the auroral sorrow” performs character, tone, time in one breath. Only one soft paraphrase loop (“swallowed the readings whole… swallowed these truths”) but repetition is thematic glue, not scaffold. Mixed metaphors (“finger pointing toward the margins,” “vessel at sea”) read as fever residue, justified by POV.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Fusing climate-science fault-tolerance with botanical anomaly stakes a fresh angle; the mutant edelweiss as indictment avoids disaster-genre cliché. Accumulative lyric structure mirrors data drift, a risk that heightens rather than obscures meaning. Transformation test fails if swapped for generic flower, proving specificity. Risk taken in lyric ellipsis pays off in closure image.</comment>
