<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias’s defiance is vivid—his collar adjustment, seed-click walk, heel-crush sacrifice—but interior contradiction is asserted (“never paid a thought tax”) rather than dramatized in-scene. The renunciation lands with cost (capture, untaxed mind), yet the leap from charming smuggler to martyr feels lightly motivated; we see the stance, not the wrenching choice that locks it.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: garden codes → greenhouse convergence → warp → capture, each step tightening surveillance risk. Closure is a crisp Earned Stasis: Elias’s unbroken mind vs. physical loss, cost legible in the heel-crush and luna-moth coordinate. One orienting hiccup—city tax premise is clear by ~130 words, just past guardrail, but delay serves the reveal, so no penalty.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Greenhouse glass, beetle flight, and seed-warp distortion are tactile and constrain tactics—camera bend, escape timing. Sensory hierarchy mirrors POV: gardener notices soil scent, scholar clocks refractive index. Final moth-wing coordinate fuses setting and stakes, charging the exit image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—cognitive freedom vs. surveillance tax—tightens when drone impact forces simultaneous escape/evidence destruction. Agency is active: Elias triggers warp, chooses to stay, crushes seed; price is immediate capture. One meaningful turn suffices; cost is visible, though emotional toll could cut deeper.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through encoded botany and sacrificed gourd: thought itself becomes contraband; resistance is cultivation, not declaration. Subtext pulses in greenhouse small-talk—“beetles restless” carries insurgent clock. Final moth image reweights prior garden code without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person hovers close to Elias, filtering perception through rogue-scholar diction—“casual flair,” “cryptic candor”—without head-hop. Rhythm accelerates in warp paragraph, mirroring chaotic refraction. Dialogue indirection sustains micro-setting stakes; no register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Strong read-aloud cadence; sentences vary, no template runs. High density—“dried seeds whispering like contained secrets” does image + tone + foreshadowing in one stroke. Minor purple shimmer in “cathedral of glass” phrase, but it aligns with POV awe and never obscures causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Taxed memories + vegetal steganography feels fresh, not bolted on; premise commits fully. Risk of horticultural encryption pays off: beanstalk literally spells liberty. Specificity—gourd rattle resonance bending glass—prevents generic dystopia repaint.</comment>
