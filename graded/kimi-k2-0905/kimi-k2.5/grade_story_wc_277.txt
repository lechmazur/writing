<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Eleanor’s interiority is vivid and character-specific—her “solemn playfulness” and habit of testing truth with a pen nib show contradictory impulses in-scene. The final renunciation (publishing the correction) is earned by the prior causal chain of discovery and carries visible economic/social cost. Micro-choices under pressure are present, but the absence of any second on-page character keeps relationship/status dynamics off the table, capping depth. Still, the arc from loyal heir to self-orphaning truth-teller is credibly fueled by her observant nature and ancestral guilt.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The causal lens holds: fake comet orbit → contradiction discovered → correction drafted → inheritance willfully sacrificed. Anchors (who/where/when) are clear by line 30; no orientation debt. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the wax-sealed correction letter reweights the Vane empire’s entire rule-set with undeniable social cost. The only micro-slips are a slight over-reliance on abstract summary in the paragraph that lists “increasingly elaborate denials,” but this does not touch the decisive final beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The echoing observatory above clouds is not postcard scenery: its acoustic properties amplify pen scratches, turning sound into accusation, and its glass floor becomes a dawn lantern that mirrors Eleanor’s exposure. The rosewood nib and squid-ink anchor tactile world-rules. Spatial choreography is clean—she descends one spiral staircase and exits one elevator. Environment charges the final image: the glowing floor literalizes the transparency she chooses.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—inheritance vs. integrity—is signaled early and tightens exactly once: the impossible 1894 photograph collapses her filial loyalty option. Cost is legible: she seals the confession with “blood-colored” wax and laughs at economic suicide. No external antagonist is needed; the pressure is coherent under the causal lens. A second tightening (e.g., legal threat) would overstuff this length, so the single turn suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</question><comment>Theme emerges without说教: “orbits of regret” accumulate across generations until one heir steps into free-fall. The comet-as-lie becomes a metaphor for moral payload, reweighted when the nib is reclassified from forgery tool to truth artifact. The final image—sunlit glass floor as lantern—offers a non-literal answer: exposure itself is the new light. No tidy moral is stated; ambiguity about the empire’s collapse is invited and lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person POV stays tight inside Eleanor’s perceptual filter: only she can know the “solemn playfulness” of her autopsy-metaphor. Syntax modulates with pressure—short staccato clauses during calculation, longer lyrical cadences at dawn. Diction (“newsprint empire,” “atmospheric deception”) remains within her educated lexicon. No head-hopping or filter-verb bloat; psychic distance is intentionally controlled.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet breathe-able: “She dipped the rosewood nib into ink harvested from squid that lived only in the depths below the cloud layer” does world, character, and sensory work in one breath. Metaphors are coherent—sound as accusation, glass as lantern—and never mixed. Zero loops, no scaffold, no thesaurus-itis. The final sentence’s “uncharted before her” is a cliché minimalism that nicks perfection, but it does not touch the closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Falsified 19th-c. comet to secure trade-wind rights is a fresh angle on Gilded-Age skullduggery; proof-by-contradiction as familial autopsy is a novel story engine. Risky choice to make the climax a quiet sealing of a letter rather than a courtroom showdown pays off by staying character-scale. Specificity of squid-ink, rosewood nib, and glass observatory prevents generic slide into “journalist exposes scandal” template. The synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight—no other outcome possible once the orbit math fails.</comment>
