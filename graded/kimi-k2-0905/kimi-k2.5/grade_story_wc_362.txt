<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is rich and character-specific—“mathematical precision of light and ice” versus “truthful lies”—and the prism-burn in her palm embodies cost. The shift from scholar to mourner is legible, but the beat is single-register; we never feel her doubt rearing once the frost starts lifting, so the contradiction pulse required for 9+ is missing.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The accumulative lens is declared early and held: each sensory layer (quartz, frost, prism, mist) tightens the texture until the final sublimation reweights the stake. Closure is a clean Charged Poise—car window now “lighter,” her chest filled with weighted silence—cost is felt without exposition. No causal leaps; every image is set up and paid off inside the 760-word window.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Quartz arbor, frost dendrites, and prism ghosts are not backdrop but instruments that constrain how she can “commune.” The car’s frost pattern literally maps grief and must be read correctly for the theory to validate; remove the mineral trees or the ice-ferns and the experiment collapses. Texture escalates rather than decorates.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prove objects absorb emotion—is signaled in paragraph two and tested through the prism-frost interface. Escalation is textural: each refracted spectral ghost thickens the pattern until the skip-phase sublimation forces a conceptual reprice. The cost (prism burns, widow’s sorrow released) is legible, but the beat is only one deepening; no secondary tightening keeps it from 9-band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges entirely through image progression: frost = stored grief, sublimation = release, quartz hum = universe acknowledging. The final line’s “honest magic” is earned because the story has physically enacted the absorption thesis rather than asserting it. No moralizing, only resonant reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is crystalline yet urgent—“breath held too long,” “spectral ghosts against the ice-crystals”—with rhythmic compression that mirrors rising spectral intensity. Free-indirect slips seamlessly into lyric elevation without breaking lexical credibility for a field-mystic. Sustained perceptual signature throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; sentences open with concrete noun or motion, avoiding template cadence. Figurative density is high but patterned early (“quartz-born humming”) so it pays off rather than clots. One clause—“the shifted hush moved from the forest into her chest”—skirts abstraction yet lands because prepped by prior quartz resonance.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Emotion-storage via frost-fractal reading is a fresh angle on psychometry; execution keeps it from gimmick by tying validation to physical burn and scent release. Risk taken in lyric accumulative structure is coherent under the word limit. Not quite 9+ because the widow’s backstory is familiar, trimming the “inevitable-yet-surprising” apex.</comment>
