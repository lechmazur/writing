<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Mara’s serene competence is vivid; her micro-choices (rotating vial, trimming gondola) enact the “fluidly logical” trait. Passenger pressure is gentle but legible; the architect’s shoulders drop under catalyzed silence. Motivation remains steady—comfort through silence—without compounding cost beyond her professional pride; deeper interior contradiction would edge this into 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Single scene, Accumulative/Textural lens: atmospheric layering tightens until quiet crystallizes. Setup crystal-clear by 120 words; closure offers Charged Poise—silence now comfort, not threat—felt in passenger exhale. Cost is ethereal rather than concrete, slightly softening the decisive change.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Drifting prism terrace, storm-glass, and resonators are tactile, multi-sensory, and directly steer action; micro-setting (vial’s lattice) constrains Mara’s timing of catalytic light cue. Environmental specificity fuses with emotional stakes; no static postcard descriptions.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: turning silence from menace to balm for the grieving architect. Escalation is gradual negative-decibel descent, culminating in 12-minute acoustic vacuum; no reversal yet meaningful deepening that forces passenger surrender. Cost is internal/sonic; could feel sharper with tangible risk to gondola or reputation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme—silence as learnable comfort—emerges through crystalline imagery rather than statement. Final refraction of light onto blueprints wordlessly reweights architecture from rigid to mutable. Ambiguity lingers without sermon, though thematic punch could be costlier.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature distinct: “vaulting hush,” “drowning in velvet,” brass resonators “tongues/ bronze.” Syntax and vocabulary suit contemplative operator; lyric diction taught early, never head-hops. Interior rhythm matches barometric rise; no line drags.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Read-aloud cadence is purposeful; metaphors stay physical (prism, dendrites, velvet). High density—few filters, zero paraphrase loops. Occasional elevated phrase (“spectral ribbons”) allowed under lyrical licence; no clarity breaks at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Acoustic-alchemy gondola, negative decibel healing, and crystalline forecasting feel novel yet self-consistent, not gimmicky. Silence as malleable substance refreshes familiar grief-therapy arc. Concept commits fully; risk is quiet rather than explosive but lands coherently.</comment>
