<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elias’s profession as meticulous indexer is matter-of-factly shown and explains his focus on the stamp’s impressions; the final realization that “truth could be fragmented” converts his earlier quiet competence into a meaningful choice to remap the catalog. One micro-choice—pressing the stamp into his notebook—rides home the new conviction, so the arc earns its Charged Poise. Interiority drifts toward the abstract at times (“divergent timelines,” “parallel validities”), softening embodiment, but not enough to break credibility. Overall, a disciplined, if slightly cerebral, character turn.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The text turns on one cogent discovery: micro-scoring on the stamp implies three authentic, not forged, deeds. Because this evidence is handled on-page, the alternative hypothesis tightens into certainty without the need for off-stage rescue. Closure is delivered via CR (Conceptual Repricing): ownership can survive flooding only as a splintered truth, a shift that carries conceptual weight and is sealed by the final stamp impression. Only minor slack: the blackout is stated to end yet Elias never reacts to regained power—no re-penalization, but a missed beat to reinforce cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Sunken-library images (warped spines, algae-lit vaults, spilled math texts) are vivid, selective, and tied to POV priorities—Elias noticing ink-seal scoring shows the micro-setting-as-setting working. Spatial clarity holds through the spiral-climb beat and slap of water pressure. Green light reprises like a quiet motif but never hard-limits choice; accordingly, the 9-band gate stays open but unmet.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Pressure builds along Accumulative/Textural lines: successive details (power failure, silence, floor tilt, new ledgers) heighten the mystery’s density, not external danger, which is apt for an archivist’s plight. The micro-turn from forgery theory → fragmentary truth narrows future work and costs months of recataloguing; this on-page consequence satisfies the tightened cost test. The blackout timeframe tightens options, though time itself is not aggressively tracked, keeping the score below 8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges cleanly through action: authentic ownership becomes contingent, amphibious, surviving only if one accepts fractured certainty. No character sermonizes the lesson; the notebook stamp alone reweights meaning. The face-value morality is avoided by Elias’s calm acceptance of complexity, leaving thoughtful ambiguity after the page ends.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elias, with a perceptual signature attuned to textural minutiae (microscopic scoring, phosphorescent glow filtered through cracks). Syntax stays calm, slightly Latinate, mirroring his measured intellect and preventing overt writerly flourish. No dialogue appears, so voice tests default to narration, which passes cleanly.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with the scene—long sentences for underwater hush, shorter clauses for the tilted-floor surprise. Figurative diction is selective rather than saturated; no mixed metaphors intrude. Occasional elevated phrasing (“reclaimed stillness settled into his chest like silt”) risks a faint poetic gloss, but it fits the reflective beat and does not clog clarity at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The premise—archivist in a drowned metropolis reconciles clashing deeds—avoids outright cliché by reframing forgery as temporal fragmentation, a fresh inflection on disaster-archive stories. Specific occupation and stamp micro-impressions generate novelty that would collapse if swapped. Risk lies in quiet interior revelation rather than spectacle, but coherence under the lens validates the strategy.</comment>
