<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Elara’s methodically curious trait is dramatized through tactile micro-choices—tracing fibers, frame-by-frame film comparison, clearing turf with “reverent hesitation”—that steadily escalate stakes. Interiority stays concrete (“silence teach her its vocabulary”) and culminates in a credible renunciation: she leaves the map torn, paying the cost of preserving wonder. No contradictory impulses are shown in-scene, and the slight reserve keeps this just below the 9+ gate.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as an Earned Stasis: the deliberate refusal to repair the tear reweights the entire quest, costing her the satisfaction of “completion” while honoring the chapel’s silence. Causal chain holds—cut fiber → marginalia → film comparison → subsidence → reopening → renunciation—each beat narrowing options under a Causal lens. Cost is legible in the final image of the torn map that stays “deliberately so,” a persistent constraint memorialized on-page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Limestone drips, “decaying vellum” air, and the turf-grown lintel anchor each move; the chapel’s acoustic architecture directly shapes Elara’s decision to withhold documentation. Micro-settings (magnifier, film editor, subsidence depression) constrain tactics beat-to-beat. While grandeur is restrained, every sensory note is POV-filtered and purposeful, charging the final image of the intact silence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—interpret what the silence demands—tightens once: discovery shifts to responsibility when she realizes the chapel was buried “not to hide it, but to preserve its profound silence.” This conceptual deepening forecloses the option of full revelation, exacting the cost of permanent incompleteness. Agency drives every step; no reversal, but the single meaningful shift satisfies the short-form requirement under Causal escalation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without announcement: knowledge versus reverent unknowing, enacted when Elara chooses the torn map as sacrament. The marginal note, subsidence, and final silence form a sparse motif cluster that reweights at closure. No moralizing—meaning lingers in the charged image of “empty spaces.” Ambiguity feels purposeful rather than evasive.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person hovers at a sensory-close distance, stable throughout. Syntax lengthens under wonder (“water dripped… shielded openness”) then clips at decision (“She documented… without disturbing”). No dialogue, so voice carries all variance; perceptual signature—parchment fibers, film shadow math, acoustic breath—remains idiosyncratic and unwavering.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary from lyrical suspension to tight clauses, mirroring cautious descent. Figurative language is selective (“root systems that had grown complacent”) and never stacks into purple. Only minor scaffold: two adjacent “had” pluperfects in the fourth paragraph slow propulsion slightly. Closure image is clean, unburdened by verbal clutter.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The surveyor’s self-wounding map and silence-preserving burial feel fresh against tropes of hidden treasure. Frame-by-frame shadow analysis of silent film supplies a specific, era-grounded method absent from standard “lost relic” plots. Could swap centuries and still function, but the acoustic chapel and map-restorer vocation provide irreplaceable texture that lifts it above template.</comment>
