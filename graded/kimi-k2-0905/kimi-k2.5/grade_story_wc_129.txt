<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Kael’s solitary ache and the relief of “witness” land with embodied cost; the final dedication is earned. Yet the interior contradiction between “desperate to graft” and bold sympathy is told more than dramatized in mid-beats, and the mute girl’s insertion late dilutes Kael’s agency. Still, the reed-bridge renunciation forecloses loneliness with visible price.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the reed bridge crystallizes the shift from isolation to kinship under an Accumulative/Textural lens; the silver hand-touch makes cost legible. Orientation is swift (who/where by 50 words), causality holds across moon-phase tag hunts, and no beat resets without price. One micro-turn—finding the mute artist—deepens rather than breaks pattern.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The crystalline orchard, obsidian arbor, and copper air are filtered through Kael’s reed-sculptor senses; every detail is woven into action—seats, water vessels, final bridge. The arbor constrains the solstice ritual and fractures starlight onto faces, charging closure. Only the “toxic depths” remain vaguely mapped, a hairline slip.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—“graft oneself onto community”—tightens through each tag discovery; the final bridge is a visible forfeiture of self-sufficient solitude. Pressure escalates by pattern accumulation: each silver glyph adds another strand of spider-silk kinship until the web can span the crater. Cost is unmistakable when Kael offers the reeds they once hoarded for empty shelters.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: art as anti-lonely infrastructure, not legacy. The reed bridge reweights the opening image of “baskets no one collected” into a communal artery. No moralizing—just the mute girl’s hand placing her mark, silently repricing what counts as existence. The luminescent ache lingers because the reeds will still rot, but the web won’t.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person remains tightly anchored to Kael’s reed-sculptor perception: geometries of drowning, sap-sticky fingers, starlight fractured through glass. Syntax elongates for yearning, then snaps short at “the graft take root.” No head-hopping; even the mute girl’s gesture is registered through Kael’s skin. A few lyric abstractions (“pain of years spent alone”) flirt with therapy-speak but are saved by the final concrete image.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is textured yet propulsive: “fruit hung like frozen starlight” carries three jobs—visual, tonal, stakes. No loops or filter-verb stacks; each sentence advances shelter, water, bridge. One mixed metaphor (“webs…crystallized”) appears mid-story but is purified into the final bridge image, so closure remains pristine.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Familiarlonely-artist trope is inverted: the art piece is a bridge meant to decay while human web endures. The moon-phase graffiti map as heartbeat-territory feels fresh, and the toxic-crater mute girl’s silver hand blesses without melodrama. Risky accumulation structure pays off; no derivative echoes. Specificity of reed+sap tensile craft roots the magic in plausible labor.</comment>
