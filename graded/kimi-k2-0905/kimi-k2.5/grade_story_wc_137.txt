<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mara’s shift from detached cataloguer to vulnerable bridge-builder is credibly anchored in her tactile discovery of the tile; the bodily jolt (“burned cold, then warm”) gives the epiphany weight. Her earlier “kindness without ghosts” stance is shown through micro-choices—carrying equipment, calming kids—so the later surrender of skepticism carries visible cost (she forfeits the safety of empirical distance). Interior contradiction is present, but the emotional layering thins in the finale: the beat with the child risks tidy sentiment, preventing a higher band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The tile discovery at the parapet is a clean causal pivot that reweights every prior dismissal; the ensuing visions tighten options—she can no longer remain a passive recorder. Closure lands as Earned Stasis: she chooses to stay and rebuild, forfeiting her old identity, with the tile mounted overhead as a persistent constraint. The lens is causal throughout; no orientation debt; cost is legible in her trembling hands and the overnight labour that “consumed her”.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Salt wind, copper-green comet, and jade phosphorescence are selectively filtered through Mara’s astronomer eye, never tourist-catalogue. The tower itself—limestone bones, whale-song conduction—acts as both tool and constraint, directly shaping her renovation plans. Spatial choreography is clean; bodies and props track across the single night. Environment charges the final image: the apex-mounted tile becomes a literal antenna, environment dictating the closing ritual.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—her need to remain intellectually safe versus the tower’s demand for emotional surrender—tightens the moment the tile hums against her palm. One meaningful escalation: the visions force a decision—transcribe or retreat; she pays with an all-night sprint that leaves her “consumed.” The cost persists: the tile now permanently reframes the tower’s acoustics, foreclosing her former neutrality. Agency is hers; coincidence merely ornaments.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the inverse relationship between measurement and empathy: numbers once shielded her from whalesong. The tile’s geometry of compassion is never lectured; it is dramatized when she translates cold carvings into cushions for children. Final image—child’s wonder, Mara's welcoming smile—offers a Conceptual Repricing: knowledge now requires exposed vulnerability. Resists moralising; ambiguity lingers in the unanswered science of the square.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is sharp—“salt wind cut through the open dome,” “vibration she could feel in her teeth”—astronomer’s precision married to sensory openness. Syntax modulates: clipped clauses during discovery, longer rolling cadences when designing alcoves, mirroring her surrender to flow. No head-hopping; single POV holds. Filter verbs appear only when voice-motivated (“she understood”). Dialogue is minimal but natural, indirection carried in gesture and silence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Strong density—most sentences couple sensory data with emotional tilt. One scaffold loop: “she had worked…she believed…she remained” opens three adjacent sentences, creating template cadence, but it stops before the climax. Mixed metaphors avoided; comet “trailing” and stone “humming” coexist cleanly. Final third is artifact-free; no figurative muddle touches closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fusion of archaeo-acoustics with emotional astronomy feels fresh; magic-square-as-empathy-amplifier is not a trope readers have seen. The tower’s re-purposing from observatory to “living instrument” is a non-obvious synthesis that grows logically from setting. Risk—letting whalesong become literally audible—could have slid into twee, but the grounded procedural description of acoustic renovation keeps it earned. Specificity of Sumerian-34 grid keeps the device irreplaceable.</comment>
