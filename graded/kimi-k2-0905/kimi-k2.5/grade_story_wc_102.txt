<comment>Maya’s interior contradiction—documentarian vs. participant—drives every beat; the 1847 nurse memory is embodied through trembling lungs and the camera drop, not label. The final collapse carries visible cost (loss of observer distance) earned by the prior breath-sync ritual. Micro-choices (aperture tweak, crystal press) reveal value hierarchy without exposition. Only the “spiritually curious” tag drifts toward diagnostic shorthand, trimming the 9-band.</comment>

<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each sensory layer (wisteria, respiring stone, inverted sky) tightens the stake until the tear’s dispersal reweights the premise—grief becomes pollen. Closure is a Charged Poise: two figures fused in cloud-projection, cost paid by Maya’s dissolution of identity. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 5; no debt. Causality holds: because she breathes with the bridge, the crystal melts, therefore the love releases.</comment>

<comment>The viaduct itself functions as micro-setting: its respiratory masonry and capillary cracks physically enable the tear’s travel and final release. Twilight color progression (copper→indigo→internal blue bloom) tracks interior shift. Spatial choreography remains stable—camera, railing, gorge—while pollen-gold fills the void, charging the closing image. One hairline slip: “gorge she could not see” repeats twice; still, environment constrains the final miracle.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—liberate calcified love—signaled in paragraph 1. Escalation is textural: each breath adds sensory density until the bridge exhales, foreclosing the option to remain mere observer. Cost is legible: Maya forfeits her documentary stance and prior self. No reversal, but the single deepening suffices under Accumulative lens; coincidence merely reveals, never resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from inversion imagery: to archive love is to petrify it; release requires surrendering the recording lens. Final cloud-projection reprises earlier lens-flip, reweighting the value of witness vs. participant without moralizing. Subtext in “pollen from a finally opened flower” fuses eros and mourning into one biological gesture. No thematic echo or prompt language; resonance is purely imagistic.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays fused to Maya’s synesthetic perception: stone “inhales,” crystal “travels capillary cracks.” Prose rhythm accelerates with breath-count cadence (three in, seven out) then suspends at the sacred pause, mirroring physiological arc. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk zero. Filter verbs appear only when motivated by camera-vision metaphor; diction remains within her artisan lexicon. One 9-band bar: perceptual signature is unmistakable.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry triple duty—image, emotion, myth—without overcrowding: “wisteria that had drunk the tears” compresses time and botany. Zero paraphrase loops; each clause adds new sensory angle. Metaphor vehicles (pollen, capillary, bellows) stay coherent under physical logic. A single purple patch—“vault where affection never spent calcified into grief”—survives because it’s immediately tested by the tear’s dissolution.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Camera obscura as soul-retrieval device feels inevitable yet fresh; inverted projection becomes literal metaphysics. The “breathing bridge” organic machine hybridizes architecture and anatomy without precedent. Risk: lyric accumulation could have slid into perfume-ad pastoral, but grounded breath-count mechanics keep it tethered. Synthesis of 19th-century cholera memory with present-day tech pilgrim yields a singular cultural splice.</comment>
