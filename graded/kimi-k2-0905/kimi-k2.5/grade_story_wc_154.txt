<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Mara’s interiority is vivid and character-specific—her “surgical precision” on human pain, the coral-to-cast bridging gesture, the micro-choice to leave the fragment as sentinel. The contradiction between her shrewd innocence and covert decryption is embodied, not declared. The final renunciation—carrying the “smudged lexicon” in her own marrow—pays the cost of translation with earned stasis. Only the sister/elder/soldier handwriting recognition is asserted without on-page differentiation, a hairline slip.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: Mara’s placement of the coral under moonlight crystallizes her promise that “notes are seeds,” reconfiguring the child’s body from archive to garden. Causality holds—every beat flows from her decrypting impulse to the final grafted ritual. The 120-word orientation gate is met (translator, Solomon Islands field-hospital atrium, twilight after anesthesia). Cost is legible in her self-indictment that the lexicon now lives “in her own marrow,” foreclosing innocence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The mist-clad atrium functions as micro-setting: vapor presses glass like an outside reader, guiding Mara’s decision to externalize the coral. The charcoal-blurred cast is handled tactilely in three beats—trace, decode, seed—finally reconfigured as moon-lit sentinel. Spatial choreography is clean; the sleeping child, windowsill, and coral remain tracked. Environment constrains silence and visibility, forcing the encrypted confession onto plaster instead of paper.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: convert isolated trauma into shared ritual before the child wakes. Tightening occurs when Mara realizes the smudges are not decoration but a collective map—this forecloses the option to dismiss them and raises the cost of translation. Her final act narrows future options: she now carries the lexicon internally. Pressure is coherent under Accumulative lens; each decoded line increases density until the coral is relinquished.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the particulars of coral grafting and plaster grafting: life insists on building upon ruin. No explicit thesis; the lotus image is reweighted from child’s shaking hand to Mara’s lantern of ache, offering resonant non-literal answer. Subtextual tension between innocence and complicity is held, not resolved. Final image refuses tidy moral, leaving reader with charged ambiguity of red water still opening lotus.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Mara’s perceptual signature—synesthetic slide from “copper light” to “neural pathways,” the synecdoche of “mouths” for war. Rhythm modulates: longer cadences for reflection, clipped fragments under decryption pressure (“The boats came again at dawn.”). No head-hopping; psychic distance contracts as she leans closer to the cast. Voice sustains lyrical compression without sacrificing clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty: “She turned it over, considering how coral grafts onto dead reef skeletons” simultaneously advances metaphor and stakes. Zero paraphrase loops; each image recurs with shifted charge (coral: found → warmed → sentinel). Metaphor vehicles stay coherent—no mixed physics. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image that recharges lotus motif. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with twilight descent.</comment>

<comment>The encrypted cast as communal testimony feels non-obvious and inevitable once revealed. Brain-coral-to-neural analogy is freshly synthesized, not imported. Risk-taking in lyric accumulative structure heightens meaning without gimmickry. Specificity of Solomon Islands field hospital, Pijin notes, and copra shed anchors universals in lived detail.</comment>
