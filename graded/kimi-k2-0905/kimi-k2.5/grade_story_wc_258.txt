<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Mara’s interior contradiction—clinging to measurement while preaching forward motion—plays out in embodied micro-choices (snap of the tape, brush dip). The renunciation of “back” is earned, but Elias remains a hollow echo rather than a crucible, so relationship pressure is thin.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the final image of “one patient centimeter at a time” reweights the premise with undeniable methodological cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern density (ink map, skylight rhythm) tightens until the last line—though orientation is complete by word 60, satisfying the short window.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The loft’s skylight, rain, and oak table function as micro-setting: the beading water mirrors the ink’s behavior and constrains visibility, charging the final image. Spatial choreography is exact—tape, cards, bodies track cleanly—while sensory hierarchy filters through Mara’s measurer’s eye.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“can we forestall another collapse?”—is signaled early and deepens when Mara reveals the cards now map only past omissions. The tightening beat is her refusal to go “back,” foreclosing Elias’s implicit plea; the price is the slow, uncertain forward path she embraces.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the iterative act of measuring distances between archetypes, culminating in the insight that velocity ≠ progress. No character sermonizes; the final image silently reprices the cultural pattern, inviting reflection without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Mara’s perceptual signature—liquid mercury algorithms, brass click—without head-hop. Rhythm accelerates under rain-drums and tape-snaps; diction remains within her calibrated lexicon, yielding a distinct texture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sentences carry double duty—description braided with abstraction—yet remain clear. One metaphor chain (“liquid mercury tracing unpredictable algorithms”) risks density but is pattern-taught early and paid off, so artifact penalty is waived; no loops or register drift touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The fusion of tarot cartomancy with quantitative reverse-engineering feels inevitable and fresh; the measuring tape as cultural seismograph re-configures familiar post-crash terrain. Risk-taking (math-mysticism) heightens coherence rather than gimmickry, rewarded under the within-band bonus.</comment>
