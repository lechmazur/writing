<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elias’s obsessive nose-grief is vivid, embodied, and rules every beat; the vial discovery forces a visible micro-choice (kneel, inhale, weep) that alters his emotional stance with on-page cost. Interiority stays concrete—“aromatically cautious,” lungs finally opened—without therapy-speak. The 17-year backstory is anchored to present stimuli and tilts the final inhale, meeting BRR. Only minor flaw: the shift from terror to acceptance is slightly compressed, but the tears land as earned endurance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens taught early through rhythmic image-stacking; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Elias arrives at “present in the radiance of what remains,” foreclosing avoidance with felt cost (empty vial, open lungs). The vial’s reappearance is kept from reader only until the ultraviolet beat, a purposeful elision paid off by tactic change. No orientation debt; who/where/when anchored by line 3. One scaffold loop (“crystal shadows” x3) but none in the final third; closure untouched.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The greenhouse is not backdrop but reagent: UV wavelength + extinct ferns + perfume vapor interact to force Elias’s inhalation and the botanical resurrection—environment constrains the decisive action. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven (smell > sight), micro-moves track knees, ribs, soil without drift. Charnwood, brass lantern, blue-wax seal recur with purpose. Spatial choreography clean; no white-room syndrome. Meets 9+ gate: setting charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“why scent triggers inherited grief”—tightens once: discovery of wife-sealed vial under extinct fern escalates pressure from avoidance to confrontation. The UV-bloom reaction is coincidence that complicates, not resolves; Elias’s agency is the deliberate inhale that narrows options (no longer cautious, tears released). Cost is legible: 17 years of guarded breath end with open lungs and empty vial. One meaningful cadence shift satisfies length; could use slightly sharper external risk to reach 8.8+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: memory is olfactory time-travel, extinction a pause, grief a seed. Subtext in gestures—stopper removed, tears falling onto soil—rather than thesis. Final image reframes prior 17 years without moralizing. Recurrent “crystal shadows” reweight from menace to benediction. Complexity honored: acceptance includes continued absence. No thematic echo penalty; no final-paragraph sermon.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains tight psychic distance; diction (“aromatically cautious,” “loamy soil,” “phosphorescent bloom”) is character-bound botanist-poet. Rhythm swells with emotional surge, then exhales in final sentence—prose as lung. No head-hopping; UV lore stays within Elias’s professional ken. Filter verbs serve voice (“he saw her now”) during memory rupture. Distinct perceptual signature sustained under peak pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High information density; most sentences advance at least two tasks. Figurative language is patterned and paid off (“crystal shadows” links lantern, vial, tear-light). One minor paraphrase loop on “extinct…extinction” but not in closure beat. Strong verbs outweigh modifiers. Read-aloud rhythm varies; paragraph cuts purposeful. No mixed metaphors or register drift. Artifacts do not touch final image; eligible for 9+ band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes steampunk conservatory, grief-botany, and olfactory time-travel into non-obvious whole. UV-activated resurrection of extinct flora via sealed perfume is fresh yet foreshadowed. Risk-taking (lyric accumulation, scent as plot engine) heightens meaning without obscuring clarity. Transformation test fails if swapped to generic garden. Specific detail throughout—“blue wax bearing his late wife’s initial”—anchors novelty. Bold, fully committed concept.</comment>
