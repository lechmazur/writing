<comment>Mara’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her “charcoal-stained fingers trembling against the spines” anchors us in her bodily dread. The contradictory impulse to both flee surfaces and dive deeper is dramatized through micro-choices: she fondles the broken tarot box, sorts threads, descends. The final self-recognition in the single mirror is credibly earned by the causal chain of untangling. Flaw: occasional diagnostic label-speak (“fragmented reality,” “necessary darkness”) briefly abstracts the pain instead of dramatizing it.</comment>

<comment>Causal lens holds: each beat (“because” she can’t paint faces she flees; “therefore” she untangles threads; “because” threads ignite she gains a new lamp) tightens options until the descent reconfigures her stance. The trapdoor appearance is the single soft coincidence, but it complicates rather than resolves. Closure lands with conceptual cost: she accepts perpetual wall-closing and carries the ache as lantern. Orientation is clear by line 4; no penalty.</comment>

<comment>The lighthouse-library is tactile—rot-slick spines, salt wind, iron ring cool against palm—and dynamically constrains her tactics: shelves collapse to force descent, threads route her hands, the cold lamp demands new fuel. Sensory choice reflects painter’s eye (charcoal, waterlogged pigments). Micro-setting exception: the broken tarot box functions as portable setting that charges the final fused mirror. Spatial choreography is flawless; no white-room lapses.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—can she see a single true self?—is signaled in para 1 and tightens through each knot she untangles, foreclosing the option to remain passive. Escalation is causal: every released memory increases psychic pressure until the only remaining path is downward. Visible price: she forfeits the safety of surfaces, embracing perpetual ache. No reversal, but one meaningful deepening suffices; cost is legible in the blue-white flame she must forever carry.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: the impossibility of a stable self-portrait when identity is layered, tidal, mirrored. The returning motif of “faces” shifts from accusation to acceptance without meta-commentary. Final image—painting shadows themselves—offers a resonant, non-literal answer: embrace the dark canvas. No moralizing; complexity preserved.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays tightly fused to Mara’s painterly perception: syntax pools and fragments like wet paint (“threads... pulsed with dim, bioluminescent light”). Diction remains within her lexicon—palette, pigment, surface—without thesaurus drift. Rhythm accelerates during knot-sorting, then lengthens for descent, mirroring breath. No dialogue, so voice contamination absent. POV modesty maintained: she “understood then,” never omniscient.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentence openings avoid templates. Information density high—one sentence often paints, embodies, and foreshadows (“She used the broken tarot card box to gather the sorted threads, redesigning their pattern into something new”). Metaphors stay coherent (lighthouse as fist, threads as veins). Minor loop: “questions rhetorical questions” is a churn fragment; it nicks the peak beat but does not obscure causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Fusing tarot selfies with lighthouse optics feels inevitable yet fresh; the inversion of ascent-to-descent reframes Gothic survival tropes. The painter who abandons likeness to map darkness offers a non-obvious moral calculus. Specific detail (charcoal under nails, salt-stiff pages) prevents abstraction. Risk—lyric compression inside collapsing architecture—heightens stakes without clarity loss.</comment>
