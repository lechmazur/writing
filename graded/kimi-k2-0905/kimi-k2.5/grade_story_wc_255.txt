<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction—Elara’s yearning to “see” color while already painting beauty in grey—drives every micro-choice; the final renunciation of that want is earned through causality and costs her best canvas. Marin’s silence and first words feel credibly scarred, not convenient. Only minor slip: “innocently cunning” is named once rather than revealed through fresh action.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: plant-dialogue pattern intensifies, reed insertion tightens stakes, and the reed’s song reweights meaning with felt cost—Marin’s voice returns, Elara forfeits her quest for color. Closure is a Charged Poise: both artists stand in reconfigured silence, options forever altered. No orientation debt; spatial anchors arrive within 90 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Kiln heat, cinder scent, and warped metal are filtered through Elara’s grey-scale perception, turning temperature into texture that constrains her decision to trade the painting. Courtyard geography stays coherent; every object (lilies, reed, furnace) is handled, not catalogued. Final image of “sound itself in shades of understanding” recharges the micro-setting of brush and canvas.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will Elara barter her treasured painting for a shot at color?—tightens once: the reed must be fired, the canvas must be surrendered. Escalation is textural: each new plant configuration increases emotional density until the single note shatters glass and forecloses the old silence. Cost is legible: Marin speaks, Elara abandons her cure-myth.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: perception itself is creative labor, and “awakening” is recognition, not acquisition. Subtext lives in plant grammar and the unplayed note—objects speak louder than dialogue. Final image reframes prior grey paintings as already complete, a resonant reconfiguration that avoids moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Lyrical third-person stays locked to Elara’s grey world; syntax mirrors her temperature-reading gaze (“heat shimmer in degrees of silver”). No head-hops; Marin’s interior is accessed only through tactile gesture and eventual voice. Patterned elision—“innocently cunning” named once—reads intentional, paid off by her stealthy stem placements.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and rhythm, accelerating toward the furnace beat, then exhaling after the note. Figurative language is selective: “perfume only possible after the phoenix rises” anchors tone without clutter. Zero loops, no mixed metaphors; “concertina reed tongue” repeats only when necessary for causal clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Colorblind painter seeking color via incinerated concertina reed is fresh; transformation comes when the reed awakens voice, not sight. Botanical cryptography and thermal synesthesia feel inevitable yet surprising. Risky lyric structure holds pressure to the final grey-on-grey stroke.</comment>
