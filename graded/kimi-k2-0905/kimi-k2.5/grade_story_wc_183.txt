<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Maya’s contradictory impulses—clinging to singular identity while reaching for plural mythology—are alive in every micro-choice; the final hand-clasp is credibly earned. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, never sliding into label-speak. The only restraint from 9-band: the twin’s absence is so absolute that relationship-as-crucible pressure must be inferred rather than scenically-tested, capping emotional cost visibility.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the ship dissolving into pages crystallizes Maya’s new merged stance with undeniable conceptual cost. Accumulative lens holds—each image thickens the mythic pattern until the final reweighting. Orientation is taught by sentence 3, waiving any penalty. A hairline slip: “trapped freedom” is named rather than dramatized in the final line, barely muting the cost glow.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The carnival-ship and fog function as micro-setting that actively warps choice—planks becoming pages, mirrors showing possibilities—directly enabling the climax rope-climb. Selective sensory detail (candy-floss residue on boots, calliope wheezing backwards) is filtered through Maya’s mythic bias. Emerging vines of neon green charge the final image, satisfying the 9+ constraint requirement.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—recover the twin’s erased name—is signaled early and tightens once when Maya must accept plural identity to pluck the nameplate. The deepening is driven by her agency under the Accumulative lens; cost is legible in the dissolution of the ship and her own name. One beat short of 8.8: no tangible forfeiture (tool, body, time) is dramatized on-page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme of plural selfhood emerges entirely through image and braid—never stated—culminating in the charged image of two voices singing in one throat. The emerald’s melt into soil reweights earlier color motifs without moralizing. A whisper shy of 9.0 because the concept “trapped freedom” is named in closing cadence, slightly diluting resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Voice sustains mythic lyric register without wobble: syntax lengthens and compresses in step with Maya’s awe. Perceptual signature is consistent—rotating horses, narrative threads as spider-silk. One microscopic POV slip: “the ship drifted blissfully aberrant” momentarily externalizes judgment Maya hasn’t yet framed, keeping the score just below 8.8.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Figurative density is high but patterned and paid off; no mixed metaphors or synonym churn. Rhythm breathes with scene shifts—long clauses for drift, fragments for blinks. A single scaffold echo (“now it was...now it was”) is purposeful time-flutter, not artifact. Closure image remains crystal.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The chimera-twin / abandoned-carnival-ship / narrative-thread braid is a fresh synthesis that feels inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric accumulative structure heightens mythic stakes without clarity loss. Specificity of “nameplates growing like flowers” anchors the concept in unforgettable image. Transformation is total: swap any detail and the spell collapses.</comment>
