<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The titan’s refusal to speak in defense, the quiet bare-foot advance, and the single iron-gall pellet carried for millennia crystallize an interior hierarchy of humility over claim; the decisive renunciation of the crown costs him nothing he values yet strips the pretender of everything—an Earned Stasis whose price is felt in the hush of collapsing columns.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each etched fragment coalesces into the rune that reweights reality; closure lands with Conceptual Repricing—the temple dissolves into myth, time resumes, and the titan’s humility is crowned by absence. Cost is legible when the crown clatters, too heavy for a head that never sought it.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Marble corridors, broken dome, drifting starlight, and the iron-gall pellet constraining every archival choice form a micro-setting whose collapse is inseparable from justice done; dust-fine stone returns to earth while the crown rolls to rest at bare feet—setting that charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—truth versus masquerade—tightens when the sigil assembles from ten thousand hidden fragments; the pretender’s options narrow to undressing before the rune. Escalation is textural but irreversible: each peeled layer of stolen royalty increases the cost of remaining disguised.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of humility as invisible sovereignty emerges through the titan’s refusal to wear the crown and the temple’s graceful self-erasure; no moral is stated—only the image of dust finer than pollen carrying away both library and lie. Subtext: memory itself is the only throne that endures.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Omniscient lyric voice sustains archaic cadence (“regally unpretentious dignity,” “epochs bowed his shoulders”) without slipping into parody; perceptual signature filters cosmos through parchment dust and gall-ink acid. Compression like “whisper of turning pages” teaches the pattern early and pays off in the final hush.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Syntax flexes from orotund openings to clipped finality; no synonym loops or scaffold. Figurative density peaks at the collapse yet remains coherent—“dust fine as pollen” propels the ending image without muddle. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with the temple’s sigh.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: archivist-titan who weaponizes marginalia across millennia to unmask a false king via star-aligned sigil. Risk of cosmic library collapse is fully committed to and paid off. Specific detail—gall-ink eating parchment like acid through comfortable lies—transforms familiar tropes of hidden heirs and prophecy into bibliophilic apocalypse.</comment>
