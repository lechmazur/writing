<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s contradictory drive—seeking closure yet choosing to keep the wound open—plays out in embodied beats (the pocketed hourglass, the kneel beside his sister). The final micro-choice, touching her frost-filled hand while the glass shatters, crystallizes a credible renunciation with felt cost. Interiority stays concrete, though a few phrases (“unwanted clarity,” “fossilized scar tissue”) flirt with diagnostic shorthand. Still, the arc lands under the Accumulative/Textural lens: enduring the open wound is earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elias abandons the quest for endings and accepts the displaced miracle as an open scar. The hourglass’s shattering and frost-binding image carries undeniable conceptual cost under the Accumulative lens. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within 120 words; the single POV holds. No causality breaks; every beat (coffee-ring reading, tunnel descent, meteor cavern) tightens pattern rather than option, satisfying the lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The tower, hourglass, frost, and meteor cavern are rendered through Elias’s tactile attention—roots brushing skin, frost vibrating in pocket—so environment constrains action and charges the final image. Selective sensory hierarchy (cold, mineral, chlorophyll) mirrors his narcotic clarity. Spatial choreography stays coherent down the spiral into the sealed tunnel. Micro-setting (the hourglass as portable scar) functions as setting and tool, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—will Elias suture or witness the wound?—is signaled early and deepens through pattern intensification: each image (coffee rings, ivy whisper, frost vibration) reweights the cost of keeping the scar open. No external antagonist is needed; pressure is situational/accumulative. The decisive tightening occurs when the hourglass shatters, foreclosing reversal. Cost is legible on-page: he accepts eternal frost-bonded vigil.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges implicitly: some traumas must remain legible rather than healed. The hourglass’s frozen second, the meteor’s displaced miracle, and the frost-bound reunion form a coherent constellation that reweights “closure” as erasure. No moralizing statement mars the ending; resonance is carried by the final image of shared frost. Ambiguity is purposeful and charged.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited maintains consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature is saturated with mineral cold, chlorophyll time, and surgical numbness. Syntax lengthens and contracts with anesthetic haze versus subterranean clarity. No head-hopping or register drift. Dialogue is absent, so voice evaluation rests on the lyrical yet precise narrative sentences which remain character-bound.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but purposeful: each sentence layers image and stakes without scaffold. Figurative language is controlled; mixed metaphors are avoided. A few near-repetitions (“frost,” “scar,” “miracle”) serve accumulative pattern rather than loops. Rhythm modulates from narcotic languor to crystalline final line, propelling closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of meteor-impact cosmology, botanical telepathy, and surgical scar-reading feels fresh yet inevitable. Risky lyric compression is taught early and paid off in the frost-bound stasis. The displaced-miracle concept reframes grief without resorting to stock trauma tropes. Specificity of coffee-ring cartography and chlorophyll time-stamp anchors the fantastical in lived detail.</comment>
