<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction is strong—silence as both weapon and wound—but the final “voice” feels foregone; the micro-choice to re-hide the envelope is the only beat where cost is visible. Earlier beats summarize endurance rather than dramatize compounding risk. Still, the lineage scar motif keeps motivation legible and personal.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: re-sealing the manuscript reverses the inheritance, turning silence into relay. Lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of developing/negative/positive charges meaning without causal reversal. Orientation anchors by word 80; no teleporting props. One meaningful deepening at the lightning reveal suffices.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Observatory glass, storm glare, and chemical tang are filtered through photographer’s eye; the timer and negative act as micro-settings that constrain when she can write. Spatial track is clean—dome → desk → glass → floorboard. Weather actively exposes the negative, so environment shapes tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—transmit truth under censorship—tightens once: lightning flash exposes the negative, proving her father’s prior vigil, turning inheritance into duty. No external antagonist appears, but silence itself gains visceral weight. Cost is legible: she forfeits immediate speech to seed future readers.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges via chemical metaphor: truth must be “fixed” in darkness before it can survive light. Final re-pricing—re-sealing the envelope—reverses expectation of disclosure, arguing that continuity of witness matters more than single revelation. No moralizing sentence mars the close; resonance stays imagistic.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyric third-person stays tight to Elara’s perceptual filter—lightning as “developing photograph,” scars as “topography.” Syntax lengthens under calm, fragments under flash, teaching the rhythm early. No head-hop; diction remains within photographer’s lexicon. Voice modulation parallels chemical process without self-conscious poeticism.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm is varied; figurative density is high but pattern-taught (development metaphor) and paid off at closure. One scaffold phrase—“furiously tranquil resolve” repeated—slips through, not enough to dull final image. Strong verbs anchor sentences; no filter-verb clusters.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Inheritance-as-undeveloped-negative reframes familiar censorship arc; bus timetable as time-capsule is fresh, though “hidden manuscript in floorboard” is stock. Risk-taking lies in renunciatory ending—she buries而非publishes—which reweights premise. Synthesis feels specific to photographer lineage.</comment>
