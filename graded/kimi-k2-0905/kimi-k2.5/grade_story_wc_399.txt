<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>The line-walker’s motivation—to “preserve the echo of wisdom”—is clear, embodied, and escalates through micro-choices (spiral approach, mask removal, song). Her contradictory impulses (vulnerability vs. theft from the desert) play out in scene, culminating in a cost-paid renunciation. No secondary character on page, so relationship/status bullets N/A. Interiority stays concrete, e.g. “her bare face felt the cool air.”</comment>

<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of attention, density, and cadence tightens until the closing image reweights the stake. Closure = Charged Poise: the parapet accepts the burden, the clearing vanishes, pavilion gains harmonic—cost legible, path foreclosed. Orientation anchored by word 75; no causality breaks. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Desert, pavilion, kinetic parapet, and body-as-setting all constrain movement and choice; the parapet’s rising arc physically shapes the final beat. Sensory hierarchy obeys POV—half-mask filters perception, peripheral sight enables conjuring. Selective detail (glowing footprints, sandstone-and-bronze semicircle) integrates into action without stall. Spatial choreography clean throughout spiral approach.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—preserve the prophet’s echo—faces tightening desert reclamation; the clearing’s contraction forces the binding song. Agency: spiral entry, mask removal, song delivery; each narrows options. Cost: clearing lost, wisdom stored in impersonal gears, human access foregone. Under Accumulative lens, density shift (pavilion harmonic) reweights stake with felt price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges: wisdom survives only by surrender to larger, indifferent systems. Subtext resides in gesture (mask removal = vulnerability as conduit) and image (gears swallow echo). No moralizing; final line reweights premise without assertion. Recurrent “echo” and “murmur” motifs constrain choice and charge closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to line-walker; perceptual signature—right eye vs. hidden left, peripheral sight—creates distinct rhythmic filter. Syntax mirrors action: long spiraling clauses approach, then short beats at kneeling. No head-hop; diction remains within desert-ritual register. Ellision (“seven unspeakable kindnesses”) taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentence openings diversify. High density: “kinetic parapet beneath the dunes stirred with mechanical grace” fuses setting, object, motion. No loops or scaffold; figuratives stay coherent (“silver dust,” “key turning”). Filter verbs minimal and voice-motivated. Zero artifacts in final third; closure image pristine.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Freshest synthesis: half-mask + peripheral ritual + subterranean memory-machine = new mythic tech. Prophet’s echo stored in gears而非human memory upends usual sage-preservation trope. Risk of dense lyricism accepted and paid off in resonant final cadence. Specific detail (ceramic-and-obsidian mask, bronze-sandstone parapet) anchors novelty.</comment>
