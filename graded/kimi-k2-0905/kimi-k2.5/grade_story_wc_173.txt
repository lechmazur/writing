<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lys’s chaste courtesan identity and bodily-poetic agency are concrete: her untouched state is the literal key, her virginity “a blade she whetted,” and every spiral motion while untangling threads is a micro-choice that risks exposure. Interior contradiction shows in the same motion—desire for memory vs. refusal to be broken—embodied in fingertips that “strip away a decade of stillness.” Cost is legible: stepping inside the prism forces her to witness infinite failed selves, a visible psychic price. Only the final beat keeps her just short of 9: the endurance/renunciation lands, but we do not feel the bodily after-shock of carrying the harvested echoes into the thaw.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the prism opens, infinite mirror-selves appear, and Lys’s stance crystallizes—she now bears the dissident past inside an Empire that erases memory. Causality holds: chastity → temporal-key → untangle → gate opens; each because/therefore link is on-page. Accumulated-light image reweights the premise with undeniable conceptual cost. Orientation, transitions, and lens remain coherent; only the faintest causal leap (how virginity maps to 4-D lockpick) keeps it from 9+ perfection.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Snow-muffled marble courtyard, glass-quartz prism, and starlight-refracted constellations are vivid, selective, and filter through Lys’s urgent perception—“shadows moved like living ink.” Weather and architecture actively pressure her: falling snow erases footprints (cover), prism facets multiply stakes (infinite selves). Spatial choreography is flawless—every spiral hand motion tracked against door-threads. Micro-setting (her unbound hair catching flakes) doubles as tool-proxy, but environment does not quite force a tactical pivot, capping at 8.6.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—extract dissident memories before the household wakes—tightens through corporeal risk: each untwist of temporal filament could trigger an alarm. One meaningful escalation: final thread releases “a crystal bell shattering in reverse,” narrowing options from stealth to irreversible exposure. Cost is visible (phantom voices of failed custodians buzz her fingers) and shapes tactics—she must stay bodily poetic or fail. Pressure coheres under causal lens; no secondary reversal, so ceiling 8.2.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the accreted images: memory as contraband, chastity as subversive archive, silence as louder than song. Subtext lives in gesture—snow erasing footprints mirrors Empire scrubbing minds; her refusal to be “broken and remade” is never moralized. Final infinity of silver courtyards reweights the premise: individual integrity can preserve collective history. No tidy moral, only charged poise; slight abstraction keeps it from 9.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person POV remains tight to Lys’s perceptual filter—“flakes fell like ash from a silent burning”—with lyric compression taught early and paid off at the mirror-selves reveal. Rhythm modulates from languid gait to crystalline clang, matching breathless trespass. Diction (“calligraphy against the white expanse,” “temporal filaments”) stays within her educated courtesan lexicon. No head-hop, no filter-verb bloat; prose is character-specific and propulsive under peak stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty—description braided with stakes: “each gesture bodily poetic and deliberate” advances both image and key-mechanic. Figurative density is high yet patterned, taught by the courtyard sonnet and justified by prism refraction. No scaffold, loops, or mixed metaphors; clarity stays intact through fourth-dimensional sleight. A single near-purple phrase—“world of monochrome radiance”—is the lone hairline slip keeping it from 9+.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Chaste courtesan as living lock-pick, memory-theft during the micron between death and dawn, and “harvesting echoes” rather than sound—all feel specific and non-obvious. The lyric-causal hybrid structure is risky yet coherent; virginity-as-key could have been gimmicky but is grounded in tactile untwisting of time-threads. Transformation test fails if swapped: only this body, this prism, this snowfall produce the mirror-self payoff. Minor genre echo (memory as light-crystals) is sufficiently re-inflected.</comment>
