<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Julian’s synesthetic ghost is vividly particular—“applause as spiraling ribbons of amber and rust” embodies perception.  His encore hunger converts to caretaker agency the instant Mara appears, a credible pivot under the garden’s pressure.  The tarot-coin transfer crystallizes cost: he forfeits his last anchor, she forfeits suicide.  One beat only from Mara keeps her below co-protagonist status; still, her micro-choice to drop the cutter is embodied and legible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: layered aria-echoes intensify density until the coin catch reweights both fates.  Orientation is swift—the Rialto back wall, night, maze within ~60 words.  Closure is a Charged Poise: Mara exits toward possible futures, Julian folds into cinnamon–velvet stasis, coin abandoned as persistent price.  No loops, no causal breaks; the splintered-time device is taught early and paid off visually.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Garden, coin, and synesthetic sound function as micro-setting that constrains action: golden threads lure Mara, coin alone is dense enough to bridge realms.  Hedge maze shapes tactical movement—she follows scent, leaves weapon among roots.  Violets in October and turquoise harmonies ground impossibility without catalog bloat.  Spatial choreography tracks cleanly as Julian “moved through the trees,” Mara stands, exits maze before demolition crew arrive.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: can Julian turn a stranger from suicide with only ghostly echoes?  Pressure accumulates through chromatic density—each spectral encore thickens the chord until the coin catch forces Mara’s binary decision.  Visible price: Julian relinquishes his sole physical relic; Mara abandons self-harm.  Escalation is single-crescendo but coherent under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of possibility versus oblivion emerges through sensory accumulation rather than statement.  Final image—coin in dirt, “waiting for the next lost soul”—reweights earlier ovations into generative legacy.  No moralizing, only charged poise.  Nostalgia never lectures; it modulates from Julian’s cinnamon close into sunrise demolition, letting reader taste impermanence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lush, music-laden diction belongs to a synesthetic ghost-performer; elevated register is动机ated.  Rhythmic control—“hummed with the violet resonance of forgotten arias”—matches aria cadence.  No head-hopping; Julian’s POV filters every hue and note.  Line variance is high, with breath-length fragments at climax, sustaining momentum.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Almost every sentence layers image + motion + sound; no paraphrase loops.  Occasional modifier stacks (“gold leaf and blood-red oil”) verge on purple but stay purposeful to synesthetic excess.  No mixed metaphors or clarity breaks.  Final third is artifact-free, preserving 9-band eligibility.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Synesthetic ghost + tarot coin + suicide intervention is fresh synthesis.  “Fractured encore timeline” transforms standard ghost unfinished-business into iterative self-haunting.  Risky lyric density paid off in on-page transfer of potential.  Concept commits fully: no retreat into generic redemption arc.</comment>
