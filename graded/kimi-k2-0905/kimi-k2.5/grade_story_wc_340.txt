<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s “warmly inquisitive” stance is shown through tactile micro-choices (tracing pages, aligning wheels) that alter her trajectory; the diary reading reframes her identity. Yet her interiority slips into summary (“understood his motivation with sudden clarity”) rather than dramatized contradiction, and the leap from servant to inheritor of the captain’s “secret” is asserted, not earned under pressure. Still, embodied details—breath fogging goggles, diary pressed to ribs—keep contradiction alive enough to justify a solid mid-7.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each ascending floor layers sensory density until the fractured goggles/diary decode reweights meaning. Closure lands as Charged Poise—Elara stands between cloud and stratosphere wearing cracked goggles like a crown, cost legible as inherited vigilance. The diary’s light-lock is convenient (no prior hint of spectral cipher), but the pattern is taught early by the cracked lenses refracting sun, so causality holds. Orientation is swift; scaffold minimal, ending image reconfigures stakes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Frost-coated elevator glass, boiling coffee at altitude, aurora as green silk—every sensory note is filtered through Elara’s professional curiosity and steers choice. The spire itself remains slightly abstract (no spatial footprint inside the car), yet the diary and goggles function as micro-setting that constrains the decoding act at climax. Cold, altitude, and refracted light literally unlock the narrative, satisfying the 9+ gate for environmental constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake: whether Elara will appropriate the captain’s dual vision of beauty-in-despair. Pressure escalates texturally—each floor adds a descriptive layer that tightens thematic focus—but no concrete option is foreclosed; she simply exits the lift with new knowledge. No visible price (job risk, physical danger) attaches to reading the diary, so escalation feels observational rather than tactical. Sufficient for a mid-6, but lacks a narrowed choice or felt cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through recurrent ice/light imagery: beauty germinates inside desolation. Subtext stays implicit—no explicit thesis, only the captain’s taste-of-altitude coffee and Elara’s final crowned stance. The diary’s anguish/rapture duality reconfigures in the closing image of “broken glass” crown, paying off prior refraction motifs without moralizing. Complexity acknowledged; transcendence neither denied nor guaranteed.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited maintains tight psychic distance; diction (“mechanical flower blooming in illuminated code”) remains within Elara’s sensibility. Syntax lengthens under wonder, shortens under pressure—rhythmic control mirrors altitude breath. No dialogue, so voice pure; perceptual signature vivid and consistent. Only hairline slip: one elevated clause “geometry of hope” momentarily breaks register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Varied sentence lengths create lift-car cadence; figurative language sparse enough to avoid purple drift. No loops, no scaffold, high information density. Occasional stacked adjectives (“impossible dream, merciless clarity”) ride the lyrical edge but never obscure causality. Clean mechanics, proofread copy, strong paragraph cut efficiency.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Frozen-cloud elevator as vertical memoir is fresh; cracked goggles serving both cipher-key and crown repurposes a standard prop. Accumulative floor-structure feels inevitable rather than gimmick. Could swap ice-spire for any tall structure without breaking emotional arc, so transformation partial. Within-band risk bonus withheld because altitude specifics already exploited.</comment>
