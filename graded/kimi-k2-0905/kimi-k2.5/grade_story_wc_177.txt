<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Interiority is lush, idiosyncratic, and body-anchored (“wax edges softened by her body heat until the embossed eagle seemed to breathe”). Contradictory impulses surface—“preserve the seal / refuse to dream”—but they are stated rather than enacted in scene; the moment of actual renunciation happens off-stage in dream-logic, so the cost is felt abstractly. Still, the voice-driven self-portrait is singular enough to clear the bar for short-form character depth.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the melted seal and the decision never to return land with conceptual cost under an Accumulative/Textural lens—pattern of decay completes itself. Causality is interior and hallucinatory, yet every image is seeded early (ivy, seal, dream-etched wall) and re-weighted at the end. The single transition from waking preparation to dream-walk to post-storm exit is legible; orientation holds without anchors because disorientation is the taught pattern that pays off.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The bunker-as-body micro-setting constrains every move: copper still on the commander’s cot, wax pooling in her palm, blast-door light spelling instructions she finally ignores. Sensory hierarchy is POV-tilted—storm vibration through ivy before thunder—so environment is felt, not catalogued. Concrete specificity (“Virginia creeper threading through reinforced steel”) charges the final image when she steps into the same green light now re-coded as freedom rather than entrapment.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stake is single and dominant: obey the decaying directive or transcends it. Pressure tightens once—the storm and the drug converge to force the choice—but the tightening is purely internal; no external option is foreclosed on-page, so cost is conceptual rather than tactical. Sufficient for this length and lyric mode, yet the absence of a visible external price keeps it just shy of the top band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from material particulars: decay as liberation, maps surrendered for pathless walking. No moral is stated; the melted wax performs the argument. The precisely playful refrain risks echoing the prompt, but the final reprise (“she moved precisely playfully now”) re-weights it as earned stance rather than label.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is unmistakable—storm vibration through ivy, eagle breathing in warm wax—sustained across every sentence. Syntax flexes with pressure: longer hypnotic cadence during descent, staccato exit beats. No head-hopping; unreliability is controlled (dream logic flagged early). The lyric register never drifts into overwriting because every figure is tethered to body or bunker.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm is deliberate and varied; no template cadence or synonym loops. Metaphors are coherent—“rust-eaten blast doors like praying hands”—and kept scarce enough to retain punch. One mixed micro-image (“electric green of after-storm”) is fleeting and does not touch closure. Density is high: single sentences fuse action, sensory filter, and thematic overtone.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Bunker-as-oracle and post-collapse mushroom alchemy feel fresh, yet the “path chooses the walker” trope is familiar; specificity of decaying directive and precisely playful gait re-anchors it. Synthesis is organic—no grafted quirks—and the final reconfiguration justifies the hallucinatory method. Risk taken in dream-logic structure pays off without obscuring closure.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Early setup via name; middle choice to ingest mushrooms and abandon seal; closure linkage when she walks away forever. Cost is conceptual but visible in melted wax. One point off for late arrival of the actual walking decision inside dream rather than dramatised beat.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Seal handled in opening, clutched during ingestion, dissolved in palm at end—three distinct beats that reweight meaning from authority to wound/birth. Irreplaceable object; removal would collapse the story’s hinge.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Directive named in paragraph 5, contradicted by mushroom brew, finally understood as finished with her—three gates, causal pressure on transcend decision. Concept shapes tactics explicitly.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Phrase seeded early, reprised at exit when her gait embodies it. No visible cost tied directly to the trait, but the reprise reweights the stake. Mid-band because it comments on movement rather than forcing a trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Transcend is the single through-action: ingest, dream-walk backward, wake and physically exit. Dream sequence is the middle development beat; final step into wet air is closure. Could not be swapped without breaking arc.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Interpreted dreams are the mandated method; mechanics taught via wall etchings and enacted in dream-walk. Plausible within world, but no secondary complication or cost specific to dream method itself—functions more as portal than constraint.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Bunker’s vine-draped decay is visible in every paragraph; spatial choreography (cot, still, blast doors) shapes her movements and supplies the final threshold. Setting is antagonist and liberator.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Storm’s approach is signaled early and coincides with drug onset, but timeline inside dream is elastic and no deadline is violated or met—serves atmosphere more than tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.8</question><comment>Desire articulated as understanding why paths choose walkers; tension with cost of abandoning sentinel duty. Realisation lands in dream—epiphany is earned, yet dramatised only inside hallucination, muting felt cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Ethereal grit sustained: concrete bunker details fused with dreamlike syntax and mushroom haze. Tone modulates—storm violence to melted-wax tenderness—without shearing voice. Final image leaves reader suspended in charged poise.</comment>
