<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Amara’s grief is vivid in the body (geode squeezed “against her palm”), but the interiority drifts into abstract theory-speak (“mathematics of loss”) that blunts contradiction under pressure; the final micro-choice—fracture the geode to carry the data—costs the stone but not visibly her, so the renunciation feels partial.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: surge → reboot window → perturbation hunt → valley vector → escape. Closure is a Charged Poise: she vanishes carrying the “weight of tomorrow,” a conceptual cost that reweights the premise (grief becomes map). Orientation clear by 60 words; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Station darkness, viewport curvature, and geode lattice filter every beat; the crystalline console interface lets the tiny setting rewrite navigation, so the micro-environment directly enables the climax. Sensory economy strong—no tourist catalog of orbit.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—touch the unused potential of her unborn family—signaled early; each tick of the cooling breakers tightens the window, forcing the final data-burn into the geode. Price is conceptual but legible: she trades surveillance-free escape for irreversible knowledge of what can’t be reclaimed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from refracted light inside a stone grown in darkness: death as redirection, not erasure. No moralizing; the final image of the cracked geode/map reweights earlier motifs without statement, achieving subdued resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Amara’s perceptual filter—“bleak exhilaration,” “quantum foam”—syntax lengthens with theory, then fractures into staccato countdown beats. No head-hopping; diction stays within her scientific lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Rhythm modulates with pressure; occasional modifier stacks (“intangibly tangible weight”) flirt with overwriting but stop short of muddle. No loops, clean propulsion; one missed comma splice in breakers sentence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fuses quantum-ghost grief with hard-SF orbital mechanics; the notion of hunting “pooled unused potential” via drone-trajectory deviation feels non-obvious and specific to this voice. Risk in dense theory pays off because the geode makes the abstraction tactile.</comment>
