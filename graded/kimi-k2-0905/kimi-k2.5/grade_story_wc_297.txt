<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority crackles: “roots say the glade will shift” marries embodied pain to oracle duty. Scars-as-circuit gives Kael mirrored motive and tactile bond, but the pair’s final leap to “weave the new covenant” is asserted rather than dramatized—no micro-choice shows what thread they actually pull. Still, contradictory impulses (stay rooted / run) coexist in scene and the shared scar cost lands on-page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the clipping’s dissolution crystallizes options—dream-paths now negotiable—while time-pressure (“until full dark”) keeps cost legible. Causal chain holds: clipping→blood→glade→scar-circuit→node entry. One minor causality fuzz: how Kael instantly intuits “covenant isn’t broken” isn’t foreshadowed, but the line reweights stakes rather than breaks them.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Cobalt glade, oak-roots fused to flesh, dusk angles that stretch time—every sensory pick is filtered through Elara’s tremoring perception and constrains movement. The clipping serves as micro-setting/tool that literally points and then burns gold, charging the final image. Spatial track is immaculate: bodies, roots, light rotate without drift. Environment + body together force the choice to step into the node.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—re-anchoring time—tightens once: roots release but dark clock starts. Protagonist agency drives every beat (steal clipping, prick finger, clasp scar, step in). Cost is visible—torn flesh, traded immobility for unknown covenant labour—yet escalation is single-stage; no secondary reversal compounds pressure inside the word count.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of temporal responsibility emerges through fused flesh and shared scar tissue rather than thesis statement. The clipped maze reweights from stolen map to dissolved covenant ink, implying governance is organic, not imposed. Final image of “dream carefully” offers resonant praxis without moralising. One near-echo: “covenant” risks abstract grandiosity but is grounded in bodily cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person lingers inside Elara’s sensory filter—roots “hum with premature chronology,” sky “bruised.” Syntax lengthens under wonder, shortens under pain; no drumbeat patterns. Kael’s dialogue is spare, mythic (“I heed the warning in your eyes”), distinct from Elara’s leaf-crinkle whisper. Compression like “anxious elation” is taught by context and stays legible.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm breathes with scene: paragraphs swell then contract as glade rotates. Figurative language is selective—no metaphor storms. One mixed vehicle: “shadows pooled like ink between trees that hummed” fuses liquid & sound, but the synesthesia feels purposeful to warped time. Zero paraphrase loops, clean grammar, high information density; sentences multitask.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Premise—“future arrived early,” prophecy literalised in flesh—twins oracle duty with ecological bondage, freshens Chosen One tropes. Scar-circuit as temporal key is specific, irreplicable. Risky lyric escalation pays off: the glade physically rotates rather than metaphorically “changes.” No derivative echo of famous myth cycles; mythos feels internally generated.</comment>
