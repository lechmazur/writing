<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elias’s guilt and need for atonement are palpable, but the interiority tips into self-diagnostic labels (“he had failed Marcus once”) rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The micro-choice to hand over the heart is present, yet the story tells us the cost instead of letting his body betray it. Still, the hierarchy of values—ministry vs. justice—remains legible and drives the final oath.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands clean: the serial-number reveal is a conceptual repricing that flips the moral ledger and costs Elias his complacency. Causal chain holds—storm light → inscription → decision to expose—though the repairman functions more as oracle than agent. One transition (shop to future plan) is allowed and legible; orientation is anchored by word 60. No meaningful tightening after the reveal; pressure plateaus instead of spikes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The shop’s brass dust and rain-streaked panes filter through Elias’s clerical eye, marrying guilt to craftsmanship. The Comtoise movement is micro-setting that constrains the final proof. Light through storm glass reconfigures meaning at closure, meeting the 9+ gate, but the exterior street remains generic, capping at 8.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—clearing Marcus’s name—ignites early and escalates via the inscribed mainspring. Yet the tightening is external (discovery) rather than a choice that forecloses an option for Elias; he simply vows future action. Cost is conceptual but not yet paid on-page, keeping the score below 8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of second chances for the dead emerges through the repaired mechanism, not sermon. The final image of “ozone and possibility” offers resonant reconfiguration without moralizing. Ambiguity survives: the state may still ignore him, preserving complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elias with priestly cadence—measured, Latinate, guilt-laden. No head-hopping; repairman’s dialogue carries subtext of judgment. Syntax mirrors emotional pressure: longer clauses collapse into hammered fragments at reveal. Distinct perceptual signature holds under stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong information density—each sentence advances guilt or artifact. Occasional purple lifts (“violet desperation”) and a paraphrase loop on “apology into action” dull the peak. No artifacts touch the closure beat; rhythm breathes correctly at the oath.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Fusing clerical guilt with horology feels fresh; the serial-number twist is seeded yet surprising. Risk is moderate—quiet revelation rather than spectacle—but coherence is high. The piece transforms the exoneration trope through liturgical patience and metallic precision.</comment>
