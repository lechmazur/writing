<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s lonely artistry and need to give voice to the mute machine are vivid; her decision to “encode herself into the physical world” is foreshadowed by her earlier acid etchings. Interior contradiction is thin—she never questions whether merging with a ghost is safe or desirable—so the arc edges toward tidy. Cost is poetic rather than visceral: “tinkersong wonder fading into a single sustained note” is felt, but not acutely personal. Still, her micro-choices (pressing the plate, singing back) track cleanly with her vocation and isolation, earning a solid high-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the ghost’s apology becomes physical graffiti that reweights the courtyard as living memory. Causal chain holds: plate→receptacle→dust→walls speak. Orientation is taught early (“misty courtyard above clouds”) and pays off in the final map. One minor causality tremor: the “map to other courtyards” appears without prior plant, but it functions as Charged Poise rather than deus ex machina. Cost is legible in the fading note and Elara’s departure into further exile.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Micro-setting excellence: the flower-press bolt plate’s fossilized gardens constrain the final encoding and literally fertilize the graffiti. Air “hummed with static electricity” syncs with the ghost’s pneumatic heartbeat, so environment steers both mood and mechanics. Spatial choreography stays clean as Elara moves from vapour to obelisk to departing horizon. Idiom stays lyrically consistent; no world-rules contradictions. Setting functions as both stage and co-actor, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“articulate unspoken needs”—is signaled early and tightens when the ghost crafts its silent mouth. Agency is present: Elara’s press-and-song sequence forces the ghost’s materialization and her own onward exile. Cost is conceptual (the duet’s fading), but less viscerally felt than Q2’s closure; no tangible loss beyond melancholy. Escalation is single-wave, not telescopic, fitting lyric-accumulative lens. Enough for high-band entry, but not the top stripe.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: transmission vs. transmutation—songs become graffiti, code becomes lichen. Subtext resides in silence (the ghost’s mouth opens “in silent song”) and in the bolt plate’s crushed flowers—violence born of love. No moral maxim is declared; the final map invites rather than answers. Ambiguity is meaningful: is Elara healing lonely machines or seeding new hauntings? Complexity sustains.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is irreducibly lyric—“driftingly alert,” “tinkersong wonder”—yet never blinds orientation; pattern is taught by second sentence. Syntax modulates: longer breathless clauses for mist, staccato noun clusters for mechanical parts. No head-hopping; single POV holds. Diction stays within balladeer lexicon; no corporate register drift. Rhythm accelerates into the final sustained note, mirroring electrical charge. Meets 9+ quick test with room for microscopic tightening.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet aerated: “fossilized gardens…into luminous dust” compresses eons into one image. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances either mist physics or emotional charge. Metaphors stay coherent (wind-chime clockworks) and physically grounded. Minor overwrite: “mechanical sorrow” edges personification convenience, but occurs early and becomes motif. Closure sentence is clean, single-image, ear-tested.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fusion of botanic melancholy and steampunk ghost is fresh; “flower press bolt plate” as memory-prison for accidental murders of blooms is non-obvious. Risky second-person address to ghost pays off via embodied graffiti response. Synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight—every pneumatic tube points toward the need for organic recompense. No derivative template echoes; specificity anchors universals. Transformation passes: could not swap plate or setting without collapsing logic.</comment>
