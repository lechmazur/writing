<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias’s “molting” trait is stated repeatedly but never alters on-page tactics; the fear of forgetting is announced, not dramatized. His single micro-choice—sliding the tin—rests on Marcus, not on any contradiction inside himself. Marcus’s stoic reply supplies the beat’s only felt cost. Interiority drifts into lyric summary (“luminous fracture”) instead of embodied tension.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the image of seeds and microfilm under a clearing moon reweights the stake with undeniable conceptual cost. Causal chain is light—mostly declarative—but the accumulative pattern (books → garden → knowledge) holds. Orientation is clean by word 60. The ending’s resonance just exceeds the soft middle where stakes are restated more than tested.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Rusted library shelves, coffee-tin false bottom, and moonlit prison yard are concrete, selective, and re-used to guide choice. The tin’s rose-embossed catch and the east-wing soil constrain the final transfer. Sensory balance leans visual, but touch and smell enter through “moldy mysteries” and “torn poetry.” Spatial choreography is flawless across the yard and table.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—seeds/tin must reach east wing—is signaled early but never narrowed by external jeopardy; guards are hypothetical. One soft tightening: shift change whispers. No visible price or lost option on the page; consequence is postponed to “tomorrow.” Pressure is situational and coherent yet static; the moon clocks time but does not heighten risk.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme—“forge beauty from anarchy”—emerges through the parallel of rescued books and clandestine garden rather than overt statement. Subtext lives in gesture: sliding the tin, pressing the rose catch. Final image re-prices resistance as cultivation, not battle. Avoids moralizing, though Marcus’s closing line flirts with thesis-like cadence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Lyric third-person hovers close to Elias’s perceptual filter: “verses on cigarette papers,” “coffee tin clutched against his ribs.” Syntax stretches into cadenced fragments that mirror moonlit stillness without losing clarity. Dialogue is sparse but differentiated: Marcus’s clipped stoicism counters Elias’s poetic diction. No head-hop; lens holds.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Strong read-aloud rhythm with purposeful variation; no template cadence or synonym loops. Metaphors (“luminous fracture,” “molting personalities”) stay coherent and sparse. Two near-adjacent “sorted/sorting” repeats are the only micro-loop, not enough to dull momentum. Line density is high; each sentence advances image or beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The monthly personality-molt is a fresh speculative hook, yet its narrative utility remains potential rather than activated. Prison-library-as-resistance and seed-smuggling are crisply combined, but the microfilm angle is under-deployed. Final garden-library fusion feels inevitable in hindsight, satisfying the transformation test. Risk level is moderate; concept earns partial bonus.</comment>
