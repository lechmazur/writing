<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elias’s guilt-locked silence and the itch for “never” are vivid; the micro-choice to raise the fiddle despite bleeding fingers embodies cost. Interiority stays concrete, but the hitchhiker remains a cipher—no contradiction shown, yet relationship pressure is absent. The final renunciation of silence is earned by the glass-flake cue and scaffold path. Voice convergence is N/A; single-POV texture is consistent.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each flutter, pixel, and note thickens density toward the Charged Poise finale where the flake dissolves and silence becomes bridge. Orientation anchored by scenic pullout <120 w; no causal turns required under this lens. Closure—fiddle raised, silence foreclosed—carries felt cost in the bleeding fingers and dissolved flake. Persistent constraint: the scaffold remains as literal footing for future bridges.</comment>

<comment>Mountain pullout and scaffold wrap function as micro-setting: the flutters map trajectory and later spell new topography, directly guiding feet and bow. Wet-plate flake is handled in three beats—pocket, palm, dissolve—charging the final image. Selective sensory economy (ozone, pine, blood) mirrors narrowing air. Spatial choreography clean: hitchhiker’s ascent path tracked by plastic ripple.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</question>
<comment>Dominant stake: will Elias ever sound the bridge-collapse note? Escalation is textural—each flutter and pixel tightens the noose of “never” until the only remaining option is to play. Agency: he decides to sculpt ascent, not dirge; cost is bloody fingertips and the flake’s dissolution. No coincidence; coincidence (hitchhiker) complicates but does not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges: forgiveness through fragmentation—pixelated amnesty reweights collapse into scaffold. No overt thesis; resonance lives in the dissolved flake and the new silent bridge of air. Final image offers non-literal answer: scaffold remains as foothold for songs unbuilt. Ambiguity lingers—will the valley audience hear?—without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays tightly fused to Elias’s perceptual filter: “dynamically observant as a predator,” “pixels…floating like fireflies.” Syntax fragments under pressure—“sculpting possibility from the ashes of ‘never’”—without losing clarity. No head-hopping; hitchhiker’s interiority rightly opaque. Pattern-taught elision (repeated flutter, pixel, dissolve) paid off in final cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with altitude—short clauses thin as air, then lengthen into bow-stroke sentences. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or pressure. Metaphors stay coherent: “metallic exoskeleton” matches scaffold, not mixed. Information density high—one line can emplace setting, reveal emotion, foreshadow dissolve.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: wet-plate pixelation = musical resurrection; scaffold flutters = stave lines on a granite score. Risky lyric accumulation taught early and held to closure. Specificity irreversible—only this flake, this pullout, this fiddler could yield this bridge of air. No template echo; collapse-to-song arc feels inevitable yet unwritten.</comment>
