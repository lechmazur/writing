<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Kael’s tactile obsession with “sandpapering” remorse is viscerally embodied; the glove removal beat crystallizes her risk. Interiority stays concrete—no therapy-speak—yet the decade of stored grief is told, not dramatized, softening the contradiction that drives her. The final steady-handed walk-off earns renunciation cost, but the moment of assimilation is summarized rather than micro-chosen, muting the earned edge.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment> Accumulative / textural lens holds: tidal-pool pattern → pavilion dig → consommé of acceptance. Orientation is swift, the single shard obeys scope, and closure lands with Conceptual Repricing—gloves abandoned, dunes re-bury the emptied repository. Cost is legible in the evaporated salt stains, though the causal link between “tasting” and “neutralising millennia of regret” is asserted rather than staged, a hairline slip at the climax.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Limestone parapet, red squelching mud, frost-scented air—each sensory pick is filtered through Kael’s chef-perception and nudges her next move. The fortress’s post-rain brittleness directly pressures the excavation choice, while the coral-ice walls function as both setting and tool, constraining the assimilation beat. Micro-setting (her gloved/ungloved hands) charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—render stored remorse safe—is signaled early and intensifies when bare palms meet frozen coral, narrowing options to “absorb or flee.” One meaningful tightening suffices: the pavilion begins to digest her, forcing total surrender. Cost is felt as ice invades veins, yet the quantitative leap from personal grief-load to world-regret consommé slightly dilutes visceral stakes; still, agency and price remain on-page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of transmuting unprocessable guilt into palatable forgiveness emerges through culinary alchemy imagery, never declared. The tidal-pool blueprints and fossilised coral form a returning motif that reweights from map to finished dish, giving conceptual repricing without moralising. Subtext of contagious touch as both wound and cure lingers after the last line, inviting reflection while resisting tidy closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays tight to Kael’s synesthetic palate; syntax lengthens during absorption then clips at release, mirroring digestion. No dialogue = no penalty. Free-indirect diction (“flavor left topography”) remains within her professional lexicon; sparse filter verbs are voice-motivated. Distinct perceptual signature—taste-as-memory—carries through to the charged final image of steady, gloveless hands.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Rhythm breathes with action; no template cadence or synonym loops detected. Metaphors (“cathedral of coral and frost”, “glacier of guilt”) are few, patterned early, and pay off in closure. One mixed risk—“sandpaper rough memories” is tactile yet workshop-common—but fits her self-conception. Density stays high; every sentence advances image, motive, or external move, propelling to the final salt-stain note.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Memory-chef + emotional contagion + subterranean guilt-glacier fuses into a singular mythic yet culinary cosmology. The concept follows its implications—she literally cooks regret smooth—without late rule patches. Risky compression of epic scale into 750 words heightens stakes; payoff lands legibly. Fresh inflection: consommé of acceptance as closure image feels inevitable yet non-obvious.</comment>
