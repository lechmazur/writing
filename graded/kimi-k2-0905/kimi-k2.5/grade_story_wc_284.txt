<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elena’s contradictory drives—guilt over dead agents vs. need for repair—are dramatized in the pillbox hand-off; the embodied shudder in her gloved fingers shows cost. Marcus as secondary pressure forces the final renunciation, shifting their status from handler/asset to co-conspirators. Micro-choice hierarchy (surrender the last chip > preserve life) is legible and scaled to length. Missing 9-band only because interiority flirts with label-speak (“tired of being broken”) instead of pure embodiment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the arrow pressed into snow reconfigures both network and soul with visible forfeiture of her last secret. Causal chain (trail codes → recognition → mutual surrender → new codes) holds under a single continuous scene. Orientation anchor beats the 120-word mark cleanly; no lens ambiguity. Cost is unmistakable in the empty hands / mended soul paradox, satisfying 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The silver pillbox re-enters as micro-setting that constrains the final choice—its weight = judgment; mist-cold numbs fingers, limiting how precisely she can carve the arrow. Zephyr and undisturbed snow serve as both hiding place and writing surface, directly enabling the dead-drop rewrite. Sensory selectivity favors touch over sight, matching spy tradecraft priorities. Meets 9-gate by letting environment charge the final image, but spatial choreography between Elena and Marcus could be one notch sharper.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—redeem or remain condemned—tightens when she decides to vouchsafe the chip; option space narrows from escape to reconstruction. Pressure escalates via because/therefore: her trail lures Marcus → his presence risks exposure → joint coding becomes the only path. One credible loss: the chip itself, forfeited on-page. Cost is legible yet not persistent; no constraint shapes later tactics once surrendered, capping entry below 8.5.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of “shatter to remake” emerges through the microchip’s journey—weapon → apology → seed—never stated outright. Subtext lives in gesture: handing over the pillbox performs forgiveness louder than any apology. Final image of the inward arrow reweights earlier codes from tactical to spiritual without moralizing. Minor echo of “fix what’s broken” edges toward prompt-language but is absorbed into Marcus’s dialogue with sufficient character stake.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person lingers in Elena’s perceptual bias—meteorological precision, constellation mapping, spy-argot—“silver hush,” “zephyr,” “poison on servers” all fit burned-spy lexis. Syntax lengthens in calmer beats, shortens under hand-off pressure, showing rhythmic control. No dialogue contamination; Marcus’s three spoken lines carry subtext of shared history. Distinct texture sustained; meets 9- gate except for one filter verb cluster (“she understood that courage was…”) that dulls immediacy at climax.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Varied sentence openings, tactile verbs (“clung,” “tilt,” “carving”) keep momentum. No paraphrase loops; one mixed metaphor—“water was cold, but it was moving”—skates by as conceptual, not sensory, so forgiven. Information density high: pillbox as both heirloom and payload revealed in same breath. Artifacts do not touch closure; stays above 8.0.</comment>

<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Burned-spy trope is refreshed through the bespoke snow-code language and the pillbox-as-confessional device; constellation pattern personalizes tradecraft. Synthesis of winter-transition imagery with espionage redemption feels inevitable yet not overtly familiar. Risk taken in quiet, non-violent hand-off pays off via Charged Poise. Lacks one more unforeseeable inflection to breach 8.5.</comment>
