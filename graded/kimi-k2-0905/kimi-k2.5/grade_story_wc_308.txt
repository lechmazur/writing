<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Interiority is poetic but abstract; contradictory impulses are asserted rather than dramatized (“he needed to appraise its significance… anchor or anchor”). No embodied emotion beyond dust settling; the sole micro-choice is the final acceptance of stasis, which is declared, not visibly struggled toward. Earned stasis is asserted without prior causality showing why this moment costs him. Character remains a monolith of theme, not an individual under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: stillness becomes navigation, pulse finds rest, cost is the eternal burial itself. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of echo, dust, and bone layers reweights meaning rather than causal chain. Orientation is taught late but pays off—disorientation is the point—so Orientation Test waived. Pattern of birds→arrowhead→stillness is legible, though beat-to-beat linkage is more lyrical than because/therefore.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Micro-setting succeeds: the flint arrowhead’s warmth and the bone towers’ harmonic hum literally constrain the final stance. Sensory triage matches stillness—sound and touch dominate over visual. Canyon rules are learned through vibration, not exposition. Spatial grounding is maintained even in stasis by internal pulses and external bird vectors. Final image fuses body, tool, and environment into one charged landmark.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—navigation without moving—is declared early. Escalation is a single deepening: realization that stillness conducts the harmonic field. Cost is conceptual (eternal burial) rather than felt on-page; no live option is foreclosed mid-story. Pressure is atmospheric, not tactical; agency is acceptance rather than decision. Meets short-form requirement for one meaningful tightening but lacks visible price that alters tactics.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through accreted images: echo, dust, arrowhead, flock—all reweighted in final stasis. No explicit thesis; silence as fullest sound is shown via vibrating bone towers. Ambiguity is productive: reader must decide whether this is transcendence or fossilization. Final image offers non-literal answer—he becomes the compass—without moralizing. Wisdom is earned through centuries of particulars, not aphorism.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person lyric maintains distant, geological register appropriate to a man turning to stone. Syntax is long, sedimentary, mirroring layered dust; clauses pile like strata. Perceptual signature is cosmological—reads turbulence as language, calcium as archive. No head-hopping; POV distance stays constant. Compression (“the pulse left wandering”) taught early and remains legible. Final cadence modulates to quiet crystallization.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Beautiful but overwritten: metaphor density approaches every sentence (“robes… geological formation”; “air itself became a solid record”). Some vehicles clash—how does sound “layer upon itself until… solid”? Paraphrase loops (“dust of centuries settled into… dust of centuries”) and template cadence (“he had… he had…”) slow propulsion. High-pressure beats are poetic, not propulsive; information density is aesthetic rather than causal. Closure image survives the purple haze but artifacts touch final third.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Premise fuses Paleolithic tool, geologic time, and harmonic mysticism into fresh synthesis. Stillness-as-navigation reverses expected pilgrimage arc. Risk of static protagonist is embraced and thematized—landmark as destination. Specificity of “calcium towers built from every predator and prey” grounds the cosmic. Patterned elision (no names, no dialogue) feels inevitable, not gimmick. Could not swap elements without collapsing entire conceit.</comment>
