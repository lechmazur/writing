<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is textured—his fingers “tracing the rosette with expectantly resigned reverence” shows embodied contradiction. The three students remain typed by occupation/trauma label; only the miner’s daughter gets a micro-choice (omitting sharp notes) that visibly costs. Shared “traveled stillness” is asserted, not dramatized, so the ensemble shift feels lightweight. Closure earns a 7+ because the collective renunciation of noise is anchored in prior causality, even if secondary voices blur.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of deliberate absence taught early (“subtracting noise”) and tightened when each student damps a string. Closure is a Charged Poise—the braided silence reweights stakes without forced unity. Cost is legible in the refugee’s “humility rather than demand” and the miner’s daughter’s trembling omission. One causality hairline: we never see how the rosette’s geometry translates to playable technique, only that it “denotes the method.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Velvet library, autumn light, and zither belly create tactile micro-setting that constrains the lesson; spatial choreography holds as the instrument is positioned between three bodies. Sensory hierarchy favors touch and sound over visual catalog. The rosette recharges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate. Only minor slack: “velvet” is repeated enough to feel upholstered rather than lived-in.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—braiding hostile voices—signaled in paragraph one. Tightening occurs beat-by-beat as each player subtracts a note, foreclosing the option of assertion. Cost is visible in trembling hands and deliberate silence. Pressure plateaus rather than spikes because the outside war is kept off-page; escalation is tonal, not tactical.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the physics of silence: harmony as curated absence, not additive concord. Subtext resides in damped strings and the refugee’s interstitial voice—no sermon required. Final image of “spaces between sounds” reweights the rosette from ornament to ethical map. Avoids tidy moral by leaving the art “might still vanish,” yet the momentary repricing is undeniable.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Lyric third-person adheres to Elias’s perceptual filter: rosette as “portal,” resonance “like incense or memory.” Syntax lengthens under reverence, contracts during demonstration (“plucking a string and then damping another”). No head-hop; refugee’s humility is shown through action, not inner monologue. Register stays within an elder musician’s lexicon until one hiccup: “conceptual repricing” diction leaks in narration, not character.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Rhythm breathes with lesson tempo; sentence variety supports the incense-like hang of resonance. No paraphrase loops, but “velvet” and “autumn” recurrence edges toward motif fatigue. Figurative language is selective—each metaphor serves the subtractive philosophy. One filter-verb cluster (“seemed to pulse/hang/denote”) slightly cushions immediacy yet stays within lyrical许可.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Fresh angle: peace engineered through literal negative space in music, not negotiated clauses. Zither rosette as political blueprint feels specific to this valley. Risk is quiet—no battle scene, only silence—but coherence holds. Could swap war factions for any sectarian divide, so universality slightly dilutes freshness.</comment>
