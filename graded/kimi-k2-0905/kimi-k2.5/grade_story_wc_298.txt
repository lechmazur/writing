<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elias’s contradictory impulses—self-immolation vs. guardianship—are embodied in the same beats (kissing bark while roots pin him). Interiority is concrete, never clinical; “reckless idealist” is shown through trespass and barter, not label. Final endurance is earned: he bargains, is bound, accepts irrevocable cost. Flaw: sister’s laughter referenced but never sounded in flash or echo, so emotional hole feels generic, trimming the top.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration: roots fuse him into the orchard, reweighting grief from erasure to stewardship; cost is the lifetime immobility implied in “became part.” Causal chain holds—card return → descent → offer → binding—each because/therefore legible under dying amber half-light. One soft spot: the barter rule (swap destinies) is announced by texts, not dramatized beforehand, but the tree’s acceptance on-page pays the debt. Orientation is anchored by line 3, well under 120-word cap.</comment>

<comment>Foxfire fungus, pear roots laced through ribs, pale fruit—these are not postcards; they constrain every step (femur cracks beneath boot, moss muffles sound). Micro-setting of the burned card against bark becomes the altar where destiny is rewritten. Spatial choreography is clean: knees, wrists, forehead progress to full root binding. Environmental mirror is organic: amber glow = dying afternoon / eternal midnight = grief without exit.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—retrieve sister’s voice—faces visible tightening: each corridor eliminates retreat, roots foreclose escape, final binding seals forfeiture of his own future. One clear reversal: he enters believing trade possible, exits knowing “some destinies cannot be traded, only shared,” articulated as Conceptual Repricing with sap in his veins. Cost is persistent and on-page: “years” surrendered, mobility erased. Escalation is steady causal compression rather than multiple turns, sufficient for 700-word scope.</comment>

<comment>Theme emerges from action: grief as compost—what rots feeds what grows. No thesis lines; the return of the burned card and his absorption literalize the moral that denial can only be transmuted, not deleted. Final ash drunk by bark reweights every prior root image, achieving non-literal resonance. Complexity remains: he gains guardianship yet loses bodily freedom, refusing tidy uplift.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person hovers at lyric distance yet diction stays inside Elias’s sensorium—“grammar of grief,” “economics of souls.” Compression is patterned early (“warnings were merely punctuation…”) and holds to last line. Syntax lengthens under drug-like surrender, then snaps short at “became part,” mirroring physical binding. No head-hop, no filter-verb clutter; perceptual signature is his translation of bone into augury.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Strong propulsion: almost every sentence couples observation to consequence—“traced roots…promise kept too long.” Metaphors stay vegetal, coherent; occasional minor overlap (“promise kept too long” / “torn fabric of fate”) but never in closure zone. Opening and final lines bookend with root/card symmetry, no scaffolding. One paraphrase loop mid-story—“destiny…barter…trammel” restated—drops the decimal.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Orchard fed by skeletons is fresh, yet specifics push it further: pear fruit pale as bone, child’s jaw used as planting pot. Bargaining with vegetal afterlife via burned Tower card synthesizes necromancy and tarot without template residue. Transformation test fails if relocated—only these roots accept ash of selfburnt fate. Bold risk in binding POV inside tree pays off with Earned Stasis guardianship that feels inevitable yet unvisited in prior fiction.</comment>
