<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elias’s interior contradiction—scholarly duty vs. bodily possession—is dramatized in knuckles, lungs, trembling fingers; the kneeling micro-choice to arrange debris crystallizes his value hierarchy and costs him temporal sanity. The final renunciation (“not a curse but a communion”) is earned through the drowning sensorium that precedes it. No relationship crucible is required here; single-POV pressure sustains. Minor dip: “solemn weight…settled” is slightly abstract after such visceral embodiment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure delivers a resonant reconfiguration: the diary’s cipher is unlocked not by intellect but by embodied surrogacy and beach-semaphore, exposing graves and renaming archival work as corporeal sacrifice. Causal chain holds: diary-touch → retrocognitive trap → debris-arrangement → parley → truth surfacing. Orientation is anchored within 120 words (zeppelin deck, quartz dunes, 1963 bleed). Lens is Causal; every beat tightens Elias’s options until he pays with self-dissolution.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Obsidian shards, brass railing, salt-static clouds, floating-library shadow—each tactile item constrains action or mirrors stakes. The lagoon’s burbling up through sand at the end physically reconfigures the dune surface, charging the final image. Micro-setting (the journal’s brass-edged pages) doubles as psychic portal, directly shaping choices. Spatial choreography remains clean from air to sand to emerging water.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can Elias free the drowned voices without drowning himself?—is signaled on page 1 and tightens with each diary contact. The midpoint turn (he must descend and arrange debris) forecloses passive observation; the final recitation costs his grip on “temporal reality,” a felt price. Escalation is linear but sufficient for 700-word span: possession intensifies → task imposed → identities merge → truth expelled. No coincidence resolves the conflict; his bodily labor unlocks the cipher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges without dictation: archiving as corporeal, ethically consumptive act. The lagoon’s mirror-black refusal of reflection becomes the moral black-hole of erased history; Elias’s arranged spirals turn academic abstraction into somatic memorial. Final image—“sediment becoming stone”—offers conceptual repricing: memory must calcify in the archivist’s body. Ambiguity lingers: who next will be “brave enough to read the debris?”</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains tight psychic distance; perception narrows to salt-tasting clouds and “cold water through another man’s lungs,” voice-specific and unfiltered. Syntax lengthens during retrocognitive seizure, then fractures into imperative clauses (“He worked feverishly”) under release. No dialogue, so no voice contamination. One minor filter-verb cluster (“he saw…he saw…”) but compressed enough to read as stress strobe rather than drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Figurative layering is dense but patterned—mirror/lagoon, cipher/debris, sediment/stone—each recurs with reweighted meaning, satisfying the “taught early” clause. No mixed metaphors; physical logic holds (water cannot “reflect nothing” yet later “bubble upward,” but rule is retaught as supernatural bleed). One paraphrase loop (“arrange new debris…arranging beach debris”) knocks 0.2. Otherwise propulsion is high: noun-verb cores, minimal adjectives, sentences advance both image and causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Synthesis of psychic-archive noir with civil-rights ghost-story feels non-obvious and inevitable: the drowned semaphore converts beach trash into mnemonic code, collapsing historiography into séance. Risky second-person sensory hijack (“feeling the cold water through another man’s lungs”) pays off by making reader complicit. Premise commits fully—no safety exit via “it was all a dream.” Specific detail (violet ink, maritime spiral code) prevents generic haunting.</comment>
