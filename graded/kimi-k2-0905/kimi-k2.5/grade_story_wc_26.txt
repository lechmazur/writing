<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—desire to save hope vs. recognition that hope has already mutated into mourning—remains embodied and scene-locked; the micro-choice to re-edit rather than erase proves her hierarchy of values on the page with visible labor-cost. The final renunciation (she does not purge the shadow but tutors it into guardian form) arises from the prior causality of stone loops and is paid for by the night-long archival grind that leaves her “sitting back” in spent stillness. Flaws (obsessive comparison, dusk-vision that exposes her to unbearable twilight) directly shape tactics; no diagnostic label-speak intrudes. Voice reads singular, not archetype; her perceptual signature (“softly deliberate”) is shown via tactile control of crystalline vault controls, not told.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the shadow’s re-binding to preservation reweights the entire premise—hope is no longer static innocence but the capacity of loss itself to carry light; cost is the decades of dream-drain that cannot be undone, only re-looped. Causal linkage holds: because Elara maps the stone’s descent, therefore she intuits the shadow’s identity; because she risks re-editing, the looped footage offers the shadow a mirror, whereupon it lifts the stone. The 120-word orientation anchor is met at word 32 (“blooming library above clouds”). Lens (Hybrid leaning Accumulative) is taught by the iterative footage comparisons and holds without ambiguity at the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The river stone functions as micro-setting: its migration from child-hand to mud to levitation constrains every tactical beat Elara performs; the blooming library’s petal-shelves literally close around her, enacting protective hands that pressure her solitude. Sensory economy favors touch (smooth weight of stone) and luminous visual (starlight released from petals), mirroring the internal shift without overt symbolism. Spatial choreography is immaculate: twin projection screens, archival controls, closing petals track cleanly. Weather/twilight is not backdrop but causal—violet twilight bleeding through glass cues her recognition of the same boundary in the footage.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve the shape of hope—tightens when Elara realizes the shadow is not invader but metamorphosed hope itself; this deepening forecloses the option to delete or fight the shadow. One visible price: the night-long editorial labor that leaves her exhausted at dawn, starlight exhaled around her. Agency is cumulative/textural: each comparison adds density until the pattern break (shadow lifts stone) reweights stakes. No coincidence; escalation is driven by her iterative attention under pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges as the non-moral paradox: preservation demands embracing the very agent of loss; the stone’s looped journey reprises this without abstract statement. Subtext resides in silence—no spoken dialogue—and in the final image of shadow tracing a contour, wordlessly acknowledging its new role. No sermonizing; the last sentence offers charged poise, not moral. The reader leaves with the concrete after-effect that regret itself can be luminous, reconfiguring prior material.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited sustains Elara’s perceptual signature: selective attention to light-boundaries, petal-mechanics, stone tactility. Rhythmic control—“softly deliberate” iterated three times but each in action context—creates liturgical cadence that pays off when the shadow mimics the same tempo. No filter-verb clusters; verbs are strong (“exhaled,” “loomed,” “lifted”). Diction stays within her archival technician lexicon; no corporate register drift. Internal compression under stress shortens syntax exactly where pressure peaks (“She worked through the night…”).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances either footage logic or emotional charge. Metaphors are coherent: shadow elongating into wings respects dream-physics; no mixed vehicles. High density: one sentence often pairs physical action with conceptual pivot (“The shadow unbound finally bound itself…”). Final line echo of “softly deliberately” is earned callback, not template churn. Proofing clean: no typos, pronouns unambiguous.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: shareable dream-archives + dusk-noticer occupation + hope-as-metamorphic-shadow is non-obvious yet internally coherent. Risk in lyric repetition of “softly deliberate” pays off by becoming the shared rhythm between woman and shadow. River-stone motif avoids tokenism by constraining every editorial decision. Proximity check: no close echoes of well-known scenes. Conceptual integrity maintained—dream economy rules never broken.</comment>
