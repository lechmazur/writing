<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Maya’s interiority is richly embodied—her tidal-pool gaze, jade-handling, and final micro-choice to entrust the cicada all reveal contradictory impulses (stay/leave, chronicler/lover) without label-speak. The chronicler vocation isn’t occupational filler: it supplies the metaphoric lens that reweights the relationship stakes. Yet the narrator’s motives remain slightly under-embodied; “I don’t need an answer tonight” reads as generous concession rather than visible cost to him. Still, her flaws (margins-obsession, evasion) actively shape the final stalemate, meeting the 9+ quick test for earned, costly endurance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the jade cicada passed hand-to-hand crystallizes the new terms—pause, not rupture—with undeniable relational cost. Causal chain holds: because she chronicles transitions, because he accepts the tangential path, the gift-exchange forecloses immediate resolution while tightening future stakes. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) appear by line 30; no debt applied. Lens is Causal; every beat is linked by “because/therefore” pressure culminating in the final image where the object’s warmth literalizes the price of waiting.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The grotto isn’t backdrop; its star-cut basin literally frames the negotiation—reflections double characters, limestone edge becomes the decision ledge. Micro-setting (jade cicada) serves as portable environment that constrains the final gesture. Sensory economy favors touch and starlight over visual clutter, matching nocturnal intimacy. One spatial glitch: we never learn the narrator’s physical relation to the basin after initial “we stood,” yet the cicada hand-off re-anchors bodies at closure, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will she stay?—is signaled by line 3. Escalation is incremental but causal: each tangential riff (tide-pool death, cicada wings, salt crystals) raises the emotional tariff of her refusal to answer. The tightening is internal; no external antagonist, but the pool’s inevitable recession becomes proxy for time running out, forcing the gift-exchange as visible price. Agency is shared: his relinquishment of immediate answer and her conditional bequest together foreclose the path to tonight’s resolution.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of transition emerges from concrete particular—cicada/life-cycle, evaporating tide pool, jade warmth—not abstract thesis. Subtext flourishes in silence: the unanswered winter question lingers like salt crust. Final image reweights prior motifs: cicada returned but now “warm from her palm,” charging the pause with reciprocity. No moralizing line; the stars’ indifference supplies cosmic irony, achieving the 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>First-person singular is stable, modest, lyric-leaning; perceptual signature skewed to tactile and reflective, never ventriloquizing Maya’s interior. Diction stays within the narrator’s plausible lexicon (“scattered salt,” “barnacles on rock”). Rhythm modulates: longer sentences for grotto awe, clipped fragments at gift-exchange, mirroring emotional crest. No head-hop; no dialogue to distort voice; cicada’s glow stands in for speech, preserving voice cohesion.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Zero loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors; each figurative image (star-salt, mirror-pool, green heart) recurs with accrued meaning rather than decoration. Information density high: one sentence often layers setting, metaphor, and emotional pressure. Register never drifts into purple; “tidal-pool chronicler” is the most technical phrase and it’s justified. Closure line “the most honest transition period of all” risks thematic echo but is earned by prior concrete cycle imagery, barely slipping past artifact penalty.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: romance negotiation staged as ecological fieldwork, with grotto as intertidal zone between souls. Cicada-as-transition trope could feel familiar, but here it is physically handled, warmed, and exchanged, transforming abstraction into tactile stake. Risk of static stargazing is averted by the final micro-gesture. Not quite paradigm-shifting, yet the integration of vocation, object, and emotional stalemate feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
