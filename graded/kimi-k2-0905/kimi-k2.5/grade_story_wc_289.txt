<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—writing desire for others while stifling her own—anchors every beat; the twig-by-twig surrender of her self-exile is embodied in blistered fingers and the “phantom weight of pens.”  
The final hand-taking with Mara is earned because the installation has visibly cost her anonymity and 17 years of silence.  
Still, Mara appears only in the last 100 words; the relationship crucible is asserted more than dramatized, muting the full cost scale.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the nest-sculpture becomes a public heart, foreclosing ghostwriting solitude forever; cost is felt in the scattering of twigs and the lovers’ now-shared署名空白.  
Causal chain holds: storm → found nest → recognition → art → return → speech; no off-stage shortcuts.  
Orientation is crystal by line 30; only mild lens wobble mid-story when the drive briefly veers from causal to lyrical accumulation before re-anchoring.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lotus temple, stilts, silver-frothed pond, prism light after rain—each detail is filtered through Elara’s synesthetic craft mind and later repurposed as building material for the installation.  
The twig spiral operates as micro-setting that literally steers her descent and final art; environment constrains choice.  
Spatial choreography is flawless; no floating bodies or teleporting props.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will she break her lifelong silence?—is signaled on page 1 and tightens when she lifts the nest: “she could not write another letter for someone else.”  
Escalation is present but singular; once she begins weaving, pressure stays steady rather than compounding; no secondary obstacle or credible loss (time, materials, social risk) surfaces.  
Cost is paid narratively at the end; on-page escalation would punch higher with one mid-build setback.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme—art as externalized vulnerability—emerges through the parallel architecture of nest and love letter; no authorial thesis states it.  
The final image of twigs drifting back into the pond reweights the entire 17-year archive from private commodity to public compost, achieving Conceptual Repricing without a moral.  
Minor deduction for one near-prompt echo: “thread that connects all things” borders on thematic tagline.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays tightly fused to Elara’s perceptual warp: verbs like “vaulting,” “refracting,” “inevitably whimsical” are hers, not the narrator’s.  
Rhythmic control peaks under pressure—short clauses mimic breath as she weaves “tight at the center, expanding outward.”  
No head-hop, no filter-verb fog; every metaphor is legible and pattern-consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies from languid pond description to staccato nest-building; sentences open with changing parts of speech, avoiding template cadence.  
Figurative density is high but purposeful—each image (prismatic quiet, silver froth, speaking colors) recycles into the installation’s payoff.  
One mixed-metaphor watchspot: “architecture she used when building sentences” momentarily conflates syntax and carpentry, but context rescues it.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Premise—reclusive love-letter ghostwriter builds giant bird-nest to confess—feels fresh and thematically inevitable.  
Whimsy is risked but grounded in tactile procedure; the story never retreats into quirk for its own sake.  
Could swap names and still function, so not quite 9+, but specific sensory layering and dual metaphor (nest/letter) supply memorable inflection.</comment>
