<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elias is voiced as thoughtful and meditative, but interiority drifts into poetic abstraction (“geometry of shared mourning”) that reads like narrative voice, not his. No contradictory impulses play out in-scene; the poem recitations are ritual, not dilemma. The final tying of ribbon to four stones is a symbolic act, yet its cost (a choice forgone or risk taken) is not dramatized on his body or calendar. Grand-mother is only spectral presence; relationship pressure therefore inert.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Elias sees grief as connective mesh, reconfiguring his task from carving names to tracing links. Ribbon-as-measuring-tape motif is taught early and recurrent; causal chain (grandmother’s injunction → retrace grooves → tie ribbon) holds. Orientation clear within 120 words. However, escalation is textural, not causal: successive poem quotes accumulate mood but do not tighten stakes; no option is foreclosed or price exacted on Elias’s time, safety, or reputation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Greenhouse at dusk is vivid—humid glass, orchids, monarchs pulsing overhead—filtering through Elias’s attention to sound and breath. Limestone slab, chisel, and silk ribbon serve as micro-setting that physically guides his final gesture. Butterfly migration gives temporal edge yet never constrains a specific deadline or resource. Detail is selective but occasionally overwritten (“sun bled violet” plus “thundering calm” in same sentence), muting immediacy.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—discover the shape of collective grief—is declared early but remains conceptual; no concrete obstacle or ticking cost emerges. Mid-story deepening occurs when spectral grandmother orders “retrace the grief,” shifting method from cutting new stone to re-cutting old letters, a micro turn that symbolically links graves but alters no external risk. Stakes do not escalate further; butterflies depart without narrowing his options or exacting a price. Resolution is insight-only; tension plateaus rather than tightens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme of grief-as-network emerges implicitly through the ribbon web stretched across stones; poem trading ritual embodies continuity without authorial sermon. Final image—ribbon tying four graves—offers resonant reconfiguration rather than moral. Occasional abstract phrasing (“infinity of dimensions”) flirts with pseudo-profundity but is grounded by tactile stone-dust detail. Complexity acknowledged: grief is neither healed nor solved, only mapped.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Third-person lingers inside Elias’s sensory filter; perceptual signature favors hush, breath, and stonework rhythm. Syntax leans poetic—“thundering calm,” “trapped moonlight”—yet pattern is consistent; no register drift into academic diction. Dialogue limited to two short, stylized exchanges with specter; tone remains incantatory rather than spoken, justified by ritual frame. Free-indirect merges cleanly with descriptive lines; no head-hopping or filter-verb clutter.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Lyric cadence sustains momentum but recurrent “-ing” openings and stacked metaphors (“sun bled violet… thundering calm… trapped moonlight”) create minor purple density. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; information is dual-purpose. Occasional simultaneity glitch: “He picked up his mallet and began to retrace…” implies two actions when one is continuous. Otherwise syntax varied; paragraph cuts crisp; final sentence lands with satisfying sonic closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Fusion of grave-carving, spectral apprenticeship, and butterfly migration feels fresh; no evident genre template. Ribbon morphing from measuring tape to grief-network cable offers specific, irreversible transformation. Risk-taking in lyric accumulation is purposeful, taught early, paid off in final tying gesture. While poem recital motif is familiar, its application across steaming dinner plates then across silent graves supplies new inflection.</comment>
