<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Motivation—silent bellhop probing the cost of safety—remains single-track and intensifies through tactile rediscovery of the bolt/music. Interiority is sensory (“sparks beneath ice”) but occasionally drifts into abstract labels (“seraphically mundane”). The final renunciation lands because earlier beats dramatize the tug between rebellion and custodianship; the bolt hand-off crystallizes cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens taught early: silence layers like snow, each discovery thickens ideological weight. Orientation is swift; place, POV, covenant anchored well before 120 words. Closure is a Charged Poise—bolt re-sealed, silence chosen anew—cost felt in “frostbitten hope.” One minor causality slip: elders’ fear-pity reaction summarized rather than embodied, but it doesn’t breach the final reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Cobalt fortress, snow, rust-smudge stair, and brass bolt create a micro-setting that literally constrains movement and sound. Sensory triangulation—cold, muted color, metallic taste—mirrors internal thawing without overwriting. Spatial logic holds from refectory table to tower ascent. Bolt-as-setting satisfies 9+ gate by charging the final renunciation image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether to resurrect forbidden music—emerges with the bolt discovery and tightens at sheet-music reveal. Pressure grows accumulatively: each artifact ups ideological weight; elders’ shaken heads narrow options. Final stance crystallizes when he chooses custodial silence, forfeiting immediate rebellion. Cost is palpable, though secondary to thematic reweighting rather than external consequence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of safety vs. expression emerges through bolt/music contraband rather than explicit thesis. Final image re-prices silence from imposed cruelty to deliberate, communal patience—resonant without moralizing. Subtext in elders’ throat-tracing conveys unspoken lineage of fear. One soft echo: “unpardonable silence” borders on prompt-speak but recurs seldom enough to keep legitimacy.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person lyric voice sustains hushed consonants, long vowels, snow-muffle rhythm consistent with muteness. Perceptual signature—metal threads, iron weep, “seraphically mundane”—is distinct and POV-bound. No dialogue to distort register; narrative diction stays within bellhop’s sensate lexicon. Controlled psychic distance; no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>High density—lines perform double duty (action + atmospherics) with minimal scaffold. Figurative layering is purposeful until “seraphically mundane” appears twice, a minor loop. Mixed metaphors avoided; vehicles stay cold/metal/frost family. Clause rhythm modulates to avoid drumbeat; paragraph cuts tight. Two proof nits: “nerve regeneration after his latest fall” could anchor time cue sooner; “bolt rolling between healing palms” repeats prior tactile image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Post-plague muteness enforced by covenant is familiar territory; freshness lies in bellhop’s custodial turn—protecting silence for future song rather than shattering it now. Accumulated artifacts (bolt, sheet music) transform standard rebellion arc into stewardship arc, making the ending inevitable in hindsight. Specific lexicon of cobalt, frost, iron tears roots the concept vividly. Risk in lyric compression pays off without obscuring causality.</comment>
