<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Aurelia’s drive to recover lost words is vivid, but interiority blurs into lyric summary (“she believed…”) instead of dramatized contradiction. The leaves’ physical reaction supplies embodied cost, yet her one visible micro-choice—trusting Marcus—arrives already summarized. Earned stasis lands, but the missing beat of active temptation keeps her arc just shy of full causal integration.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the vault’s truth lets the leaves unfurl and reweights the city’s future. Causal linkage holds—map ➜ plates ➜ vault—each step narrowing options. A single lens (Accumulative/Textural) dominates and persists through the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The greenhouse’s dripping condensation, hydroponic forests, and metallic postal scraps are tactile, selective, and mirrored in Aurelia’s ink-stained fingers. Setting constrains the final choice: humidity corrodes the lock, forcing the plate-key gambit. Micro-setting (body/tool) charges closure as the leaves physically react to the vault’s air.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>One dominant stake—recover lost honesty—tightens when Marcus’s lie wilts the leaves, turning abstract goal into immediate bodily cost. The reversal is micro but sufficient: dishonesty now physically blocks progress. Final access to the vault forecloses the option to keep searching; cost is the perpetual burden of reading every grief.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the living leaves and unread letters: truth is a biosocial organism that dies without circulation. Subtext in Marcus’s wilt-triggered confession shows candor as literal survival tool. The ending’s image of thriving gold leaves reframes the city’s drought as moral rather than hydrological—resonant without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person poetic compresses without head-hop; perceptual signature filters through Aurelia’s calligrapher gaze—ink, gold, letter anatomy. Syntax lengthens in humid corridors, shortens at lock breach, mirroring breath control. No dialogue contamination; merchant diction stays terse against her ornate internal cadence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Rhythm breathes with corridor steam; clauses accrete like condensation, then snap clean at the vault door. Metaphors stay vegetal and postal, avoiding mixed vehicles. One scaffold: “words sent but never received in the collapse” restates prior clause; minor, doesn’t dull closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Bioluminescent lie-detecting hair leaves grafted onto epistolary archaeology feels inevitable, not quirky. The vault of unopened mail reframes post-apocalypse as archive of aborted reconciliations—fresh moral angle on drought narrative. Risk in merging botanical SF with mail-system noir pays off without violating internal logic.</comment>
