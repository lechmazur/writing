<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s reticence and preservative drive are consistent, but interiority stays abstract—“weathered innocence” is asserted, not embodied. No contradictory impulse is dramatized; the final placement of the crystal feels inevitable rather than a hard choice that costs her something we can feel. Micro-choices (pressing crystal to spine, raising it to lips) are atmospheric, not tactical. Meets baseline for arc but lacks the visible cost or internal split needed for 8+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the crystal left atop the moss-coated dictionary reweights the premise—language is now biologic, preservation is surrender. Cost is conceptual (she relinquishes voice), but not viscerally felt; the lens is Accumulative/Textural and holds. Orientation is swift; no因果 breaks. One cap: the tightening beat (crystal placement) is single, not compounded. Clean, but emotional cost remains oblique, holding it below 8.8.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Library is vividly sonically reflective; limestone echoes and dew percussion constrain Elara’s stealth and timing. Crystal-as-micro-setting recurs, charging the final image. Selective sensory hierarchy (spores > sight) mirrors POV biologist bias. Spatial choreography immaculate. No environment-forcing tactical change keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve meaning vs. accept organic mutation—signaled early. Pressure deepens as lichen overwrites “serenity/silence,” but escalation is atmospheric, not tactical; no narrowing options or resource lost. Accumulative lens tolerates this, yet absence of visible price or foreclosed path caps intensity. Sufficient tightening for length, but not urgent enough for 8+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme—language as living, decay as alphabet—emerges through fungal grammar and crystal refraction, never stated. Final image reconfigures preservation into collaboration without moralizing. Ambiguity is productive: salvation spelled in spores invites counter-readings. Could use one concrete human stake (a memory, a name) to sharpen cost, holding below 8.8.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person lyrical sustained; syntax elongates then compresses with breath of library. Diction stays within biologist lexicon; perceptual signature filters world through spore & sonic detail. No head-hop; psychic distance stable. One clause drifts toward editorial—“she understood now”—minor filter, not enough to nick 9.0.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm modulates; stacked metaphors are patterned early and earned by closure. No synonym loops or scaffold. Dew “percussion,” “mycelium cursive” are fresh yet precise. One mixed vehicle: “rainwater in a leaf’s cup” inside a crystal fracture momentarily blurs physics—minor, not at climax. Clean enough for 9-territory; micro metaphor slip keeps fractional guard.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Post-dictionary biosphere is fresh; merges conservation sci-fi with lyric essay. Growth-as-grammar feels inevitable, not gimmicky. Risky second-person plural “we” avoided; instead, scholar’s solitude becomes universal through fungal lingua. Specificity of chandelier crystal repurposed as sonic memory device is memorable inflection. No close echoes; transformation passes test.</comment>
