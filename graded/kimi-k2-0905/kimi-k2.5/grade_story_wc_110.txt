<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara’s contradictory impulses—guilt, loyalty, investigative hunger—are dramatized in continuous micro-gestures (tracing the groove, pocketing the lens). The final choice to confess is prepared by the embodied weight of the tickets and the shared silence with Julian; cost is felt in the cracked-foundation image she keeps. Interiority is concrete, but “transparency” is named a little too overtly, blunting full nuance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the lens transferred, the ticket retained, complicity acknowledged, no daylight yet. The rain-soaked forecourt crystallizes options—tomorrow’s reckoning is unspoken but unavoidable—and the cost is legible in the crack imagery and shared breath. Causal chain holds: because Mara decodes the doodles → confronts Julian → offers lens → mutual pact. No orientation debt; anchors clear by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mahogany ticket-groove, amber desk lamp, quartzite pavers vibrating with acoustic memory—details are filtered through Mara’s night registrar eye for wear and resonance. The lens and ticket serve as micro-setting objects that literally constrain next moves (decoding, offering). Weathered glass canopy drip becomes cathedral percussion, mirroring the shift from secrecy to exposed breath.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake: will complicity calcify or crack? Pressure escalates when decoding reveals Julian’s fear, not malice, forcing Mara to test her own cover-up. The meaningful tightening is the ticket exchange: mutual surveillance turned inward, options narrowed to tomorrow’s confession. Cost is legible—shared social/professional jeopardy—though the board’s power remains abstract.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of transparency emerges through tactile images (lens, wet stone, cracked foundation) rather than thesis. Final image of the registrar walking home with the lens reweights “focus” as moral reckoning, not optical trick. Subtext in silence and drip-language avoids explicit moral; ambiguity lingers in whether the board will crush them.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Mara’s perceptual signature: acoustic memory, velvet rope tension, loupe vision. Syntax flexes with breath-length clauses under forecourt resonance; no head-hopping. Julian’s voice is distinct in clipped defensive lines; Mara’s interior cadence is longer,雨水彙整成詩.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Rhythm mirrors dripping—sentence length varies, no template cadence. Information density high: one sentence can layer sensory, emotional, and symbolic work (“crystal whispering forecourt…after words become unnecessary”). Minor filter-verb cluster (“she understood now that transparency…”) but erased by immediacy of final image. No mixed metaphors; lens logic stays coherent.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fresh angle: using obsolete concert tickets + projector lens as forensic tools for institutional espionage. Specificity of registrar’s midnight rituals and acoustic pavers lifts the piece above standard whistle-blower tale. Risk taken in lyric ellipsis (“timeframe after words become unnecessary”) pays off in resonant hush closure. Could edge higher if board’s stake felt more concrete.</comment>
