<comment>Mira’s barefoot, awkwardly confident interiority is concrete—"toes curling against the grit" while she deciphers star maps. Her motivation evolves from cataloguing debris to catalysing continuity; the pulse she releases costs her the safety of anonymity and any return to mere observation. Micro-choices (pressing palms to stone, speaking deciphered words) are legible, grounded, and irreversible. Only the "meaning in the mess" epiphany edges toward template profundity, slightly softening the cost clarity.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Mira’s catalytic pulse reweights the rebellion’s future without declarative summation; cost is felt in her exposed stance "awkwardly tall among the ancient stones." Causal chain is lyric but traceable—star alignment → spoken trigger → pulse → new possibility. Orientation anchors within 120 words; no prop or knowledge teleporting. Lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of ruin/ancient persistence tightens until the cadence shift at dawn. Accumulation cap does not apply; closure untouched.</comment>

<comment>Spaceport repair bay is rendered through Mira’s barefoot haptics—"cold metal," "ozone and rain" taste—making the industrial ruin a tactile crucible. The stone circle functions as micro-setting that literally charges the final image; its subsonic hum alters her breath and tactics. Selective detail ("rusted hull plates," "fusion welders once repaired") roots scale without exposition dump. No spatial drift; skylight crack, gantries, and grit stay consistent and body-relative.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—ensure sacred pattern survives war—signals early and tightens when alignment and spoken words foreclose retreat. Escalation is Accumulative: hum density increases from teeth-rattle to visible shimmer; cost is the irreversible exposure of releasing the pulse. Agency is catalytic rather than combatant, fitting the lull context. No coincidence resolution; dawn timing is astronomical constant, not luck.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through stone/spaceport juxtaposition: systems collapse, patterns persist. No explicit moral; final image of "possible sky" reweights prior rubble. Opera glasses evolve from nostalgic curiosity to lens that ignites continuity; their charged reprise embodies theme. Subtextual silence—absent armies, sleeping guns—carries the political layer without slogans.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays strictly inside Mira’s perceptual filter—"vibration travel up her arms like a current seeking ground." Rhythm modulates from long lyrical cadences to clipped final等待, mirroring the intensifying hum. Diction remains within her stargazer lexicon; no sudden academic register. No dialogue, hence no voice contamination.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>High information density—each sentence layers sensory, emotional, and world data. Figurative language is disciplined: "cathedral of scaffolds" establishes scale then recedes. One paraphrase loop—"the hum intensified, becoming a thunderous serenity"—is forgivable at climax. No scaffold, no synonym churn; opening and closing lines anchor and resolve cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fusion of prehistoric stone circle inside off-world spaceport feels inevitable yet uncannily fresh. Barefoot stargazer wielding opera glasses as ritual lens reconfigures familiar rebellion tropes into quiet apocalypse-prevention. Risk—lyric accumulative structure instead of battle set-piece—heightens coherence. Transformation test fails if stones or glasses swapped; specificity is irreplaceable.</comment>
