<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s seventeen-year fixation and trembling arms give us embodied, high-stakes motive; the single-POV interiority stays concrete. No contradictory impulses are staged in scene—she climbs, places, sings without hesitation—so the “empathetically decisive” trait is asserted rather than dramatized through internal friction, keeping the score just below the 9-band gate.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The closure is a clean Decisive Change: the final clang locks the elevators in permanent solidarity, cost paid in her exhaustion and the irreversible mechanical covenant. Causal linkage holds throughout—weight descent → harmonic transmission → elevator arms move → talks resume—under a tight Accumulative lens that lands with audible finality.</comment>

<question>3</question><question>8.9</question><comment>Frost, rust, stained-glass orrery, and the brass weight’s scrape are selective, sensory, and steer action. The clock-tower micro-setting literally constrains the tactic (the weight’s calibrated drop must fit the escapement), satisfying the 9+ gate; only a hair of extra atmospheric repetition keeps it shy of 9.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reunite the valley or freeze in isolation—is signaled early and tightens when the weight’s descent becomes irreversible at midpoint. One meaningful escalation: the first answering steam-whistle tremor proves the harmonic tactic works, narrowing options to full commitment; cost is legible in the grinding gears and her spent voice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of linguistic reconciliation emerges from the polyphonic act, never sermonized. The final image of “harmonious chorus echoing across the reconciled valley” reweights the opening silence without moralizing, achieving Conceptual Repricing that feels earned rather than asserted.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Elara’s perceptual filter—starlight “borrowed,” weight “pulsing”—with rhythmic cadence that swells during the song. No head-hopping; voice modulation under pressure (soaring soprano against bass clang) is purposeful and coherent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and syntactic shape; information density is high without purple overload. One scaffold loop—“grain elevators… grain elevators talks”—repeats near-identical phrasing within two lines, a minor artifact that prevents 9.0.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fusing harmonic linguistics with mechanical diplomacy through buried copper pipes is a fresh synthesis; the premise commits fully and pays off in the locked-arm image. Risky lyric escalation could have collapsed into abstraction, yet specificity of dialects and steam-whistle harmonics keeps it grounded and memorable.</comment>
