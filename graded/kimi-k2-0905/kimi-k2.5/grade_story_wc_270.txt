<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mira’s contradictory impulses—reverence for tradition vs insurgent drive to evolve—are dramatized in the moment she lowers the amber; the plants’ telepathic chorus externalizes her interior split without label-speak. The final smile registers earned cost: she has permanently traded sealed safety for volatile co-creation. Micro-choices (tracing kite symbols, calibrating pool temperature) keep agency on the page. Grandmother label is never allowed to ossify into stereotype; fatigue in her knees and the thumbnail-sized embryo ground her in singular body.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the splitting amber and unfurling tendrils reconfigure “tradition” from stasis to adaptive pact, cost paid by the literal fracture of the pendant and the irreversible release. Accumulative lens holds: each sensory layer (steam, mineral gardens, kite script) deepens density until the final image crystallizes option shift. Causality remains intact—telepathic plant data stream motivates every move; no coincidences resolve the conflict. Orientation anchored by word 60 with “steaming terraces” and timeline “fifteen years after” keeps geography and chronology legible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Volcanic basin functions as micro-setting that supplies the precise thermal sequence needed to dissolve amber without killing embryo; failure would forfeit the pact. Sulfur-tolerant bacteria and mineralized kite tail are tactile, POV-filtered details that constrain decoding method. Hot-spring pool temperature is not backdrop but tool whose calibration determines success. Final image of tendrils turning toxic water into nursery recharges earlier “alien gardens” line, proving environment has been metabolized into plot.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“evolve tradition or preserve stasis”—tightens once: the decoded thermal sequence forces a now-or-never release with no rewind. Stakes stay personal and legible; no world-saving inflation. Cost is visible on-page: amber splits, pendant lost, Mira’s joints ache, plants’ lightning-chlorophyll feedback leaves her eyes watering. Pressure escalates under Accumulative lens via sensory density increase rather than causal reversals, sufficient for 800-word window.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges implicitly: evolution demands intentional rupture of preservationist amber. Kite script language of resistance reappears as living wood, reweighting “tradition” from artifact to collaborative process. No final moralizing; resonance carried by image of toxic springs becoming nursery. Subtext in fern-screams and moss-whispers keeps conflict biological rather than didactic.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Mira’s perceptual signature: mineral steam “tasted like lightning and chlorophyll,” a synesthetic idiom unique to her plant-telepathy. Syntax lengthens under heat stress, then fractures into short clauses at amber split, mirroring event. No head-hopping; plant voices remain external chorus, not POV intrusion. Register stays within her insurgent-engineer lexicon without academic drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose achieves high density: “minerals crystallizing into alien gardens” does world-building, stakes, and beauty in one stroke. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or choice. Metaphors stay coherent under volcanic logic—steam, resin, embryo, kite all share materiality. Occasional elevated diction (“conceptual repricing”) appears only in editor-voice, not Mira’s perception, so allowed.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Synthesis of insurgent botany, telepathic vegetation, and thermal decryption feels non-obvious yet inevitable. Kite-script repurposed by photosynthetic data-stream is fresh world-logic rather than ornament. Risk of eco-telepathy pays off by making plants co-authors of revolution. Specific detail (thumbnail-sized embryo, sulfur bacteria song) prevents concept from drifting into abstract eco-metaphor.</comment>
