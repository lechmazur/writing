<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Ash’s grief-driven hunt is visceral; the leaf discovery forces a credible, earned collapse of distance into presence. Interiority stays sensory—scent, vibration, taste—never abstract. The final lick crystallizes enduring love as a physical cost. Only the absence of a second on-page character keeps the relationship crucible from full pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens: each salvage-scent layer tightens the stake of “translate absence into presence.” The cylinder→riddle→leaf chain is a single, coherent escalation; the wax disk’s final vibration reconfigures meaning with unmistakable cost. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no因果 breaks. Closure is a Charged Poise: night/dawn riddle answered, distance collapsed, song still spinning.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Scrapyard as “praying skeletons” and the solar-panel grave are tactile, selective, and body-scaled. The leaf-in-wax micro-setting literally becomes the closure altar; its amber suspension mirrors Ash’s arrested grief. Iron wind and thermal groans act on action—pushing Ash toward the tin box. Every descriptor is filtered through canine priority: scent first, vision last.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—collapse kilometers of loss into centimeters of contact—tightens once: cylinder found → riddle read → leaf unearthed. No reversals needed; the accretive density of scent-memory raises cost at each pile. The final narrowing is ontological: night/dawn riddle forecloses the possibility that Mara is anywhere but under his tongue. Price is paid in exposed solitude when he sings alone.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the riddle’s answer: persistence of cycles (night/dawn, death/memory) rather than salvation. The leaf is not revival; it is proof that color can survive annihilation, reweighting the gray world. No moral is stated—only the song’s tinted revelation. Ambiguity lingers: is the song comfort or eternal mourning?</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person canine POV never slips; knowledge stays nose-bound, time measured in thermal wind cycles. Syntax lengthens during scent-tracking, shortens at discovery—prose as physiology. “Intuitively descriptive” is not told but enacted through groove-reading and copper-oxidation translation. No dialogue, so voice purity remains intact.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with Ash’s trot–sniff–freeze pattern; no two sentences open alike. Figurative layering is dense but always canine-sensory: “rust and regret” is smell-tasted, not metaphoric ornament. No loops, no scaffold; every clause adds scent data or emotional torque. Only a single mixed register spike—“cartography of the heart”—slips toward human idiom, quickly reined in.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Post-apocalyptic dog reads wax grooves to solve a riddle from a dead handler—fresh synthesis, not trope recombination. The groove-reading method is grounded in jawbone vibration, not magic. Risk: canine interiority could collapse into kitsch, yet it holds via sensory rigor. The autumn leaf as compressed forest collapses eco-catastrophe into one retrievable pixel—image that would fail if swapped.</comment>
