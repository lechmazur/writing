<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Maya’s contradictory loyalties are alive in every beat—badge on lapel, tokens under shirt, stone chip scoring paint—so the dual allegiance hurts. Interiority stays concrete: “thrum…through the rusted steel,” “hopeful desperation…like tide water.” The final smile-plus-adjustment shows earned renunciation: she’ll serve the future, not either master, with visible social cost. Still, no second on-page character pressures her, so relationship crucible and status dynamics bullets remain unused, capping the top band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure is a crisp Resonant Reconfiguration: the graffiti network is already spreading as corporate boats arrive, a charged poise that reweights the premise—privatize the rafts, not the carnival. Causal chain holds: because she刻 the stone-chip glyph, the juggler activates, teen photographs, community widens the loop; cost is the perpetual tightrope of translation she must now walk. Orientation is anchored within 120 words; lens (Causal) is stable. One micro-slip: “they would privatize the rafts, perhaps” momentarily softens certainty, nudging down from 8.8.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The raft city is tactile—damp rust, neon reflections, wet paint under fingernails—and every detail toggles choice: graffiti layers serve as clandestine bulletin board, flotation barrels as resonant drum. Sensory hierarchy obeys Maya’s translator gaze: she reads surfaces for hidden code. The perpetual-carnival rule set stays consistent and learned through action. The stone chip itself acts as micro-setting that charges the final image, meeting 9+ gate, but one stray adjective (“brassy and defiant”) edges toward telling, keeping it just below top band.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve communal soul before privatization—is signaled in paragraph one and tightens through the graffiti gambit: each new tag forecloses passivity. Maya’s agency drives escalation: she scores the pivotal map-glyph that turns random performers into insurgent cells. Cost is legible—she commits to permanent double agency, forever “adjusting her translator’s badge.” A hair more external push (one corporate drone noticing paint wetness) could have sharpened jeopardy, but pressure stays coherent under causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme—culture as living code that survives commodification—emerges through graffiti propagation rather than statement. The stone chip’s journey from relic to cryptographic key reweights memory as tactical future, a conceptual repricing threaded throughout. Subtext thrives in silent exchanges: juggler mid-toss alters rhythm, knife-thrower receives. Final smile invites reader to calculate ongoing risk, avoiding moral summary. One near-echo: “roots matter even when you floated” flirts with aphorism, barely softened by grandmother idiom.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays welded to Maya’s perceptual filter: “felt the thrum,” “her gut read the emotional currents,” syntax flexing under pressure (“rhythm felt frantic, a heartbeat before the scalpel”). No head-hopping; corporate diction (“underutilized verticality”) is explicitly their flyer, not narrator. Rhythm accelerates across the final paragraph without drumbeat monotony. Dialogue is absent by design; voice coherence survives.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Sentences carry double duty (paint chip scores glyph + reveals resolve) with natural cadence shifts. Metaphors are precise: “music…a heartbeat before the scalpel,” “graffiti…like barnacles.” No paraphrase loops or filter-verb stacks. One clause (“threatening and buoyant all at once”) momentarily abstracts tide water simile, a hair below seamless. Otherwise clean mechanics propel to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Floating-carnival gentrification is fresh, but the deeper spark is treating graffiti as blockchain: a decentralized ledger of communal ownership that corporations can’t parse. Stone-chip-as-cryptographic-key fuses memory and hacking in a way that feels inevitable once revealed. Specificity abounds—spiral=supplies, fractured mask=safe house—so concept cannot transplant unchanged. Risk in structure (no dialogue, single POV) pays off without obscuring stakes, meriting the upper band.</comment>
