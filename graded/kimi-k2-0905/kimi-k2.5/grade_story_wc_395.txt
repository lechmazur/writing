<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elara’s obsession with “where deleted files go” is vivid and specific, but her interiority slips into editorial summary (“she finally understood…”) instead of dramatized contradiction under pressure. No micro-choice visibly hurts her until the final broadcast, so the cost feels retrospective rather than earned in-scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands: the crew is alive, the lie exposed, the archive’s rule-set repriced. Causal chain holds—patch photo → numeric map → server raid—though the beat where she “broadcast the truth through recurring numbers” is elided; we’re told it worked rather than watching tactical risk.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>The velvet-backed patch, cooling racks mistaken for life-support, and snowing JPEGs ground us inside the machine. Spatial clarity wavers once: “quantum server core” is never located relative to her workstation, so the final confrontation feels slightly float-room.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—prove deletion is a lie—tightens when numbers turn into rescue coordinates, foreclosing her anonymity. Price is conceptual rather than visceral: she loses the comfort of corporate innocence, but the text doesn’t make her pay on-page (job loss, arrest) so cost stays abstract.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without slogans: digital “absence” is simply storage we refuse to acknowledge. The reprise of forgotten songs as life-support lullabies reweights the motif from nostalgia to ethical debt, achieving Conceptual Repricing without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is coder-poet: “flickering servers…digital snow” stays in her perceptual wheelhouse. Long sentences accumulate like cached data; occasional adjective stacks (“palpable void where connection had once existed”) edge toward purple but pattern holds through closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Strong rhythmic variety and information density; no loops or scaffold. One mixed metaphor (“tangible ghost haunting the machine”) and two near-simultaneous participle phrases dull clarity in the climax, keeping it from the 9-band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The missing-persons cold case resolving inside a deletion vault feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Risk—treating astronauts as corrupted packets—pays off; the concept could not survive a simple name-swap, proving transformation.</comment>
