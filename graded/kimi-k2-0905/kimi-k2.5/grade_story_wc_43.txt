<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elena’s interiority is concrete—her decisive micro-choice to take the vinyl shard anchors agency. The final image of Maya pressing the broken record to her heart shows embodied, contradictory emotion. Yet Elena’s own stakes feel instrumental rather than personally costly; the hymn never endangers her professional serenity, so the closure cost is vicarious.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the shard transferred from weapon to relic, father-daughter stance crystallized with undeniable cost. Causal chain is tight—Elena’s mundane hymn enables the lucid moment that permits the transfer. Accum/Textural lens holds: sensory density (ozone storm, IV clicks) reweights the stake without external plot turns.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Cloud-haven altitude is more than postcard: thin-air logistics shape the impossible rain-smell rising upward, charging the final image. Micro-setting of the shard pressed to papery skin constrains the goodbye gesture. Spatial choreography is clean—glass wall, bedside table, IV line tracked without drift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“execute a flawless goodbye”—is signaled early and tightens when the shard is surrendered. One meaningful deepening: scent of valley storm breaches the sterile altitude, forcing Maya’s hand from violence to need. Cost is legible in the jagged vinyl against dying flesh, but escalation is single-wave rather than compounded.</comment>

<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from fracture itself: beauty because broken cannot be mended. Subtext lives in gesture—Maya’s white knuckles relax only after Elena’s mundane liturgy re-weights the shard. Final image refuses forgiveness yet affirms shared esthetic of rupture, delivering resonance without moral tag.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Elena’s perceptual filter—selective attention to IV clicks, dust motes, ozone. Syntax lengthens and contracts with hymn cadence, creating rhythmic signature. No head-hop; distance stable. Register slips once (“conceptual repricing” diction) but recovers.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>High figurative density serves accumulative pattern; mixed metaphors avoided. One paraphrase loop—“pulsing stillness” repeated with variant phrasings—dulls final paragraph. Otherwise propulsion clean; no scaffold, no filter-verb clusters. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with morphine-metronome beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Premise—hospice suspended in clouds—risks gimmick yet justifies itself via upside-down rain scent. Broken vinyl as eucharistic fragment feels specific rather than stock. Risk taken: hymning linen creases could tip into twee but stays grounded by medical bluntness (“sunken chest”). Not transformative but fresh inflection.</comment>
