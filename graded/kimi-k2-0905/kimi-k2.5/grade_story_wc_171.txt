<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s pivot from cold strategist to reluctant planter is dramatized through the soil reveal and her steadying of knees; the scar she once ordered made visible keeps guilt embodied. The child’s sensory reply (“smells like rain”) crystallizes generational transfer without sentimentality. Interiority stays concrete: “weight of collateral damage broke her operatively gentle nature into something deliberate.” Only minor slip—general’s tremor feels reported rather than enacted—keeps it from 9+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the portable garden’s biological necessity reconfigures future options with undeniable conceptual cost. Causal chain holds—celestial window → ritual soil → intertwined roots → mutual survival—each beat tightening the noose of shared dependence. The Orientation Test is met by line 5. Persistent constraint (clipboard passed seasonally) shapes tactics beyond the page. Felt price is legible in Elara’s arthritic kneel and the general’s trembling seal.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Terrace micro-setting constrains every move: crumbling limestone forces careful footing, titanium braces glint as mute reminder of patched histories, clipboard slot limits planting depth. Wild orchids through mosaic cracks mirror civilian persistence; Jupiter-Saturn shadows literalize converging enmities. Weathered stone’s scent (“midsummer rain on ancient stone”) anchors the child’s first sensory contact with peace. Environment actively guides the final gesture—seals pressed into mixed soil, not parchment.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—end inherited hatred or keep planting graves—tightens when Elara exposes grave-soil instead of contracts, foreclosing symbolic peace and demanding agricultural interdependence. Mid-scene reversal: general’s laughter collapses into trembling seal, narrowing options from refusal to participation. Child’s thumbprint adds irreversible biological stake. Cost is visceral—ash-laced soil under fingernails, six-decade celestial clock—forcing mutual husbandry under threat of starvation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through recurring root/ash imagery: what grows from cremated soil must be co-tended or nobody eats. Final image reweights “flawed beauty” from architectural decay to shared sustenance without moralizing. Subtext in the prosthetic leg’s click—metal planted where flesh once rooted—echoes the planter box. Reader left pondering if botanical necessity can override memory; ambiguity earned, not asserted.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays tightly filtered through Elara’s strategist gaze: “operatively gentle,” “fragile architecture,” “biological necessity” diction mirrors her tactical mind. Rhythm slows to planetary cadence, then fractures with the general’s bitter laugh—intentional modulation. No head-hopping; child’s voice surfaces as external datum Elara records. Compressed syntax under pressure (“She mustered her composure”) keeps momentum without dropping poetic texture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Sentences pull double duty: “boots grinding against limestone worn smooth by centuries of failed diplomacy” situates body, history, theme in one stroke. Metaphors stay coherent—celestial dance, shared shadows, intertwined roots—without mixed vehicles. Zero paraphrase loops; each clause adds new pressure or sensory layer. Final line cadence mirrors planetary drift, ear-tested aloud for weight.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Portable grave-garden as peace-enforcement mechanism feels non-obvious yet inevitable; swaps signed parchment for living collateral. Merges agrarian sf with ritual diplomacy without genre scaffolding. Celestial window repurposed from omen to deadline, transforming astronomy into political leverage. Specificity of wheat/barley strains tied to opposing terrains prevents generic swap-out, cementing freshness.</comment>
