<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elara’s guilt is palpable and embodied, but the younger self remains a mute projection; the shoulder-touch lands as tenderness rather than a crucible that forces a visible choice or cost on the page. The final “harmony” is asserted, not dramatized through a renunciation or new risk, so the emotional arc feels resolved by fiat rather than earned contradiction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Causal chain holds: letters → temporal breach → amber anchor → shoulder-touch collapses regret. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—time folds, the younger self turns, guilt is repriced—yet the cost is conceptual (timeline rewrites) rather than a tangible loss shown on the page, keeping it just shy of 9-band punch.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The glass dome, cedar cabinet, and insect-amber are tactile, odor-rich, and integrated into action; the amber’s geological weight literally anchors the temporal tether, satisfying the 9+ constraint test. Spatial tracking stays clean despite timeline overlays, though “quantum equipment” remains a generic placeholder amid otherwise sharp micro-setting.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—silencing twenty-year guilt—tightens when the firmware wails and letters force confrontation. The meteor-hush pressure peak is lyric, not causal, yet the protagonist’s agency to punch through time is explicit; the absence of a visible personal price (memory loss, bodily toll) keeps escalation from cresting into 8.8+ territory.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Theme of auditory preservation as penance emerges through lost birdsong, baby cries, and haunted firmware; forgiveness is shown via the softened cry rhythm rather than stated. The final reweighting—guilt resolved by retroactive embrace—avoids moralizing, though the concept’s cosmic scale slightly dilutes intimate emotional cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Voice is lush, lyrical, and consistent—constellation needles, fossil sunlight, retinal flickers—without purple overload; perceptual signature is scientifically poetic. Syntax modulates under pressure, compressing during the meteor hush, then widening for the shoulder-touch; no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty (density + atmosphere), rhythm breathes with beats, and no paraphrase loops or scaffolding intrude. Occasional metaphor stacking (“terrible meteor hush… heavy origami”) flirts with overwriting but stays patterned and paid off; closure image remains crisp.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fresh fusion of extinct-sound archiving, tattoo cartography, and retroactive motherhood; temporal mechanics hinge on amber and firmware rather than generic portals. Risky lyric compression succeeds, turning baby cries into forgiveness frequencies—yet the concept’s audacity slightly outruns the on-page cost, keeping it just below 9.0.</comment>
