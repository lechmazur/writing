<comment>Kaelen’s shift from militant to tender custodian is embodied in micro-choices: tracing fissures, refusing to veil mirrors, finally covering them in modesty. The contradiction between his revolutionary past and new “archaeology of forgiveness” is held in scene, not abstract labels. Cost is palpable when he weeps while time streams past the shard—an earned stasis that forecloses further conquest. Interiority stays concrete, though one brief “understood” moment edges toward convenient epiphany.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the shard rewrites the asteroid from fortress to sanctuary and Kaelen from fighter to elegist, with sorrow as visible price. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each storm cycle and mirrored refusal layers density until the final mirror-covering crystallizes meaning. Causality is internal but coherent: shard → new reading → public stance → private ritual. No orientation debt; anchors (who/where/when) settle within first 100 words.</comment>

<comment>Baroque asteroid is lived-in: gravity wells pool amber time, chapel dome fissures guide fingertips, mirrors act as temporal valves. Crystal shard functions as micro-setting that constrains final choice—its singing edge literally redirects visible time. Sensory hierarchy mirrors Kaelen’s poetic bent: sight and sound dominate, touch carries risk. Spatial choreography clean across three storm cycles; no floating rooms.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—whose narrative of the past will prevail—tightens when Kaelen hazards madness by uncovering mirrors to test his counter-theory. One decisive deepening: shard reveals apology, not domination, forcing public rebuttal to Voss and private ritual change. Cost is credible—social credibility spent, internal grief unleashed. No external antagonist needed; pressure is epistemic and moral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: witness over conquest, elegy over manifesto. Final image—covered mirrors honoring invisible wounded time—offers non-literal answer to dispute without moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture (turning mirrors away) and object (shattered vase as confession). No thematic echo violations; insight stays rooted in shard-handling and storm exposure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited maintains consistent poetic distance, lexicon rich but never exceeds Kaelen’s educated diction. Rhythm swells and contracts with storm tempo; long sentences mimic time’s viscous flow, fragments mark lightning strikes. No head-hopping; perceptual signature filters every detail through ruin-haunted sensibility. One clause (“time pooled like amber wine”) skirts purple but earns its keep via return in closing honeyed stream.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Sentence variety high, scaffolding minimal; most lines carry double duty (image + pressure). One paraphrase loop—“visible time” repeated three beats in succession—deducts lightly. Metaphors stay coherent (amber, gilt, velvet) and physically grounded. Read-aloud rhythm propels without drumbeat; strong verbs (“sang,” “shattered,” “burnished”) replace modifiers.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fusion of baroque aesthetics with hard-SF visible time feels fresh; trope of ancient artifact reframed as apology vessel upends standard “control” narratives. Risk in lyric accumulative structure pays off: closure reconfigures entire asteroid purpose without exposition dump. Specificity—microscopic light-poetry, mirror modesty ritual—anchors universals of grief and restitution. Transformation test passed: story collapses if setting or shard replaced.</comment>
