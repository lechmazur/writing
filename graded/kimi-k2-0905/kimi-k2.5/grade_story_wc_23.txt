<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The navigator’s body-as-salvage, arrhythmic heart, and lunar-cognition are vividly embodied; her soldering of the censer foot is a micro-choice that externalizes the internal map. The “geography of loss” motive stays concrete through tactile beats, and the final palm-on-bronze moment crystallizes Earned Stasis with visible cost. Minor over-articulation (“navigate the geography of loss”) flirts with diagnostic label-speak but is saved by the immediate physical anchoring.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the station becomes an inward lighthouse, foreclosing external rescue under Accumulative/Textural lens. Each salvage step (censer locked, wire soldered, bronze thrumming) tightens the pattern; the final throb reweights earlier static into acknowledged grief. Causality holds without soft resets; the only marginal slip is the slightly late reveal that the midnight voice is no longer needed, but the prior circuitry work justifies her autonomy.</comment>

<comment>The rusted deck, frozen lantern at half-mast, and verdigris corrosion form a micro-setting that constrains her movements and supplies the only workable pivot point for the censer. Sensory selection favors metal taste and hydraulic groans over visual cataloguing, mirroring internal corrosion. Spatial choreography stays clean as she crawls, fits, and solders; the station’s transformation into ceremonial instrument charges the Earned Stasis image.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—map loss instead of flee it—tightens when lunar clarity allows the decisive solder; gibbous moon stabilizes cognition, narrowing options to “finish or forget.” No external antagonist needed; pressure is situational-coherent via failing hydraulics and thinning memory. Visible price: she forfeits outward rescue for inward beacon, cemented by bronze throb that matches arrhythmic heart.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the inversion of navigation: chart absence, not presence. The censer’s shift from prayer relic to compass pivot reweights ritual into personal cartography without moralizing. Final image offers conceptual repricing—loss as inhabitable country—whose cost is undeniable in the welded wires and solitary thrum.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice carries a scarred, salt-rusted texture: “skin grafted over titanium ribs,” “bell a wound opening in the dark.” Syntax lengthens under moonlight, contracts at new-moon disorientation, mirroring cognitive tide. No dialogue, so register stays consistent; perceptual signature is tactile-metallic, never generic. Filter verbs appear only when voice-motivated (“feeling the throb”), maintaining immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary from clausal cadences to hammered fragments (“Build the fulcrum.”), propelling the final ascent. Figurative density is high but patterned early (“starlit signal station,” “reverse migration”) so payoff feels earned, not overwrought. Zero paraphrase loops; each clause adds new pressure or sensory layer. Occasional elevated diction (“verdigris,” “meridian”) fits the navigator’s chart-maker lexicon.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The “reverse migration” conceit—walking toward drowned homes while waters rise inland—flips climate-fiction tropes into intimate elegy. Salvage-body as lighthouse engine synthesizes post-human imagery with raw grief without gimmickry. Conceptual risk (inward lighthouse) is fully committed to, culminating in a non-literal image that reconfigures prior static. Specificity of the censer foot’s ceremonial weight makes the invention feel inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
