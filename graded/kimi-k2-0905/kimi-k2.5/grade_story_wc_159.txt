<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The caretaker’s monastic drive—“to preserve the sound of forgotten names”—is embodied in every micro-gesture: the tap of cracked bamboo, the palm against vibrating crystal. Her contradictory ache (poisonous regret swallowed willingly) is dramatized, not labeled, and the final renunciation—continuing alone after the tube turns to dust—pays the cost her flaw demands. No other character appears, so status/relationship bullets are N/A; the interior arc alone is sufficient for the length.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: because the tube is cracked, therefore light blooms; because light blooms, therefore names survive a little longer. The single meaningful tightening occurs when the caretaker realizes the imperfection is the necessary lens; this reweights the stake from slow loss to momentary salvage. Closure is a Charged Poise: the dimming orchids still “hold the charge of remembrance,” crystallizing both victory and inevitable erosion. Cost is legible in the tube’s disintegration and the “quietly fatal” regret she cups in her chest.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The Opal Library is rendered through sensory triangulation—cloud-mist underfoot, violet-tasting air, prismatic stone shelving—each detail filtering the caretaker’s professional eye. The cracked bamboo tube functions as micro-setting: its fissure physically refracts sound into light, constraining the climax. Spatial choreography is flawless; we track her climb and descent without drift. Only the “museum of extinct feelings” risks abstraction, but it is immediately anchored in concrete exhibits (jars of tenderness, cabinets of rage), so the cap waiver applies.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve names against silence—is declared early and escalates once: the discovery that a broken tube can momentarily reverse entropy narrows her options to “use it now, lose it forever.” The price paid—tube turns to dust, regret ingested—makes the escalation irreversible. No antagonist is needed; entropy itself supplies coherent pressure. The turn is driven by her agency, not coincidence; luck only complicates through the accidental find, already completed before the scene begins.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the paradox of preservation through imperfection: only the cracked vessel can sing light into crystals. The foxglove-regret motif (beautiful toxin willingly drunk) reweights the ending without moralizing. No abstract thesis is stated; the final palm on the snow-child’s orchid silently asks what remembrance is worth if it poisons the keeper. The resonance is earned, not asserted.</question>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The prose carries a hush-frost cadence—“steps that barely stirred the cloud-mist,” “translucent blooms that stored phonetic vibrations”—mirroring the caretaker’s gentle systematic gait. Syntax lengthens during the luminous bloom, then shortens to dust-fall: rhythmic control heightens pressure without obscuring clarity. No dialogue appears; single-POV interiority remains consistent, never exceeding what a taciturn custodian could articulate. Filter verbs (“she understood,” “she felt”) are sparse and voice-motivated, not hedges.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sentence variety is organic, pivoting from soft sibilance to clipped fracture when the tube snaps. Mixed metaphors are avoided: “sonic illumination” is physically coherent within the invented physics. No paraphrase loops, scaffold, or synonym churn; each image advances state or stakes. Opening and closing lines act as tuning forks, vibrating the same thematic frequency without repetition.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The crystalline-orchid archive of extinct emotions is a fresh synthesis of memory-crystal and emotional-museum tropes, made specific through acoustic botany and sonic photosynthesis. Risk is taken in eschewing conflict with a human antagonist, yet entropy as pressure feels inevitable rather than gimmicky. The cracked-tube-as-lens twist is unforeseeable yet prepared by the architect’s sung blueprints. The concept is inseparable from this setting-voice; transplanting to another world would shatter the resonance.</comment>
