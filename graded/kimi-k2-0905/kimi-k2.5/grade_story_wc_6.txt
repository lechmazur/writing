<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied (“fire-claimed flesh,” “phantom pain”); the contradiction of firefighter/arson-daughter is always on.  Yet the decisive graft choice is driven by abstract hope (“teach her body to sing”) rather than a concrete, immediate cost or risk that narrows her options in-scene, so the final turn feels slightly under-motivated.</comment>

<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: kelp-and-coin ritual deepens pattern until closure reweights scars as “singing.”  The orientation anchor (who/where/when) is clear by 80 words, but the medical impossibility of kelp-to-skin graft is never flagged as surreal rule-shift; because the closure beat depends on that graft “taking,” the causality wobbles under literal reading.</comment>

<comment>Obsidian lagoon, black sand, and copper coin are rendered with tactile specificity and return in the final image where “scars finally sing in the language of tide,” directly charging Earned Stasis.  Spatial choreography is clean; the kelp thread and coin weight track without drift.  Micro-setting (anaesthetized wrist) constrains the graft action, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—prove scars can feel again—is signaled early and tightens once when the graft anchors.  Escalation is textural: kelp adherence → prickling return, a single deepening that reweights the stake.  Cost is present (“stubborn hope,” possible infection), but not sharpened into a visible forfeiture; it’s felt but could be more visceral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme of renewal-through-mercy emerges from kelp-coin ritual and volcanic sand burial without moralizing.  Final image of “singing scars” offers a resonant, non-literal CR that reweights fire legacy into oceanic grammar.  One minor echo: “fire reveals what remains” edges toward thesis-speak, but it’s embedded early enough to feel earned.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric voice maintains perceptual signature—“migration of clouds,” “kelp-drift peace”—that modulates from hush to tentative chord.  Syntax stretches but stays purposeful; no head-hopping.  Compression (“anaesthetized skin” as given) is taught by context and paid off in the prickling return, keeping psychic distance steady.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm is fluid; sentence lengths vary, no template cadence.  Dense figurative runs (“obsidian lagoon,” “silver silence”) risk purple tint, yet pattern is set early and never breaks closure clarity.  One paraphrase loop: “pressed the kelp graft harder… feeling the first prickling return of feeling” could compress, but momentum survives.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Fusing kelp to burn scars as DIY physiotherapy is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis of firefighter lore and oceanic myth.  Black sand, refugee coin, and volcanic glass cohere into an idiosyncratic ritual that would collapse if any element were swapped.  Risk-taking (medically impossible graft) is announced through lyric pattern, not gimmick, and charges the final image.</comment>
