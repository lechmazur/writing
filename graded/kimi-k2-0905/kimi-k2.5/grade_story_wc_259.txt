<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses glow in every beat: she trembles with “anguished joy,” dances violence-and-preservation, laughs-while-weeping.  Micro-choices—elbow-forehead-knee sequence, randomised gait—reveal a values hierarchy (truth > survival) with visible bruises from guardian near-misses.  Final renunciation of straight-line life is earned by the entire chaotic ingress, cost weighted by “atoms of nostalgia” still clinging like ash.  Only keeps her from low-9 band is slight rehearsal of the “perfection = poison” epiphany; interiority flirts with label-speak once.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: she staggers out carrying “the weight of what she had learned,” path turned into a “scribble of defiance,” option-set permanently reconfigured.  Causal chain holds—random motion → pagoda opens → data burns clean → she exits unpatterned—each because/therefore step intact.  Orientation clear by 90 words; no teleporting props.  Minor wobble: “seventeen years” backstory delivered in block but it tilts present stance (why she risks bones), so passes BRR test.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Archive environment actively constrains every tactic: bioluminescent dimming triggers pagoda arrival, obsidian walls hum catastrophe-feedback, floor grids dictate footfall chaos.  Micro-setting (saffron veil absorbing bronze dust) reappears in final image, sealing the cost on her person.  Sensory triad—touch (palm on wall), sight (violet fungi), sound (glass-in-silk chime)—is POV-filtered, never touristic.  Spatial choreography tracks cleanly through seven-tier pagoda, no impossible positions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“extract forbidden truth without being killed by pattern-detecting guardians”—signals in line 2 and escalates by tightening guardian proximity each time her gait steadies.  Mid-story reversal: random dance, originally survival tactic, becomes the only key that unlocks data core, fusing external & internal conflicts.  Visible price: veil coated in irreversible bronze dust, shoulders weighted by Empire’s suicide memories; tactics altered (she must keep walking home without repeating a step).  Could edge higher if a living antagonist forced one more adaptation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges entirely through concrete reversal: the Empire murdered itself with order, she resurrects truth with disorder.  Atoms of nostalgia shift from quaint memory-bits to corrosive ash-blessing, repricing chaos as cultural immune system without sermon.  Final image of “scribble of defiance” against straight lines gives non-literal answer to core question—perfection = death.  No tidy moral; ambiguity lingers in the ache of “grief bright as dawn.”</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person POV stays tight inside her perceptual filter: “vibrated in her teeth,” “golden fireflies,” syntax lengthens then fractures to mimic chaotic dance.  Rhythm control mirrors stress—compressed fragments during guardian scans, looping cadences during ritual dance, final steadying walk.  No head-hop; veil-as-recording-surface motif remains consistent.  Diction borders on ornate but never exceeds plausible historian-poet lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies sentence length and opening; one minor template run (“She… She… She…”) three-beat cadence is intentional ritual signal, paid off.  Figurative layering is dense but each metaphor (particles as suns, smiles that cracked faces) is internally coherent and advances knowledge or stakes.  Zero paraphrase loops, zero scaffolding.  Final clause knife/dawn/scribble lands clean, no mixed vehicles.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Premise flips the standard “archive heist”—break in with logic, break out with chaos—making unpredictability the literal key.  Nostalgia rendered as combustible data-dust feels novel yet inevitable in hindsight.  Structural risk (lyric dance as decryption) heightens meaning without obscuring clarity.  Specific historian wardrobe, Empire math-tyranny, and bronze pagoda could not be swapped into another setting without collapsing the story.</comment>
