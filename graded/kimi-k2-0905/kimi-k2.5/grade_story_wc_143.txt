<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elena’s interior contradiction—reverence versus complicity—is embodied in the shiver she hugs to the heating coils; the photo and rust-message are credible renunciations with visible cost. The “purposefully curious” trait is dramatized, not labeled, driving every micro-choice. No second character on stage, so relationship bullets N/A; solo arc is complete.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the captured dawn-image and oxidizing plaque make the loss irrevocable; cost is legible in the final “love letter written in oxidation.” Accumulative lens holds—density of light, shadow, and chemical bloom reweights the stake. Orientation anchored by line 3; no teleporting props; one meaningful tightening as sunlight triggers the shutter.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The helmet visor, spectrograph, and titanium plaque act as micro-settings that constrain choices; the summit’s thermal plunge dictates the endurance test. Detail is filtered through Elena’s professional eye—fusion-glass veins, regolith paste—never tourist catalog. Spatial choreography clean; camera, sand grain, and plaque track consistently. Environment directly shapes the final image, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—preserve the last pure record—tightens when sunlight arrives and crawlers wake; outlasting the night forecloses retreat with hypothermic cost. Escalation is accumulative: shadow pattern → chemical bloom → mechanical drills; each layer adds irreversible density. Protagonist agency drives every turn; coincidence absent. Cost visible in frozen breath and surrendered summit.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the oxidation of memory itself—archival impulse versus extraction—without sermon. The final “love letter no longer looked up” reweights the hourglass grain and photograph into epitaph. Ambiguity persists: witness may be futile, yet morally necessary. No thematic echo or moral abstract; resonance is imagistic and earned.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person POV remains tightly anchored to Elena’s perceptual signature—spectrograph readings, glove tactility, hypothermic fog. Syntax compresses under cold stress: “breath fogged… refused to retreat.” No head-hopping; diction stays within her scientific lexicon. Rhythm modulates from patient layering to shutter-click brevity at climax. Patterned elision (chemical formulae, sand grain fall) taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>High information density: one sentence fuses temperature, visor glare, and moral stance. No paraphrase loops; metaphors consistent—“cathedral of gold and obsidian” extends lighting effect without muddle. Read-aloud rhythm varies; paragraph cuts precise. Final clause “dawnlit melancholy” is earned compression, not purple. Zero artifacts in closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: crater inspector + chemical time-capsule + lunar dawn gives archival SF a elegiac tilt. Tropes transformed—corporate mining becomes memory mining; hourglass sand migrates from Greenwich to vacuum. Risk in hypothermic stillness pays off with resonant image. Proximity check: no echo of familiar lunar-set scenes; specificity of ferric bloom and irradiated plaque feels unique.</comment>
