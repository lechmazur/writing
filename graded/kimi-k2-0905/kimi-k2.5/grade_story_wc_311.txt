<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The reaper’s grief is embodied in concrete micro-choices—leaning the scythe aside, unfolding the atlas, reaching through ice. Interior contradiction is vivid: he both clings to and releases her by naming the monsters. The final renunciation—scythe becomes pen—pays off prior causality with felt cost. Only slip: “heartbroken” is named once in self-diagnosis rather than shown.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: naming the fears crystallizes them into new constellations, reweighting his eternal task. Causal chain holds—recordings → atlas → scattered light → named monuments → changed vocation. One transition (dusk→night) is legible. Cost is visible: atlas dissolves, intimacy remains untouchable. Could edge higher if the sacrificed astronomers’ dissolve had looped back to constrain his final choice.</comment>

<comment>Observatory operates as both physical and metaphysical space: cracked lens fractures sun into prisms that literally power the ritual. Brass telescope, wax cylinders, and scythe are tactile tools whose states track cleanly. Dust motes as micro-galaxies mirror interior scale without overt symbolism. Setting constrains the final act—light must angle through the dome for crystallization—satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—name the nameless grief or remain paralyzed—is signaled early and tightened once when the atlas ink rises into ice. Agency is renunciation-turned-creation: he chooses to witness rather than harvest, costing him his last relic. No false escalation; pressure coheres under Accumulative lens. Price is legible—atlas becomes stardust, intimacy stays unreachable—meeting 8+ threshold.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from specific paradox: giving geometry to sorrow keeps it alive yet navigable. Sea monsters shift from marginalia to monuments, reweighting the idea that form preserves rather than erases. Final image of new constellations offers non-literal answer: grief becomes map, not cage. No moralizing; resonance lingers in the angles spelling her name.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric-elevated yet consistent with an immortal reaper’s diction—“sun hemorrhage,” “kraken of interrupted future.” Rhythm swells under pressure: long clauses collapse into fragment “Stay.” Perceptual signature filters cosmos through bereavement—light is always “dying,” dust is “microscopic galaxies.” No head-hopping; distance holds.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence. Figurative density is high but patterned—light as blood, monsters as grief—paid off in crystallization. One mixed metaphor “distant intimacy of touching something… untouchable” is earned by emotional paradox. Zero loops or scaffold; momentum breathes with dusk→night arc.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses cosmic horror with elegiac romance: astronomers opt into starlight to defeat unnamed dread. Sea-monster atlas as dark-matter map feels non-obvious and inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric escalation succeeds because closure keeps stakes personal. Transformation test fails if reaper is swapped for generic mourner, confirming specificity.</comment>
