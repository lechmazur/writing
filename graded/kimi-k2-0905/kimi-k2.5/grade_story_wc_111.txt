<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses—lying to the garden, then atoning—are dramatized in concrete beats; the final renunciation (empty pouch) carries visible cost. Interiority is vivid and particular, though a trace of diagnostic self-labeling (“wisely pragmatic”) nicks the top band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the maze’s simultaneous blooming/withering reweights the premise that narrative, not probability, sustains life. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each marble placed thickens pattern until the final exhale. Causality is internally coherent, no orientation debt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The garden’s “blooming withering” and calcified fountain act as micro-setting that constrains every choice; the cracked marbles function as charged objects steering ritual. Sensory filtration is POV-true, thorns tasting of rusted copper. Spatial choreography remains clean inside the shifting maze.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Single dominant stake—proving the garden’s consciousness—tightens through each marble offering; the final dual-state image forces irreversible acceptance with felt cost. Agency is present in every lie/repair cycle. One meaningful deepening suffices; no false escalation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges inductively: survival demands negotiable truth, not statistical certainty. No moralizing; the fountain’s stasis flower offers resonant non-literal answer. Motifs (cracked marbles, chlorophyll currency) reweight at closure, integrating character arc and concept seamlessly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet disciplined, with patterned compression taught early (“probability dissolved into soil”) and paid off. Perceptual signature—botanist’s diction fused with numinous awe—remains stable. Syntax modulates with ritual cadence; no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>High information density; most sentences dual-load image and emotion. One mixed-metaphor cluster (“river deltas or veins of an ancient hand”) slightly blurs peak beat. No loops, scaffolds, or filter stacks; rhythm breathes with ritual pacing. Proofing clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Premise—measurable luck versus vegetative memory—feels fresh and fully committed to. The cracked-marble currency and chlorophyll metric are specific inventions that would break if swapped. Risky lyric structure coheres, turning necessary deception into moral botany without gimmickry.</comment>
