<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is concrete and embodied—her calloused thumb on the carved grooves, the weight of ash in her palms. The contradiction between grief’s vertigo and the chisel’s steady bite is held in scene, not summarized. Micro-choices (silencing the kettle, aligning the blank with skylight light) externalize the “harvesting lessons” motive. Loss of 0.3 because the lions remain off-page memory; their absence is told more than dramatized, muting the crucible effect that could have forced a costlier visible choice.</comment>

<comment>Accumulative lens: each stroke of the chisel thickens the pattern “here / gone / transformed.” The kettle’s rising whistle and the sliding rain droplets act like metronomic beats that tighten until the half-finished handle becomes the resonant reconfiguration—an Earned Stasis where grief is not solved but housed. Causality is interior and lyric yet legible: because the wood drank sawdust and roars, therefore it can now hold boiling water without burning. Cost is visible in the final image: unfinished handle + cooling tea = practical immortality paid for by permanent absence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The loft is rendered through tactile micro-setting: skylight droplets as “tiny clocks,” ash grain “running like the stripes she used to brush,” steam mixing with sawdust scent. These details constrain choices—she carves beneath the rain-lens light because that is the only illumination offered. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible object positions. Loses 0.1 because the circus tent exists only in memory; a single present-tense remnant (a claw-marked beam, a rope end) could have anchored the past physically.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake: convert absence into usable form. Pressure escalates via accumulative pattern—each droplet, each chisel bite adds density until the option of remaining purely grief-stricken is carved away. The tightening is conceptual but felt; the handle must be strong enough for future kettles, foreclosing the possibility of leaving the wood blank. Cost is conceptual yet undeniable: the handle will always be half-Viktor, half-Mara, never whole again.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the transitive property of woodworking: love = carving absence into function. No character utters the thesis; the subtext lives in gesture (thumb tracing grooves) and image (amber droplets magnifying grain). The final reweighting—grief as “furniture for the soul”—avails itself of CR: the social cost is that widowhood must now be lived through daily touch of the handle. Complexity is preserved; the lions’ wildness is neither romanticized nor condemned.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Mara’s perceptual filter: rain droplets as “crystallized time,” wood grain as “rivers and canyons.” Syntax lengthens under calm, fragments under chisel strike—“Here and gone.” No dialogue, so voice coherence is judged on interior diction alone; no register drift. The “rust-hued peace” idiom is repeated but earns its echo by modulating from bitter to resigned between first and last use.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Varied sentence openings; no template cadence. Information density high—“The ash wood carving blank sat heavy in her palms, its grain running like the stripes she used to brush on her husband's lions” does triple duty: haptic, backstory, simile. Figurative logic stays coherent; rain as lens/time is maintained without mixed metaphors. Zero paraphrase loops. Final paragraph lands on concrete nouns and strong verbs: “she set down her cup and picked up the chisel once more.”</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: circus-lion widow + woodworking grief ritual. The “here and gone” mantra is not novel, but its transformation into a kettle handle is. Risk taken by using lyric accumulative structure instead of causal plot pays off; closure remains legible. Transformation test passed: swap any other craft and the lion/roar/ash specificity collapses. Loses 0.5 because the skylight-as-clock idea edges toward familiar poetic trope.</comment>
