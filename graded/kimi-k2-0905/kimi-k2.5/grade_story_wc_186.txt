<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara’s retrocognitive gift is vividly embodied—her “mind catching backward echoes like a net gathering smoke”—and her solitary vigil is credibly obsessive. Yet the final ascent and prism-insertion feel slightly under-motivated: the text asserts “she understood with retrocognitive clarity” rather than letting us watch that clarity crystallize in a micro-choice that costs her something on the page. Interior contradiction is present but compressed into summary; the beat where she actually presses the prism home is not dramatized, so the cost is more declared than felt. Still, her perceptual signature is strong enough to lift the score into the low-7 band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the beacon’s gold threads stitch a new possibility across the wasteland, turning monument-of-loss into signal-of-return. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—star alignment, cracked prism, and Elara’s gift converge in one charged image whose cost is the release of generations of stored silence. The piece teaches its pattern early (coincidence as syntax) and lands a single tightening cadence at the Thornwheel moment. Orientation is anchored by word 80 (“glass humming pavilion stood alone on the crater's rim”), so no penalty applies.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The pavilion’s vibrating panes, “fractured” and “humming,” function as both environment and tool: their changing frequency mirrors Elara’s pulse and ultimately channels the beacon’s light. The broken crystal’s darkness-catching facet is a micro-setting that literally re-circuits the tower, so the object constrains the final action. Sensory selection is urgent—wind through “hollow bones of civilization”—and filtered through Elara’s engineer-heritage gaze. Spatial choreography is clean: rim → spiral climb → beacon heart, all tracked without drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prove pattern prevails over chaos—is signaled in paragraph 2 and tested by the once-every-84-years alignment. One meaningful tightening occurs when the star touches the spire and Elara must complete the circuit; the option to wait another lifetime is implicitly foreclosed. Cost is conceptual but legible: she trades the protective silence she has tended for the uncertain voice of a re-lit world. Under Accumulative/Textural lens the pressure intensifies via ascending hum and star-track, not because/therefore chains, satisfying the lens guardrail.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: the universe whispers in parallels, and hope is a seed that can root in broken soil. The thistle-down image at the end reweights the earlier “collecting coincidences like seeds,” turning abstract belief into tactile image without moralizing. Subtext resides in the prism’s fracture—preservation-through-damage—mirroring a civilization that must break to survive. No thematic echo is uttered; the final line lets the image do the work.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Elara’s perceptual register: “her mind catching backward echoes,” “pressure against her temples like physical thumbs.” Syntax grows shorter and more rhythmic as the star approaches—“She climbed… She positioned… She pressed”—mirroring pulse acceleration. No head-hopping or register drift; diction remains within her engineer-archivist lexicon. Distinct voice is sustained under pressure, meeting the 9+ quick test, but a few adjective stacks (“bruised twilight,” “ash and regression”) keep it just shy of the 8.8 gate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and musical—“light did not simply ignite; it unraveled outward in threads of gold”—yet avoids purple overload by keeping figurative language tied to the beacon’s function. No paraphrase loops or template cadence; sentence openings vary. One mixed metaphor (“shard of hush expanding outward until… hum surrendered”) is minor enough not to dull the closure image. Filter verbs are minimal; information is woven through action.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Post-collapse star-aligned beacon re-lighting is familiar terrain, but the retrocognitive custodian who reads coincidence as syntax feels specific and non-obvious. The prism’s intentional fracture as circuit-breaker is a fresh mechanical twist that reweights the trope of “broken relic.” Risk-taking—quiet lyric escalation rather than explosive battle—heightens coherence without gimmickry. Transformation test fails if names are swapped, because the specificity of Elara’s backward-seeing gift and the 84-year Thornwheel cycle are inseparable from this narrative DNA.</comment>
