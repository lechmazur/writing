<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—doubt as phosphorescent pulse—remains concrete and embodied throughout; her micro-choice to offer her skeptical light enacts the final reconfiguration. Yet the thunder-bearer’s sudden assertion that “your skepticism is the final component” feels externally delivered, not mined from prior shown stakes, slightly undercutting earned agency. Still, the taste-shift method consistently externalizes internal flux without label-speak, keeping emotional arc legible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the forest vote approves, her doubt becomes functional compass, cost felt in irrevocable role shift. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of taste/weather imagery tightens to final auroral charge. Orientation is taught early via sensory triangulation, satisfying 120-word anchor; no ambiguity at end. One minor strain: “transition” logic is spoken, not dramatized, but does not rupture causality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lavender bluff, tin ring, taste-weather—each micro-setting constrains perception and ultimately charges the final image when ring becomes compass. Selective sensory triage (thyme-ozone-copper-honey-salt) tracks Elara’s attention under pressure, never cataloguing. Spatial choreography across four bodies stays clean; weather trails offer positional cues. Environment evolves from stage to agent (forest vote) satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“will the forests let us keep the weather?”—is signaled early and deepens through sensory escalation. One meaningful tightening: forest election crescendo coincides with compass ring awakening, forcing Elara’s stance crystallization. Cost is conceptual but legible: she accepts irreversible guide-role. Pressure plateaus rather than spikes because antagonistic force (forest) remains off-page; still, atmospheric disturbance supplies coherent proxy.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of reluctant responsibility emerges through image-chain (doubt → compass) rather than statement. Final reweighting—skepticism as navigation—offers resonant non-literal answer. Ambiguity persists: no moral superiority of human or forest, inviting counter-readings. Only minor deduction for thunder-bearer’s line bordering thematic echo.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited adheres to Elara’s perceptual signature—synesthetic taste-weather diction, auroral color grammar—without head-hop. Rhythm mimics magnetic flutter: long lyrical sentences under aurora, staccato tastes under pressure. Compression (“terrestrially cosmic”) is taught early and paid off. Distinct voice never defaults to committee lyric.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentence openings diversify. Information density high—e.g., “root systems transmitting chemical ballots” fuses worldrule and stakes. OccasionalModifier stacks (“terrestrially cosmic in its ancient marriage…”) flirt with purple but pattern-taught and brief, not obscuring cause. No loops, scaffolds, or mixed metaphors near closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Synthesis of geomancy, synesthesia, and democratic botany feels specific and non-obvious; removal would collapse entire frame. Transformation test fails—plot could not survive relocation. Fresh inflection: doubt literalized as bioluminescent navigation device. Slight risk in lyric density pays off without clarity loss.</comment>
