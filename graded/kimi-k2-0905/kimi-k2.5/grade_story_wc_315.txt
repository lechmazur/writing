<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara’s embodied expertise and micro-choices under pressure are vivid; the muscle-memory buckle revision and readiness to leap anchor her arc. Interior contradiction is thin—no moment where instinct wars with doubt—so the watcher’s burden feels more assigned than wrestled with. Still, the final click conveys earned stewardship and residual fear, satisfying the cost test.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: static silence → visual contact → buckle tweak → canopy bloom → safe snap, each step tightening options. Orientation locks by line 5; the 17-minute clock supplies urgency and the closing image (warm metal) pays off the opening cold bite. Closure is decisive—trust preserved, risk paid—though the micro-fracture check is a hair under-motivated as the cause of the three-degree shift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Sequoia platform, stratospheric wind shear, and vapor acoustics are filtered through Elara’s professional gaze, constraining every adjustment. The buckle’s temperature flip (cold → warm) becomes the tactile signature of success. Spatial choreography is flawless; no floating bodies or phantom props. Environment is not merely backdrop but the resistance that shapes the final trajectory.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—keep Kael alive—signaled immediately and intensifies as the speck grows. Mid-air buckle revision constitutes the single meaningful tightening, trading release timing for safety; cost is visible in her bleeding palm and the later leap contingency. Pressure plateaus rather than doubles after the revision, nudging it short of the 8.8 band, but the legible price keeps escalation honest.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Trust as lived physics emerges through line tension, drag math, and the warm buckle payoff—no moral spoken. The silence-after-static motif reweights from isolation to shared relief without thematic announcement. Subtext stays in gesture and tool, though a hint more contradiction around the cost to Elara herself would deepen resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited clings to Elara’s perceptual filter: wind vibrations through boots, metallic tooth-cold, midnight math. Syntax lengthens during calculation, shortens during spot-sight—rhythmic mimicry of drop tempo. No head-hop; diction stays within her technician lexicon. Voice is distinct enough to risk a 9+ but one clause of elevated lyric ("mathematics made flesh") edges toward register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Information-dense without clog: each sentence advances calibration, sensory data, or emotional stake. Metaphors are spare and accurate—"void where the descent would happen," "canopy bloom." No loops, no filter-verb stacks. A single participle opener slips into simultaneity ("positioning herself...") yet the action order remains clear and the closure line lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The guardian-catcher / falling-belayer reversal freshens sky-diving tropes; genetically engineered sequoia lookout is new speculative hardware. Freshness arises from procedural intimacy rather than concept alone—salvaged glider-grid, micro-fracture torque, late-release calculus. Could transplant names but the embodied engineering arc would fracture, passing the transformation test. Risk is present yet modest, capping below 9.</comment>
