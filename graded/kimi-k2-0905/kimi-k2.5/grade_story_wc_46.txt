<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Interiority is lyrically specific, but the “star-fire”/“zephyr bloom” idiom drifts toward cosmic boilerplate; embodied contradiction is implied yet never crystallizes in a single forced micro-choice. The final kneel registers as emblematic acquiescence rather than a fresh, costly stance. Still, the seven-year patience and the refusal of flame keep motivation coherent.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds: each polished shard adds reflective density until the pearl forms a charged poise that reweights exile into stewardship. The spiral placement sequence is the causal spine; memories are cued by tactile glass, keeping reflection anchored. Closure image—the cooling pearl—carries undeniable conceptual cost: she forever forsakes ignition. Orientation is taught by mist and drip within 120 words; no penalty.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Serpentine grotto, mineral tears, and fern-starved crevices are filtered through gem-polisher’s gaze; every vapor curl responds to wrist motion, turning setting into tool. The ceiling cracks function as adjustable aperture, constraining angle calculations for the final shard. Micro-setting (frosted emerald fragment) charges the closing image when it becomes the pearl’s heart. Density never stalls momentum.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“share light without fire”—is signaled early; escalation is textural: each clarified fragment tightens the array’s potential until the pearl blooms. No external antagonist; pressure is her fear of relapse into conflagration. The final radiance forecloses pyrogenic return with visible serenity cost. One meaningful deepening satisfies short-form bar.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through iterative polishing: refraction over generation, humility over hubris. The sea-glass-to-pearl arc reweights “light” from destructive possession to reflective gift. No moralizing sentence distills the insight; the image of cool starlight pooling in shell-like curve does the work. Ambiguity lingers: will eternity of borrowed brilliance satisfy a former sun?</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person lyric maintains consistent psychic distance; diction (“mineral tears,” “zephyr bloom”) feels intrinsic to an ex-cosmic intelligence refining terrestrial vocabulary. Syntax lengthens during polishing beats, then compresses at starlight touch, rhythm mirroring breath. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk is zero. Perceptual signature—light as weight and silence—remains stable.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Figurative layering is high but patterned; mixed metaphors (“cathedral of stone and vapor,” “serpent coiled”) stay within geologic/organic field and payoff at pearl formation. No loops or scaffold; sentence variation propels. One density bump: “weigh it against the memory of star-fire” repeats conceptual weighing twice in three sentences, a hairline drag.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Fallen star learning prism-hood through lapidary penance feels fresh, yet echoes familiar redemption-of-fallen-angel arc. Specificity of tide-tumbled spacecraft glass and mist-responsive cavern keeps it from template drift. Risk is interiorized—no battles, no dialogue—but coherence justifies the quietness. Final pearl image offers non-obvious synthesis of penance and continuance.</comment>
