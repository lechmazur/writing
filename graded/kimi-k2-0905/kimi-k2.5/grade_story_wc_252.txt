<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara’s guarded heart and calloused self-concealment are embodied in tactile beats (hand on barnacles, cable release); the scrimshaw’s hum fuses interior ache to exterior action. One significant slip: “grace that had always been her truest weapon” is diagnostic label-speak mid-crisis, −0.4. Otherwise contradictory impulses—safety vs. surrender—co-exist in scene, and the final submersion costs her land-identity irrevocably.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: tide-images, treaty after-image, and bone-warmth layer until the island’s spectral fold reweights meaning. Closure is a Charged Poise—Elara surfaces sovereign, scrimshaw fused, dock life foreclosed; cost is the literal inability to return (she watches the island vanish). Orientation clear by line 4; no因果 breaks. One micro-loop: “grace that belied her station” echoes later “grace that had always been…” without new pressure, −0.2.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sublittoral fringe is lived-in—barnacle pylons, liquid-silver pools, barometric tug on joints; environment constrains the final choice (step-off timing set by tide). Spectral horizon fold charges the closing image. “Dock master’s payroll” is the only generic node; a tighter occupational detail would push higher. Meets 9+ gate: tide and terrain directly shape tactics and final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—answer the whale or stay moored—signaled in first 100 words. Tightening occurs as spectral fold appears and cable release becomes irreversible; cost is social death plus physical exile. Accumulative escalation via water-language density, pattern break at bone-fusion. No causal antagonist needed; pressure coherent under chosen lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of surrender-to-nature emerges through tidal imagery and treaty back-wash; no explicit thesis. Final image reweights “guard” into “sovereign vulnerability,” resonant without moral. Subtext in Mako’s combative tenderness and workers’ unlocking hearts enriches collective stakes. One near-tell: “freedom required embracing the terror…” could be implicit, −0.1.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lyric third-person intimate, diction tidal and salt-stained (“sublittoral,” “leviathans,” “bone calling to bone”). Rhythm swells and ebbs with surf tension; no head-hop. Filter verbs used sparingly and voice-motivated. Dialogue minimal but distinct: Mako’s combative tenderness vs. Elara’s unvoiced reply. Psychic distance tightens from wide mist to marrow-fuse.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Read-aloud cadence varied; sentence lengths mimic tide draw. High info density—each line layers sensory, emotional, world rule. Two adjacent “grace” phrases create minor paraphrase loop, −0.2. No mixed metaphors; figurative language stays marine-coherent. Opening and final lines anchor and recharge motif cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Post-Treaties dock-priests and whale-summoned vanishing island feel novel yet inevitable. Scrimshaw map-becomes-territory twist grows from established nautical lore. Risk-taking in lyric accumulative structure heightens mythic stakes without gimmick. Specificity of “binding treaties made violence impossible” grounds fantasia in political scar tissue.</comment>
