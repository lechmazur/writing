<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elias’s involuntary truth-telling is more label than lived contradiction; it never forces a costly micro-choice on the page. The only tangible cost is the Corporation’s displeasure, kept abstract. Interiority is evocative (“honey too thick to swallow”) yet drifts toward poetic self-exposition rather than embodied tension under pressure. Closure—handing the truth to the engineer—carries conceptual, not dramatized, cost; Earned Stasis is legible but not textured by prior on-page stakes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: riddle → recovered bee → revelation of dreaming drones → sealed box preserves wonder. Each step is legible, with a final Resonant Reconfiguration that reframes blackout as birth. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral, yet the city’s grinding tomorrow stays visible, satisfying closure under Causal lens. Only minor drag: the bee’s “harmonic resonance” moment borders convenient magic, not fully prepped.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>“Amber resin,” “clover and copper” air, and the tower’s ozone-soaked grille are sharply selective, filtering through Elias’s sensory bias. Micro-setting—the vibrating preserved bee—functions as both prop and metaphoric compass, guiding the final image. Spatial choreography is clean; no floating rooms. Minor over-reliance on nectar dusk as atmospheric shorthand, but it recharges in the final line, earning its keep.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</question><comment>Dominant stake—preserve the poetry of failure—arrives early; pressure tightens when Elias decides to speak truth and seal the box. Escalation is mostly conceptual rather than tactical; no live option is foreclosed on the page beyond tomorrow’s inevitable bureaucratic erasure. Cost is felt socially, not viscerally, keeping pressure within lyric bounds appropriate to length. Sufficient for short-form lyric escalation under Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme—beauty inside systemic collapse—emerges through concrete images (resin-coated stairs, dreaming bees) rather than assertion. The riddle’s redefinition from “charcoal” to “potential” offers a quiet Conceptual Repricing that lands without sermon. Final image of sealed box reweights the blackout as creative rupture; ambiguity between wonder and complicity lingers, satisfying complexity requirement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person free indirect style stays close to Elias’s synesthetic attention: “air tasted of clover and copper.” Diction remains within a tech-poet’s plausible lexicon. Rhythm modulates: longer cadences for dusk ascent, clipped fragments at reveal. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is consistent and charged. Only nit: corporate drones “learned to dream” edges into authorial flourish rather than character-bound perception.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies; few filters, no scaffold loops. Density is high—“liquid gold” metaphor stacked beside “burnt honey” in adjacent sentences—yet stays legible under lyric pressure. Mixed metaphor “honey too thick to swallow” for compulsion works because gustatory synesthesia is already licensed. Two near-paraphrases about “grinding regularity” and “mechanical efficiency” could compress, preventing a higher band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fusion of bee-hive algorithmic collapse with nectar dusk is fresh; trope of blackout becomes genesis, not apocalypse. Specificity—amber resin on boot soles, titanium thorax etchings—grounds the concept in sensory memory. Risk: lyric essayistic drift, but payoff in final sealed moment keeps it narrative. Slight thematic echo of “failure as art” is common in slipstream, yet idiosyncratic imagery resists full template charge.</comment>
