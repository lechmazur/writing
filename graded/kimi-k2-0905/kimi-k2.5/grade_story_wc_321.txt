<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias’s “resiliently positive” trait is shown through embodied action—whistling through hurricanes, steady radio calls—rather than label-speak. The empty hourglass functions as an extension of his perception, tilting in his palm to guide micro-choices under pressure. Internal contradiction is light; we see no moment where optimism collides with a credible urge to surrender, so the final “permanent transient” state feels more bestowed than wrestled for. Still, his consistent perceptual filter and the cost of eternal ferrying land as a believable Earned Stasis.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elias accepts endless limbo as the price for saving the passengers, the empty hourglass now “filled with ordinary dust”—a legible conceptual cost. Causal chain holds: radio tuning → starlight bridges → passenger merger → clocks re-align. The grotto’s rules are taught early through sensory cues (“memories floated like sediment”) and never contradicted. One minor micro-turn suffices at this length; no orientation debt or lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The spectral grotto is rendered through Elias’s body and tools: hourglass warm as skin, radio frequencies that match the cavern’s breathing. Constellations pulsing like jellyfish give a single vivid visual anchor that is later recharged when starlight knits into bridges. Spatial choreography remains clean as he moves through the vessel guiding passengers. Environment constrains tactics—without the radio’s harmonic match to Fibonacci spirals, convergence fails—meeting the 9+ gate for constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“merge timelines before infinite isolation”—is signaled by word 150 and tightened once: the child in the yellow coat must be made whole or the pattern collapses. Agency is continuous; every dial adjustment narrows probabilities and costs him permanent exile. No external antagonist is needed; the fracture itself supplies coherent pressure. Cost is visible in the final image: he radios coordinates that “no longer quite matched the charts,” foreclosing any return to ordinary reality.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: ferrying as metaphysical custodianship of unrealized futures. The hourglass’s shift from absent sand to ordinary dust reweights the premise—time is not mined from some cosmic reservoir but recycled from the mundane, a conceptual repricing paid on-page. No moral is stated; the final line’s quiet acceptance invites reflection on the cost of caretaking. Ambiguity is purposeful: we feel the ache of eternal transit without exposition.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elias’s perceptual signature: “horizon liquefied,” “glass warm as living skin.” Syntax lengthens during wonder, shortens during tuning—“He adjusted the dial slowly”—mirroring pulse. No head-hopping; when passengers exist in triplicate we see them only as he does. The lyric register risks purple but stays moored to tactile stimuli and radio mechanics, yielding a distinct rhythmic signature under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry dual duty: “starlight knitting into bridges” advances both image and causality. No loops or scaffold; each metaphor extends the maritime lexicon—tidal gasp, spectral grotto, sideways clocks—without contradiction. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line releases with resonant cadence. One mixed metaphor—“clocks run sideways” beside “loose rope”—is forgiven under accumulative lens where pattern trumps physics.</comment>

<comment>The sideways-clock fracture, empty hourglass, and maritime radio form a fresh constellation not seen in prior slipstream fare. Elias’s deckhand competence reframed as cosmic navigator feels inevitable yet surprising. Risky lyric compression is taught early and paid off at closure, heightening rather than obscuring meaning. The synthesis earns its +0.3 risk bonus.</comment>
