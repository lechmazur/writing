<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—yearning for tethered safety yet embracing severance—peaks in the knot-tying scene, earning a credible shift. Emotions are embodied through tactile handling of telescope & twine, avoiding label-speak. Micro-choice (aiming lens at “space between clouds”) crystallizes her renunciation with visible cost: she foregoes rescue for atmospheric witness. The arc lands as Earned Stasis; motivation tracks, though we never see her fight the balloon’s drift—she’s purely reactive.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the void “remembers,” the twine-archive trails into nothing, and we feel conceptual cost (she chooses drift over return). The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern holds from first cumulus catalog to final knot. No Orientation penalty: who/where/when clear by c. 80 words. One accumulation cap applies: reflective blocks edge ~22-25% but stay anchored to present stimuli; a single micro-cut would tighten.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Brass telescope functions as micro-setting, constraining final stance when she turns it from clouds to blank sky. Sky strata, gondola creak, and starlight dust are filtered through meteorologist bias—selective, goal-oriented, never touristic. Spatial choreography is clean; altitude felt via creak, frost, and dangling twine. Environment evolves causally: cable break → drift → dawn light shift, all tracked in real time.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prove that “empty spaces remember” after rupture—is signaled early and tightened once: she chooses archival knotting over signaling rescuers, narrowing outcome to conceptual proof. Agency visible; no coincidence resolves anything. Cost is conceptual, on-page: permanent exile from former “spooled” safety. No visible material loss (food, altitude control) is tracked, keeping score sub-8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from iterative pattern—cataloging clouds as emotions, then archiving absence—rather than explicit statement. Subtext resides in silent act of tying while rescue nears, implying art over survival. Final one-line log (“The void remembers…”) reweights premise without moralizing. Cloud-emotion taxonomy and negative-space concept interlock organically; resonance lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Perceptual signature is distinct: meteorological lexicon fused with private myth (“cirrus meant anticipation”). Syntax is lyrical yet controlled, cadence modulating with altitude height. No head-hopping, POV stable. Occasional elevated phrasing (“dusty starlight like a shroud”) edges toward poetic self-consciousness but remains internally consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm mostly varied; one run of three “she… then she…” constructions near the middle creates template cadence (-0.3). Metaphors are coherent; only one blend (“nerve endings seeking connection” atop frayed twine) slightly jostles physical logic. Density strong; few filter verbs. No artifacts in closure beat. Would tighten with one fewer adjectival cloud descriptors.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Frame—meteorologist adrift, knotting broken twine as weather-memoir—is non-obvious and memorable. Cloud-emotion taxonomy feels inevitable to character yet fresh to reader. Conceptual risk (lyric stillness in life-or-death height) pays off via charged poise. While “severed tether as freedom” carries familiar echoes, specific aviation detail and negative-space archive transform trope into singular vision.</comment>
