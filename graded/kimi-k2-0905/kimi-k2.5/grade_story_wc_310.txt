<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid ("stellar doubt gnawed"), coins-as-nodes externalize conflict, but the backwards-prophecy logic is accepted too smoothly—no micro-choice visibly wrestles with the paradox before the final dial-turn; cost is felt yet not personally scaled.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the universe unfolds because Elena’s adjustment propagates backward—cost is the permanent fossilization of her doubt. One causal jump (coins → distortion coefficient → phase lock) is legible under a Hybrid lens. Orientation is taught early by ambered deck and reversed grammar; no caps apply.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The ambered observatory deck doubles as micro-setting and constraint—its viscous surface traps coins and gauges their pattern, directly shaping her tuning decision. Sensory triage favors touch and temporal texture over visual catalog; hydrogen-line specificity grounds the physics without exposition dump.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—birth next expansion or eternal singularity—is signaled in paragraph one. Escalation is one-track: isolate prophecy frequency → coins reveal coefficient → final dial-turn; no reversals, but narrowing is coherent under Accumulative lens and the price (permanent amber exile) is legible.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges as the necessity of doubt as creative medium; the final reprise of warm coins reweights them from random relics to seed-currency of a newborn cosmos. No moralizing—meaning stays implicit in the backwards causal loop.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Voice is dense, lyric-technical, yet consistent—controlled nominal stacks ("parallax rails," "quantum echoes") mirror Elena’s precise fervor. No head-hopping; psychic distance stays tight to her perceptual filter. Patterned elision ("the method was clear now") is taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Rhythmic variety carries the lyric overload; only minor scaffold ("the method was clear now" repeats concept) and one mixed metaphor ("message in a shrinking ocean" beside amber resin) slightly dull the peak. Otherwise信息-dense without paraphrase loops.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Collapses big-crunch cosmology into tactile coin-casting; backwards-prophecy mechanic feels non-obvious and binds every beat. Risk in reversed causality pays off because closure beat remains legible and charged.</comment>
