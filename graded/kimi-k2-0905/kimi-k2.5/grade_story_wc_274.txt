<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara’s interior contradiction—oath vs revelation—governs every beat; trembling hands and throat tightness embody cost, and the final smile crystallizes her shift from guardian to liberator with earned cost. The 17-year backstory is efficiently anchored to the present choice, meeting BRR limits. No secondary character on page, so relationship bullets N/A.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: discovery → moral crisis → upload → alarm → held breath. Closure is a Charged Poise: “seeds” reweights the frozen archive, undeniable conceptual cost. Orientation achieved by word 88; no disorientation taught, but early anchoring suffices for this lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The sub-zero vault, frost breath, and ice-coated keys constrain every motion; the library itself becomes the final seedbed. Snowed-in exit adds persistent physical constraint. Detail is selective, sensory, and filtered through archivist priorities—no tourist catalog.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—truth vs complicity—tightens once: the upload irrevocably forecloses neutrality and triggers alarms. Price is legible in the blaring sirens and her waiting arrest. Single meaningful turn satisfies 600-word scope; escalation is causal under chosen lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Emergent theme: archived silence can become insurgent speech. No moralizing; the seeds image reweights earlier “frozen tombs” without thesis statement. Subtext of complicit bureaucracy vs moral imperative remains complex, unresolved—invites reflection.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Mara; perceptual signature—“dizzying quiet,” “blood like distant applause”—is consistent and character-specific. Rhythm swells from hushed description to staccato upload verbs, mirroring tension. No dialogue; voice remains distinct under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>High density: “crystalline suspension,” “dormant networks coughed to life” compress concept and image. No loops or scaffold; metaphors stay coherent. Variation in sentence length propels the upload beat. One mixed vehicle—“blood like distant applause”—but it clarifies disorientation and does not clutter closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Frozen-archive-as-activism is fresh; twin-insignia truce trope is inverted by archival exposure rather than chase thriller. Specificity of neural imprint cataloging and permafrost cables keeps the world particular. Risk-taking (quiet ending, single act) pays off via resonant seed image.</comment>
