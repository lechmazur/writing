<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elias’s “blank face” and performative narration are vivid, but his interior contradiction never sharpens into a decisive, costly choice; the traveler remains a passive mirror, so relationship-as-crucible pressure is muted. The final gift of the bird carries micro-cost, yet the beat is more symbol than felt stake-shift. Still, his hoarded-guilt Auditor past and stagey coping create a specific, memorable psyche.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the woman’s unmeasured exhale reweights the hush and the bird becomes breathable grief, cost legible in the splintered wood against her palm. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern of theatrical elevation tightening to quiet release. Orientation is swift; turbine shadows mark time from line 1. No causal break; one shard, single POV, default scope met.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The rotting porch, turbine shadows, and dried bouquet filter through Elias’s baroque perception, constraining his ritualized hospitality; the bouquet’s dust coats the woman’s fingers, charging the final moment. Micro-setting (birch stick, kettle) doubles as prop and emotional lever. Spatial choreography remains crisp in one continuous scene. Environment is inseparable from the stakes of relearning feeling.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—will the woman inhale sustenance or remain numb—tightens when Elias hands her the sharp-edged bird; risk of further hurt is felt. Escalation is textural: theatrical cadence deepens then drops to whisper, aerating grief without external opposition. Cost (splinter, unmeasured breath) is visible yet modest; pressure sufficient for 700-word frame but not piercing.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: mandated joy replaced by legitimate sorrow demands new ritual containers. Subtext lives in gesture—touching dusty lavender, exhaling without measure—never sermonized. Final image reframes whittling as “architecture of continuation,” a conceptual repricing that invites reflection without moral. Ambiguity between resurrection and crow is purposeful, not equivocal.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited clings to Elias’s ornate, pseudo-Shakespearean diction; perceptual signature is unmistakable—wind “chopping the afternoon into measured segments,” wood surrendering by “tender persuasion.” Rhythm modulates from public declamation to stage-whisper, mirroring the woman’s re-entry into felt life. No head-hopping; POV distance stable. Compression and elevated register are consistent, taught by line 2, paid off in final hush.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and syntactic shape; strong verbs propel motion. Figurative language is dense but patterned—turbine shadows as clock hands, wood as secret-keeper—coherent under Elias’s rococo lens. No mixed metaphors or loops. Minor filter-verb clusters (“she watched him shave”) do not stall momentum. Final line lands with crystalline clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Post-mandate emotional void narrated through domestic performance feels fresh; whittling as grief-aeration and theatrical tea-making transform familiar post-collapse tropes. Specificity of the Auditor who once hoarded sorrows in journals anchors the concept. Risk in elevated diction pays off by charging the final quiet. Could not swap setting or ritual without collapsing the story’s oxygen.</comment>
