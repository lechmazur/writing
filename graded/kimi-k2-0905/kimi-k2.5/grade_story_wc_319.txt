<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interior life is lush—“dimensionally homesick heart…welcoming new uncertainties like guests”—but contradiction stays reflective; no moment shows guardian choosing against a live alternative, only renouncing a summons never dramatized. Emotions are embodied in mist/breath/pendant, yet the sole micro-choice—curling around the oak while swallowing the call—lacks immediate stakes because birth-dimension threat is abstract. Renunciation lands as Charged Poise, satisfying arc, but cost is conceptual rather than felt, capping high-band entry.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: pendant reprise → mist absorption → inward architecture builds density reweighting “home” from answer to question. Closure is clean Charged Poise: final curl refuses召唤, reconfigures guardian as “native of the in-between.” Orientation firm by paragraph 2; transitions are lyric cadence shifts, legible. Cost is atmospheric, not tactical; persistent constraint (ache as hospitality) is declared, not dramatized—just sub-9 barrier.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Frozen garden is omnipresent: crystals thread ribs, mist pools behind eyes, setting literally becomes body. Environment constrains anatomy and perception, directly charging final image of inward-opening doors. Selective sensory triad—cold, hush, brass warmth—keeps economy. Spatial coherence maintained through footprint/paw duality; no geography drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake: stay undefined vs. return home. Pendant reappearance tightens choice; interiorizing garden deepens pattern, shifts value from escape to inhabitation. Escalation is accretive, not causal—each swallowing increases psychic density until refusal crystallizes. Cost is existential ambiguity; no external price or foreclosed tactic on page keeps score sub-8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme—uncertainty as hospitable space—emerges via recursive swallowing of landscape, never named outright. Pendant’s brass/obsidian duality and “boundaries of light” motif reconfigure from beacon to lamp of limbo. Final image of “keys to doors that opened inward” offers resonant non-literal answer. No moralizing, strong aftereffect.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lyric omniscient maintains fox-headed perceptual signature—ozone taste, licking chops, paw/boot prints. Syntax stretches into hypnotic parallelism (“interiorizing exteriors,” “hunting of possibilities”) that teaches pattern early and pays off in closure cadence. No head-hopping; psychic distance controlled. Filter verbs serve incantatory rhythm, justified.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>High information density: one sentence often does three jobs—image, metaphor, interior move. Rhythm modulates from long breathy clauses to staccato “She waited. But the waiting was active.” Figurative layering is patterned, not cluttered; vehicles stay consistent (mist, frost, light). Minor scaffold: “she had been waiting…she had fled…she remembered” cluster could trim, yet artifacts never touch closure beat.</comment>

<comment>Liminal librarian swallowing crystallized roses to terraform her own ribcage is fresh synthesis of portal-fantasy and body-horror pastoral. Concept commits fully: no safety exit, no hand-wave geometry. “Dimensionally homesick ache as hospitality” flips exile into chosen stance—inevitable once taught. Risk-taking elevates stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
