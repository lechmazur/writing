<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Maya’s mathematically exact interiority is vivid and consistent; her contradictory need for justice while carrying her father’s con-man ink charges every beat. The final micro-choice—three drops in the judge’s tea— crystallizes her hierarchy of values with visible cost. Father remains off-page, so relationship crucible is waived; Maya’s solo arc earns the 8-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: every beat obeys because/therefore logic from ink pot to 2:17 AM breach. Closure is a Charged Poise—Maya poised with the loaded needle, options re-weighted, cost legible in her sacrificed innocence. One transition (prep-room → server-room) is clean; orientation anchored by word 60. No causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Funeral-home micro-setting—chemical tanks, refrigeration hum, casket curtain—constrains stealth timing and supplies the death/vitality metaphor that charges the ending. Cobalt ink pot acts as portable setting-piece, its iridescent menace felt on the skin. Sensory hierarchy filtered through Maya’s exacting gaze; no white-room drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“mathematics of a fair trade”—tightens when the 2:17 timing error forces the final breach; option set narrows to complicity or abandonment. Cost is her moral absolutism liquefied along with the judge’s. One meaningful escalation beat suffices; coincidence (guard early) complicates rather than rescues.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the irony of using a dictator’s mind-melting tool to purchase democratic justice; no moral is stated. Final image of the shimmering needle reweights all prior “fairness” calculations into ambiguous complicity. Subtext operates through the ink’s moral stain transferred onto Maya.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited clings to Maya’s mathematical perceptual signature—numbers, trajectories, equilibrium—without head-hop. Syntax tightens under pressure: clauses shorten as breach moment arrives. No dialogue, so voice purity remains intact; diction stays within her lexicon of proofs and chemicals.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Sentences vary in length and rhythm; high-density lines carry simultaneous sensory and metaphorical load without purple drift. No loops or scaffold; “liquefied rigid thinking” returns only to reweight stakes. Figurative logic stays coherent—ink as both signature and solvent—through peak beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fusion of bureaucratic mind-control ink + asylum procedural + funeral-home stealth feels novel and inevitable. Conceptual risk—poisoning a judge for justice—pays off without moral safety-net. Specificity of iron-gall chemistry and border-patrol rotation pattern anchors freshness.</comment>
