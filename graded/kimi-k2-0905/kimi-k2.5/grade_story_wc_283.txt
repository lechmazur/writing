<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is concrete—her fingers moving among buttons, the whispered canyon echo—but the epiphany “time could be folded, not merely poured” is asserted rather than dramatized through contradictory micro-moments, so the final renunciation feels lightly earned. No second character appears, so relationship crucible is N/A; her agency satisfies the lens.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: upward-falling sand and reshaped cliffs reweight the prophecy with undeniable cost under the Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is anchored by word 50; the button-catalogue pattern is taught early and pays off when the jar shatters, reconfiguring meaning.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The amber warehouse, button mandala, and canyon echo function as micro-settings that constrain choice; the cliffs shift from “walls” to “wings” in the final image, directly charging the closure. Selective sensory detail (resin vaults, golden motes) is filtered through Elara’s professional attention without catalog bloat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prevent solstice collapse—is signaled early; escalation arrives via the tightening realization that buttons can remix prophecy, culminating in the visible price of the jar’s silence shattering and cliffs re-settling. Agency remains with Elara throughout; coincidence plays no role.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: endings are loose buttons awaiting new cloth. The final image of upward-falling sand offers a non-literal reweighting without moralizing; ambiguity lingers about what futures the reconfigured cliffs now support.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person POV stays tight to Elara; perceptual signature is steeped in tactile amber and harmonic resonance. Syntax grows more lyric under pressure—“sand fall upward for the first time”—without register drift; no head-hopping or filter-verb stacks.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Rhythm modulates from measured opening to compressed final cascade; sentences carry double duty (action + atmosphere). One mixed metaphor—“fossilized time pooled”—but clarity remains intact; no loops or scaffold in closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Hourglass-turner as seamstress of possibility fuses fresh occupation with familiar prophecy trope; button-as-memory mechanic is specific enough that swapping it would break causality. Risk in reversing gravity sand pays off by recharging the premise rather than gimmickry.</comment>
