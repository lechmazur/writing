<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Maren’s interior contradiction—control as blindness—is dramatized in the leaf-unclenching gesture; the 15-year regicide of data is the specific backstory that makes her renunciation cost real. Embodied emotion is precise: “roots cracking through concrete” is felt, not labeled. The final micro-choice—leaving the leaf pinned by wind, not will—earns her Earned Stasis with visible forfeiture of authority.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the linden leaf pressed to wet cedar by wind reweights her entire epistemic framework with undeniable conceptual cost; the greenhouse cathedral must fall. Causal linkage holds throughout—“because she clenched control, therefore she missed truth”—and the storm season persists as future constraint. No orientation debt; who/where/when anchored by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The mossy trellis is not backdrop but active teacher: its lattice gaps literally shape the bindweed’s survival path Maren finally heeds. Rain-slick cedar and soaked boots provide tactile friction that keeps the present grounded. The linden leaf itself functions as micro-setting, its bruised veins a map she can’t redraw; this object constrains her final release.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—her drive to catalog versus the need to surrender—tightens once when the leaf’s battered yet living veins contradict her nanosecond timetables. The meaningful turn is micro but decisive: she forgoes rebuilding with steel, chooses open trellises; storm season remains as persistent price that will test the new stance. Cost is legible on-page: 15 years of data now obsolete.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: knowledge through surrender, not capture. The linden leaf’s reprise—first as specimen, finally as green flag of surrender—reconfigures meaning without moralizing. No thematic echo; the final image is concrete, its conceptual repricing undeniable. Ambiguity lingers: will the nursery survive wildness?—yet the question is invited, not answered.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Maren’s perceptual filter; “circuitously sincere” is her diction, not the author’s. Syntax flexes with pressure—compressed clauses during storm, longer lyrical spans during revelation—without losing clarity. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk zero. The rhythmic repetition of “reluctant metamorphosis” is pattern-taught early and paid off in final line.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or pressure. Metaphors are disciplined—“viscous and electric” air, “something viscous and electric”—and never mixed. Information density high: one sentence often performs sensory anchoring, interior tilt, and foreshadowing (e.g., storm dripping carries weight of failed hypothesis). No scaffold sentences; final line cadence mirrors opening humidity, closing the sonic ring.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The botanist-who-must-unlearn-control is familiar, yet the inversion—wild vines teach the scientist—feels inevitable via tactile specifics: stamen angles, nanosecond timers versus bindweed spiral. Risk taken in lyric accumulative structure rather than causal plot; pattern taught early by rain-drops-as-data and paid off in leaf-release. No close echoes of famous scenes; the greenhouse-as-cathedral trope is refreshed by storm season’s brutal catechesis.</comment>
