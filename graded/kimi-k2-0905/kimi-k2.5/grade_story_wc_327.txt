<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The copper-veined storyteller’s quiet articulation under lethal pressure is embodied through micro-choices (whispering the myth, footfall harmonics) that foreclose her own voice with visible cost. Interior contradiction—preserve language vs. surrender her last breath of it—drives every beat. The renunciation at the end is earned: she trades her living utterance for resonant fossil, veins dimming in legible loss.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as charged poise: the diamond’s curse is redirected into the canyon, language converted to permanent texture-echo, storyteller left voiceless but successful. Causal chain (bird pattern → tonal key → sympathetic resonance → fracture → release) holds without gaps. Orientation anchored by word 40; no lens ambiguity. Cost is unmistakable—“her copper veins dimming in the twilight of the last word.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The bone-tower canyon is never backdrop; its acoustic topology dictates tactics—quiet articulation, footstep pitch, whispering-gallery placement. The flawed diamond’s temperature response and the calcified floor’s harmonics are sensory, selective, and action-integrated. Final image reweights the setting itself into the preserved lexicon, environment literally becoming language.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—save the language before the elder dies—is signaled early and tightens through audible countdown (“accelerated with each passing breath”). One meaningful escalation: she deciphers the bird cipher that converts bone texture to unlock tone, narrowing options from “find any key” to “speak the creation myth now or lose everything.” Price is her own voice, crystallized in the dimming veins.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: extinction can be transmuted into resonance, but only through self-sacrifice. The shift from “syllables dying across her lips” to “language lived on as resonance within the towers” reweights the premise—preservation costs the speaker. No moralizing; the final image of dimming copper offers ambiguous afterglow rather than triumph.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person POV stays tight to the storyteller’s sensorium; perceptual signature filters every detail through acoustic priority. Syntax lengthens under contemplation, compresses at fracture—“the diamond cracked… it sang”—mirroring tension. No head-hop; copper and bone metaphors remain in-character. Voice modulation tracks her draining vitality.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and stress; no template runs. Figurative language is selective—“trapped lightning,” “throat-like passage”—and never clogs the high-pressure fracture beat. Information density high: one clause often fuses sensory, emotional, and world data. Zero paraphrase loops or register drift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Acoustic necropolis, copper automaton, and phoneme-hoarding diamond synthesize into an inevitable, specific whole. The bird-cipher method and texture-to-sound translation feel non-obvious yet prepared by early cues. Risky lyrical compression pays off: closure is emotionally legible without conventional plot beats. Concept commits fully—no retreat into generic fantasy.</comment>
