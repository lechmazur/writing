<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Maya’s interiority is vivid and character-specific—her “ritual” of reading dust, her refusal to discard files, her pocketing of the button all embody her grief and emergent mission. The contradiction between bureaucratic duty and covert compassion is dramatized in micro-choices rather than told. Final endurance (compiling the mercy index) carries visible cost: she stays after hours, risks her job, accepts the ache. One slip: the instant leap from dust rings to full belief in a sergeant-saint feels slightly under-credentialed for a professional archivist, a hairline motivational bump.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the file room changes from mausoleum to “secret library,” reweighting Maya’s stance with undeniable conceptual cost—she now shoulders guardianship of strangers’ mercies. Causal chain holds: dust anomaly → open file → find button → trace pattern → compile index; each because/therefore tightens options under the Causal lens. Cost is legible in the final beat: “She carried the sergeant’s button…as a method,” a permanent debt she chooses. No orientation debt; anchors clear by line three.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The foster care file room is rendered through tactile hierarchy—dust gradients, brittle creases, manila monuments—each detail filtered by Maya’s archaeological gaze. Dust itself becomes a living ledger that constrains her search tactics and finally charges the closing image. Spatial choreography is immaculate: shelving, folders, button, camera, pocket all tracked without drift. Environment literally guides her choices, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—preserve evidence of kindness—surfaces by paragraph three and escalates via each unearthed button; every discovery forecloses the option to cull files, tightening her risk. One meaningful deepening: the realization that love can “outlast its own utility” crystallizes her stance and commits her to covert after-hours labor. Cost is visible on-page: overtime solitude, potential discipline, emotional fatigue. Agency remains hers throughout; coincidence (dust ring) only complicates, does not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme—mercy survives administrative death—emerges entirely through artifact and action, never sermonized. The returning dust image and button reprise reweight meaning at the end without moralizing. Final image reframes prior grief as “part of this larger fabric,” offering conceptual repricing rather than platitude. Ambiguity remains: we never learn if Maya’s archive will outlive her, keeping thematic tension alive.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person intimate sustains perceptual signature—Maya’s “geological” gaze, her finger tracing “gray film,” her pocketing metal “as method.” Syntax mirrors her slowed, reverent pace: long sentences for cataloguing, sudden fragments at discovery (“A single brass button”). No head-hopping; knowledge stays strictly bounded to her inference. Voice modulates under pressure—diction tightens from archival precision to tremulous hope without register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose density is high—each sentence layers archival act, sensory detail, and emotional charge. Figurative language is selective and paid off: dust as “strata” primes the closing “secret library” reconfiguration. No loops or scaffold; varied openings and paragraph lengths create organic rhythm. One minor strained metaphor—“fossilized creases”—but it does not touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Premise—orphan files reveal covert mercies via dust forensics—is fresh yet inevitable in hindsight. Specific detail (button, visitation log, brass oxidation) prevents generic “kindness in dark system” tropes. Risk lies in lyric stillness over action, but coherence under the Causal lens validates the choice. Transformation test passes: story collapses without foster archive, dust reading, and military button.</comment>
