<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elara’s calm curator persona is vivid, but her interior contradiction—why she stays, what the “masterpiece” costs her—never crystallizes in a single pressured choice; the final exit reads as scheduled rather than renounced. No moment forces her to risk or surrender anything tangible, so the arc is observational, not crucible-tested.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The accumulative lens is declared early and holds: each donated photograph thickens the communal spiral, tightening emotional density until the equinox display reconfigures the town’s self-image. Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration—Elara walks away, map case empty, leaving the living pattern behind—cost is visible in the emptied case and harvested field.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lavender stalks, rusted gates, and softening leather case are re-used tactile anchors; the climbing vines externalize elapsed time and charge the final frost-touched image. Spatial choreography stays clean across seasons; the field’s evolution from bloom to stubble directly parallels the town’s emotional reaping.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stake—collective healing—is signaled early and escalates as townspeople recognize bodily echoes in the arcs; pressure peaks when the spiral is publicly fixed, foreclosing anonymity. No visible price is exacted from Elara herself, so the tightening is communal, not personal, capping intensity at mid-band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through the geometry of shared grief becoming grace; no character verbalizes the moral. The final spiral image reweights earlier fragments without sermon, achieving Conceptual Repricing: the town now sees itself as ongoing story, not ruin.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric distance stays stable, with perceptual signature—arc-seeking, scent-memory, hush—consistent throughout. Sentence rhythm modulates from long, vine-like clauses to the clipped final departure, mirroring the seasonal turn.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet breathable; no loops or mixed metaphors. Selective detail—“dove gray map case against her hip,” “spiral that drew the eye inward then outward”—carries double duty, advancing both image and emotion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>The “puzzle archivist” trope is refreshed by the black-and-white arc method and the communal而非private payoff. Risk is moderate—quiet lyric escalation rather than twist—but the synthesis of geometry, grief, and lavender feels particular to this text.</comment>
