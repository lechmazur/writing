<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias’s contradictory impulses—empathic hunger vs reclusive terror—are dramatized in the single beat of unlatching the door; the embodied cost (he “settles deeper into his shadows,” forfeiting any future claim to the invitation) makes the renunciation legible. Interiority is concrete until the closing clause “infinitely connected,” which slips toward label-speak, shaving the top band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the invitation’s relocation reweights the premise (error becomes doorway) and Elias’s solitude is now elective, not imposed. Causal chain holds—because he once received a mis-addressed letter he now repeats the error—though the moment the woman reads is summarized, not shown, keeping it just shy of 9+.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The library-as-character constrains every move: marble absorbs sound, shadows swallow bodies, the peephole dictates distance. The crumpled paper and crystal weight function as micro-setting that literally props the door open, charging the final image under the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“stay hidden vs answer loneliness”—tightens once: he shifts from bolted to unlatched. The price is legible (he forfeits the invitation and any future claim to exit), satisfying the single meaningful deepening required for short form.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the repeating error pattern rather than assertion: mis-delivery becomes mercy. The final silence between seeker and hidden keeper lets paradox resonate without moralizing, landing a resonant reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-limited voice is steady, syntactically calm, Latinate diction mirroring Elias’s cloistered scholastic lean. One clause of therapeutic abstraction (“infinitely connected”) momentarily softens the texture, stopping just short of 9+.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Rhythm modulates from long, vaulting sentences to the clipped final triad—“The door creaked open. / The young woman stepped... / Tears gathered...”—echoing the heartbeat Elias overhears. Zero loops, no mixed metaphors, high information density; the prose is publish-ready.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>The “secret library fed by mis-addressed mail” angle refreshes the hidden-world trope; the recursive error structure feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk is present but modest—still an inventive, memorable take.</comment>
