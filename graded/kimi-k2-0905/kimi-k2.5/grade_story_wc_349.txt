<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elara’s desire to reach the “white room” is legible, but her interior contradiction—trading amnesia for freedom yet craving origin—stays abstract; no embodied emotion or micro-choice dramatizes the cost of stepping through the incision, so the final renunciation feels asserted rather than earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The accumulative/textural lens holds: pattern of measured absences builds to the doorway incision and a resonant reconfiguration—she abandons parole and cart. Closure carries conceptual cost (she dissolves into narrative silence), yet the causal jump from “quantifying absence” to literal slit in reality is lightly hand-waved, keeping it sub-9.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Glass orchard, floating clouds, bottled moonlight—each image is filtered through Elara’s vendor gaze and constrains her tactics (spacing bottles to map emptiness). Selective sensory detail (luminescent vessels, transparent leaves) charges the final image when she leaves the cart behind; spatial choreography remains coherent.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reach narrative genesis before parole snaps—signals early; pressure tightens when parole flickers at the incision. One meaningful deepening: she must forfeit her trade/tools to cross. Cost is conceptual (eternal dispersal) but not viscerally felt on-page, so escalation stays strong, not exceptional.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of erasure vs. origin emerges through the moonlight bottles and the white room, never sermonized. Final image of becoming “the silence between words” reweights prior absences with conceptual cost. Ambiguity lingers without confusion; no tidy moral imposed.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lush, rhythmic prose mirrors the glass-orchard wonder; perceptual signature is consistent—Elara notices intervals, voids, centimeters. Patterned elision (“glimmering parole,” “integrated fragmentation”) is taught early and paid off at closure. No head-hopping; voice modulates from vendor-polish to incantatory release.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Sentences vary in length and syntax; information density high—each line advances image or concept. Occasional stacked modifiers (“integrated fragmentation that composed her existence”) flirt with purple but serve voice. No loops, no scaffold; metaphor stays coherent. Clean copy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>“Bottled Moonlight” and “glimmering parole” feel fresh; the quantified-absence portal is a risky conceit that coheres by closure. Specific detail (42 cm of empty air) grounds the surreal frame. Transformation: vendor of forgetting chooses self-dissolution into pre-narrative silence—inevitable yet non-obvious.</comment>
