<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction is vivid—“lukewarm” talent vs. iron diligence—and every micro-choice (counting drops, aligning shards) flows from that tension. Embodied emotion is precise: trembling fingers, dried-coral mallet, salt crust on stone. The only bar to 9+ is that the moral calculus never sharpens: she risks nothing personal beyond exhaustion, so the cost feels environmental, not interior.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens declared by second paragraph and held: drip cadence → bell resonance → tide memory. The 1460-drop count pays off as the exact trigger for the first seep, delivering a Resonant Reconfiguration with undeniable conceptual cost—she has exchanged infinite mornings for an unfinished ocean. No causality breaks; orientation anchored within 70 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sapphire viaduct, salt-crusted basin, and condensing stone function as micro-setting that constrains every tactical decision; the drip interval literally sets the spell’s metronome. Sensory hierarchy skews to tactile and auditory, matching a mage who must feel rather than force. Final image of water pooling through cracks re-uses early descriptors with reweighted meaning, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“reawaken the memory of sound”—is signaled early and tightened by the measurable drip cadence; each incremental drop narrows her options until the 1460th forces the strike. Escalation is textural, not causal-reversal, but the pattern intensifies stakes by shrinking the remaining time and visible water. Cost is legible: infinite future dawns pledged to an unending vigil.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: persistence of the insufficient can tilt cosmos. Subtext lives in the bell’s silence—absence as positive force. Final image reweights “lukewarm” from insult to quiet engine of change. No moralizing; ambiguity remains whether one mage’s lifespan will suffice.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays glued to Elara’s perceptual filter: she measures, whispers, counts. Syntax lengthens during calibration, then fractures into short clauses at the strike—“The sound that emerged was not loud, but it was true”—mirroring her held breath. No head-hopping; diction stays within her plausible lexicon even when elevated by wonder.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is rhythmically alive: seven-second anaphora, precise numerals, then release into imagistic final paragraph. No loops, no mixed metaphors. One minor scaffold—“she understood that rebuilding required precision”—could be cut without loss; keeps score sub-9.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Familiar eco-fantasy trope flipped: no chosen one, just inadequate technician plus broken metronome. Drip-rate arithmancy feels novel, the bell’s voice-as-mnemonic device fresh, and the lukewarm mage premise carried to conceptual limit. Risk in quiet ending pays off; transformation is inseparable from this exact salt basin and cracked clapper.</comment>
