<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Mara’s guarded hope and survivor’s vigilance feel concrete; her decision to ring the bell atop the arch crystallizes a earned shift from isolation to kinship. Interiority stays embodied (“struggled to trust the silence”) rather than abstract. The ghost’s motivation is purely altruistic, so lacks contradiction, but Mara’s micro-choice under the arch carries visible cost—she now tends an orchard she once merely survived.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the nebula blooms overhead, reweighting every prior loss into collective stewardship. Causal chain (chalk → moisture → ionized barrier) holds; the watering bell’s return in the final dust-message tightens the loop with felt cost. One soft spot: “she reexamined the settlement's original star charts during lunch” compresses a causally necessary beat into off-stage summary.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Frost-crunch boots, floating rock arches, and the ceramic bell’s chime anchor the alien orchard in tactile specificity. The magnetic anomalies and moisture collectors integrate into the actionable goal rather than postcard backdrop. Final nebula image is charged by the bell’s last ring, satisfying the 9+ constraint test. Minor lapse: spatial relation of “highest point beneath the largest arch” remains slightly vague.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—long-term atmospheric survival—surfaces early and tightens through each dawn message. One meaningful escalation: mirror-angle calibration forces communal labor under threat of solar winds. Cost is conceptual but legible in the final image (fragile vapor shield). Could edge higher if a concrete resource loss (time, water, injury) had been dramatized on page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of chosen family emerges through communal orchard labor rather than explicit thesis. Thomas’s ghost reframes “haunting” as continued caretaking, reweighting grief into mutual obligation. Final line (“love that refused to abandon its orchard”) offers resonant non-literal answer. Avoids moralizing, though the word “respite” flirts with abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays close to Mara’s sensory filter; diction (“jagged shadows,” “brittle maps”) carries perceptual signature. Rhythm modulates from frost-crunch immediacy to lyrical uplift at the nebula bloom. No dialogue to test, yet narrative voice remains distinct. One tiny filter-stack: “she had learned to trust these strange communiques” could drop “had.”</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence. Figurative language is selective (“shimmered like dying stars”) and purposeful. High information density: each line advances atmosphere or tactic. Only minor scaffold: “as it always was when the ghost appeared” restates desertion already implied.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Synthesis of agrarian sci-fi, benevolent ghost, and DIY magnetosphere feels fresh yet inevitable. Transformation test fails if moved to generic colony, proving specificity. Risk taken in quiet climax (mist bloom) pays off under accumulative lens. Slight deduction for familiar “survivors become family” arc, redeemed by ghost-engineer twist.</comment>
