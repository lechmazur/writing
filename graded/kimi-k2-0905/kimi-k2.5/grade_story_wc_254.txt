<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid—her breath, the ache in her teeth, the tremor radiating outward—yet the “tremor of certainty” is stated more than dramatized. The final epiphany (the ban was self-built) is foreshadowed but still feels slightly abstract; we see the realization, not the full cost of having mis-built it. Micro-choices (placing palm, stepping between columns) are present and aesthetic, but no contradictory impulse complicates them. Earned stasis is credible; a hairline slip keeps it from the 8-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/lyric lens holds: each paraphrased phrase thickens the quartz song and her dissolving form. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive within 120 words; cobalt atrium and frozen lake are immediately legible. Closure is a Charged Poise: she becomes the cloud-shadow poem itself—image reweights stakes with undeniable cost. No causality break; pattern taught early (paraphrase, dissolve, hush) pays off in final scatter-image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Cobalt tiles, lantern-moth hush, quartz hum felt in molars—details are selective, sensory, and pressure-driven. Environment is not just backdrop: the colonnade’s vibration literally dissolves her outline, charging the final image. Micro-setting (her palm on cold quartz) functions as tool and threshold. No spatial drift; world rules stay consistent. Could edge 9-land with one more tactical constraint from setting mid-scene.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Single dominant stake: reclaim the banned frequency or remain exiled in self-censorship. Pressure escalates accumulatively—each paraphrase brightens a column, narrowing her physical form. The tightening is visible: body blurs, shadow multiplies, option to stay wholly human evaporates. Cost is legible—she scatters into fractal light, irreversible. Agency is interior but decisive; no external antagonist needed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: art as self-authorization versus self-censorship. No explicit thesis; the final image—she becomes the poem—answers the implicit question. Subtext lives in sensory traces: cobalt tint as substance, lantern-moth hush as permission. Resonance lingers without moralizing; ambiguity (will she re-coalesce?) is purposeful and charged.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person lyric remains tight to Elara’s perceptual filter: she notices snow-shadow syntax, quartz harmonics in her molars. Diction is poetic yet precise—“aesthetically driven” is the only phrase that flirts with label-speak, but it is immediately embodied by her balletic step. Rhythm modulates: longer clauses swell during incantation, fragment-like phrases at scatter-moment. No head-hopping; distance stable. Voice is distinctive enough for 9-territory; one near-label keeps it shy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sentence variety is wide; no template cadence or synonym loops detected. Metaphors stay coherent—cloud-shadow, pollen-on-wind—without mixed-vehicle crashes. Density high: “cobalt tint of the atrium’s namesake” does triple duty (color, space, metaphor). Minor scaffold: “aesthetically driven” appears twice in close proximity; does not obscure closure. Read-aloud ear test passes; momentum breathes with scene needs.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses banned poetics with resonant architecture; not a trope template. Cloud-shadow poet as profession is specific and fresh; the idea that paraphrase can physically dissolve the poet stakes new ground. Risky lyric accumulation pays off—readers accept her scattering because the pattern is taught early and charged at close. Transformation test fails if you swap names; the cobalt/quartz/frozen-lake triad is irreplaceable. One more tactical surprise mid-scene could nudge 9+.</comment>
