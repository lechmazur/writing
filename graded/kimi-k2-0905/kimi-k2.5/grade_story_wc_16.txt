<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses—cataloguing silence yet courting risk—stay alive in scene; the embodied “cautious exuberance” and micro-choices (tablet selection, stylus dip) tether motivation to action. The final renunciation of silence is earned by the heptagon ritual and costs her the safety of detachment. Julian’s late entry limits mutual crucible pressure to one beat, capping depth.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each extinct language tablet adds a because-link toward the air-written vows; the ink well’s transmutation is the visible cost. Closure lands as Charged Poise—the bridge of light suspended between them—reconfiguring options with felt cost (dawn dissolution clause). No orientation debt; archive geography is legible by 120 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Archive as micro-setting constrains choice: defensive wards force quiet steps, ochre air dictates ritual timing. Glass ink well evolves from shared memory to binding medium, charging the final image. Sensory hierarchy mirrors POV—Elara hears dead grammars vibrate, tastes forgotten syntax—never tourist catalog.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore trust before transfer—tightens when each tablet vow narrows the option to remain silent. Escalation is her increasing visibility to wards plus dawn deadline; price is explicit (ritual ink bought with months of distilled loneliness). Agency drives every beat: she selects, writes, risks.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from schism-languages-as-metaphor: civilizations die when speakers stop speaking; private couples follow. Subtext lives in gesture—Julian’s finger through glass reprises earlier shared ink well touch, re-weighting meaning. No moralizing; resonance is the audible chord of seven dead tongues reconciling.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person intimate sustains Elara’s perceptual signature—“hum of seventeen dead tongues vibrating through the iron”—without head-hop. Rhythmic control: long sentences for spiral stacks, staccato for ward danger. Diction stays within arcane-linguist lexicon; no filter-verb stacks. Dialogue minimal but distinct: Julian’s rough disuse vs her crystalline hope.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>High information density: “languages that had died specifically because its speakers had stopped speaking to one another” does world-and-theme work in one stroke. No mixed metaphors; figuratives are physics-sober. One paraphrase loop spotted (“cautious exuberance” twice in three lines) but does not touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: extinct linguistics as couples therapy via semantic binding ritual. Risk—writing vows into mid-air—pays off when glowing grammar becomes literal bridge. Transformation test fails if moved to generic lab; archive-ink-heptagon triad is inseparable. Concept commits fully, no retreat into metaphor alone.</comment>
