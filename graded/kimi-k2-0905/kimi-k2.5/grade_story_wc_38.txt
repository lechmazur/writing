<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is lyrically specific, but the text labels emotions (“shame,” “grief”) rather than embodying them mid-dance. Micro-choices—rolling the dice, selecting the next pirouette—are present, yet the stakes of failure never graze her body or breath; cost is announced, not felt. The final whispered verse lands as earned renunciation, but the arc flirts with perfection rather than flaw-driven inevitability.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each dance layer adds density until “The Major Lift” re-weights the archive from prison to library. Pattern is taught by the second paragraph and closure crystallizes in the vault’s sigh—undeniable conceptual cost. No orientation debt; space/time are anchored in the first 50 words. One tighten: dice roll → choreography → vault opens; no causal reversals needed under this lens.</comment>

<comment>Sunken lab constrains every move—puddles splash, fungi light the score, brass bowls echo drip-rhythm; environment dictates choreography spacing and stealth necessity. The dice-as-console-key integrate tool and architecture; final vault exhalation is charged by this micro-setting. Sensory hierarchy favors touch and sound over visual ornament, keeping detail pressure-anchored.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—liberate submerged testimonies—is signaled early and tightens once: “Minor Fall” narrows the physical path to vault. Cost is conceptual but legible: regime memory will surface, Elara’s anonymity forfeited. Calm defiance keeps risk abstract; no bodily price or ticking clock raises felt jeopardy higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme—vulnerability transmuted into armored record—emerges through protein-chain journals and dance-decryption, never sermon. Vault image reconfigures drowning into breathing without moral tag. Ambiguity lingers: who will dare read? Resonance earned via concrete particulars, not proclamation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric sustains spider-web cadence; diction (“bioluminescent cyan,” “mathematical poetry”) stays within Elara’s fused scientific-artistic idiom. No head-hopping; psychic distance contracts under pressure: shorter clauses during vault approach. Compression (“she whispered a verse…”) teaches elision early and pays off in final line.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm breathes with dance beats; sentence length mirrors pirouette/pause structure. Metaphors are consistent—web, tide, cipher—no mixed vehicles. One loop: “patient as a spider spins its web” appears twice; minor scaffold but does not dull closure. High density; every sentence advances image or decryption step.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fusion of choreographic cryptography with biotech confessions is fresh; not a trope retread. Dice notation repurposing execution harmonics into map feels inevitable yet unforeseen. Risk—entire story told through abstract dance—pays off because setting and stakes remain tactile. Could not swap names/places without collapsing concept.</comment>
