<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elias’s interior contradiction—trembling hands vs. refusal to retire—grounds him; the stone-cast encodes divorce/daughter regret into embodied ritual. Micro-choice (barefoot walk, deliberate toss) reveals hierarchy of values. Final “ready to read cracks” shows earned endurance with visible cost. Could use one more in-scene impulse that risks immediate failure to hit 9-band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the prism’s spectral fracture reweights twenty years of mundane glass-work with undeniable cost—he forfeits certainty for prismatic asking. Accumulative lens holds: tide pool rings → standing waves → spectral light pattern taught early and paid off. No orientation debt; anchors clear by line 4. Persistent constraint (trembling hands) shapes final return to workshop.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prism atrium and tide pool function as micro-settings that constrain choice: only at this bluff, at this tide-still minute, can the pattern physics reveal his life’s interference waves. Salt-scarred warehouses, mercury-still pool, and spectral fracture are selective, POV-filtered, and evolve with beat. Tool (beach stone) alters later perception; environment charges final image. No spatial drift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—whether to keep repairing or to see value in brokenness—tightens when standing waves complicate simple rings, forcing recognition that pressure creates color. Agency lies in stone-cast and final pickup of toolbox; both foreclose passive retreat. Cost visible in “patterns remained inscribed.” Escalation is single deepening rather than reversal, sufficient for lyric-accumulative design; lacks second tightening to reach 8.8.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges inductively: mundane glass under pressure reveals spectrum; human fracture likewise refracts hidden color. Final image reweights prior repairs without moralizing. Subtext in “reads between lines of cracked silica” carries vocational metaphysics into personal fault-lines. Avoids tidy thesis; ambiguity lingers in “ready to read whatever cracks the day would bring.” No echoic articulation of “noctilucent reckonings” at end keeps it under 9.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elias’s glazier optics: silica, frames, refraction, salt-scarred. Syntax lengthens during contemplative beats, compresses at “stone sunk; water stilled.” Free indirect blends without filter-verb clutter: “he would understand… through the patterns.” No head-hop; perceptual signature distinct and rhythmic. Metaphors (crystal lung, mercury) stay within his material lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Sentence variety supports tidal rhythm; no template cadence or synonym loops. Figurative language clustered in descriptive paragraphs, not during decision beat, so density rule waived. Opening “horizon still bled violet into grey” anchors time and mood without purple overload. One paraphrase loop: “patterns… patterns” across adjacent clauses costs −0.2; otherwise clean, propulsive, high density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Occupational epiphany via optics is fresh angle on late-life reflection; stone-in-pool as physics-of-consequence device feels inevitable yet not clichéd. Risk in withholding dialogue and external characters pays off by intensifying interior lens. Could push further if prism atrium had earlier causal role rather than mainly iconic reprise. Still, synthesis of glazier craft and spectral revelation is memorable.</comment>
