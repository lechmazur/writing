<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vey’s contradictory impulses—flee memory vs. transliterate it—are embodied in mercury skin that literally rewrites the mountain; the final choice to keep pain visible is earned through the stone’s tactile translation and the spiral’s contraction. Interiority stays concrete (“swallowing broken crystal,” “quicksilver grief”) and avoids label-speak. The only cap is the absence of a second on-page character, so status/relationship bullets stay unused.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Decisive Change under Accumulative/Textural lens: the act of seeding glyphs re-weights the entire mountain from graveyard to living syntax, with visible cost—the mercury body rings, shelves realign, thunder becomes promise. Causality is thematic rather than purely linear: nightly substitution fails → stone discovered → translation → seeding, each beat increasing pattern density until the spiral contracts. Orientation is taught early via the junction of staircases and the nightly ritual; no debt applied.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The mountain-bookstore is not backdrop but tool: granite shelves breathe, geography is editable, and the summit’s starlight breach literally enables the seeding. Micro-setting (stone, feather, mercury skin) constrains the translation method and charges the final tattooing. Spatial choreography is clean across the vertical climb; sensory hierarchy mirrors Vey’s glass-biased perception.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can Vey inhabit pain without erasing it—tightens when substitution fails at the stone; escalation is pattern-deepening (illusion → translation → seeding) rather than successive reversals. Agency is present: choosing to carry the stone upward and press glyphs forfeits the safety of nightly erasure. Cost is legible in the shuddering realignment and the retained ache that now has “space to grow.”</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through image, not thesis: home as grammar one inscribes, not excavates. The stone’s seeding reconfigures the entire mountain into a text still “wet with the ink of becoming,” leaving resonant ambiguity—no moral, only a living syntax. No echoic thesis statement; final image reweights all prior substitutions.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays tight to Vey’s perceptual filter: mercury skin, syntax-as-architecture, hidden thunder heard in mason-jar bones. Patterned elision (“they pressed silver palms…”) is taught early and pays off in the final seeding. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk is zero; diction remains within the mythic register the POV warrants.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sentences vary in length and rhythm; metaphor density serves the mythic cadence without clogging causality. No synonym loops or mixed metaphors; “hidden thunder trapped in a mason jar” is precise. The only minor artifact is occasional stacked prepositional phrases, but these never obscure the closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms the familiar “memory-avoiding immortal” trope into geology-as-syntax, making the mountain both library and palimpsest. The feather-as-translator device is fresh, non-obvious, and inevitable once enacted. Risk-taking (glass-bodied seer rewriting bedrock) heightens stakes without losing clarity.</comment>
