<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation is dramatized through micro-choices—breath-matching guitar, waiting silence, opening the locket—each action quietly risking rejection. The boy’s first whistle note and word carry believable hesitation and cost. Interiority avoids therapy-speak; contradiction appears in her hope-versus-restraint tension. Only the grandmother locket backstory is slightly over-reflected without fresh choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens: eclipse window → safety → whistle → "Again" because/therefore chain is intact. Closure lands as Decisive Change with felt cost—the boy’s reclaimed voice and her tear-blurred relief. Setting anchors within 50 words; no orientation debt. Persistent constraint: her need to stay softly adaptive keeps her from celebrating loudly, visible in the final steady strum.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sage ridge functions as micro-setting: thin soil, trembling leaves, temperature drop under eclipse all shape the children’s shared breath and timing. Brass locket and whistle act as handled objects that constrain pacing and light. Sensory filter stays in Elara’s musician-biased perception—wind as key, silence as meter. Final image of spiral hair catching returning sun recharges setting magic without overt symbol.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—break silence without breaking child—signaled early. Tightening occurs when eclipse darkness drops temperature and sage leans, forcing the whistle note; live option of retreat remains open until boy hums. Cost visible: Elara’s withheld tears and controlled strum show she pays in suppressed exuberance to protect fragile gain. Agency shared: her steady presence invites, his breath chooses.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme of ordinary magic emerges through eclipse hush enabling sound where words failed; no explicit thesis stated. Baby curl reweighted from nostalgia to living spiral of healing at end. Subtext in shared breathing and silent plant witnesses. Final "Again" offers resonant non-literal answer—wonder can restart after darkness—without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elara’s musician perception—light as timbre, wind as tempo. Rhythm modulates: longer sentences during waxing eclipse, short fragments at totality. No head-hopping; Milo’s interior accessed only via observable tremble, widened eyes. Distinct perceptual signature carries through closing line where returned sunlight is "same ordinary magic."</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose shows high density: one sentence often layers sensory cue, emotional calibration, and environmental response. Varied sentence openings; no template cadence. One mixed metaphor—"water finding cracks in stone" beside "filament of sound"—but physical logic holds. Zero loops or scaffold; each paragraph advances knowledge or stakes. Final line earns rhythmic echo of opening.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: music therapy plus eclipse totality as timed clinical intervention; not a trope template. Transformation test fails if relocated to city rooftop—sage ridge micro-climate and cultural hush are integral. Risk in quiet climax succeeds because whistle note is irreversible sonic event. Hair curl re-purposed from keepsake to metronome to DNA spiral, avoiding sentimentality.</comment>
