<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara's calmly inventive precision under pressure is shown through tactile micro-choices (counting steps, aligning quill holder, painting by touch); the interior contradiction between loyal sentinel and silent insurrectionist is dramatized in the moment she re-keys the sundial, foreclosing her old identity with felt cost. Motivation grows from abstract resistance to concrete spatial sabotage, but the emotional price (loss of belonging, perpetual secrecy) is implied rather than embodied on the page. Still, the single-POV lens stays tight, and every action is traceable to her calculated risk.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: blackout → frozen gears → opportunity → coded sundial realignment → future misdirection. Closure lands as Decisive Change: the sundial’s shadow will soon point insurgents toward the armory, an irreversible tactical pivot. Cost is visible in the empty quill holder and Elara’s vanishing silhouette—she forfeits status and safety. Orientation is anchored by twilight, western parapets, and arrow slit before word 120; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Luminous fort, half-painted sundial, and bronze quill holder are not backdrop but tactical levers: blackout strips the fort to “bones,” guiding Elara’s path; sundial’s grooves and gnomon angle become literal lock-picks; quill holder doubles as lens and ink vessel. Sensory hierarchy follows crisis—touch and muted twilight color dominate, sound swallowed. Spatial choreography is clean: thirteen steps, eastern arcade, flagstone click. The setting constrains and enables the final misdirection, charging the closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—silent revolution’s timing—tightens when blackout reveals the sundial’s secret geometry; protagonist’s agency drives every escalation: extraction of lens, calculation of 23°, painting the quadrant. One meaningful turn: the act of painting re-keys the fortress’s spatial logic, narrowing options for both guards and insurgents. Cost is legible: Elara forfeits her sentinel identity in exchange for tactical advantage, a price crystallized as she “melts back into twilight.”</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of silent subversion emerges through spatial betrayal—turning a time-keeping device into a weapon—rather than exposition. Subtext operates in the hush, velvet silence, and “winking” conspiracy; the sundial’s misdirection becomes a metaphor for institutional betrayal. Final image reweights prior motifs: dawn will not bring truth but orchestrated chaos. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers about who will be caught in the shadow.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays fused to Elara’s perceptual signature: mechanical sounds recede, color narrows to bruised purples, touch guides. Diction—“luminous fort,” “cradle of sparks,” “winking hush”—is compressed yet precise, never purple. Rhythm accelerates with paratactic moves during painting beat, then exhales into longer clause as she vanishes. No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens under stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty: “patina warm against her palm” fuses texture and emotional anchoring; “geometrically inevitable” marries math and fate. No scaffold loops; each clause advances position or stakes. Figurative language is sparse, pattern-taught (“cradle of sparks” reappears as literal birthplace), paid off in final line. Minor filter verbs tolerated (“she could almost hear”) because they serve hush-tone.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: lock-picking via celestial alignment + blackout + writing tool as cipher key. Sundial-as-insurrection-map feels both ancient and new, grounded in tactile detail. Risk taken: static opening tableau, but payoff justifies delay. Conceptual integrity intact—every rule introduced (coded angles, quill holder mechanics) is used to rewire power.</comment>
