<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Maya’s contradictory impulses—rational doubt vs tactile rescue mission—play out in live gesture; the geode’s cooling at the end shows earned cost. Interiority stays concrete ("stomach clenching") rather than diagnostic. The single weakness: the brother memory is summoned twice but never pressed into a micro-choice that risks failure, so the final shift feels slightly pre-ordained rather than hard-won.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: each pill-finding beat layers density until the spirals revealed in the long-exposure reweight the stake. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—the cooling geode + light-paintings crystallize "connection without pills" with undeniable conceptual cost. One transition (studio → building sweep) is legible; no orientation debt. Causality stays intact: because she trusts body-resonance, therefore she finds the spiral pattern, therefore she can finish the recall.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Light-painting studio acts as micro-setting: LED trails and blackout constrain her motion and make the final spiral discovery possible. Radiator, curtain, ventilation shaft are sketched with tactile handling that tracks spatially. The muscovite geode functions as portable "environment" whose temperature shift guides pivot points. City-scale neural damage stays off-page but is filtered through bodily cues, keeping exposition spare.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Stake—retrieve pills before neural damage—tightens through somatic escalation: warmer geode → sharper visceral reaction → spiral pattern discovery forecloses the option to stop. One meaningful deepening suffices; no reversal needed. Cost is visible: her palms burn, breath catches, and the final cool geode signals exhaustion of the method. Agency stays hers; no coincidences.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme of authentic vs synthetic connection emerges via the spiral arrangement users left—an unconscious plea read only through body-wisdom. No explicit thesis; final line lets "doubt and compassion speak the same language" resonate without moral. Subtext in LED ribbons mirrors neural pathways, re-weighted when she sees the spiral. Avoids sentimentality; hope is earned by tangible forfeiture of the pills.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Third-person intimate carries a skeptic’s compressed diction: "I don’t believe in telepathy, but I believe in your pain." Rhythm tightens under stress—single clauses, no filter verbs. Technical lexicon (muscovite, somatic markers) stays within a studio artist’s plausible curiosity. No dialogue, so voice purity remains intact; free indirect slips cleanly into italicized self-address.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Sentence variety supports momentum: long painterly cadences for spirals, staccato for discovery beats. Metaphors ("willowglass hope") recur with reweighted meaning, never mixed. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence adds new sensory or causal information. Figurative language pauses during the peak extraction beat, keeping propulsion clear. Minor scaffold: "fractally precise" appears three times—acceptable because pattern is taught early and paid off in final image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Telepathy-pill recall feels fresh; pairing it with DIY mineral dowsing in an art studio is non-obvious. Light-painting documentation of contraband search turns procedural plot into visual metaphor. Spirals as desperate user-language reverses the usual "government vs addict" trope into grief-mapping. Risky lyric density mostly succeeds; one near-cliché ("trembling hands") is the lone soft spot.</comment>
