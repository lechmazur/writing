<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara's abdication-via-ascent motive is vivid; the swallowed-stone image and her quiet commands to the mountain show embodied rule. Yet the pivot from "answers" to "become cosmic seamstress" arrives in a single exultant paragraph—no prior beat shows her hunger to mend, so the climactic renunciation feels slightly unearned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the bleeding sky is re-sewn, crownless Elara claims a new vocation, cost is the permanent forfeiture of throne and former identity. Accumulative/textural lens holds—each image layer (bone throne, violet air, starlit pool) intensifies dread until the firefly counter-pattern re-weaves it; orientation anchored by word 80; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mountain, grotto, and liquid-sky pool are tactile, bias-filtered through Elara's defeated-royal gaze; the "lacy menace" veins and the pool that mirrors no cave wall actively constrain her understanding and later her act of re-weaving. Cobalt palette can verge on monochrome, but the final golden fireflies break it precisely at the closure beat, fulfilling the 9+ test.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—avoid cosmic unraveling by deciding what sovereignty means—surfaces early; pressure escalates through sensory densification rather than external opposition. The mid-point firefly revelation tightens options: mend or drown; price is her crown and former world. Slight deduction because the cosmic stakes are announced more than tested on-page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of power redefined as creative service emerges through image pattern—bone throne vs. star-needle—never sloganized. Final image of "queens became weavers" reweights all prior dread without moralizing, inviting counter-readings of sacrifice versus escape. Subtext of shared complicity with Mara adds political bite.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lush, compressed lyricism stays inside Elara's ex-royal lexicon; perceptual signature notices hierarchy even in rock veins. No head-hopping; psychic distance cleanly snaps from wide dread to fingertip-in-pool action. Occasional adjective stacks ("impossibly golden...honey and ozone") flirt with purple but serve the textural/accumulative mode.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varied; sentences perform multiple tasks—"she pulled herself onto the shelf where the cobalt grotto waited, its mouth breathing warmth" moves body, reveals setting, carries metaphor. A few near-miss mixed metaphors ("sky that wept liquid light onto empty crowns") and minor echo ("bleeding" used thrice in 100 words) keep it from immaculate.</comment>

<comment>Fusing abdication crisis with cosmic textile repair feels fresh; fireflies as counter-thread to apocalypse is lovely inversion. Risky lyric density almost collapses under its own perfume but holds thanks to tight focalization. Could swap names and still work, but the synthesis of star-sewing + relinquished crown is memorable and specific.</comment>
