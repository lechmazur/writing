<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is textured and embodied—her flashlight trembles, her fingers trace cold metal and glass—but she never breaks past observer to agent; the micro-choice is only to photograph. The sixteen colors = sixteen souls realization is powerful yet delivered as summary, not as a decision that costs her a path. Earned Stasis is hinted (she “carries no belief” yet bears witness) but the refusal isn’t dramatized with visible price on the page. Still, her skeptical exhaustion and the weight settling “into her sternum” keep her credibly flawed and specific.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The story lands a resonant Charged Poise: the beaded wheel’s sixteen colors reweight Elias’s confession, making the moral cost legible without supernatural release. Causality is sound—each radio clue maps to a physical find, culminating in the valve wheel that fuses industrial and intimate. The Orientation Test is passed by ~100 words. Closure cost is unmistakable: “she understood the exact tonnage” reconfigures her prior architectural thrill into burden. One minor slip: the climax is observation, not action, so the Decisive Change is intellectual; still, the final image holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The tunnel’s soot-blackened bricks, ballast under boots, and iron ribs create a tactile, lived-in pressure cooker; each sensory pick is filtered through Mara’s drowsy alertness. The beaded valve wheel functions as micro-setting that constrains the final moral reckoning and is returned to twice, charging closure. Spatial choreography is clean—beam, beads, camera click all track. Weathered glass and chemical sludge keep industrial rules consistent. The environment is not backdrop; it supplies the literal weight she came to measure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“find the weight of that swallowed truth”—is signaled early and tightens once: the wheel’s sixteen colors force her to reprice heroism vs murder. No reversals are needed; the single deepening is sufficient under Accumulative lens. Cost is felt in the sternum-stone image and the camera click that archives rather than absolves. Agency is observational, but the narrowing of her moral certainty is legible on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the fusion of industrial artifact and prayer beads: cost accounting for impossible choices. Subtext lives in the radio callers’ metaphors (“wheel that prays in colors”) that Mara decodes without cosmic comfort. No moral is stated; the final image of exact tonnage invites open reckoning. The refusal of supernatural balm keeps complexity intact, though one line flirts with echo—“silence between heartbeats” edges toward poetic overkill yet is earned by prior density.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays glued to Mara’s perceptual filters—her skeptical radio trawling, her flashlight bias, her architectural rush reframed as moral burden. Syntax lengthens under fatigue, then snaps to shorter fragments at the valve wheel. No head-hopping; psychic distance is controlled. Word choice (“swallowed truth,” “tonnage”) remains within her lexicon. Distinctive rhythmic signature sustains throughout without monotony.</comment>

<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentence openings diversify. High information density: soot-blackened bricks, chemical sludge, sixteen colors each carry double duty. No synonym loops or filter-verb stacks. One mixed metaphor—“spine of some buried leviathan”—is permissible and taught early. Final third is clean; no artifacts dull the closure image.</comment>

<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The ghost-shift legend is refreshed through materialist skepticism and the radio-to-valve scavenger hunt; trope becomes forensic reckoning. Beaded valve wheel is an original fusion of industrial and votive. Risk-taking in the passive-observer climax is justified by the Accumulative lens and pays off in conceptual cost. Specificity of “sixteen distinct colors” anchors universals without ornament.</comment>
