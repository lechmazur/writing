<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maya’s contradictory impulses—vacancy vs. the clone’s hunger to live—are dramatized in the forehead-to-brain contact; the micro-choice to open the jar and fuse costs her the last shield of numbness, earning the tear-tracked reawakening. Interiority stays concrete (“salt cutting tracks down cheeks that had forgotten sensation”). The only slip is a touch of diagnostic self-labeling mid-paragraph (“ego death was not an ending but a partner”) that momentarily abstracts the embodied crisis.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the fused self steps to the rock’s edge, fear and aliveness co-present, history stabilizing—cost is the now-empty jar turning to dust and the irreversible return of feeling. Causal linkage holds: because she vivifies the duplicate, therefore she reclaims emotion and the dojo stabilizes. Orientation is taught by line 5 (“floating rock dojo… below her, the world fractured”), waiving any penalty. No lens ambiguity; the piece stays situational-accumulative to the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The floating rock, glass jar, and mutable world are tactile constraints: the rock’s suspension mirrors her emotional limbo; the jar’s cold glass and peeling label are handled repeatedly; the brain’s gray matter pressed to her forehead charges the final integration. History’s rewrites function as environmental pressure, forcing the custody decision. Sensory economy is tight—visual, haptic, kinesthetic—filtered through Maya’s hollowed perception. Spatial choreography remains coherent across the single continuous scene.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—defeat emotional numbness—is signaled in paragraph 1 and tested by the clone’s demand for embodiment. Escalation tightens once: from rejection (“You cannot exist”) to synthesis (opening the jar), narrowing her options to either perpetual vacancy or shared embodiment. The price—permanent re-exposure to grief and fear—is legible in the closing tears. Agency drives the turn; no coincidence resolves the conflict.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: self as negotiated fiction, ownership as possession, emptiness requiring fullness. The DUPLICATE label’s reprise—now liberation—reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext resides in the brain’s electrical whispers and the salt-sting of returned sensation. Final image offers charged ambiguity: afraid and alive, refusing tidy closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited maintains consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature is stark, blade-like, matching the “slices through pretense” attribute. Syntax lengthens under contemplation, fragments under contact (“Maya wept. The tears were foreign…”), mirroring neural reintegration. No dialogue, so voice purity remains intact. Register stays within a post-awakened ascetic lexicon; no filter-verb clutter.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence advances image or stakes (“Below her, the world fractured and reformed…”). Metaphors are coherent—bell, blade, reed—without purple drift. Minor scaffold: two adjacent sentences beginning “Maya understood…” could compress, but the loop does not touch the climax. Opening and closing lines anchor and recharge the motif of revisionist history.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The clone-custody battle staged inside a single consciousness on a floating rock amid rewriting history is a fresh synthesis of transhuman and koan traditions. The DUPLICATE label’s transformation from diminishment to liberation feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Risky abstraction (ego death, complementary opposites) is grounded in the sensory brain-touch. Specificity of preservative dream, gray matter, salt tracks prevents generic drift.</comment>
