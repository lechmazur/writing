<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s face-blind synesthesia and tactile pigment-mastery drive every beat; her fractal seeing and “mirror the sky” obsession feel inseparable from her body. Interiority stays concrete—she “traces grain,” “memorizes texture like a beloved face,” never slides into label-speak. The renunciation at the threshold—walking out without watching the fall—pays the cost of her limit in one clean image. Only minor: no second character on-page, so status crucible unused, but single-POV depth satisfies.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each pigment stroke layers density until the dawn light reframes the mural as prophecy. Closure is Charged Poise—she carries “the sky within her,” a conceptual repricing that fuses tree, art, and self at the moment of erasure. Causality intact: coin grooves → pigment → sky mirror → renunciation. No orientation debt; “hollowed heart of the Great Oak Library” anchors by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The rotting oak ribs, ribosome shelves, and dewy pigment flecks congeal into a living organ that literally decays beneath her brushes. Tool/setting fusion: the domed ceiling becomes both canvas and dying tissue; its rot limits her time and thus her scale. Final image—walls falling to “reveal not darkness but the sky”—recharges every prior texture. Micro-setting qualifies; no credibility breaks.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“mirror tomorrow’s sunrise before erasure”—tightens when dawn amber pigment must be mixed to a future color that does not yet exist. Escalation is textural: each recursive stroke narrows the possible gradient until the mural becomes the prophetic sky. Cost is visible: she forfeits the chance to stop demolition, pays in irreversible pigment loss and personal exile. Agency remains tactile—she does not surrender, she finishes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through tactile synesthesia vs. cosmic impermanence; no explicit thesis stated. Fractal seeing and doomed library reweight the question of what art preserves—likeness or essence. Final image carries conceptual repricing: the sky is not outside but carried within damaged perception. Avoids sentimentality; resonance lands in the quiet refusal to watch collapse.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is acute—“constellations of texture,” “architecture of bone beneath skin”—syntax mirrors fractal recursion without monotony. No dialogue, so voice purity stays intact. Register stays within painter-scholar lexicon; no filter-verb clutter. Compression in peak beats—“she could not stop the demolition”—reads as breathless necessity, not elision error.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies: long sensuous clauses for pigment work, staccato “engines roared to life” for demolition. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances texture or stakes. Metaphors stay physically coherent—wood as ribosome, cloud as gradient—no mixed vehicles. Only hairline slip: “texture that would shimmer like actual atmosphere” leans toward tell, but immediately redeemed by tactile proof of dawn light.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Face-blind synesthetic who paints souls via touch inside a dying tree-library is a high-risk synthesis that feels inevitable in hindsight. Centuries-old coin encoding pigment ratios through fingertip grooves is a fresh archival device. Fractal recursion as both perceptual limit and mural method fuses concept with form. Risk-taking heightens stakes without obscuring closure; no derivative premise remains.</comment>
