<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—yearning for reunion yet flinching from self-erasure—is dramatized in her unsteady pulse against steady hands; the final “expansion” choice carries visible cost as her flesh turns starlight, anchoring her forever in the grove.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory layer (sap-glow, spice-scent, sister’s voice) deepens the stake until the closing image crystallizes a permanent transformation; fortune-cookie cue anchors causality, and the orchard’s stasis becomes the exact price paid.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Silver sap, perpetual moon, and spice threads are not backdrop but instruments: the trees lean in response to her pulse, the aroma coils into visible conduit, the moonlight bakes the final transmutation—setting actively constrains and enables the closure beat.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Single dominant stake—sister’s return—tightens through each sensory beat; the reluctant metamorphosis forecloses escape, forcing a trade-off (human shape vs. eternal bridge) whose cost is felt on the page as she roots into the luminescent grove.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of love as “violent becoming” emerges from the spice evaporation, flesh luminescence, and final clasp without moralizing; the closing reweighting—expansion instead of loss—arrives as image, not statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Lyric compression stays stable inside Elara’s perceptual filter; cosmic diction never drifts into abstraction but stays moored to tactile sap, pocket paper, heartbeat rhythm; no head-hop or register lapse under peak pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Varied sentence lengths mirror the spice spirals; no scaffold or synonym loops; only one mixed metaphor cluster (“cosmic intimacy pressed against her skin”) but clarity remains intact through the closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Fusing fortune-cookie prophecy with void-seed alchemy and permanent-moon orchard creates a non-obvious synthesis; the transformation price feels inevitable rather than gimmicky, satisfying the transformation test.</comment>
