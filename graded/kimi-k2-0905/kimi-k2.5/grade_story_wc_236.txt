<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mara’s loss of smell is embodied in every beat—she “inhaled deeply, smelling nothing, understanding everything.” The screw acts as an externalized memory organ, forcing her to humanize time instead of scent. Her micro-choice to wrap it in silk before returning it crystallizes the earned shift from aromatherapist to archaeologist of the visible. Interior contradiction is muted; no genuine struggle against her new method is staged, only acceptance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the screw’s journey from birthing clamp to clock innard reweights Mara’s vocation under the Accumulative/Textural lens—each water drop now carries “monument to transition.” Causality is lyric rather than event-driven; the pattern of occluded views taught in paragraph one pays off in the final fog-lift. Cost is felt in the vanished sense that can never be reclaimed, visible in her breath cycling condensation on the glass. No orientation debt; who/where/when are anchored by line four.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The shop is rendered through micro-setting—loupe, brass gear, water chamber—each item constraining Mara’s tactile reading of emotion. Light fracturing through curved reservoirs mirrors her fragmentary perception, charging the final image. Fog and milky glass function as both literal weather and perceptual metaphor without overwriting. Spatial choreography is clean; no floating props.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake: can Mara map emotional terrain without scent? Pressure tightens once through the screw’s discovery; it forces a deepening of method rather than external opposition. No visible price is dramatized—she does not lose a client or break a clock—so escalation stays lyrical. Sufficient for 600-word scope but keeps the score sub-8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges via refracted objects: scent-less-ness becomes attention itself—“the ordinary miracle was not in the smelling but in the noticing.” The screw’s migration from birth to timepiece reconfigures meaning without moralizing. Final image of breath fogging and clearing offers conceptual repricing of perpetual loss become method. No thematic echo; insight stays rooted in tactile particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains precise perceptual signature: “dimensionally flat,” “amniotic fluid,” “metronomic patience.” Syntax lengthens under contemplation, shortens during gear manipulation, echoing clock rhythm. No head-hopping; knowledge stays strictly Mara-bound. Voice never drifts into academic register despite abstract stakes.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is textured yet propulsive; figurative language clusters only in reflective beats where pattern is taught. No synonym loops or template cadence. Line like “silver comma suspended in amniotic fluid” is exact, not purple. Zero scaffolding; each sentence advances image or stance.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Loss of smell re-cast as perceptual aperture rather than debility feels fresh. Water clock as emotional stethoscope synthesizes horology and midwifery without contrivance. Screw’s transposition from life-tool to time-artifact supplies non-obvious hinge. Risk is controlled; lyric structure never compromises clarity.</comment>
