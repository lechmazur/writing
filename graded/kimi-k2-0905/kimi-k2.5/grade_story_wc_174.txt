<comment>Marcus’s shift from manipulator to penitent is credible because every beat roots the change in bodily gesture (handing over the stick, feeding it to flames) and each micro-choice costs him status and certainty. Interiority avoids therapy-speak; instead, the radar dome’s geometry and the stick’s notches externalize guilt. The blind storyteller functions as pressure, not prop: her plain narrative forces Marcus to recognize his reflection, sealing the arc. Flaw retained: we never learn why an urbane calligrapher chose bar-puppet agitprop—motivation springs fully formed—so the arc is emotionally complete but not psychologically exhaustive.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the ashes beside the cracked dome reconfigure meaning—stories are no longer tools to inscribe on others but air one must breathe. Causal chain intact: argument → stick surrendered → fire → silence; each step forecloses retreat. Lens is Accumulative/Textural: repeated images (dome, stick, tape) tighten until the final cadence releases pressure. Cost is conceptual and felt: Marcus forfeits manipulative mastery and sits “uncommonly serene,” a stance whose price the image makes undeniable.</comment>

<comment>The dome functions as micro-setting that constrains: its Cold-War ribs trap sound and guilt, the crack that vents smoke literalizes expiation. Radar-antenna scrap becomes the campfire stick—environmental salvage turned moral tool, its notches a tactile record of harms. Waterfront bars remain off-page but the blind woman’s alley is sketched in three sensory strokes (grime, rasp, hush), enough to shift Marcus from stage to dirt. Weather withheld until “meteor hush,” a late image that compresses atmosphere and stakes into one breath.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—can Marcus relinquish narrative control—signaled early and tightens once: when he asks “Tell me something true” he forfeits puppeteer immunity. Escalation is Accumulative: each handling of the stick deepens the cost until burning it crystallizes the stance. No reversal, no antagonist; pressure is internal and sufficient. Price is visible: the ashes and cracked dome make the forfeiture irreversible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: stories are not inscriptions upon passive minds but reciprocal air that can poison or heal. Subtext carried in gesture—handing over the stick equals ceding authorship. Final image of smoke through the crack reweights prior motif: the dome that once broadcast fictions now vents remorse. Avoids sermon by refusing to declare Marcus redeemed; the ash remains ambiguous, a sacrament or toxin still possible.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Voice is controlled lyric with patterned compression: “meteor hush,” “half-lit epiphanies” teach the reader early to accept abstraction paid off in closure. Perceptual signature is calligrapher-precise—Marcus notices angles, ink-dark ribs, notches—then dissolves into grime-blind receptivity, syntax loosening as control erodes. No head-hopping; blind woman’s voice is reported, not ventriloquized. Register stays within Marcus’s urbane lexicon until alley surrender, a credible slip.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: each sentence advances image or moral physics (“signals that bounced off empty skies”). No loops, no scaffold; metaphor is coherent (stick as antenna-bone, smoke as reversed broadcast). Rhythm modulates—long cadences for dome expanse, staccato for fire crackle—without algorithmic pattern. Minor overgrowth: “half-lit epiphanies” appears twice; second use feels tagged rather than earned, but it lands inside closure so the blemish is hairline.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Puppet-theater-as-ethical-warfare is fresh; the inversion of puppeteer into audience delivers non-obvious insight. Radar dome repurposed as confessional is specific to this story; swap venue and metaphor collapses. Stick carved from antenna scrap fuses setting, prop, and conscience in one object. Risk taken: no external confrontation, all stakes internal; coherence sustained, clarity intact. Hindsight inevitability is complete—ashes had to be the last broadcast.</comment>
