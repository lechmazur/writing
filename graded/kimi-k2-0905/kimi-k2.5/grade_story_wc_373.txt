<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is concrete—her palm-reading of the fob’s warmth, her stagger-act calibrated to enforcer spacing—and her contradictory wish to stay invisible yet brandish the heirloom drives every beat. The recording objective is clear, but the emotional cost is only implied; we feel tension, not the visceral knife-twist of betraying her father’s world. Still, her micro-choices (feigned drunken stumble, visible bait) foreclose retreat and individuate her from stock “avenging daughter.”</comment>

<comment>Closure is the crystalline click of the hidden cylinder finishing its etch; that mechanical snap reweights the night—Mara can now prosecute the lieutenant, her tactical arc complete. The inferred lens is Situational: each repositioning under the pier compresses her stance until the final image (fob heavy with evidence) charges the silence with irrevocable cost. Causality holds: every false-start feint is a therefore that buys angle and cover; no off-stage shortcuts.</comment>

<comment>The salt-rotted underworld is rendered through kinetic selector filters—“barnacles like rusted coins,” reef-salvaged wine casks dripping—details that double as spatial markers for her cat-and-mouse path. Tide-level lanterns and creaking pilings evolve with the clock; the rising water literally shrinks floor-space, forcing her final stagger-step closer to the conspirators. The fob itself functions as micro-setting: its hidden key-hole orients her body angle for optimal sound-capture, a prop that constrains posture and timing.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—secure the betrayal recording before sunrise—tightens geometrically: each false-start loop loses minutes while dawn keeps crawling. The agent’s predator-scan and the lieutenant’s added enforcers raise visible price; when Mara exposes the fob as lure, she risks instant violence to gain the last coordinates. Escalation is situational but legible: every choice narrows her hiding geometry and amplifies exposure cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of silence-as-ammunition emerges through the hush-truce mechanics rather than sermon: recordings, whispers, withheld names (no one is properly named except Mara) build the motif. Final reconfiguration: the same hush that protected traitors now arms Mara; the market will wake to a voice playback it never expected. No tidy moral, just the uneasy aftertaste that secrecy can be weaponized by anyone willing to pay the danger-cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Narrative voice carries a nocturnal, tide-breath rhythm—long clauses that swell and clip, mirrolling lantern-light and barnacle-rot imagery. Perceptual signature is specific to Mara’s criminal education: she reads floorboard give, smells reef-wine behind varnish, catalogs exits like her father taught. No head-hopping; psychic distance compresses under stress, sentences shorten as dawn nears, then elongate again in the purple-exit calm.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and propulsive; every sentence moves position, sound, or stakes: “She retreats, begins again” is a complete tactical unit. Figurative control avoids clutter—only two metaphors per beat, each tied to pier decay (barnacles as coins, lanterns swaying like prayer). No scaffold loops, no mixed metaphors; the single Template-cadence run (“false starts” x3) is motivated and pays off in closure cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The phonograph-in-a-fob is a fresh gadget twist, and framing the entire mission around acoustic espionage rather than gunplay flips the smuggler-heist trope. “Truce of hush” world-rule feels organic because market customs are shown through punished breaches, not exposition. Specificity of tide-rise squeezing stall geometry gives familiar noir under-pier a lived-in inflection.</comment>
