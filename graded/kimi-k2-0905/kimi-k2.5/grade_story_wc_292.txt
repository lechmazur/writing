<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elara’s obsession with vindicating Mara is vivid and embodied; her trembling fingers, copper-nail burn, and final transmission choice show a legible value hierarchy. Interior contradiction—idealism hardened into “stubborn conviction”—is stated, not simultaneously dramatized in a single beat, muting the highest band. The renunciation of institutional silence lands with felt cost, satisfying the 9+ quick test despite minor emotional paraphrase.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the archive’s silence breaks under Mara's recovered coordinates, irreversibly rewriting history. Causal chain holds—decoded stanzas → live reading → transmitted correction—each step because/therefore. Copper nail anchors physical evidence; exile is reversed conceptually, geography denied. Cost is legible in Elara’s fungal trek and professional risk; lens stays causal throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Setting is a macro-character: sweating glass, velvet mold, bioluminescent corridors constrain every move and mirror Elara’s suffocating urgency. Weather station tools and the copper nail micro-setting actively shape the climax—nail placed on transmitter as physical proof. Sensory hierarchy favors taste and touch, narrowing perception under crisis. One anchored location, no spatial drift; environment evolves with each drip.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Single stake—restore Mara’s name—tightens when live transmission forecloses Elara’s career safety. Agency sits squarely on her: decode, climb, speak. No coin-flip rescue; the reversal is earned by her voice and the nail’s evidence. Price is on-page: professional exile swapped for ancestral vindication.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme—history’s erasure of prescient women—emerges through fungal decay, reversed exile, and the archive’s silent glass. No moralizing; the final image of the gleaming nail reweights “madness” into sacrifice. Ambiguity lingers: station still rots, spores colonize tomorrow’s data. Particulars drive resonance, not thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person lingers inside Elara’s perceptual filter—wet velvet breath, green mold compass—syntax grows clipped under transmission stress. No head-hop; meteorologist’s whisper is external datum. Distinct diction: “spongey dread,” “reversible exile,” professional meteorological lexicon. Rhythm escalates from languid decay to hammering heartbeat without drumbeat monotony.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Sentences pull double duty—description advances stakes: “mold colonized… in velvet blooms” foreshadows archival decay. Mixed metaphors (“breathed with spongey dread”) flirt with excess yet stay thematically coherent. Zero paraphrase loops; no filter-verb stacks. One buried lead—jet-stream causality could open the story—but clarity recovers by midpoint.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fuses climate-fiction, archival mystery, and gothic eco-horror into an inevitable whole: doomed female captain, data-driven prophecy, fungal reckoning. Reversible exile concept flipped from punitive geography to ontological correction—fresh without gimmick. Copper nail and coded stanzas feel discovered, not assembled. Risky compression succeeds; tropes transformed through sensory rot and bureaucratic transmission.</comment>
