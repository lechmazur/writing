<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara’s quiet-forged persistence is embodied in every micro-choice—wrapping the silk, counting hammer strikes, climbing out empty-handed—so her final “architect of return” identity lands as earned renunciation rather than label. Interiority stays concrete (“fingers trembling not from exhaustion but from the weight”) and avoids stock diagnostic talk. The only minor slack: “meek” is declared early but never contradicted in-scene by an observable mis-step or self-recrimination, so the contradiction is asserted rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure is a crystal-clean Charged Poise: the arches hum anew, shoots pierce ash, and Elara stands emptied yet reconfigured—cost made legible in the vanished silk and her empty hands. Causal chain (silk→vault→forge-hammer→root-resonance) holds without teleportation; the mine route is pre-mapped and recalled. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) is secure by line 4. Lens stays situational-accumulative throughout and reweights stakes in the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Floating violet-shadow arches, magnetic ore shafts, and crystallised seed vault are filtered through a smith’s eye for tension, grain, and resonance; every physical detail later constrains action or supplies the means (magnetic flux restored by hammer-ritual). The orchard planet is never tourist-catalogued; we learn it through soot, anvil, and root. The azure silk micro-setting returns as the final color echo in shoots—an indispensable recharging image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“coax resilience from rubble”—is signaled in paragraph 2 and tightened once when the floating arch groans, narrowing the window before gravity storms return. Protagonist agency drives every beat: silk barter, hammer-ritual, root-weaving. Cost is visible in dissolved silk and spent physicality. No coincidence rescues her; the resonance she rekindles is the same ore she once mined. One meaningful escalation suffices and lands.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges as the quiet alchemy of persistence: transmuting meekness into patient, subterranean power—never sermonized, only enacted. The azure/gray color dialectic and the smith’s forge metaphor weave organically through beats and recharge in the final silver-green shoots. No tidy moral; the planet’s balance feels provisional, the personal cost still raw. Reflection is interleaved with micro-choices, satisfying BRR limits.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person intimate maintains steady psychic distance; perceptual signature is metallic, rhythmic, soot-stained (“she calculated each step with smith’s precision”). Syntax modulates with pressure—long cadences in descent, staccato hammer beats at climax, then open silence topside. No head-hop, no filter-verb clutter. Dialogue absent by design; voice coherence remains exemplary.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is textured yet economical; sentences carry dual duty (“wrapped the magician’s silk… movements that betrayed a quietly determined spirit”). Figurative layer is sparse, pattern-taught (forge/seed/arch) and paid off without clutter. Zero paraphrase loops, zero register drift. Final paragraph slows rhythm to match planetary inhale—an intentional cadence shift that sharpens resonance rather than dragging momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: planetary orchard plus magnetic-floating geology plus blacksmith-seed-ritual feels inevitable yet unseen before. The silk-currency barter system is lightly sketched but specific enough to avoid generic wand-waving. Risk lies in the quiet, almost lyric refusal of spectacle—stakes stay personal, and the climax is a heartbeat, not an explosion—yet coherence never wavers. Transformation test passes: swap any ingredient and the emotional engine collapses.</comment>
