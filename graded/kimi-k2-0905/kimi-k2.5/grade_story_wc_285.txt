<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is embodied and specific; the coachman’s stitching, skin-read of rain, and cheek-cool detection reveal a calm, methodical mind under vow-bound pressure. The palimpsest promise gives him a layered motive that tightens into the final boarding. No contradictory impulse is dramatized on-page—he never hesitates—so the arc is steady rather than crucible-forced, keeping him just outside the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the hush after gutter-tick cessation crystallizes permission to cross, reweighting all prior waiting into one resonant moment of agency. Cost is felt in decades of layered vows and the storm-won silence. Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout; each sensory beat adds density until the final image simplifies to “absolute, crystalline permission.” No causality or orientation breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fog, rain-gutter acoustics, and the yarn-needle micro-setting constrain every beat; the ferry cable’s low hum becomes the final permission signal. Sensory selection is POV-filtered (skin-read temperature, absence of birdsong) and guides the go/no-go decision. Environment actively shapes tactics—no postcard backdrop. Tool-plus-body acts as setting and charges the last image, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—ferry only those who truly need reaching—remains abstract; no passenger appears, so the vow is tested by weather and time, not by a living choice. Escalation is textural: storm recedes, fog lifts, gutters quiet, tightening the window for safe passage. Cost is the lifelong vigilance itself, but because no alternative option is ever jeopardized on-page, pressure is ambient, not acute. Sufficient for the length, but lacks a visible trade-off that would push higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through palimpsest vow, needle-mending, and distillation: complexity reduced to single acts of mercy. Final image of “crystalline permission” reweights prior layers without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers—who decides “true need”?—inviting reflection. No abstract slogans; resonance is built from concrete particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tightly tethered to coachman’s somatic perception; no head-hop. Diction—“spindrift serenity,” “gloom-hill wind”—is lyrical yet consistent with a quiet, weather-wise ferryman. Rhythm modulates: long accumulation sentences build density, then shorten at the boarding beat. Filter verbs are minimal; perception is concrete.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence or paraphrase loops. Metaphors (“shoulders gathered like storm clouds”) are few, deliberate, and paid off in closure. Information density high: one stitch equals meditation, rain-drop equals word. Minor elevation in diction (“palimpsest,” “vellum”) stays within a reflective lifeworld; no purple overload. Zero artifacts in final third.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Quiet ferryman waiting out fog is familiar, but the palimpsest-vow + ambient-sensing navigation gives it a fresh angle. Yarn-needle-as-compass and skin-reading river turn stock elements specific. Risk lies in lyric stasis, yet payoff justifies the meditative pace. Could swap names, but the sensory method and layered promise feel inseparable here.</comment>
