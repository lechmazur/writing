<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s motivation—"to find beauty in the unfinished"—is concrete, embodied, and drives every micro-choice; the bow’s search for resonant frequencies is a lived hierarchy of values. Interiority stays particular, never diagnostic, and the final renunciation of completion is earned by the causal chain of sounding the shipwrecks. The only bar to 9.0 is that the cost, while felt, is not given a tangible consequence that will alter her next dawn.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the chronic hush is conceptually repriced from absence to "full of potential," with the bowl’s retained heat as visible cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: cadence shift (flames → sympathetic hulls → transformed silence) reweights the stake without causal reversals. Orientation is taught by line 3; no teleporting props or amnesia; the final image crystallizes options under the inferred lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The greenhouse-shipwreck cathedral is not backdrop; its salt-bleached beams and barnacle-studded glass constrain every tactical move—driftwood fuel, condensation source, resonant chamber. Micro-setting (upended bowl-as-drum) directly shapes the climax’s acoustics. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: Mara notices frequencies first, rust second, rot last. Environment, tool, and body together charge the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—liberating sound from imposed silence—is signaled in paragraph 2 and tightens through the single escalating cadence: bowl hum → hull chorus → hush repriced. Agency is continuous; each bow stroke narrows the remaining silence. Cost is legible—salt-bleached wood consumed, heat surrendered—but the price does not boomerang back to limit tomorrow’s resources, keeping the score just shy of the 8.8 band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the pattern of arrested processes: decay, half-notes, shipwrecks, all allowed to sing without forced completion. The final image—"respectful pause"—reweights the premise: silence is no longer failure but fertile incompleteness. No thesis is stated; resonance arises from the concrete transfer of vibration from bowl to hull to air. Ambiguity is purposeful and charged, inviting reflection on ecological and artistic loss simultaneously.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays tightly focalized through Mara’s acoustical perception; perceptual signature is distinct—"ghosts of frequencies," "iron prisons of memory." Syntax lengthens and compresses with breath, mirroring bow work. No head-hopping or register drift; patterned elision ("the world had swallowed its own tongue") is taught early and paid off at closure. A hairline slip toward elevated diction in "radiantly undone" keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm is controlled: long anaphoric clauses build drone, then fracture into shorter beats as flames lower. Information density is high—each sentence advances image, character, or acoustics. Figurative logic stays coherent (sound as liquid, silence as ice) without mixed metaphors. One scaffold loop—"magnificent simplicity" repeated—dulls the edge slightly, preventing 9.0.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses climate-collapse orchard, sunken greenhouse, and musical resurrection into an inevitable, specific whole; removal of any node collapses the concept. The "echo-harbor violinist" profession is not quirky ornament but the only viable agent for this world. Risk—honoring decay instead of restoring—pays off in a non-literal, charged image. Synthesis feels both fresh and necessary, meriting the high-band bonus.</comment>
