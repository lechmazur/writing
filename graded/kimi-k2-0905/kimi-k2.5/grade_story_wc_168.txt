<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Maya’s contradictory impulses—clutching guilt while offering solace—are dramatized in the marble transfer; the “gently skilled” hands both heal and recall failure, a lived contradiction. Elias’s arc from frozen recruit to pocketing the marble is believable because Maya’s testimony externalizes his own shame. Interiority stays concrete: “door handle that had melted in her grip” over abstract labels. Cost is felt: she descends with emptied box, innocence permanently forfeited.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: marble passed, new syntax forged, Maya lighter yet scarred—cost is visible in the emptied box and dawn chill. Causal chain holds: because she failed Thomas, she can now meet Elias; because she relives the failure, Elias re-enters service. One reflective block (≈20 %) is anchored to present granite ledge and alters stance by handing over the relic. Orientation is clear by line 15; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Moonlit ridge, granite ledge, and cracked porcelain box create tactile micro-setting that guides the final exchange. Starlight caught in hairline fractures charges the closing image. Sensory range is narrow but POV-true—smoke memory, marble coolness—economy suits 725-word span. Environment does not constrain tactics as fiercely as internal scars, so stays just shy of 8+.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake: can Maya convert private penance into communal rescue? Mid-scene deepening occurs when she recognizes Elias’s frozen state as mirror of her own—choice to speak narrows her isolation and risks re-opening wound. Passing the marble forecloses her monopoly on grief and costs her the relic she carried twenty years. Pressure accumulates under Accumulative/Textural lens via image repetition (burns, cracks, stars) that reweights loss into language.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete return of objects: cracked box, marble, constellations—survival’s language is fracture, not wholeness. No moralizing; final line lets the ridge silence speak. Subtext in Elias’s thumb tracing the fissure shows acceptance of brokenness without announcement. Insight is earned: “innocence lost was not virtue destroyed but merely the price of fluency” arises from lived recounting, not assertion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person POV remains tight to Maya; diction (“slow dance of celestial bodies,” “arithmetic of loss”) is lyrical yet consistent with a firefighter who has bargained with stars. Rhythm modulates: longer cadences for reflection, clipped fragments for sensory memory (“door handle that had melted”). No head-hopping; Elias’s interior is read through gesture and silence. Voice sustains controlled grandeur without slipping into purple.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but purposeful—“ash of the Blackwood fire” packs origin, color, and history. Mixed metaphors are few and functional (“constellations that rivaled the stars” is POV-justified). No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or stakes. Occasional elevated phrasing (“conceptual repricing,” “universal language”) is earned by context, not register drift.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh angle: firefighter trauma translated into linguistic salvage rather than heroic rescue. Cracked porcelain as portable shrine for unclosed grief is specific and memorable. Risk in lyric compression pays off—no stock PTSD tropes, no tidy redemption. Could edge higher if valley geography or Blackwood fire had one non-generic detail to ground uniqueness.</comment>
