<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s eroded ambition and contradictory need to hoard then surrender regret are embodied in every micro-choice; the moment she opens her mouth and “let the years pour out” crystallizes a lifetime of internal conflict with visible cost, earning the trade with her ghost. The scavenger identity is more label than lived-in trade—no concrete scavenging tactics appear—so motivation borders on emblematic, not individuated, keeping this just below the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the instant Mara and ghost swap solidity, the timeline re-weights and the carousel restarts, undeniable conceptual cost on the page. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—spiral images, sound-fragments, and regret-crystals layer until the cadence shift at the mirror charges meaning. No orientation debt; who/where taught by line 3, pattern of elision taught early and paid off. Minor waver: “chronologically confused” is asserted more than demonstrated in causal beats, a hairline slip that keeps it from 9.5.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Kinetic lagoon, vapor-against-gravity, and creaking cooling metal are tactile, selective, and coherently choreographed; the mirror-polished brass pole at carousel-center literally refracts choice and charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate. Sensory hierarchy stays tilted to Mara’s scavenger eye—she notices salvageable sound, not panoramic vistas—so detail never clogs momentum. Spatial logic immaculate; boots sink, platform shudders, bodies swap solidity without a single impossible position.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will Mara surrender her regret or stay fractured—is signaled in paragraph four and tightens when the ghost demands “the specific weight” rather than the collected stories. The deepening is accretive, not causal: each sound-fragment adds mass until refusal becomes impossible; the final trade-off forecloses her old solidity, price unmistakable. One meaningful intensification suffices under Accumulative lens; no reversals required. Could edge higher if a mid-scene tactical loss (camera jam, lagoon surge) had actively tested her resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges entirely through the physics of regret: stories as ballast, scavenging as self-theft, carousel restart as continuity bought by self-dispossession. No moralizing line ever articulates the lesson; instead the closing image of “dormant seeds” regrown in daylight reweights prior material with Conceptual Repricing. Ambiguity lingers—who exactly rides the horse?—but complexity is coherent, not confusing, inviting reread.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lush yet controlled: vapor “swirls against gravity’s logic,” regret “compressed layers of compromise and fear”—metaphors thick but never mixed, rhythm taught early and held. Compression like “chronologically confused” is pattern-not noise, paid off at the mirror. Perceptual signature sharp: Mara notices salvageable sound, feels weight in her palms, sees only what can be traded—every clause bears her scavenger bias. No head-hopping; ghost speaks in temporal chord but stays exterior, preserving distance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; sentence lengths breathe with discovery then tighten into short declaratives at the trade. Density high—each line does setting + metaphor + interiority—yet clarity intact. No loops, no synonym churn, no filter-verb stacks; “let the years pour out” is show, not tell. One microscopic snag: “dandelion seeds” and “dormant seeds” create faint echo; not quite loop but keeps this from 9.0.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Regret-as-physical-currency, sound-fragments harvested by disposable camera, and carousel-as-temporal-mirror synthesize into a premise that feels inevitable yet wholly fresh. Risk—lyric non-linear time—is taught by line 2 and never breaks causality; payoff is the image of seeds grown in light, reframing scavenging as self-reseeding. Specificity throughout: “rusted copper crown,” “cooling metal creak,” not generic steampunk. Could not swap names/places without collapsing the lagoon physics; transformation is integral, not ornamental.</comment>
