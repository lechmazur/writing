<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira’s contradictory impulses—grief for her sister vs. duty to the Archivists—are dramatized in the shell-raising beat; the final choice to “sing her sister home” costs her the clean absolution she sought, fulfilling the 9+ test. Interiority stays concrete (“reed-blown melancholy,” “teeth rather than heard”). One label-slip—“she understood at last”—is cushioned by immediate embodied action, so only a hairline dip.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the Echoed Ones shift from victims to seeds, reweighting the premise with undeniable social cost. Causal lens holds: shell angle → voices → decision to revere rather than exploit. Progressive disclosure is the because-chain engine. Cost is legible in the final line—“echo became choice, not capture”—which forecloses the Archivists’ original use. Minor orientation waiver: starlight & nexus are taught by 120 words and serve the closing image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The shell’s jagged spiral and the sandstone worn “smooth by ancient floods” are tactile constraints that guide Mira’s barefoot descent and final shell-angle calculation. Starlight columns and cosmic hum narrow perception to the resonant key moment. No tourist catalog; every environmental detail is filtered through her perceptual bias. Meets 9+ gate: the shell-as-micro-setting directly charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—why her sister echoes—tightens when the shell reveals the seed-archive truth, forcing Mira to choose between veneration and exploitation. Agency is hers: she raises the shell, then sings to re-pattern the nexus. Cost is felt: she accepts perpetual guardianship, foreclosing personal absolution. One meaningful tightening suffices; no reversals required.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: conservation of memory vs. consent. The shell’s reprise reweights the moral calculus—archival immortality is glorious yet stolen. Final image offers resonant non-literal answer: “echo became choice, not capture.” No sermonizing; ambiguity lingers about who will honor the seeds.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person hovers at Mira’s perceptual frequency—“vibration she felt in her teeth”—maintaining stable psychic distance. Syntax lengthens under starlight awe, then fractures into short beats at shell-song climax, mirroring pressure. No head-hopping; Archivists speak only when spoken to. Diction stays within her lexicon; “ley lines,” “resonance key” are taught objects, not authorial intrusion.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or causality. Figurative layer is dense yet purposeful—“arteries of stone,” “frozen river of light”—teaching the cosmic/corporeal braid that closure reprises. No mixed metaphors; sandstone, starlight, shell keep physical logic intact. One clause—“dust of centuries”—could feel stock, but it’s immediately grounded by bare-foot sensation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses geo-acoustic immortality with consent ethics—fresh synthesis beyond stock climate-fantasy. The seashell-as-encyclopedia trope is transformed through acoustic geometry and sister-specific grief. Risky lyric compression taught early (“universe hummed its secret song”) pays off in the final re-patterning song. Specificity anchors novelty: Cataract Gorge, quartz-shadow sister, red-rock acoustics.</comment>
