<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mara’s hunger-to-creation arc is embodied in every tactile beat—fingers itch, hands tremble, she kneels, paints air—so the resurrection of joy feels earned. Interior contradiction pulses (“pensive yet genuine” laughter) and the final clasping of the fresco fragment crystallizes a micro-choice that forecloses return to numbness. No secondary character on page, so relationship bullets N/A. Voice, gesture, and memory interleave without lapsing into diagnostic self-talk.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each layer of light-painted memory tightens the stake of “can joy re-ignite?” until the fog-gallery reconfigures meaning. Closure is a Charged Poise—she pockets the daydream-negative with visible cost (the grove dissolves, waking world awaits). Causality is interior but coherent: because the trees show fresco → because fresco pulses → therefore she paints light → therefore film blooms → therefore she smiles, now light-sensitive again. Orientation anchored by word 52 (“ruined orchard district”), no penalties.</comment>

<comment>Fog is not backdrop but reactive medium—curls like stale wool, lifts only for the final sunbeam that “completes the exposure,” directly charging closure. Ceramic chime beneath moss, bioluminescent roots, and phosphorescent pigment ground every beat in tactile specificity. Camera-obscura box and fresco fragment serve as micro-settings that constrain her method and final talisman. Environment shapes tactics: fog accepts light-paint, roots amplify glow, orchard provides hanging branches—choices impossible elsewhere.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“can she feel chromatic joy again?”—is signaled in first paragraph and escalates through each coat of light. The deepening occurs when ancient root-glow joins her phosphorescent strokes, narrowing isolation to collaboration; cost is the ephemeral gallery that dissolves, leaving only the palm-sized fresco and the knowledge of sensitivity regained. Agency is present-tense creation, not memory; coincidence (finding film strips) complicates rather than resolves. One meaningful tightening suffices; it lands.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: creation outlasts ruin, joy is latent not lost. No declarative thesis; the painted fruit that ripens in phantom light reweights earlier “ancient mirth” into living promise. Subtext pulses in networked trees—communal memory sustaining solitary artist. Final negative-in-pocket image invites counter-readings: is the rebirth fragile, provisional, cumulative? Complexity without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Perceptual signature filters every phrase through chromatic synesthesia—“taste of silver and rain,” “chromatic joy,” “shouting symphonies of color.” Syntax lengthens and contracts with emotional breath; fog sentences drift, light-paint sentences spark. No dialogue, so dialogue bullets N/A. Free-indirect texture stays tight to Mara’s lexicon; no register drift. Patterned elision (“hours or perhaps mere breaths”) is taught early and paid off at fold-out closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm breathes with escalating cadence; clauses tighten as light-paint accelerates. Dense figurative language is purposeful—each metaphor performs exposure chemistry: “silver halides eager,” “alchemical marriage.” Zero paraphrase loops; no mixed metaphors; props track (camera box, tin, film strips). Final beam “completing the exposure” is precise technical closure. Opening and closing lines frame voice and afterglow respectively.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Mycorrhizal knowledge network as memory-curator, fog as darkroom, and phosphorescent pigment as living emulsion synthesize into an image-system unavailable elsewhere. Risk of lyric diffusion is held by strict chemical metaphors that tether awe to process. The fresco fragment’s survival via fog-protection turns conservation science into tender metaphor without lecturing. Feels inevitable in hindsight yet non-obvious on entry.</comment>
