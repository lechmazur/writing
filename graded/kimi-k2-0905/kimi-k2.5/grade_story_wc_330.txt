<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elias’s muteness, carpenter patience, and the moment his throat “unlocked” are vividly embodied; the thirteen-year silence is the only label-heavy beat. Micro-choice—cupping the fragment and deciding to return with tools—crystallizes his shift from witness to maker with visible cost (voice reclaimed yet still solitary). Interior contradiction (silence as prison vs workshop) drives every beat; no second character on page so relationship bullets waived. Earned stasis: he accepts the continued burden of rebuilding alone, halo fragment warm against chest—price felt.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of hush → chime → mist → song layers density until the final cadence reweights silence as generative. Orientation anchored by line 3; no causality breaks. Closure is Charged Poise: fragment hums, light scatters like seeds—conceptual cost (he must now act). One shard/one scene, within length. No meaningful tightening beyond the single song-beat, but the cadence shift suffices for 600-word scope.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Abandoned train greenhouse, broken pipe mist, and birch forest are tactile and POV-filtered; shattered glass and velvet rot constrain movement and mood. Halo fragment’s “whispering gleam” recurs as micro-setting that charges the final image. Spatial choreography clean: dining car → impossible corridor → oasis → exit. Environment directly shapes the beat: mist thickens when fragment vibrates, ferns unfurl—setting participates in causality.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake: transform silence into creative motion. Pressure escalates via sensory layering (bells → mist → song) under Accumulative lens; no external antagonist needed. One meaningful tightening: song activates fragment, foreclosing the option to remain merely listener. Cost legible—he leaves still solitary, pocket humming with future labor.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete reversal: silence not absence but fertile space. Final image of light-scattering seeds reweights prior “emptiness” without moralizing. Recurring halo fragment and misting hush accumulate meaning; no late motif graft. Subtext in gesture—clasping fragment to chest—carries the emotional aftershock.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Elias’s carpenter perception: notices wood grain, brass gears, “velvet rot.” Syntax mirrors patience—long sentences, latinate nouns—then fragments under song burst. No dialogue, so voice distinction bullet waived. No head-hopping; perceptual signature consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentence openings avoid template cadence. Figurative language dense yet purposeful—pattern taught early (“misting hush”) and paid off. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn. One mixed metaphor risk: “seed pod” adjacent to “compass” but context keeps logic intact. High information density; each sentence advances image or stakes.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Carousel carpenter who regains voice via antique halo fragment feels fresh; combines maker-craft with lyric ghost-circus without gimmick. Transformation test fails if swapped to generic relic, proving specificity. Risk in lyric accumulative structure is earned—closure legible. No close echoes of famous scenes.</comment>
