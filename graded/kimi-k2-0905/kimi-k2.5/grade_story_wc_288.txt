<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mira’s contradictory impulses—mourning her past identity vs. forging a solitary future—are vividly embodied in her handling of the sundial and her willingness to sit inside the humming stones. The reincarnation memory is not just backstory; it tilts her present micro-choices (climbing the terrace, placing the dial, staying cross-legged) and produces a credible renunciation with visible cost: the “last fragile piece of her old self snap cleanly away.” Interiority stays concrete, never drifts into label-speak. Earned stasis is reached, but the beat is single-track; no secondary character pressure is possible, so the crucible is purely intra-subjective—sufficient for this length but capping the top band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the hovering sundial and pulse-shift from hum to heartbeat reconfigure Mira’s isolation into chosen solitude with undeniable conceptual cost (she foregoes the hope of physical return). Accumulative/textural lens holds throughout: imagistic density (cloud-ocean, coral shelves, coherent light) tightens until the final cadence reweights the stake. Causality is internal but coherent—each reflective paragraph is anchored to a present tactile cue and alters her next move. Orientation is clear by ~100 words; no teleporting props or soft resets.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The tidal library, basalt circle, and atomically reflective sundial aren’t ornament; they constrain action (the circle’s magnetic field literally levitates the dial) and mirror the internal shift (library “breathes” as Mira learns to breathe alone). Sensory hierarchy obeys Mira’s focalization: she notices magnetic resonance in her teeth before she sees light beams. Micro-setting (the brass surface) charges the final image by showing sky instead of her face. Consistent stratospheric physics and spatial choreography keep the floating world legible.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—translate isolation into independence—is signaled in paragraph four and tightens through one meaningful deepening: the realization that coexistence means accepting atmospheric dispersion rather than resurrection. No external antagonist is needed; pressure is situational and accumulative. The final hover of the dial is the visible price/turn that forecloses the old longing. Cost is legible on-page; escalation is single-arc but sufficient for 700-word scope.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the inversion of extinction: absence becomes medium, loss becomes ground for self-definition. No moral is stated; the final image of the sundial-lantern that “needs no flame” reweights all prior mourning into self-sufficiency. Subtext resides in physical gestures—letting the old self snap away—rather than exposition. The concept of “brittle awakening” is dramatized, not asserted, satisfying the aftereffect test.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Mira’s perceptual signature: she feels subsonic hum in teeth, notices light equations on stone before intellect labels them. Syntax elongates in calmer moments, fragments under resonance crescendo, matching pulse. No dialogue appears; voice distinction is therefore judged on interior texture, which remains idiosyncratic and stable. Lexicon stays within her plausible frame even when elevated (“cerulean expanse”) because the library milieu licenses it.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but not purple; figurative language is patterned (cloud-ocean, frozen lightning) and pays off in the final sky-reflection. No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected. Strong verbs (“surge,” “snap,” “crystallize”) carry motion without modifier clutter. One mixed-metaphor risk—“brittle awakening crystallize within her”—is forgiven because the narrative immediately grounds it in frost-on-window image. Closure beat is free of artifacts.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Synthesis of extinct cloud-beings whose consciousness becomes atmospheric rivers feels fresh and inevitable; no close genre echo. Risk-taking in floating-library setting heightens solitude theme without gimmickry. The brass sundial’s atomic reflectivity is transformed from antique tool to cosmic mirror, charging the final self-sky confrontation. Transformation test passes: swap setting or object and the emotional arc collapses.</comment>
