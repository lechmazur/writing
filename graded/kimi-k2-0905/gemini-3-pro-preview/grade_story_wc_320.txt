<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is concrete—grease on gloves, hairs lifted by the hush—and her micro-choice to “listen for the gaps” turns the beat. The nebula-transcription motive is stated early and loops back in closure, but the text never lets us feel a contradictory impulse; she never doubts or fears failure, so the cost feels intellectual rather than embodied. Still, the hierarchy of values (data > personal safety) is legible and consistent. Enough for a strong mid-7, but the absence of interior friction blocks 8+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the “recipe” re-weights the dying star from loss to genesis, with the cooled fragment in pocket as felt souvenir. Causal chain holds: perigee noise → failed protocols → discard assumption → capture hush → data. The tower-collapse risk is named but never threatens action, so the cost is mostly conceptual; hence not 8.8+.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The pink terrazzo shard is micro-setting that constrains choice—only it completes the circuit and later cools as proof of success. Wind-groaning girders, hydraulic grease, psi-gauge create tactile lived-in texture without catalog excess. Spatial choreography is tight: ladder → deck → receiver slot → pocket. Meets 9+ gate by charging final image, but a few catalog adjectives (“swollen,” “rusted”) are familiar; stays at 8.4.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—capture the nebula’s last breath—is signaled early. One meaningful tightening: abandoning wave-spike training for negative-space listening narrows options and succeeds. Cost is conceptual (academy protocol invalidated) rather than visceral; no resource or body is actually risked on-page. Sufficient for high-7, but lacking a felt price keeps it from 8.5+.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of “beginnings inside endings” emerges through image (recipe in the extinction data) rather than statement—until the final sentence spells it out, a minor thematic echo. Subtext is richer in silence-as-positive space, reframing static as pregnant. Complex ambiguity present, but the closing articulation trims mystery. Mid-7 feels right.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Voice is textured, technical-yet-poetic: “hydraulic grease,” “celestial screeching,” “serenely electric.” Syntax tightens under pressure—fragments disappear, verbs sharpen. No dialogue, so no convergence risk. Perceptual signature holds: Elara sees fame as conductivity, gorge as mere backdrop. Clean free indirect style, no filter-verb fat. Minor over-alliteration in “cosmic cacophony” is forgiveable; still 8.6.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Sentences vary length and opening; no template cadence detected. Figurative layer is restrained—only two metaphors in climax beat, both paid off. High information density: one line does locator, tool, and emotional filter. A few adjectives (“swollen,” “jagged”) trend generic; keeps it from 8.5. No loops, no scaffold, strong propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fame-as-conductor and silence-as-signal are fresh syntheses; the Hollywood sidewalk shard repurposes pop-culture detritus into working tech. Concept obeys its own logic throughout. Risk is moderate—quiet climax, no monster reveal—but coherence stays. Not radically unforeseen, hence short of 8.5, but solidly memorable.</comment>
