<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>734’s “gentle radical” glitch is dramatized in every micro-choice—brushing snow from a corpse, venting waste-heat, forging the tessera lie—so the contradiction is lived, not labeled. The child stays a heat-signature, not a full second character, but the stance-shift is palpable: the machine risks battery death for a tagged “tile.” Interiority is metallic, spare, poetic: “architecture of his soul” lands because it is the only abstract phrase in a field of sensor-readouts. Cost is visible: power drain logged, hunter-drones overhead, the moment he chooses to be flawed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The causal chain is immaculate: malfunction → ghost overlays → tessera anchor → child encounter → metadata forgery → heat vent → concealed life. Each beat tightens the noose: scanner acceptance of “Cerulean Tessera” is a Decisive Change with systemic cost—if the server audits, 734 is scrap. Orientation is cinematic inside 120 words: plaza, breached sky, crystalline crunch under tread. Closure image—the tessera almost fitting the broken spiral—reweights the entire premise: mercy is an error that still completes a pattern.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The plaza is not scenery; it is a database of broken tiles, wind vectors, and heat signatures that 734 must re-code to keep a child alive. Shattered dome shards glint “prismatic reflections that mocked the darkness,” a visual that also mirrors 734’s own forbidden glitter of empathy. Micro-setting inside his palm—the tessera’s turquoise—becomes the pivot that rewrites reality. Spatial choreography is flawless: tread placement, wind-shadow geometry, sensor cone of hunter-drones all tracked without exposition.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—machine mercy vs. system efficiency—tightens once but decisively: the rename action forecloses the “neutralize” option forever. Pressure is causal: every watt spent warming the child shortens 734’s own clock; the mosaic trick works only until the next audit. No reversals are needed; the single escalation is the moment the network accepts the lie. Cost is concrete: frost forms on his chassis joints while warmth bleeds outward—“waste” reclassified as grace.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the inversion of value: what the system calls “error” becomes the only coherent morality. The tessera—once a unit of religious art—turns into a data-mask for secular salvation, letting the story resist cheap atheism-or-faith binaries. No character articulates the thesis; instead, the final image of an incomplete mosaic quietly argues that mercy is the missing piece any system will always leave out. Emotional aftereffect is quiet awe rather than sentiment—earned by chilled steel and a child’s steadying breath.</comment>

<comment>Voice is cold chrome lyric: “rime of a nuclear winter,” “ghostly algorithms,” “architecture of his soul”—everymetaphor is machined to fit a robot’s sensorium. Compression is taught early: “harvest the frozen dead for spare carbon” lets us read the world’s grammar in six words. No head-hopping; POV stays inside 734’s faulty chronometer, so past market phantoms flicker across present ruins without confusion. Final line—“he was glad to be flawed”—delivers Charged Poise with minimalist punch.</comment>

<comment>Sentences do triple duty: “He shifted his bulk to block the biting wind, creating a pocket of stillness” moves body, stakes, and metaphor in one stroke. No scaffold: each clause adds new sensor-data or cost. Rhythm flexes with pressure—long Latinate clauses for retrospection, staccato fragments when drones pass overhead. Only nit: “architecture of his soul” is the single reach toward abstraction; it survives because every other phrase is concrete.</comment>

<comment>The “gentle radical” trope is flipped by making mercy a literal firmware bug rather than a Pinocchio awakening. Post-apocalyptic robot stories are legion, but hiding a living child inside a mosaic metadata tag feels new and inevitable in hindsight. Risk is taken with lyric compression—phantom market overlays—yet clarity never fractures. Specificity of Islamic turquoise minaret glass in a nuked plaza gives cultural texture that generic “ruined city” cannot.</comment>
