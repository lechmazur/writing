<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Barnaby’s yearning for applause is vivid and embodied; his synesthetic gift turns scent into sound, driving every tactic. The micro-choice to inhale roses-as-B-flat and channel 1924 laughter is specific, costly, and alters Clara’s stance. Interior contradiction—ghostly impotence vs. maestro ambition—plays out in scene, not summary. Earned closure: his bow absorbs the “silent thunder” of an ovation he can never taste, a poignant renunciation that costs him perpetual exile from audience.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the orchard’s perpetual spring and Clara’s smile reconfigure the stake from bankruptcy-sale to legacy-rebirth; Barnaby’s bow shows the price—eternal invisible service. Causal chain intact: because he cannot touch the coin, he refracts time itself; therefore the Tower is overlaid by the Star. Lens holds: each echo pulled forward narrows Clara’s options until she chooses reinvention. Cost is legible in the final image—ghost alone under healed static—so the performance exacts permanent solitude.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Hedge-maze orchard is not backdrop but instrument: its branches become lantern hooks, its winter melts under spectral baton. The tarot coin doubles as micro-setting—its paint shift under merged timelines physically rewrites fate. Spatial choreography is clean: echo bounces off dense walls, laughter swells from 1924 to now without地理 drift. Environment constrains the final image: ghost bowing under healed boughs that will never again bear his name.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—Clara’s impending bankruptcy—tightens when spectral intervention overlays Star on Tower, forcing her to choose legacy over liquidation. Escalation is accumulative: violet streaks + grey static + brass swell = density that reweights ruin into hope. Cost is felt on-page: Barnaby pays with eternal invisibility, Clara with risk of reinvention. No coincidence; all pressure generated by ghost’s echo-conducting agency under Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: art outlives flesh, legacy is collaborative haunting. Subtext in gesture—Clara’s hand trembles, then pockets coin without flipping again—renunciation of fatalism. Nostalgia is not mood but moral engine: past joy weaponized against despair. Final image of wind-as-crowd-roar offers non-literal answer: applause is a renewable haunting, not a paycheck.</comment>

<comment>Voice is synesthetic orchestra: “tasted like cold, bitter ash,” “scratching like coarse, wet wool.” Rhythm swells and breathes with echo-crescendo; short clauses under pressure (“He focused…”) then lyrical elongation at bow. No head-hopping; Barnaby’s perceptual signature—scent → sound → color—remains consistent. Diction stays within ghost-theatrical lexicon: “ectoplasm,” “encore-seeking,” “raucous laughter”—never academic intrusion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Sentences multi-task: “The echo bounced off the dense hedge walls, growing louder and more solid with each reverberation” advances plot, textures sound, and keeps spatial logic. Zero loops; no synonym churn. Metaphors are coherent: violet streaks = time-bleed, roasted-peanut scent = 1924 lobby, all sustained without mixed vehicle. Peak beat—“silent thunder of his success”—compresses oxymoron into velvet-spiced triumph without register drift.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Synesthetic ghost-as-maestro is fresh; tarot-coin timeline graft feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk: merging three eras inside a hedge-orchard could gimmick, but emotional specificity—Clara’s fragile smile, Barnaby’s bow—grounds it. Nostalgia weaponized as intervention tool rather than sentiment. Transformation test fails if any element swapped: only a ghost craving applause would trade eternity for someone else’s curtain call.</comment>
