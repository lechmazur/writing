<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Julian’s “terrifying, radical candor” is shown through his stillness and the offer of the ink; Elena remains a symbol rather than a full interior. The micro-choice to hand Vance the pot crystallizes his ethic, but Elena’s mirrored terror is told, not embodied. Interior contradiction is hinted but not dramatized under pressure. Enough for high-band, not for 8.8+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: because Julian inherits honesty, therefore he wields the ink; because the ink liquefies rigidity, therefore Vance signs. Closure is a Decisive Change with conceptual cost—Vance’s worldview breached. Orientation is clean by word 80; no teleporting props. The breach is earned, not lucky. Slight stretch: ink’s rule is asserted, not pre-taught, but payoff justifies the late rule.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stainless steel tables and porcelain embalming sink ground us in tactile sterility; ozone scent of ink gives the uncanny lift. Spatial choreography is flawless—bodies, tray, door tracked. The prep room’s chemical warmth vs. rainy chill externalizes the deathly vitality tone. Ink as micro-setting constrains the final choice—meets 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—Elena’s life—signaled in paragraph four. Tightening occurs when Vance crosses the threshold; ink offer is the irreversible trade that forecloses his denial. Cost is conceptual: Vance’s binary code dissolves, leaving him “terrified by his own humanity.” One clean escalation under causal lens; no gratuitous reversals.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of fair-trade mathematics emerges from Julian’s gesture, not exposition. Subtext is carried in silence and the ink’s vaporized logic. Final image of “truth as the most potent magic” is borderline thematic echo but saved by its placement in Julian’s interior, not narrator sermon. Resonant reconfiguration achieved; avoids tidy moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited adheres to Julian; no head-hop. Voice has surgical cadence—methodical, antiseptic, then ozone-tinged. “Marinate in the uncomfortable silence of the dead” is a vivid perceptual signature. Free indirect style stays clean; Vance’s tremor is observed, not ventriloquized. Minor register lift in “mathematics of a fair trade” but fits Julian’s idiosyncratic motive.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence. Density is high—each line advances stake or tone. Figurative language is spare, ozone/liquify metaphor kept coherent. One mixed metaphor “breach of social protocol” is minor. No scaffold or synonym loops; pronoun reference clean. Final line “truth…most potent magic” borders on maxim, but cadence earns it.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Fair-trade ethics distilled into a literal ink that dissolves bureaucratic rigidity is a fresh conceptual hinge. Funeral-home-as-negotiation-table reweights institutional sterility. Risk is taken in the magical rule, yet it pays off causally. Not quite 9.0 because the ink’s attribute is declared rather than discovered, reducing hindsight inevitability.</comment>
