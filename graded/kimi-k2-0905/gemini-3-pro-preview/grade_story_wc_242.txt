<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Silas’s “teach endings to begin” creed is conjured in the last line rather than forged in micro-choices under pressure; interiority slips into lyric label (“impossible geometry of their pain”) instead of embodied contradiction, so the final renunciation feels asserted, not earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly as Charged Poise: the dissonant chord severs the loop and the operator sits in “pregnant” silence, cost felt. Causal chain is thin—why this pitch shatters that grief is asserted magic—but at this length one crystallizing beat suffices; orientation holds early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Condensation on the spinning glass, voltage meter spike, and wet-shadow tunnel texture coil around the moment of intervention; the booth’s iron guts and third-ral Reply grit constrain Silas’s reach and charge the final stillness, satisfying the 9+ gate for object-as-setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—can Silas disrupt the emotional loop without destroying the callers—tightens once when he risks the dissonant chord; the price is the callers’ abrupt departure and his own renewed isolation, legible under a causal lens. Escalation is single-note but sufficient.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Theme of anonymized mercy emerges through the mechanics of wrong-number patch-ins and the withheld names; the final image reframes “ending” as fertile silence without moralizing. Subtext resides in the glass screech that severs addiction to grief, a resonant non-literal answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person lens keeps psychic distance consistent; diction (“bleeding underground arteries,” “cultivated estrangement”) is lush yet anchored in Silas’s technician-poet sensibility. Rhythm climbs with clause-lengthening until the disruptive chord, then cuts to stark silence—effective modulation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Strong density—most sentences carry tactile detail plus plot function. Occasional lyric pile-up (“vibrating with the distant rumble… and the closer, sharper resonance”) slightly dilutes the urgent beat; no paraphrase loops or mixed metaphors, but one filter-verb cluster near the spike keeps it sub-8.8.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Turning a glass harmonica and obsolete switchboard into psychic dialysis feels fresh; the “wrong-number confessional” reframes urban anonymity as deliberate ministry. Concept risks gimmick but grounds itself in sensory procedure, yielding a specific synthesis rather than borrowed surrealism.</comment>
