<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elias’s face-blindness is more than a label: it dictates why he alone stays behind, how he “sees” the coin’s ridges instead of a monarch, and why touch, not sight, unlocks the sky. The contradiction—an artist who cannot recognize faces—drives every micro-choice and gives the ending its cost: he can paint infinity but can’t preserve himself inside it. Interiority stays concrete (“topography of ridges, pores, and shadows”) and avoids diagnostic cliché. The only slack is the absence of a second on-page character, so status/relationship crucible bullets are moot but not missed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal chain is clean: because he is face-blind → he stays → he must finish the ceiling → he needs the hidden pattern → he finds the coin → translates it by touch → paints the sky → accepts impermanence. Anchor (who/where/when) lands within 60 words; no orientation debt. Closure is Earned Stasis: he sits, eyes closed, foreclosing escape so the art can exist for one breath. Cost is legible—“the perfection of the work was bound to the fragility of its medium”—and reweights the premise. Minor slack: demolition clock is external, not a choice he can alter, so agency is reactive, not proactive.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The hollow redwood is not backdrop but tool: its curved grain becomes the canvas, its bark hides the coin, its ceiling becomes the sky. Sensory hierarchy obeys Elias’s haptic bias—sound is vacuum, light is secondary, texture is everything. Micro-setting (the coin’s micro-grooves) literally enables the climax. Spatial choreography is flawless: ladder, chalk, dust fall, rumble, sit—every object tracked.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“mirror the sky before the walls fall”—is signaled early and tightens once: the clouds fail until the coin reveals the fractal key. Escalation is situational: external demolition pressure compresses time, forcing tactile translation instead of visual. Cost is visible: he drops chalk, chest heaves, accepts annihilation. No live reversal he can control, so tightening is external rather than a trade-off he initiates; this caps intensity just below the 8.5 gate.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: art’s infinity vs. mortality, perception vs. recognition, finite medium vs. infinite desire. The coin’s recursive swirls reprice the entire quest—what seemed failure becomes the hidden blueprint. Final image (sky painted inside a doomed trunk) reweights the premise: beauty exists because it will vanish. No moralizing, only charged particulars. Ambiguity is purposeful: is the sky a triumph or a tomb? Both.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Voice is tactile, compressed, rhythmic: “vacuum of sound,” “pendulum of pure geometry.” Syntax mirrors Elias’s perceptual warp—long sentences for breathless ascent, then short drop: “He dropped his hand.” No head-hopping; POV stays strictly inside his haptic filter. Diction stays within his lexicon; no academic register drift. Dialogue absent by design; narrative voice carries all subtext.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but breathable: “fractally precise, repeating in ever-smaller iterations that defied the naked eye but sang to his tactile sense” does three jobs—image, metaphor, plot key. No loops, no scaffold, no mixed metaphors. Rhythm accelerates with chalk strokes, then halts on “He dropped his hand.” Only hairline slip: “manufactured heaven” risks cliché, but context recharges it.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Synthesis feels inevitable: face-blind portraitist + fractal coin + doomed library = fresh angle on ephemerality. No close echoes; the redwood-as-gallery and coin-as-blueprint are non-obvious. Risk—quiet ending inside annihilation—pays off by making stillness the final weapon. Conceptual integrity complete: if any element swapped, the whole collapses.</comment>
