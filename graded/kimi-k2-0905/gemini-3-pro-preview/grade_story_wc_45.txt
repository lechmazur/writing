<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Thorne’s interior contradiction—scientist confronting the impossible—drives every beat; the shift from clinical removal to yearning for the magic is embodied in the tactile tooth and the decision to “reset” grief. The micro-choice to bypass the stethoscope for bone-setting tools crystallizes his hierarchy of values under pressure. Cost is visible: he risks professional credibility and emotional safety to offer parents a navigable lie. Minor slip: “shrewdly innocent” is applied to the fae, not self-diagnosed, so the trait feels attributed rather than enacted by him.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the wooden corpse is re-declared a “map,” reweighting death into possibility; parents feel the cost of hope in their swallowed tears. Causal lens holds throughout—each beat because/therefore linkage hinges on the tooth evidence forcing reframing. No orientation debt: who/where/when anchored by line 3. Persistent constraint—Thorne must speak before the parents see the body—shapes final tactics. Final image of “terrifying, beautiful hope” lands undeniable social cost: they will live inside his placebo constellation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Garden, maze, and tooth function as micro-setting that constrains choice: the enclosed secrecy allows Thorne to perform his metaphysical splint unseen. Fog and roses filter through his medical eye—”ancient roses watching”—merging sensorium with stakes. Spatial choreography is flawless; no floating bodies. Hedge rustle signals approaching parents, tightening clock. Garden’s breath-holding mirrors family’s suspended grief, charging the final alignment of lie-to-truth.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—parents’ need for a survivable narrative—tightens when Thorne realizes anger will “close the door forever.” Agency: he forecloses the path of宣告死亡, choosing instead to fabricate a celestial map; price is his own certainty. Escalation driven by his because/therefore deductions from tooth → wooden anatomy → lie-to-splint. No coincidence; every intensifier is causal. Felt cost legible in his trembling leaves and the parents’ terrified hope.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: the heuristic power of controlled falsehood—lie as splint, constellation as grief prosthetic. Tooth reappears as first star, reweighting substitute body from terminus to path; this conceptual repricing is the thematic climax. Ambiguity is preserved: hope is also torture. No moralizing; final whispered “We reset it so it heals stronger” is action, not thesis. Emotional aftereffect is concrete: reader feels the ache of living inside a necessary fiction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Thorne’s medical perceptual filter—driftwood texture, bone-setting lexicon. Syntax mirrors clinician precision then fractures slightly under wonder: “yearn not for the restoration of the mundane.” No head-hopping. Diction stays within Victorian physician register; “metaphysical joint” is as far as metaphysics intrudes, keeping plausibility. Distinctive rhythmic uptick in final paragraph matches parents’ dawn of understanding, voice modulating with emotional crescendo.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; density high—single sentences fuse action, image, stakes: “He adjusted his spectacles, feeling a strange surge of nostalgic innovation.” Metaphors are controlled and non-contradictory: wooden body as “fallen statue” aligns with stillness, not elasticity. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line recharges “constellation” motif with new emotional valence. Micro-variation in sentence rhythm keeps propulsion; no filter-verb clusters.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: changeling lore reframed through orthopedic medicine, producing the unforgettable “splint for the family’s sanity.” Risk—treating grief as compound fracture—pays off; premise commits fully without retreat. Specificity of hedge maze → secret garden → tooth star map feels inevitable, not gimmick. Transformation test passed: swap magic or medicine and the emotional engine collapses. Nostalgic innovation tone feels author-discovered, not prompt-assembled.</comment>
