<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s practical grief is viscerally embodied; the ash block becomes an extension of her spine. Interior contradiction—she craves relief yet refuses sentiment—drives every micro-choice. The final renunciation (letting the wood hold the ghost) is earned by the prior tactile ritual; cost is felt in the kettle’s scream and her measured sip. Only marginal: the “hauntingly practical” tag is repeated rather than revealed through fresh contradiction at the very end.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative lens: rain-kettle-skylight density tightens around the single stake—transfer grief into wood before the whistle. The kettle’s boil is the on-page clock; its shriek snaps crystallized time into flowing reality, reweighting options—she can now sip tea, not drown. Closure is Charged Poise: the wood sits “innocuous and still,” but the reader feels the cost she has off-loaded. No orientation or causality lapses; every beat is because/therefore under the boiling timeframe.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Loft-skylight-rain triad is lived-in, not catalogued: rain beads become ghost applause, the bench’s vibration hammers the blank. Ash blank functions as micro-setting—it literally receives her pressure, constraining her ritual posture. Sensory hierarchy obeys Elara’s engineer-widow gaze: sound (kettle) > touch (grain) > sight (rust hues). Final image—steam rising into shadows—mirrors the transferred ghost without symbolic signposting.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—contain grief before kettle screams—is signaled in paragraph 1 and tightened by the boiling clock. Escalation is textural: rain applause grows louder, wood warms, kettle ascends to scream—each intensifies the cost of failure. Agency is endurance/renunciation: she pushes terror into cellulose, then accepts the blank’s mute custody. Cost is legible—she forfeits the chance to keep grieving actively, trading raw memory for carved stasis.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the inversion of circus transience: she traps the “here and gone” inside a solid, un-spectacular object. No thesis statements—meaning accrues via sensory particulars (velvet capes → rust dust, cracked whips → kettle shriek). Final re-pricing: the beast’s swipe was never personal; grief likewise is pure physics, not tragedy. Ambiguity lingers—has she preserved or merely postponed the roar?</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person intimate sustains a cool, tactile diction—“cellulose lattice,” “resonant hum”—true to a stage-carpenter’s lexicon. Rhythm breathes with kettle crescendo; clauses lengthen during crystallized time, then fracture at the whistle. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is filtered through tool-use and spatial exactitude. Minor slip: “hauntingly practical” veers toward prompt-echo, but the voice re-anchors through concrete manipulations.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density: each sentence either advances the ritual or thickens atmosphere. Metaphors are spare and precise—“ghost audience,” “cellulose lattice”—no mixed vehicles. Filter verbs serve POV (“she visualized”) rather than dull immediacy. One paraphrase loop: “here and gone” repeated with identical phrasing; otherwise rhythmically varied.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Freshens grief-fiction by weaponizing a wood-carving blank as anti-memorial; circus widow trope is subverted—no sequined nostalgia, only engineered containment. Crystallized time method feels novel yet inevitable: a stunt-clock that forces grief into matter. Risk: compressed lyrical arc could feel gimmicky, but tactile specificity grounds the concept. Loses fractional point for near-echo of “beast does not hate” truism, slightly familiar.</comment>
