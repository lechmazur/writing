<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mara’s hive-withdrawal tremor and Elias’s skeptic-turned-somatic-guide are vividly embodied; the diaphragm-hand-to-wrist beat enacts a credible micro-choice hierarchy. Interior contradiction—Mara’s craving for communion vs. terror of noise—stays physical, not therapeutic. Elias’s motivation to “paint the noise” is legible from first page and scales to the final cost: the lattice image that lets her endure the static. No stock epiphanies; the earned stasis is her quiet spine-straighten against the monitor.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: because Elias refuses the pill → he can guide; because Mara swallowed it → she shakes; therefore he tapes the geode and invents somatic choreography. One meaningful tightening at 3-min exposure narrows options from verbal to visceral. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—digital cathedral re-weights her “noise” into structure; cost is her tear catching the red standby light. Orientation anchored by word 40; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Velvet darkness, dim red standby, and black backdrop function as micro-setting that constrains movement to millimeters. Muscovite geode is handled, re-handled, and final-image charged; its pearlescent lattice becomes the literal environment of the photograph. Spatial choreography stays clean—camera aperture, taped crystal, chest-to-back breathing—no impossible positions. Sensory selection narrows to touch and monochrome light, matching crisis perception.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: can Mara endure neural static without retreat? Pressure escalates when verbal coaching fails → somatic method trialed → final image offers breathable structure. One visible price: Elias forfeits intellectual distance, merging bodies to steer the wand. Agency is shared; coincidence absent; escalation coherent under causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from particular: hive-collapse noise vs. human-scale pattern-making; no meta-commentary. Fractal lattice re-weights “chaos” into bearable beauty—Conceptual Repricing without moral tag. Subtext lives in gesture: his hand on diaphragm = belief in physiology over pharma. Resonance lingers in fragile digital glass, not asserted hope.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited anchors to Elias’s perceptual bias—“affectionate skeptic” diction colors every noun. Sentence rhythm mimics breath: long exposure sentences stretch; post-exposure short clauses collapse. No head-hop; psychic distance tightens as chest meets spine. Filter verbs minimal; “he felt her somatic response” is justified by bodily method.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Zero loops; high density—“velvet darkness” anchors tone and place in three syllables. Metaphors stay physical: lattice, cathedral, glass—no mixed vehicles. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with scene tempo. Opening and closing lines bookend with light imagery, satisfying cadence. No scaffold sentences; muscovite, aperture, diaphragm used with technical accuracy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Telepathy-pill fallout as lovers’ recovery studio is fresh; geode-as-lens is specific, not gimmick. Somatic choreography sidesteps clichéd “cure by love” trope—image offers endurance, not erasure. Risk-taking in blackout dance pays off in fractal photo. Could swap generic crystal, but muscovite’s pearlescent layers are irreplaceable to color fracture.</comment>
