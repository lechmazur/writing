<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Silas’s “turn questions into destinations” creed is dramatized through the duel-philosophy device and the prosthetic’s micro-choices; the interior contradiction between violence and diplomacy is felt, not declared. Kael’s silent plea is a sharp externalizer of relationship-as-crucible, though his back-story remains a silhouette. Final alignment costs Silas his tactical invulnerability (trapped blade, ozone scent), paying a visible price. Slight over-articulation of “diplomatically fierce” edges toward label-speak, preventing the final 0.1.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the Northern Door vector crystallizes peace as a live option and the blade-trap enacts its physical cost under glass. Causal lattice holds—each parry/riposte is a because/therefore argument that narrows to the single exit. Orientation anchor (who/where) arrives by line 3; no penalty. One tightening only, but it is meaningful and lens-consistent.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Glass atrium + brook + sundial form a micro-setting triad that literally steers footwork and shadow-angle choices; the northern door’s spatial payoff is inseparable from the climax. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true—Silas’s clockwork ear hears gears over water. Half-painted sundial acts as both prop and geography, constraining vector math in real time. No static postcard; every surface is tapped, scraped, or shadow-read.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“decode before Duke arrives”—is signaled in para 1 and tightened by each clash; the sundial’s misaligned bands literally shrink floor space. One decisive deepening: the needle-card shadow proves the exit, turning fight energy into diplomatic alignment. Cost is the hydraulic over-extension that traps Silas’s own prosthetic against the wall—he buys peace with temporary vulnerability. Agency is entirely on-page; coincidence complicates nothing.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of “violence as language” emerges through concrete duel-metaphor, never sermon. Subtext lives in Kael’s eyes and the ozone scent—no character utters a thesis. Final image reweights the sundial from abandoned art to covert map, achieving Conceptual Repricing without moral tag. Seamstress-tin motif returns charged, but its thematic punch is slightly under-cut by late reveal; prevents 8.5.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person tight stays inside Silas’s perceptual filter—measured clicks, pigment angles, seam-worn tin. Syntax mirrors duel tempo: longer clause for lunge, caesura for parry. No head-hop; Kael’s interior is inferred only through blade angle and eye-plea, preserving distance. Diction (“velvet doublets absorb sweat”) is period-appropriate yet precise; no register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but never purple; each metaphor (clock-countdown arm, diplomatic riposte) is paid off by motion. No synonym loops or template cadence; sentence rhythm accelerates with clash, then exhales at whisper. Information dual-loaded: “hydraulic force” conveys both tech and emotional pressure. One mixed metaphor—“unravel the other’s soul” slightly over-abstracts amid kinetic precision—drops the 0.2.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Fencing-as-argument + sundial-as-cipher + needle-card-as-codex synthesize into a fresh espionage micro-genre. Risks—mid-duel cipher solve, mechanical limb lock—pay off without gimmickry. Seamstress tin transforms from domestic kitsch to cryptographic key, an inversion that feels inevitable after shadow-vector reveal. Concept is bold yet internally coherent; proximity to trope of “duel that isn’t” is acknowledged but reweighted by geometry twist.</comment>
