<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elian’s calm, fearless collector persona is vivid, but interiority stays external; we see poise, not private contradiction. The micro-choice to weaponize embarrassment is sharp, yet the prior emotional risk feels declared (“integrate laughter”) rather than dramatized in his body or memory. Because the General’s laugh is the hinge, Elian’s own vulnerability remains off-stage, leaving motivation functional but not fully costed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Causal chain is clean: sour note → spectral turbulence → memory → release. Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elian foregoes further engagement once Thorne lightens, and the upward-spiral image carries visible cost—the gorge’s silence is now peaceful, not oppressive. Orientation anchors by line 6; no lens ambiguity. One soft spot: the tooth’s prior whereabouts arrive as exposition, not earned discovery.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Echo Gorge is rendered through acoustic micro-details that directly shape tactics; the harp’s dissonance is inseparable from the stone acoustics. Mist, twilight, and temperature drop are filtered through Elian’s practiced eye, never touristic. The final image of “luminous ache” reconfigures the same gorge from purgatorial to peacefully bright, meeting the 9+ gate but without an extra constraint twist.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Single dominant stake—free Thorne via laughter—signaled early. Pressure tightens when spectral confessions erupt and the General’s silence greets the tooth; the laugh itself is the decisive trade-off that dissolves his form. Cost is present but carried by Thorne; Elian’s risk remains implicit, not viscerally felt, keeping the score below 8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Theme of dignified absurdity emerges through the concrete tooth image, never sermonized. The reweighting of shame into shared laughter is performed on-stage, inviting the reader to feel the “beautiful pain” of healed regret. No tidy moral—just the spiral of light—leaves resonant ambiguity. The slight uptick rewards the elegant inversion of military dignity via farce.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</question>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Elian’s perceptions; diction (“sonic friction,” “purgatorial twilight”) is crisp, poetic yet filtered through a professional collector’s precision. No dialogue, so voice hinges on internal cadence; the clipped, deliberate syntax mirrors his methodical nature. Moments of compressed lyricism (“luminous ache”) are earned by earlier sensory scaffolding.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening, propelling the read-aloud rhythm. Metaphors stay acoustically coherent; no mixed vehicles. Only minor scaffold: “the heavy chains…shattered” leans cliché, but it occupies a single line and doesn’t touch the closure image. High density—each sentence layers atmosphere, tool action, or emotional stakes.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>The soul-collector who weaponizes dissonance and embarrassment rather than salt or iron feels fresh, yet the “regret atmosphere” and military-ghost tropes are familiar. Specificity of the taxidermy-crocodile lie and harp-as-lure elevates the concept beyond standard psychopomp tales. Risk lies in the tonal pivot from gothic to gentle farce, executed cleanly.</comment>
