<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—public sunlight vs. private shadow—is dramatized in the first third and drives her final micro-choice to paint the hush; the “quietly driven” trait is embodied, not labeled, and the tears cost is visible. The absence of any second character or status crucible limits relational pressure, so the score caps below 8.8.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the UV-vein map reweights her entire artistic premise under the Accumulative/Textural lens; the “lighthouse for the lost” image makes the conceptual cost undeniable. Causality is intact—cathedral glass imperfection → visible pulse → paint shift—but the single beat tightening is micro, not a reversal, so it stops just short of 9.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The amber pavilion glass actively transfigures winter slush into perpetual autumn and supplies the literal filter that enables the discovery; spatial choreography is clean as Elara leans, presses, lowers. The glasshouse’s “permanent suspended autumn” recharges the final indigo brushstroke, meeting the 9+ gate for environment charging the image, but the winter-melt outside remains slightly decorative.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—why night blooms hide from daylight—is signaled early; escalation occurs via the single tightening of the Moonflower sigh that reweights her art from vanity to generosity. The cost is conceptual (her prior work = vanity) rather than a forfeited object or relationship, so pressure is legible but not viscerally paid; this keeps it in low-8 band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically through the flower’s UV map and her indigo brush: beauty as clandestine generosity, not performance. No final-paragraph moralizing; the “secret conversation with the void” is an earned image, not an assertion, and the conceptual repricing lingers with plausible ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric distance is stable; perceptual signature is vivid (“chaotic, joyful sunlight” vs. “quiet spaces where the light could not reach”). Syntax thickens under revelation—“ghostly signal,” “lighthouse for the lost”—but stays within Elara’s artistic lexicon; no head-hopping or filter-verb clutter.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic without loops; metaphor chain (sunlight/void/lighthouse) is coherent and purposeful. One mixed vehicle—“spectral autumn light” beside “UV veins”—skims the edge of incoherence but is saved by the sci-flower premise; no artifacts touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The night-bloom lighthouse trope is refreshed through the cathedral-glass filter and the UV map reveal; the muralist-versus-void angle feels specific rather than stock. The transformation of public mural vanity into shadow generosity is an inevitable but non-obvious synthesis, earning the high-band edge.</comment>
