<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is sensuous and specific—“shivering not from the cold, but from the weight of her title”—and every micro-choice (blind walk across the mirrors, solvent drip, torque on the wrench) externalizes her hierarchy of values. The final stance crystallizes with visible cost: she packs her tools to the “gentle clinking of metal sounding like a lullaby,” a quiet exhaustion that forecloses further pursuit. Competence is balanced by genuine struggle, but the absence of a second character means status dynamics and relationship crucible bullets are N/A; the score reflects solo-interior excellence only.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal chain is rock-solid: because the moon is jammed → she enters → mirrors test → she acts → wheel turns → moon slides. Closure is a clean Decisive Change with felt cost: the “gentle clinking” lullaby signals spent stamina and foreclosed options. Orientation is anchored by word 70 (“obsidian peaks…Spire”), well inside the 120-word window. One minor nip: the prophecy scraps are mentioned late and off-stage, so the schematic discovery feels slightly convenient, keeping it sub-9.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The frozen library is not postcard backdrop—it actively forces tactics: ice-mirrors refract her fears, the dome’s “sterile, blinding whiteness” literally pins the gears. The clockmaker’s gear assortment functions as micro-setting, its brass teeth meshing with ancient iron to decide the climax. Every sensory pick is POV-filtered: ozone cuts “stale, frozen air,” briny wind evokes impossible sea-longing. Spatial choreography is spotless; bodies and tools track cleanly across the rotunda.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“restore the moon’s rhythm”—is signaled in paragraph one and tightens through one decisive reversal: the mirrors try to paralyze with fear, but she chooses blind forward motion, narrowing options to tactile faith. Cost is legible: the “gentle clinking” coda equals depleted energy and foreclosed retreat. No coincidence resolves the conflict; her trained torque alone frees the axle. Slight reserve: escalation is single-step rather than multi-stage, keeping it just below the 8.5 gate.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the friction between cosmic mechanics and human handiwork—“to learn the rhythm of repair”—without ever naming the theme. The final image reweights the premise: the library’s silence shifts from “decay” to “peace,” a conceptual repricing paid for by her bodily effort. No moral is stated; the reader is left with the after-echo of gears and lullaby. One minor echo-charge: driftwood nostalgia remains more atmospheric than architectonic, preventing a 9.0.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person voice carries a distinct poetic compression—“wind did not howl so much as it whispered”—yet stays within Elara’s perceptual orbit. Rhythm modulates: long clause-stack sentences for brooding entry, clipped fragments under wrench-torque pressure. No head-hopping; POV distance remains tight. Dialogue is absent by design; narrative voice alone handles subtext and goal, and succeeds.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Line-level craft is near-flawless: sentences vary in length and opening, zero paraphrase loops, high density—“solvent distilled from the essence of twilight” does two jobs (world detail + stakes heightening). Mixed metaphors are avoided; obsidian peaks, bleached ribcage, metallic tree stump all cohere inside the same fossilized-leviathan lexicon. One microscopic tic: “sterile, blinding whiteness” is a touch familiar, but it is immediately recharged by the physical effect of “pinning the gears.” Closure sentence is clean and resonant.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>“Lunar-eclipse locksmith” is fresh without being gimmicky; the concept fuses astrophysics with pick-work in a way that feels inevitable once stated. The frozen mirror-hall refracting the soul rather than the body twists a familiar trope into something numinous. Risk is taken with lyric density, but it pays off in thematic coherence. The piece avoids cosplay surrealism because every oddity (briny sea-scent on a mountaintop) is anchored to POV perception rather than author flourish.</comment>
