<comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—stoic rationalist vs. ribbon-carrying sentimentalist—drives every beat; the starling epiphany is embodied (fingers buzzing, chest flood) not labeled, and her final snap is earned by prior refusal to surrender logic. Cost is legible: the crystal’s transmutation is also her self-repricing—she forfeits sole scientist identity and takes on creator/dancer stance. Only minor slip: “statistical noise” is mildly on-the-nose for a peak beat. Overall, auburn hair is never allowed to become token label; it’s woven into guild whispers that she actively dismisses, keeping trait specific.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the warm jewel reweights the premise—matter now obeys wonder, not just law. Causal lens holds: because she abandons count-analytics for murmuration-empathy, therefore the silver flame ignites and the crystal re-forms. Time-anchor (bruised-purple sky) is fixed by word 106, satisfying Orientation Test. Cost is unmistakable—“she was no longer just a scientist”—and that identity forfeiture is persistent constraint.</comment>

<comment>Environment, body, and tool trifecta: the basalt table’s proximity forces her to reach across moss (tactile), the waterfall’s fracturing light supplies the rainbow geometry that later mirrors the spiral she mimics, and the ribbon in pocket constrains her willingness to torch sentiment. Final image—warm jewel pressed to skin—charges the setting with eternity-scent breeze, making orchard complicit in her repricing. Spatial tracking flawless: crystal never leaves table until lifted, starlings above remain separate from mist below. No filler exposition; each sensory pick serves the beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</question>
<comment>Dominant stake—harmonize logic/intuition or lose millennia-old crystal—tightens exactly once when sky bruises and the birds offer a non-repeatable alignment. Escalation is causal: the tightening forces her to abandon crucible protocol (live option foreclosed) and risk identity coherence. Price is visible—she pockets the ribbon while snapping flame, proving the fusion has personal tax. No artificial reversals; one meaningful turn suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</question>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: the final scent of “apples and eternity” is the non-literal answer to the question of whether wonder can rewrite physics. Subtext carried in gesture—fingers brushing ribbon before snap—shows love as the secret reagent. No moralizing paragraph; insight stays in the image. The murmuration reprises as living geometry that reframes her earlier data obsession, creating elegant resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</question>
<comment>Third-person limited stays lashed to Elara’s perceptual filter—she notices drag coefficients, smells basalt, never drifts into orchard omniscience. Syntax grows shorter under epiphany (“She snapped”) mirroring bird pulse. No dialogue, so rhythm and diction carry voice; “kaleidoscopic waterfall” is the most ornate stretch but fits her pattern-seeking mind. Tense and psychic distance stable.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</question>
<comment>Zero loops; no paraphrase churn. Sentence openings vary; paragraph cuts land on image beats. Figurative language is sparse but precise—“jagged teardrop of ice” compresses age and fragility. No mixed metaphors; silver flame logically extends from heart-bird resonance. Read-aloud rhythm accelerates into the snap, then relaxes into breeze sentence, mirroring pulse of experiment.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</question>
<comment>Fusion of alchemy + murmuration mechanics feels fresh; standard “scientist learns feeling” arc is salvaged by making the birds the actual crucible. Transformation test passes—swap starlings for any other metaphor and the physics of the flame fails. Risk taken in lyric ellipsis (no lab gear beyond table) pays off in mythic compression. Slight deduction: auburn-haired alchemist is borderline trope, though guild prophecy is immediately undercut.</comment>
