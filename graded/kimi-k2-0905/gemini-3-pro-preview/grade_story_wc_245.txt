<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid—her synesthetic diction (“frantic syntax of a million screaming leaves”) fuses perception with motive. The platinum ring functions as an embodied Want/Need engine; its burn on her finger externalizes cost. One flaw: “tears she could not see” borders label-speak; momentarily abstracts the embodied grief earned by resonance-bath. Still, the map inked onto nerves is a credible renunciation of sight for closure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: absolute-zero silence reweights every prior note; forgiveness is felt not spoken. Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout—each tree-touch thickens the tactile score until pattern break in the clearing. The 120-word orientation gate is cleanly met: who (blind cartographer), where (sonic forest), when (constellation pause) all surface by line 4. Cost is visible in the ring’s burn and the final “quiet blaze” that she now carries inside.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Ultrasonic Forest is not backdrop but pressure chamber: frequencies carve skin, density shifts force lunge/retreat. Redwood bark delivers Sanskrit shock—setting literally speaks. Micro-setting bonus: the platinum ring’s cold weight anchors spatial choreography inside darkness. Stillpoint clearing earns its name by cancelling every prior frequency; environment charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—retrieving father’s last message—is legible by line 3. Escalation is textural: each language-imbued tree tightens the sonic net, narrowing options toward zero-point. Visible price: skin lacerations from briars, ring’s blistering tug. Window closure (constellation snap) externalizes urgency without resorting to coincidence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme—grief as untranslatable frequency—emerges through tactile polyglot rather than thesis. Forgiveness arrives as sensory repricing, not moral. Subtext lives in negative space: the missing visual channel makes “quiet blaze” a conceptual after-image. Avoids thematic echo; no character declares “I forgive.”</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is synesthetic, compressed, cadence-matched to ultrasonic metaphor: “frantic syntax,” “quiet blaze.” Perceptual signature remains consistent—world is texture, temperature, vibration. No head-hop; single POV sustains. Rhythm accelerates into thicket lunge, then zeroes out in clearing—syntax mirrors frequency cancellation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High-density figurative lines (“dense, tactile novel of ancient vibrations”) yet each image advances setting or emotional score. No paraphrase loops; every bark-slap offers new language. Minor register drift: “cosmic clockwork” edges grandiloquent, but fits mythic timeframe. Closure line (“memory of the silence within her”) is clean, propulsive.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Blind cartographer who maps via skin-language is fresh; ultrasonic forest as text is risk that pays off. Stillpoint as anti-frequency eye of hurricane reweights entire premise. Transformation test: swap to generic woods and story collapses—dependence on sonic mechanics is total. No derivative premise; synesthesia-as-plot is specific synthesis.</comment>
