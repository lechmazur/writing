<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Elian’s “fiercely gentle” interiority is dramatized through micro-choices—carving sigils with maternal tenderness while risking self-annihilation—yet the sister remains an off-page abstraction, so the relational crucible is only implied. The interior contradiction (reckless idealism vs. tender precision) is vivid, but because Leda never appears, the status shift is conceptual not dramatized. The price (his evaporated certainty) is legible in the final slump, earning the change. Voice stays coherent and single-POV, meeting the 9+ quick test for earned renunciation with cost.</comment>

<comment>Causal lattice holds: because Leda traded joy, therefore Elian infiltrates; because he inlays sigils, therefore the orchard demands payment; because he surrenders certainty, therefore her joy is released—each linkage narrows options. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the sap’s golden up-rush is the on-page image that reweights the orchard’s rule-set, leaving Elian in Charged Poise—alive but directionless, cost felt. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no lens ambiguity. The persistent constraint—his permanent loss of certainty—shapes the final image and satisfies the 9+ cost proof test.</comment>

<comment>The catacomb orchard is not backdrop but surgical theatre: roots cradle bones, sap demands payment, skull-lined corridors squeeze movement—every environmental detail constrains the ritual and charges the final image. Sensory economy is strict; half-lit glow and marrow-fed fruit are re-used, never catalogued. Spatial choreography is clean: Elian kneels, carves, presses card to sap—no impossible positions. Micro-setting (burned tarot card dissolving into golden light) becomes the vector that reconfigures destiny, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—restore Leda’s joy—signals early and tightens once: the orchard’s counter-demand for substitute essence forces Elian to surrender his own certainty, a visible price that alters tactics. Escalation is causal under the Causal lens: each sigil carved increases metaphysical debt until the orchard vibrates teeth-loose, options narrowing to pay-or-fail. No coincidence; the orchard’s resistance is innate physics. Cost is legible on the page—“his belief in a safe return bleed out”—qualifying for 9+ territory, though the tightening is single rather than compound.</comment>

<grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: barter-system metaphysics collides with sibling love to propose redemption is possible but never free. Subtext resides in gesture—tender caress of bone, sap accepting ash—so the moral is felt, not declared. Final image (golden light rushing upward) offers Conceptual Repricing: the orchard’s iron law is rewritten, yet the agent is left hollow, complicating the moral. No final-paragraph sermon; ambiguity lingers whether patching souls merely relocates the fracture.</comment>

<comment>Third-person intimate maintains consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature is precise—lantern shadows “nervous,” sap “weeping,” roots “groan”—all filtered through Elian’s fragile certainty. Syntax tightens under pressure: clauses shorten as sap surges, rhythm mirroring cardiac race. No head-hopping; POV stays strictly bonded to Elian. Diction stays within plausible lexicon for a mythic underworld thief-poet; no corporate register drift.</comment>

<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances causality or sensory charge. Metaphors are coherent—marrow as currency, sap as fate—without mixed-vehicle collisions. Information density is high: “sigils of restoration and memory” compress ritual, motive, and metaphysics in four words. No filter-verb stacks; verbs are strong—“slumped,” “surged,” “rattled.” Closure beat is uncluttered, letting golden light carry the reweighting, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>

<comment>Fusing catacombs with orchard subverts both tropes; bone-fed luck-trees feel inevitable once declared. Semiotic surgery—carving meaning into root and bone—offers a fresh magic system grounded in tender gesture rather than incantation. The tarot card, reversed and scorched, becomes a literal contract fragment; its dissolution is a reparable-destiny conceit that reframes familiar “deal with the dead” lore. Risk-taking (renunciation ending without triumphant escape) heightens coherence; the story commits fully to its premise, earning the +0.4 within-band bonus.</comment>
