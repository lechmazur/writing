<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Silas’s artisanal detachment and static-charge empathy are vividly particular; his refusal to erase grief but only blunt it feels lived-in. Elara is weaker: her surrender is generic and her one spoken line is therapy-speak (“Will it make me forget him?”). The micro-choice pivot—he lifts the blotter, she inhales—carries cost, yet her interiority is summarized rather than embodied, keeping the beat short of exceptional.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a crisp Conceptual Repricing: the blotter’s synthetic nostalgia reweights reality, leaving Elara glassily serene and the grotto warmer. Causal chain holds: because she is shattered → therefore Silas offers half-truth → result is bearable false peace. One shard, one transition (dusk → night) is cleanly handled. Cost is visible—“transaction finished, the illusion absolute”—but the price to Silas (static silence) is mentioned, not felt, so it stops just below the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The amber grotto is not backdrop but instrument: resinous walls mirror the manufactured warmth inside Elara, and the cooling air cues the scent’s diffusion. Tactile handles—silver tweezers, sealed jar—ground the counterfeit chemist’s ritual. Light shift from honeyed gloom to synthetic glow physically marks the emotional reconfiguration, satisfying the 9+ constraint test.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can Elara survive absolute grief—is signaled early and narrowed to a single yes/no inhale. Agency is hers; the scent’s arrival forcibly softens the jagged loss, foreclosing raw mourning. Cost is legible: she trades authentic pain for narcotic nostalgia. No escalation beyond this one beat, but the tightening is irreversible; the story accepts stasis over growth, fitting the situational lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges without sermon: engineered forgetting versus earned memory, the market value of reality. Half-truth concept reweights from exposition to lived consequence when the blotter’s lie becomes Elara’s new baseline. Final image—grotto brighter, Elara glassy—offers resonant non-verbal answer. Complexity acknowledged: Silas’s empathy is also commerce, leaving moral ambiguity intact.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Silas’s sensorial register: static prickles, resinous light, clinical appreciation. Syntax is crisp, rhythm lightly varied; no filter-verb clutter. Elara’s voice is thinner, but only one line appears; narrative diction never slips into corporate jargon. Perceptual signature—emotion as electrical charge—is sustained and paid off at the end when silence replaces static.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is lean, high-density: “counterfeit emotion dealer” unpacks through action, not exposition. Metaphors are coherent—honeyed gloom, jagged reality—never piled. One paraphrase loop (“tension began to drain… static charge began to smooth”) lightly dulls momentum; otherwise no scaffold. Final line is surgical, propulsive.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Premise—perfume that edits grief—feels fresh, yet anchored in 19th-century mesmerism and modern pharmacology. The static-electric empathy device is a memorable inflection not seen in prior grief-market tales. Conceptual risk (sedation as mercy) is fully owned; no retreat to moral safety. Specificity of blotter ritual keeps the idea from drifting into generic futuristic noir.</comment>
