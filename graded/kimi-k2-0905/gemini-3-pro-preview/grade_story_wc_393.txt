<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elias’s guilt and need to “prove that even the most broken things could function” give him a clear, active stake. His interiority stays concrete—watching “his hope wither,” the “stone in his gut”—but the repair-woman’s motives remain opaque, so relationship pressure is only half-felt. The ending’s renunciation lands cleanly: he stands paralyzed by the grace he withheld—cost visible, path foreclosed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the heart beats to the sad music, repricing Elias’s entire mission. Causal lens holds: because he sought mechanical absolution, therefore he confronts the echo of his failure. Orientation is anchored by word 30; no telegraphing or puppet moves. Only micro-drag: the woman’s discovery is internally coherent but arrives as off-stage knowledge she already possessed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The shop is rendered through tactile bias—velvet drapes, brass flare under sudden light—functioning as a cathedral that forces reverence and softens Elias for the final sting. Micro-setting rule met: the music box and heart constrain every beat; their brass surfaces literally reflect the moment of reconfiguration. Spatial choreography is clean; no floating props or white-room gaps.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can brokenness be redeemed?—is signaled in paragraph 2 and tightens once: “technically correct… the spring is indeed snapped,” collapsing Elias’s hope. Agency stays on Elias: he initiates the visit, unwraps the heart, leans in, and accepts the paralyzing cost. Cost is visible—his collapse into silence—though the external price (what he will do next) remains off-page, keeping the score below 8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from resonance vs. repair: the heart runs on “the echo of what surrounds it,” reweighting redemption from divine to auditory. No overt thesis statements; the final image of metallic thumping accusation is the answer. Subtext in the woman’s silence and the chaplain’s paralyzed watching carries the emotional after-effect without sentimentality.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked on Elias; no head-hop. Perceptual signature—clerical metaphors (“cathedral of stopped time,” “reverence he usually reserved for the Eucharist”)—remains consistent and specific. Syntax breathes with pressure: short clauses when hope withers, longer lyrical stretches during the resonance reveal. Dialogue is minimal but clean, carrying subtext in the woman’s cryptic replies.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings avoid monotony. A few scaffold lines (“He approached the counter…”) could compress, but nothing loops or muddles causality. Figurative language is selective: “light breaks through storm clouds” is earned by the drape-pull and pays off in brass flare. No mixed metaphors or filter-verb stacks in peak beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clockwork heart as resonance engine feels fresh and grows organically from the shop setting. The reversal—spring was never the power source—reconfigures both contraption and moral logic without gimmick. Risk is moderate: quiet interior SF rather than spectacle, but specificity (valves, resonance chamber) grounds it. Could edge higher if the woman’s expertise had earlier foreshadowing.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Setup in opening three lines; he drives every beat—carrying the bundle, pleading, watching the demo, accepting paralysis. Closure image is his emotional forfeiture. Meets all three gates with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Heart is handled in unwrap, diagnosis, pedestal placement, and final charged beat; its shudder-to-life reweights the entire moral arc. Remove it and the story vanishes. Causal pressure and specificity maxed.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>“Second opinion” is the inciting request and the woman delivers a verdict that overturns the state engineer; it enables the final reversal. Not deep but essential to tension.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>“Aptly deliberate” is dramatized in the woman’s micro-screw placement and slow drape pull; the trait buys time for Elias’s rising dread and showcases her mastery. Functional trade-off visible.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>“Do we get what we deserve?” spoken aloud reframes Elias’s guilt and foreshadows the accusatory ending. Line is memorable and reweights prior material; not indispensable but strongly tied to closure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Light-through-storm-clouds simile is signaled at drape-pull and mechanics matter: the sudden glare reveals the resonance chamber and triggers the woman’s key turn. Lyric reprise at brass flare.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Shop’s hush, dust motes, and velvet drapes pressure Elias into whispered confession; the music boxes supply the literal resonance that powers the climax. Setting resources alter outcome.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>“Calm before realization” is named once and matched emotionally, but no ticking clock alters tactics; time is static. Serves mood more than pressure—mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Apology-into-action is the overt mission; every Elias choice—unwrapping, pleading, staying silent—is filtered through this desire. Conflict between spiritual duty and mechanical proof drives arc.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>“Vibrant hush” is seeded in line 1, sustained through dusty motes and metallic heartbeat, and modulates into accusatory stillness at the end. Tone coheres and charges final image.</comment>
