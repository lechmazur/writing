<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara’s luminous skepticism is dramatized in every move—she treats her own glow as “diagnostic leaks,” never awe. The single micro-choice, waiting motionless until the star strikes, crystallizes her mechanistic faith and costs her hours of stillness. No interior contradiction is voiced, so the arc is linear not knotted, but the embodied cold light + tool-using intellect combo feels singular. Closure is an earned stasis: she concedes magic is real yet retains identity as mechanic—cost is the unending maintenance burden she now shoulders.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds throughout: suspended geese → auditory breadcrumbs → box obstruction → stellar key → twist release. Orientation is taught by word 30 (“City of Forgotten Fountains”) and spatial logic never wavers. The decisive change—box opens, memories soak stone, geese resume—lands with visible cost: Elara’s pragmatic worldview is nicked, future workload implied. One minor loop: “psychic plumbing” is used twice within 30 words; otherwise propulsion is clean.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dust-as-currency, dry aqueducts, and the Grand Cistern’s stone bowl constrain every tactical choice; waterless setting literally blocks memory flow. The stained glass box’s leaden frame and crimson/cobalt panes evolve from obstruction to valve, recharging the final spectral deluge. Micro-setting—the pedestal’s throat—dictates the precise torque Elara visualizes. Sensory economy favors grit, cold stone, and the knuckle-crack sound, all filtered through Elara’s diagnostic gaze—no tourist catalog.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—liberate calcified memories—signaled paragraph 1 and tightens once: only stellar alignment can open box, forcing motionless vigil. Cost is legible: hours of immobility+worldview concession. Agency is crystallized attention, not brute force; coincidence complicates (geese pause) but does not resolve. Escalation is singular yet sufficient for 750-word frame; a second reversal would over-egg.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly: memory as infrastructure maintenance, magic as system obeying physics. Subtext in gestures—wiping hands on trousers—shows mechanic’s pride after handling the sacred. No explicit moral; final image of blended light re-weights premise without sermon. Thematic echo “magic still required a mechanic” is borderline statement but lands in character voice, forgiven by immediacy.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person intimate sustains consistent perceptual signature: Elara notices friction angles, molecular grit, star trajectory—never tourist filler. Syntax grows clipped under pressure (“Seizing the instant, Elara reached out”). No dialogue, so voice distinctness rests on diction like “sidereal patience,” which stays within her engineering lexicon. Only micro-slip: “biological phosphorescence” sounds textbook for a self-sceptic, but context justifies clinical self-distance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty—description + causal cue: “dust was the only currency” embeds world-rule and economic stakes. Rhythm breathes during star-wait, then shortens at release. One mixed metaphor: “spiritual arteries” beside “calcified plaque” is forgivable in thought. Zero paraphrase loops, zero scaffold; opening and closing lines anchor voice and recharged image cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Combines memory-plumbing, astromechanical lock-picking, and luminous skeptic into a synthesis that feels inevitable yet new. Risk of stasis-as-climax is embraced and pays off: waiting becomes the heroic act. Specificity—Cygnus azimuth, leaded glass torque—prevents allegory drift. If transplanted to another city or character the arc collapses, proving non-generic architecture.</comment>
