<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interiority is sensorially rich (“armor dull with the patina of solitude”) and actions track the obsession cleanly; yet the single micro-choice—pledging to flux—arrives as oratory summary rather than embodied contradiction under duress, blunting the cost that must be felt in the moment of vow. No second character on stage, so status crucible waived; still, the lack of a live opposition keeps the arc just sub-publishable.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the instant the pod drops, “armor loses weight,” history unwrites, possibility is literally in hand—an undeniable before/after. Causal chain is intact—each marionette step because/therefore unlocks the next twist of physics—so the inferred lens holds with visible price (“pledged his soul”). No orientation debt; greenhouse geography stays spatially coherent. Meets 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Greenhouse is not backdrop but prosthetic: glass-leaf chimes, ionized soil smell, and weeping-lead trunk all dictate Valerius’s footfalls and final reach; the pod-as-micro-setting charges the closure image. Environment materially constrains tactics—misalign a step and the ritual fails—satisfying the 9+ gate. Sensory economy is near-ideal for 700-word scope.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“shape of possibility” v. forfeited past—tightens once, sharply: when he murmurs allegiance he abandons knightly fealty forever. The price is on-page (soul to chaos) and alters later options; no off-stage rescue. Escalation is singular but sufficient for 700-word contract; coincidence absent. Lacks a second tightening beat that would push into 9-band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: possibility itself as moral sedition. The final image—armor weightless, history erased—reweights the earlier metallic patina of solitude into luminous escape, achieving resonance. No sermon, no thesis line. Ambiguity lingers: is he free or annihilated? Complexity earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is textured, archaic-without-pastiche: “translucent spun glass,” “patina of solitude,” syntax elongates then fractures under pressure. Perceptual signature—ionized air tasted on the tongue—stays knight-bound yet alchemically altered. No head-hop; distance stable. Experimental marionette gait is pattern-taught early and paid off at climax. Rhythm accelerates into the final breath without drumbeat monotony.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>High information density; each sentence layers task, metaphor, and physics (“latent regret in the soil”). One template cadence run—three sentences in a row open “He …” in the unstrap beat—dulls flow slightly but does not obscure causality or closure. Metaphors stay internally consistent (glass to dust to light). Proofing clean; no loops in final third. Publish-ready with microscopic polish.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Alchemical orchard feeding on regret, marionette ritual as physics cipher, and the literal pluck of raw potential as fruit constitute a synthesis not seen before. Each trope is grounded in sensory consequence; risk (banned play incites madness) is embraced without gimmickry. Fresh inflection arrives in the pod drop that retroactively rewrites the armor’s weight—inevitable yet surprising.</comment>
