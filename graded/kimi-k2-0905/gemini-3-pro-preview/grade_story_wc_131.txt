<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s contradictory impulses—erasure vs. the ache to be seen—are dramatized in the stealth/cache beat; the final renunciation of direct contact carries felt cost. Interiority stays concrete, tethered to tactile conduit and dust. One hairline slip: “quiet, aching yearning” flirts with label-speak, though it’s immediately embodied by the cache risk. Still earns the 9− band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: blackout → rattling debris → tape find → cache → visibility renunciation, each beat narrowing options. Closure is a Charged Poise: shared discovery reconfigures both lives while Elias’s isolation endures—cost is legible in the sealed hatch and lingering shadow. Spatial/temporal anchors arrive by line 5; no orientation debt. Minor loop: “kindly methodical pace” appears twice; doesn’t touch the climax.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Body-as-setting (crawlspace ribs, copper pipes) and the tape shard itself constrain every tactical move; dawn color shifts mirror the stake of visibility. Selective sensory hierarchy—lint scent, valve rust—filters through Elias’s custodial gaze. The library’s velvet hatch and flickering streetlamp are reused, not catalogued. Environment directly enables/cache-blocks the final choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will he risk exposure to heal the librarian’s despair—tightens once: discovery of the tape escalates from private memory to actionable cache. Agency is present in every beat; coincidence (blackout) only complicates. Cost is visible: he forfeits face-to-face gratitude, accepts perpetual erasure. Could use one additional micro-tightening beat mid-cache to reach 8.8+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of invisible stewardship vs. human hunger for recognition emerges through gesture and silence, never stated. The tape’s return reweights the “lost intake records” from institutional absence to personal communion. Final image—her scanning the vents—offers resonant ambiguity: history is restored, yet the giver remains air. Avoids moralizing; complexity intact.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays welded to Elias’s perceptual slate: “vaulted atrium breathed” is his sensorium, not omniscient. Syntax lengthens during stealth, shortens during the strobe-window cache, mirroring risk. No head-hopping; librarian’s interior is implied only through gesture. Distinctive cadence—sapphire hush, hollow-boned fossils—without purple overload.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>High-density lines do triple duty: “dust bunnies betray” advances stealth, character, atmosphere. Metaphors are coherent (jagged rhythm = failing grid) and sparse under pressure. One scaffold echo: “kindly methodical” reused; minor. Otherwise zero loops, no filter-verb stacks, strong verb front-loading. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with beat stakes.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Guardian-in-the-walls is familiar, yet here retooled as archivist-of-people, not building, via seventies tape shard—fresh inflection. Risk: choosing cache over emergence turns trope on its head, stakes irrevocable loneliness. Specific municipal-archive HVAC mechanics ground the fantastical stealth in credible maintenance labor. Could push further if tape’s content were foreshadowed earlier, but transformation is clear.</comment>
