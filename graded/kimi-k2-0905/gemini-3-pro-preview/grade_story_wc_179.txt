<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elian's contradictory interiority ("scheming pacifist") is dramatized through the silent transfer scene; Kaelen’s shift from rage to liquefying sword is externally credible. Missing micro-choice immediacy before skin-touch slightly delays embodied cost; still, the final shoulder-drop lands as earned stasis.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure is a crisp Conceptual Repricing: the cylinder’s vanishing reweights Kaelen’s identity under the broken-pin mercy. Causal lens holds—every reappearance of the cylinder is a motivated therefore—though “cellular memory” mechanism is asserted rather than primed, a hairline nick to causality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Soundless Sanctuary functions as micro-setting: nullified acoustics force intimacy and enable the silent transfer. Mercury floor and glass walls supply visual metaphor without stall; spatial choreography stays clean as bodies tilt toward wrist contact. Grounding achieved by ~80 words.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—shatter Kaelen’s strength myth—tightens when the flawed cylinder reappears and the void-pin is pressed to pulse. Cost is legible: Kaelen’s sword liquefies, pride follows. One meaningful escalation sufficient; no reversals needed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from broken mechanism as grace: the absent note becomes breathing room. No moralizing; final image of vanished cylinder reweights prior metaphor. Complexity intact—reader can read as mercy or manipulation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Third-person tight to Elian delivers a calculative, pacifist-ironic perceptual signature: “dangerous contradictions,” “terrifyingly intimate and silent.” Syntax stays controlled; no head-hop. Compressed diction suits null-acoustic pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentences multi-task. One template cadence run (“He... then he...”) in cylinder-return beats −0.3. No mixed metaphors; mercury-to-glass shift is coherent. Information density high until “cellular memory” label, which glints as scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Silent memory-transfer via broken music-pin feels fresh; trope of surrender-as-evolution is inverted through acoustic-null crucible. Risk—non-verbal persuasion—paid off by liquefying sword image. Specificity prevents swap with generic artifact.</comment>
