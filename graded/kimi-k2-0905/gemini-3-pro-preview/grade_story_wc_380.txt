<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Elias’s terror, superstition, and single-minded need to anchor himself to a lost summer are shown through bodily detail (trembling hand, racing heart) and a credible micro-choice—clutching the crystal and flowers as psychic ballast. The interior contradiction between terror and practiced grace is dramatized, not narrated. Memory as consumable waste product is a fresh, character-specific obsession that charges every shovel of salt. The final “he had reclaimed his ghost” lands as earned renunciation because the dig and the gravity-flux cost have been physically paid.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure arrives as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elias’s stolen crystal and remembered scent re-weight reality, making a before (weightless terror) / after (grounded return) legible at the salt flats. Causal linkage holds throughout—each gravity lurch is triggered by his progress, not coincidence. The coffee-ground compass is taught early, paid off when the ring explodes, forcing the anchor act. Orientation is clean by line 8; no teleporting props or convenient amnesia.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The chamber’s “gleaming silence” and supersaturated lake are not backdrop but hazard: jagged ceiling spikes, ankle-snapping wells, and salt crust that crunches like bone force Elias’s crouch-and-step tactics. Micro-setting extends to the copper bowl whose weight anchors him when gravity flips. Sensory hierarchy obeys POV—he attends to vibration, crunch, breath-mist, never visual gloss. Final image of dock lights “flickering welcome” recharges the opening lamps, proving environment can reconfigure emotional stance.</comment>

<question>4</question><question>8.3</question><comment>Dominant stake—retrieve deleted memory before salt dissolves it—is signaled in paragraph 3 and tightened when every spadeful risks gravity snap. Each escalation is protagonist-driven: choose to dig → crystal theft triggers weightless peril → memory anchor chosen to survive. Cost is visible: bruised ribs from the hard drop, plus the irreversible theft that makes him complicit in facility waste crime. No off-stage rescue; coincidence complicates but does not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the metaphoric equation of memory = crystallized waste product; the story refuses to state this aloud, letting the dig and the blue node embody it. Subtextual silence about the unnamed “her” forces reader to feel the hole Elias refuses to articulate. Final image re-weights premise: reclaimed ghost = personal waste now privately owned, not erased. Moral ambiguity remains—he steals communal sorrow for private solace—without tidy judgment.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</question><comment>Voice is lantern-lighter specific: maritime superstition, salt-cathedral awe, and a dockman’s terse poetry (“sound like breaking bone”). Syntax compresses under stress—fragments when gravity flips, then lengthens as he steadies. Coffee-ground divination is not exoticized; diction stays within a weathered laborer’s lexicon. No filter-verb stacks; perception is immediate: “coffee grounds exploded upward, blinding him.”</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Prose is dense yet breath-controlled: one sentence can stage, sense, and symbol—“The salt crunched under his blade, a sound like breaking bone in the quiet dark.” Metaphors are spare, never mixed; “blue as a bruise” fuses color and injury in four words. No scaffold loops; each sentence advances position or stakes. Rhythm accelerates into the weightless beat, then cadence slows on the hard landing, mirroring physiological shock.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</question><comment>Fusing memory-deletion SF with maritime coffee-ground divination is non-obvious and specific; neither trope survives transplantation unchanged. The whale-beach as psychic rupture is sketched in two lines yet underwrites all gravity laws without exposition dump. Risk taken: a silent solo scene in a salt cathedral could have slid into lyric postcard, but tactile shovel-by-shovel agency keeps it narrative. Fresh inflection: personal archaeology of communal waste—memory as litter—feels inevitable only after the final line.</comment>
