<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses—resurrection fantasy vs extraction realism—play out in every micro-choice; the heartbeat-count anchors Elias’s bureaucratic ghosthood while the ink-pour lets chaos override his own logic, all culminating in the earned renunciation “too late to save her, but just in time to save him.” Interiority stays concrete: throat-pulse, ink smell, shard edge. No therapy-speak, only sensory particularity. Cost is visible: the shard drowns, the file closes, the living pulse keeps ticking—an Earned Stasis that forecloses reunion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the ink dries, projection severs, and Elias resumes his count—an image that reweights every prior beat with the cost of irreversible isolation. Causal lattice holds throughout: because he is legally dead he can breach the server; because the shard is the fracture coordinate the table reads it; because the ink obeys physics the algorithm accepts stochastic patterns. Orientation is anchored by word 50 (iridescent observatory, dome, snow). No lens ambiguity; Accumulative/Textural pattern—density of sensory fragments crystallizes into final stance—taught early and paid off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Observatory dome, snow-muffled silence, conductive ink’s metallic reek—each detail is filtered through Elias’s engineer-bureaucrat perceptual bias and constrains his next move (cold forces gloves off, thin air tightens throat count). The porcelain shard functions as micro-setting: its weight and edge dictate sensor placement and bridge analog-to-digital. Spatial coherence never wavers; camera tracks from dome ceiling to black table surface to throat-pulse without drift. Final image—inky hand, ticking artery—recharges the opal shimmer motif with new cost.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—extract truth from corrupted marital memory—signaled in paragraph 4. Escalation follows Accumulative/Textural lens: each sensory layer (snow hush, ink rivulet, pixel tear) deepens the cost of knowing. Mid-scene tightening occurs when the ink’s chaotic path forces Elias to surrender authorial control—visible price paid. No coincidence; resolution earned by his final stance crystallization: he accepts incomplete data and resumes the count, foreclosing reunion.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</question><comment>Theme—grief as corrupted file—emerges from concrete refrain of counting, staining, fragmenting; no explicit thesis. Subtext lives in silence: the unsaid fear she voices post-mortem was the true bug. Final image of ink drying on living fingers reprises the earlier iridescent dome but reweights it: interior beauty now costs permanent exile. Resists moral; ambiguity lingers in the restarted count.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person tight stays locked to Elias’s perceptual filter—iridescent hues, artery math, ink stench—without head-hop. Syntax mirrors engineer precision: clauses calibrated like packets. No dialogue, so voice distinction N/A. Brief compression under stress—“Seventy-five, seventy-six”—reads as intentional pulse meter, not artifact.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Rhythm breathes with scene temperature: long sentences during static wait, staccato count during final sever. Every image pulls double duty (ink = conduit + grief stain). Zero filter-verb stacks, no mixed metaphors, no scaffold loops. Opening and closing lines book-end with mirrored bodily anchor (throat hollow → inked fingers) that recharges motif.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fusing biometric ghosthood with analog-entropy data recovery feels fresh; trope of “downloaded spouse” is reversed—he seeks the error, not resurrection. Porcelain shard as seed and terminal object twists familiar break-up souvenir into cryptographic nonce. Risky choice to let ink physics drive plot pays off: causality feels discovered, not contrived. Specificity of high-altitude radio quiet window as temporal gate is non-obvious and inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
