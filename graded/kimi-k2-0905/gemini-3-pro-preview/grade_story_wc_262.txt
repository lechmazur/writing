<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—seeking a repository for “unused love” while stripping love from the film—drives every beat; the embodied warmth-transfer ritual makes the abstract need visceral. The micro-choice to chill the strip to corpse-temperature crystallizes her renunciation and costs her the last emulsion ghost. No secondary character means no status crucible, but the single-POV pressure is sufficient for this length. Her spatial imagination is more alleged than dramatized; we are told, not shown, how it alters tactics.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the amber nebula inside the lens is an undeniable new rule-set—love is mineralized, not decayed. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout; density increases via sensory layering until the final cadence shift. Causality is intact—because she warms the strip, therefore the love migrates into glass. Cost is felt in the sudden silence that “feels lighter,” a tangible atmospheric debt paid.</comment>

<comment>The booth’s ozone/acetate chemistry is not mere perfume; it supplies the solvent that allows the psychometric transfer. The carbon-arc projector’s crystal lens becomes the micro-setting that ultimately stores the nebula, charging the final image. Spatial choreography is flawless—film, palms, glass, shutters track cleanly. Weather drops pressure outside in synchrony with internal pressure, fulfilling the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—locate and relocate abandoned love—tightens when the strip goes cold and the love is irreversibly glass-locked. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length; no reversal is required. The cost is the hush that succeeds the thunder, a felt vacuum. Agency is her deliberate warmth-transfer; coincidence never rescues.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the inversion: love is not lost but archived, a conceptual repricing performed by the final nebula. The goodbye letters remain off-stage yet their absent presence is re-weighted into the amber swirl. No moral is stated; the image argues that unspent affection fossilizes rather than vanishes. The after-effect is a quiet vertigo—readers re-see every discarded ticket stub as potential amber.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited maintains tight psychic distance; diction (“viscous,” “halide”) stays inside Elara’s specialized lexicon. Rhythm accelerates with predicate stacking during the transfer, then fractures into short clauses at the chill moment, mirroring heartbeat. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is consistent. Filter verbs are minimal and voice-motivated.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is loop-free, high-density: one sentence often performs sensory, metaphorical, and causal work. No mixed metaphors; “amber nebula” extends the projector-light motif cleanly. Read-aloud rhythm breathes—long sentences for incubation, staccato for release. Minor scaffolding in the opening clause (“The vintage movie palace…”) is forgivable scene-setting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The psychometric transfer of unused love into projector glass is a fresh synthesis of mysticism and obsolete tech. Risk—using temperature as emotional chemistry—pays off without gimmickry. Specificity of nitrate decay and carbon-arc hardware prevents template drift. The concept is irreversible to genre swap; only celluloid and crystal could enact this amber entombment.</comment>
