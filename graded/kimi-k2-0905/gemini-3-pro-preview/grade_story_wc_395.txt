<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Silas’s obsession with the deleted-crew mystery is vivid and embodied (the thumb-rubbed patch), but interiority flirts with label-speak (“his motivation was singular”) and the final horror is more declared than lived in his body. The contradiction between corporate cheer and private desperation is present yet never forces a micro-choice that visibly costs him until the final image, which lands as revelation rather than irreversible decision. Still, the fraying patch as tactile anchor and the lie to the drone show credible tactic under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the “archived assets” tag reweights the entire premise with undeniable social cost. Causal chain holds: because Silas follows the numeric pattern he therefore finds the hidden partition; the patch anchors him throughout. Orientation is clean by line 5; the archive and drone are spatially stable. One meaningful tightening—overlaying the audio tracks—forces the reveal and forecloses any naive view of deletion.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The obsidian console, hovering drone, and stagnant ocean of profiles are sketched with terse, evocative strokes that feed the claustrophobic tone. The mission patch functions as micro-setting, its coarse fabric grounding Silas’s attention and later whitening under his knuckles, charging the final horror. Spatial choreography inside the server farm stays coherent; bodies and machine parts track cleanly. While no single environmental element constrains a tactical choice, the archive’s implied vastness and the drone’s red eye supply persistent pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—find the erased truth—signals in paragraph 2 and escalates when the numeric pattern narrows the search to audio ghosts. The overlay act is the decisive tightening that swaps ignorance for knowledge at visible internal risk (the lie to the drone). Cost is conceptual but legible: Silas’s employer becomes jailer of souls, forever tainting his role. No reversal reverses itself; coincidence only complicates.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the splice of celebrity archive and state kidnapping: memory as corporate property. The refrain of “deleted yet archived” reweights from tech jargon to moral indictment without moralizing. Subtext lives in gesture—thumb on patch, knuckles white—rather than exposition. Final image of profiles tagged “assets” crystallizes the commodification horror without a summarizing epiphany.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight on Silas with perceptual signature tied to digital forensics: file sizes, pixel dimensions, metadata. Compression is purposeful—“the sensed absence of a billion voices”—and rhythmic control heightens in the overlay silence. Drone dialogue is flat by design, contrasting with the textured inward voice. No head-hopping or register drift; diction stays within a tech-curator lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Sentences vary in length and opening, propelling toward the quiet reveal. Information density is high: each sentence advances discovery or atmosphere. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors; figurative language is sparse and apt. The final paragraph’s “they were never meant to be found” lands as crisp, inevitable closure without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The premise fuses cold-case true-crime with server-farm gothic, then routes it through audio archaeology—a fresh synthesis. Recurring numbers as steganographic distress signal feels both inevitable and non-obvious. Risk is taken in the quiet, horror-without-gore reveal, and it pays off by reconfiguring the entire archive as penal colony. Specificity of the patch and the 04-21-X pattern prevents generic drift.</comment>
