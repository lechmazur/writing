<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elian’s burnished sorrow and refusal to surrender the past to Thorne’s authoritarian read are vivid; the shard-handling beat embodies his contradictions. The final trembling hand shows cost, but the victory feels slightly too cleanly “won by art” without a tangible consequence that alters his next move—cost is felt, not future-closing.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the storm-projection rewrites ambient time, Thorne’s data corrupted, Elian’s dream forced onto reality—undeniable conceptual cost. Causal linkage holds: because he covers mirrors and angles the shard, therefore the chronal refraction reconfigures the room’s meaning. One minor elasticity: the shard’s exact chronal properties aren’t seeded before the storm, but the image pays off the lens so cleanly the gap is hairline.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Baroque asteroid, phosphorescent hours, and velvet-mirror mechanics are sensuously specific and filter through Elian’s poetic bias. The micro-setting of the grand salon—mirrors, brocade, singular ray—constrains the climax; environment literally shapes the refraction that rewrites history. Spatial choreography remains coherent across the storm sequence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—control of historical narrative—tightens when the storm offers a one-time chance to project an alternate past. Elian’s agency drives the escalation: he acts (covers mirrors, positions shard) and forecloses Thorne’s evidentiary certainty. Cost is legible in Thorne’s shaken data and Elian’s trembling hand; a slightly sharper tangible loss would push higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme—memory as insurgent art—emerges through the shard’s refraction rather than exposition. The final image of forcing the universe to dream his dream reweights all prior ruin-gazing without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers: the vision is both lie and lived truth, inviting reflection on who owns the past.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays welded to Elian’s poetic perceptual signature: “the gale sings of memory,” “silver tongues” of mirrors. Syntax grows incantatory under pressure, then fractures into the trembling hand—rhythmic control matches emotional crest. No head-hopping; Thorne’s interior is read only through Elian’s filter, maintaining distance discipline.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative layering serves the lyric mode without clogging causality. No loops, scaffold, or register drift; each sentence advances image or stakes. One near-purple phrase—“terrible, heavy beauty”—is earned by prior sorrow-polishing and does not dull the final refraction image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Visible Time as pollen-storm and mirror superstition converted into historiography weapon feels fresh and inevitable. The shard’s chronal refraction is a new inflection on “broken relic” trope. Risky lyric escalation pays off by reconfiguring reality rather than merely decorating it.</comment>
