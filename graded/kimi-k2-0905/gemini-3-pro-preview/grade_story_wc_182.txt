<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elara’s motive—save the Time Traveler—stays clear, but her interiority is mostly conveyed through abstract job-title nouns (“arcane linguist”) rather than contradictory impulse in scene. The single decisive choice (offering new fungal taxonomy) is clever yet externally motivated by world rule, not a revealed personal stake or flaw, so the cost feels intellectual, not emotional. She earns entry and exit, but the beat that crystallizes her own irreversible loss or renunciation is missing; hence the arc remains functional, not crucible-hot.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: missing data → renegotiation → release → extraction, each step because/therefore linked. Closure is a clean Earned Stasis: the mountain “settles,” satisfied by the new knowledge, and the Traveler is freed with the implicit price that the mountain keeps its cataloging supremacy. The price is more conceptual than viscerally felt by Elara, but the logic is airtight under the Accumulative/Textural lens (knowledge-density reweights reality). Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive within 60 words; no caps triggered.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Setting is the star: fossilized encyclopedias as footholds, ivy of ink, paper fungi in joint cracks—each detail doubles as world rule and tactical surface. The “unheard symphony” motif is taught early, escalates at the gate, and subsides into satisfied hum at exit, charging the closure image. Micro-setting (the diary, the golem’s paper skin) constrains Elara’s method and final gambit. Spatial choreography is flawless; no two objects occupy the same imagined space.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—retrieve the Traveler—signaled in line four. Pressure tightens once: the golem’s toll demand collapses all prior options into a single knowledge-trade; no further escalation, but that collapse is decisive. Cost is present (the mountain keeps its epistemic authority, Traveler ages), yet the personal price to Elara is only implied. Sufficient for this length, but a second tightening or visible personal trade-off would have pushed it into 8.5+ territory.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme—cataloging versus silence, what knowledge deserves admission—emerges through the fungal omission rather than exposition. The final reconfiguration (mountain’s satisfied hum) non-literally answers the unasked question: incompleteness is the only sin. Subtext stays in gesture (golem’s rustle, ivy’s creep) without sermons. One near-tagline (“looking for what was missing”) is forgiven because it is embedded in rescue dialogue, not final-paragraph moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person keeps tight psychic distance; perceptual signature is linguist-biased (“syntax of silence,” “grammar of stone”) without drifting into textbook register. Rhythm swells and ebbs with the “symphony” motif, mirroring tension. No head-hop; no dialogue to corrupt voice. One clause (“smelling faintly of ozone and regret”) edges purple but stays within POV’s metaphoric fluency; otherwise diction is disciplined.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sentences are dense yet lucid, often doing three jobs (image, world-rule, character filter) in one sweep: “paper-thin blossoms sprouting from the cracks in the history section.” No paraphrase loops, no scaffold. Opening and closing lines are acoustically matched (“unheard symphony” ↔ “quiet, satisfied hum”), giving lyric closure. Only micro-slip: “resourceful as she conserved” is filler-ish; delete “as she conserved” and beat holds.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The living mountain-library that digests unread stories feels fresh, yet the rescue pivots on an unseen fungal gap—an insight that reweights the entire taxonomy premise in hindsight. Risk is high (concept-driven fantasy in 700 words), but specificity of fossilized encyclopedias, ink-ivy, and grammar-harmonic toll keeps it from gimmickry. The symphony motif sustains conceptual unity without external borrowing. Transformation test fails if any element swapped: this could only happen here.</comment>
