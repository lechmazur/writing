<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The narrator’s solitary vocation is embodied in every beat—his “projection” is a micro-choice that costs him emotional exposure. The Countess’s finger-twisting of the carpet thread externalizes grief under pressure and forecloses her prior denial. Their shared silence is a crucible that alters both states: she moves from void-language to acceptance, he from observer to complicit presence. Cost is visible: his page is still wet, her finger white from tourniquet thread.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the severed thread held like a relic reweights absence into necessity. Causal chain: projection → explained absences → melancholy acceptance; each beat tightens under Accumulative/Textural lens. The final image crystallizes options—winter isolation now chosen, not inflicted. Cost is legible in the shared exhale of the house and the ink still wet on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Thread, carpet, and dying maple leaves function as micro-setting that constrains choice: the thread’s snap is the decisive act. Garden shadows evolve from skeletal shapes to theater of memory, mirroring internal shift. Spatial choreography is clean: hilltop estate, veranda, library dust motes all tracked without drift. Sensory hierarchy favors touch and sight filtered through grief-biased attention.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—mapping grief so absence becomes bearable—tightens once: from void-language to acceptance via explained absences. Escalation is textural deepening: each sensory detail increases emotional density until the thread snaps. No reversals needed; pressure coheres under Accumulative lens. Cost is felt in the characters’ shared winter stranding and the narrator’s spent ink.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from concrete particulars: absence as atmospheric pressure, unraveling as necessary weave. Final image reweights premise—solitude becomes chosen soil for new roots. No moralizing; resonance is in the thread relic and the house’s inhale. Ambiguity lingers: is the traveler healing or merely surviving by cartography?</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>First-person voice carries a mortician-poet diction—“cartography of healing,” “amber of memory”—consistent with profession. Perceptual signature is selective: notices dust motes, scent of tobacco, finger ischemia. Rhythm modulates from languid garden description to compressed final paragraph matching dusk contraction. No dialogue, hence no voice convergence; interiority remains singular.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies: long anaphoric sentences for garden decay, staccato final lines for closure. High information density—each sentence layers sensory and emotional data. Metaphors are coherent: “void” → “silence in library,” “unraveling part of weave.” Zero loops or scaffold; no mixed metaphors in peak beats. Opening and final lines anchor and recharge motif.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Premise—traveler writing obituaries for the living—is fresh angle on grief memoir. Synthesis of cartography + necrology + autumnal estate feels specific and inevitable. Risk in lyric accumulation pays off: abstract “geography of healing” becomes tactile thread snap. Transformation test fails: only this voice could render absence as atmospheric pressure.</comment>
