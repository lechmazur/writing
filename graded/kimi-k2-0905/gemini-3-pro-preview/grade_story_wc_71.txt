<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Elias’s obsession with “living houses” is vivid, but the emotional cost of his nightly trespass stays abstract; we feel his curiosity, not the bruise of risk. Interiority is rich (“creeping normality noticer”), yet the pivotal moment—placing the root—reads more ritual than irreversible choice, softening the felt stake. The closing renunciation lands, but only because the prose insists; we don’t witness a micro-choice that actually forecloses his return. Still, the contradictions (“dried root smells of blooming flowers”) are character-specific and memorable.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Closure is a textbook Conceptual Repricing: the shard of hush becomes a parable of contradiction that reweights Elias’s whole quest. Causality is lyric-accumulative rather than plot-mechanical; each beat layers sensory density until the final image crystallizes option and cost in one silent inhalation. The orientation anchor (who/where/when) arrives by line 5; the orris root’s displacement teaches the pattern early, so the mosaic design is legible. No lens ambiguity at the end—quiet bay, gray dawn, surrendered streetlights—earned stasis with conceptual cost intact.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The bay, porch planks, and calcified root all function as micro-settings that constrain placement and charge the final image; remove any and the conceptual reprice collapses. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven: sodium hum, salt sting, violet cold—each filtered through Elias’s synesthetic attention. Spatial choreography is pristine; we track his climb, crouch, placement, retreat without drift. Weather and season evolve from deceptive calm to sharpening dawn, mirroring the stakes without overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—why houses feel alive—tightens from abstract itch to concrete test with the root placement; that single act forces the house to “listen,” a visible escalation under accumulative lens. No reversals are needed; the deepening is the crystallization of silence into shard, a density that reweights options. Cost is conceptual but legible: Elias relinquishes the root and any illusion that he can control vitality—earned stasis. Pressure remains coherent; coincidence (drunk fisherman) complicates rather than resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the central contradiction—decay that smells alive, silence that screams—without a single overt statement. The orris root’s journey from ocean cure to porch sentinel reprices the concept of “soul” as residue of hidden growth, not fresh infusion. Final image (streetlights surrender to dawn) offers non-literal answer: aliveness is recognition of entropy, not escape from it. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers as to whether the house is now “awake” or Elias simply accepts its dormancy.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person focalization stays tight inside Elias’s perceptual warp; no head-hop. Diction—“hushed blaze,” “masonry cadavers”—is compressed, lyrical, and consistent; every adjective earns its keep under salt-air pressure. Psychic distance shortens at climax: “He pressed it to his nose” (close) to “the house was listening” (mythic) without register rupture. Rhythm modulates: long rolling sentences for tide-pace, then clipped fragments as silence shards—pattern taught and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry triple duty: advance, embody, reverb (“salt air stinging his eyes” = setting, sensation, consecration). No scaffold loops; each image appears once and recedes, preventing purple bloat. Figurative logic stays internally coherent—silence as calcified, blaze without crackle—so metaphoric density heightens rather than muddies closure. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and re-charge motif; paragraph cuts are surgical.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The “creeping normality noticer” is a fresh vocational lens on cosmic horror of quietude; trope of haunted house inverted into entropy-noticer’s experiment. Displacing ocean-cured orris to sanctify timber is specific, non-obvious synthesis that could not swap settings without collapse. Risk of lyric abstraction is embraced yet paid off in conceptual reprice rather than drift into vagueness. Final reconfiguration feels inevitable only in hindsight—hallmark of ingenuity.</comment>
