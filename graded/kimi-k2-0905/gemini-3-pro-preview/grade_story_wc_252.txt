<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elian’s calm, fluid motivation is legible throughout, but Vane’s shift from violent refusal to surrender leans on the scrimshaw’s “unlock” rather than on accumulated interior beats; the embrace-as-assault moment is sharp, yet Vane’s final release feels slightly under-causal for the climax.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the dissolve of the dock and the spark of gills reweight the world with undeniable cost. Causal chain holds—whale-call → scrimshaw warmth → Vane lets go—but the dock’s sudden “cloud of silt” edges toward convenient dissolution rather than earned physics.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>“Sublittoral fringe” and “waist-deep brine” anchor body and place early; kelp as lover’s fingers, whale-song vibrating watery molecules—each detail is sensuous, selective, and directly pressures the choice to detach. Dock-to-silt could use one sentence of causal foreshadowing to hit the 9-band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Single dominant stake—leave or drown—tightens when the whale-call raises the water from chest to shoulders. The scrimshaw’s warmth is the visible price that forces Vane’s renunciation; escalation is coherent, though the island’s fade feels off-stage compared to the immediate aqueous threat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of fluidity vs. rigid boundaries emerges through image, not lecture: dock dissolving, gills blooming, gravity unburdened. Final image reweights the premise—home is not land lost but water embraced—without moralizing. Slight softness only because the island’s conceptual disappearance is asserted more than dramatized.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person keeps a tight psychic distance on Elian; diction stays within maritime laborer lexicon (“bollard,” “pilings”) while rising to lyrical compression. Rhythm matches rising tide—long clauses swell, then shorten at “Let go.” No head-hopping; POV modesty maintained.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong kinetic verbs (“wrestled,” “spiraling”) and sensory specificity; one mixed metaphor “roaring silence” is forgivable. Filter-verb clusters absent; no loops. Copy-clean except a single tense slip “had ended overnight” that could trim to “ended overnight” for immediacy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Post-cataclysm aquatic conversion told through dockside grapple feels fresh; whale-bone as biometric key and the island literally erasing itself from reality are non-obvious syntheses. Transformation test passed—swap dock worker for office clerk and the whole emotional arc collapses.</comment>
