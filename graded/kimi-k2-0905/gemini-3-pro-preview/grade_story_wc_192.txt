<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Mara’s interiority is concrete—her white-knuckled grip, the ache of uncurled fingers—yet the “drowning/suffocating” metaphors edge toward diagnostic shorthand. The contradiction between her bridge-burning agency and her paralysis with the ring is dramatized in one continuous beat, so the change is legible. Elian’s translucent-scar linkage supplies external pressure, but as a shadow he remains more symbol than second voice, so relationship-as-crucible is thin. Cost is felt in the final ash-swallowed thud, earning the renunciation.</comment>

<comment>Causal lens holds: because she refuses to release the ring, therefore the threshold dissolves; because she drops it, her stance reconfigures. Anchors—who/where/when—are fixed by line 3; no orientation debt. Closure is the visible, audible thud that swallows the sound and the threshold, a Decisive Change with felt cost. The persistent constraint (no bridges, no door) shapes the final image, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>

<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The burnt cathedral of ash under cold starlight is not backdrop: the soft ash receives the ring, swallowing its sound, literally charging the final image. Distance, texture, temperature are filtered through Mara’s bone-deep fatigue; she notices what matters—ash like snow, iron’s bite, silence pressing on eardrums. Spatial choreography is clean: cross-legged center → Elian kneels → both stand → ring falls → empty palms under stars. Environment constrains the choice: no planks left, only ash to receive the anchor she relinquishes.</comment>

<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Single dominant stake: can she step off the vanished threshold? Pressure tightens once when Elian reframes the ring as anchor, narrowing options from trophy to weight. The reversal is her uncurled fingers—agency reasserted—visible price paid in the ash-swallowed thud that forecloses return. Cost is unmistakable on the page under the causal lens.</comment>

<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme—liberation through relinquishment—emerges from the ring’s reweighting, not sermon. Subtext operates in Elian’s silence and the ash that swallows sound, implying past noise cannot return. Final image (empty palms under stars) offers a resonant, non-literal answer: absence is now her possession. Avoids tidy moral; ambiguity survives in the vast dark world she must still enter.</comment>

<comment>POV stays tight third on Mara; Elian is observed externality, no head-hop. Syntax flexes with stress—“white-knuckled,” “shaky but holding”—and relaxes into longer breath after the drop. Diction remains within her credible lexicon; no filter-verb stacks. Silence-as-pressure motif is taught early and paid off when the thud is swallowed, satisfying patterned-elision rules.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or pressure. Figurative language is sparse and coherent—“burnt cathedral,” “tender shadow keeper”—no mixed metaphors. High information density: one line can anchor setting, reveal psyche, foreshadow cost. Final thud is monosyllabic, sonic closure that mirrors thematic silence—rhythm serves beat.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Synthesis of post-fire wasteland + spectral guide + doorknocker-as-anchor feels inevitable yet fresh; familiar grief-ritual is re-cast through tactile iron and swallowed sound. Risk taken in near-allegorical figures (shadow keeper) paid off by grounded sensory detail. Without the ash-swallow mechanism the story collapses, proving irreplaceability. No close echoes of famous scenes; voice remains singular.</comment>
