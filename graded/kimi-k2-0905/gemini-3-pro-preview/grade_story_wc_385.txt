<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elara’s sensory-specific vocation is shown through acoustic micro-choices (“adjusted her pitch… catching dissonance”), but her interior contradiction—the cold drive to expose murder versus the trembling isolation of the act—stays summary-level until the final breath. The shell-handling gives tactile stakes; her body never visibly trembles or mis-sings under stress, so embodied cost arrives late. Closure choice (seal the echo) is causally prepared by every prior sung fragment, earning the renunciation of silence, yet the moment of private terror that should foreshadow it is only asserted.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Orientation lands immediately—sandstone walls, starlight, midnight intrusion—well inside 120 words. Causal chain is clean: because she feeds graduated melodies, therefore the canyon yields truth-sediments, because she now holds the grafted echo, therefore she must smuggle it out. One seamless scene, no teleporting props; the shell’s rising heat literalizes escalating danger. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the city will awaken to its own acoustic corpse—an undeniable conceptual cost sealed by the intake of breath.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The gorge operates as both instrument and prison; spiral geometry of shell → spiral fault in stone guides the tactical modulation of song. Micro-setting (the shell’s heating hollow) constrains the final sealing act. Sensory economy favors sound over sight, matching POV bias. Starlight and reed-wind supply tonal melancholy without tourist clutter; every environmental cue is filtered through geological acoustics that determine success or discovery.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will she extract the Archivist before Council wards strike—tightens via each returned echo; failure equals acoustic entombment. Agency is continuous: she chooses pitch, interprets reverb, risks volume. The shell’s vibration supplies visible price, forcing breath-level concealment. One meaningful deepening: Council’s silencing spell graduates from background rumor to embodied wall-graft, shifting stakes from curiosity to witnessing state murder.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Themes of forced remembrance and weaponized memory emerge through sonic images, never stated; the city will literally echo its crimes tomorrow. Subtext lives in implication: governance survives by turning citizens into monuments against themselves. Final image (she walks back toward the sleeping city) reweights earlier melancholy into activist threat, accomplishing Conceptual Repricing without moralizing. Irony: the tool of mourning (echo song) becomes the blade that will cut the silence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinctive lyric cadence mimics canyon reverb—long vowels, clause-echoes (“sandstone walls twisted… twisted into…”)-pattern taught in first two sentences and sustained. No head-hopping; perception stays welded to Elara’s auditory filter, diction inside plausible lexicon for a sound-cartographer. Compression balances immediacy (“reed-blown melancholy”) with information. Final whispered seal modulates rhythm to breath-level, matching tactical shift, so voice control escalates with stakes.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High information density: single sentences simultaneously advance lore, acoustic tactic, and atmosphere. Varied sentence length mirrors musical phrasing; no template cadence runs. Metaphors stay physically coherent (wind as reed-blown instrument). Two micro-loops—“echo forever… fade into silence” restated—dull momentum only briefly; no artifacts near closure. Proofing clean; pronoun “she” stays unambiguous throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Premise fuses geologic acoustics with political thriller, a non-obvious synthesis. Council’s sound-traps invert normal surveillance logic: instead of recording you, they make the landscape replay you eternally. Risky lyric structure pays off by aligning reader breathing with protagonist’s final sealing intake. While “music as memory” is familiar, the shift from mournful lament to insurgent archive feels fresh and specific to this canyon.</comment>
