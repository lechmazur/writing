<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Elara’s insurgent resolve is vivid, but the “accidental telepathy” is asserted, not dramatized; we never feel the psychic cost in a micro-choice. Her final stance is earned, yet the interior contradiction between worship and weaponization is stated more than embodied under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Causal lens holds: because she decodes the kite, therefore the sphere opens, therefore the child awakens. Closure is a decisive conceptual re-pricing—hope becomes weapon—with visible cost as patrol lights lock onto her triumphant surrender.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Hot-spring heat, sulfurous steam, and dissolving amber constrain every beat; the milky-gold pool literally catalyzes the unseal. Spatial choreography is flawless—boots, satchel, kite-fabric, embryo—each object tracked across scalding ground.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—rebirth versus stagnation—tightens when decoding narrows options to one tonal sequence; failure means capture and eternal caution. The final image forecloses negotiation: rebirth is now armed and airborne under spotlights.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from tension between passive worship and active resurrection; “weaponized hope” reweights earlier moss-hum to anthem. No moralizing—insight is the glowing child itself—yet the concept feels inevitable, not asserted.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is sinewy, volcanic, grandmother-specific: “living shackle,” “earth was still angry.” No head-hopping; perception narrows to heat, static, color-bands. Rhythm accelerates with tap-code pulses, then snaps into triumphant brevity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Zero loops; every sentence layers job—heat gnaws, moss screams, fabric teaches. Metaphors stay geothermal: steam=curling shackle, amber=milky gold, never mixed. High density with read-aloud rhythm that mirrors decoding tension.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: insurgent grandma + geothermal cathedral + kite-binary as hack. Implanted destiny trope is inverted—savior is not leader but biosphere compiler. Risky choice to hinge climax on fabric-knot decryption pays off with specificity.</comment>
