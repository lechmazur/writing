<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara’s drive to ‘anchor serenity within motion’ is concrete via her seed-tending micro-choices and final revision of that goal; still, we never see her risk failure or real trade-off, so the cost feels intellectual rather than visceral.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly as Conceptual Repricing: the stillness she sought is redefined as participative cyclical motion; the lens is Accumulative/Textural, taught early, held to the final wrapping-paper image, and carries felt conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Canopy humidity, wax-paper canvases, and the greenhouse’s sway act as tactile constraints; the corpse-flower spadix becomes the micro-setting that charges the final drawn image, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Single dominant stake—personal anchoring—is signalled early and deepens through odor-analysis beats; tension tightens once when the bloom’s ‘vibration’ reframes her quest, but no external obstacle raises the cost beyond cognitive reframing.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges entirely through sensory particulars and the wrapping-paper palimpsest; the ending’s redefinition of serenity as motion is implicit, resonant, and avoids moralising.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is strong: olfactory vocabulary, synaesthetic metaphors (‘symphony in a minor key’), and rhythmic compressions under bloom-pressure remain coherent; no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lines are dense and rhythmic; occasional lyric stacked metaphors border on excess but are pattern-taught early and never obscure causality or the closure beat, so the penalty stays minor.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fusing corpse-flower horticulture with arbororeal mysticism feels fresh; the wrapping-paper journaling ritual and olfactory plot engine are specific, non-interchangeable, and integral to closure.</comment>
