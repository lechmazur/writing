<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elian’s obliging-mechanic facade and hidden obsession are crisply drawn; the final quiet renunciation—picking up the wrench instead of stepping sideways—pays off his interior split with felt cost. Interiority is mostly concrete, though one lapse into “radical obsession that…would deem insanity” drifts toward diagnostic label-speak, clipping the top band. Micro-choices (aligning lenses, pulling the lever, cradling the wrench) track hierarchy of values on the page. No second character present, so status crucible is N/A; solo arc holds.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the hologram collapses, the secret is banked, and the wrench’s weight re-anchors him to linear life—cost is the foreclosed escape. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory layer (icy warmth, phantom flutter, steel lever) tightens the stakes until the final image reweights them. Orientation is clean by line 3; no teleporting props. One hairline slip: “sideways time” is named before the hologram teaches us what that means, a micro-timing twitch keeping it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Station, gantries, capacitors, and bruise-colored sky are filtered through mechanic eyes; tool-as-setting constrains every move. The magnetic nexus is not just scenery—it is the pivot the prism array must lock to, charging the climax. Cold biting face vs. vibratory capacitor heat creates the requested icy-warm duality without branding it in dialogue. Spatial choreography is flawless: no impossible positions during the lever pull.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prove time moves sideways—is signaled early and tested by the holographic trial. One meaningful tightening: the nexus drifts out of alignment, collapsing the window and foreclosing Elian’s chance to follow the ghosts—price is immediate and visible. Agency is internal/attentional rather than external confrontation, fitting short-form scope. Cost is legible on the page (cold rushes back in, heart hammers), but no persistent constraint shapes tomorrow’s tactics, capping at 8.1.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: the cost of secret knowledge versus the safety of obedient repair work. Subtext lives in the wrench’s return—an object that once fixed things now marks the refusal to break free. No moralizing sentence recaps the meaning; the final image of secret warmth against cold externalizes the thematic trade-off. The sideways-time conceit reweights the mundane tool, achieving Conceptual Repricing at exit.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays welded to Elian’s perceptual signature—mechanical, understated, alert to vibration and temperature. Syntax shortens under lever-pull pressure; no head-hop. Filter verbs are sparse and voice-motivated (“felt mechanically warm”). Register never drifts into academic astro-babble; even “holographic principles” is framed as garage tinkering. Distinctive diction: “duralumin,” “jury-rigged,” “over-clocked capacitors” all within plausible mechanic lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with scene temperature—longer clauses in stillness, staccato bursts at lever clank. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn; each sentence advances image or pressure. One mixed metaphor bruise → indigo → violet is allowed under accumulative texture rule. Information density high; no scaffold sentences. Final line re-uses “warmth” and “cold” with recharged meaning, satisfying the read-aloud ear.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Trans-lunar moths and sideways-time slides are familiar SF tropes, but the mechanic’s covert array built from trash-compactor parts gives the combo a grounded, idiosyncratic twist. The refusal to follow the ghosts—choosing the wrench instead—flips the usual portal-fantasy arc, providing fresh inflection. Specificity of capacitor heat vs. stratospheric cold keeps it from feeling recycled. Not quite risky enough for bonus spike, but transformation is evident.</comment>
