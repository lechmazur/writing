<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’ interior contradiction—freezing to resist panic—is dramatized in muscular, body-first beats. The worn photo acts as a tactile pivot that tilts present choice; the grafting table micro-choices show hierarchy of values (beauty vs survival) with visible cost. PTSD memory is never psych-summarized; instead, desert ash is tasted in salt-air. Closure renunciation (stay, keep grafting) is earned by this embodied chain; only the quiet-talent label drifts toward shorthand, keeping score just under the 9-gate.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds: each sensory layer (wind, whine, soil, photo) thickens until the final graft reweights the whole pattern. Closure is a Charged Poise: Elias’ refusal to flee crystallizes options—remain the green lung—while the conceptual cost (perpetual vigilance, storm-locked solitude) is undeniable in the last image. Causality is intact: because he polishes the pearl and binds orchid to pine, therefore he stays, foreclosing mainland escape. No orientation or artifact debt touches the ending beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Glass-and-iron greenhouse acts as micro-setting that literally constrains every choice—leave and die of exposure, stay and tend fragile life. The grafting knife and bio-luminescent orchid are tools/objects that charge the final image; their tactile states alter tactics (delicate slice, binding tape). Salt-spray vs loamy air mirror inner storm/stillness without overt symbolism. Only minor spatial drift: “central grafting table” appears without prior anchoring, but choreography recovers by the splice beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—personal survival vs caretaking duty—tightens once: the turbine-whine triggers panic, forcing Elias to decide whether to stay the keeper of green things. Agency is renunciation; staying costs mainland comfort and perpetual PTSD exposure. Cost is visible: trembling hand steadies only after he accepts lifelong grafting vigilance. Escalation is single but sufficient under Accumulative lens; no secondary external antagonist needed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through recurring splice/anchor imagery: orchid = hope, pine = reality, union = fragile endurance. No explicit thesis; final image of “slow, brutal persistence of growth” reweights prior desert death without moralizing. Subtext in silence: absent lighthouse keeper ghosted by Elias’ self-appointed vegetal beacon. Minor abstraction in “optimism in realism” line keeps score just below 9.0.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Perceptual signature is botanist-poetic: “chlorophyll and root structures,” “biological puzzles,” diction never leaves Elias’ trained gaze. Rhythm mirrors PTSD storm-to-stillness: long sensuous sentences collapse into clipped surgical verbs at splice. No dialogue, so no convergence risk. One register drift: “conceptual repricing” idiom feels academic against coastal grit, but isolated.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies intelligently; storm sentences billow, splice sentences cut. No loops or scaffold; each sentence either advances weather, body, or tool-state. Metaphors stay physically coherent (glass lung, teeth-chattering frames). High info-density: “inhaling salt spray, defying gray desolation” layers threat, setting, theme in one breath. Clean copy, zero pronoun drift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: PTSD drone-survivor becomes lighthouse-grade plant-grafter, grafting memory onto salt-proof orchids—specific, non-obvious. Desert wedding ashes ↔ coastal greenhouse lungs transformation avoids trope echo. Risk in quiet ending is earned by prior sensory build; novelty lies in vegetal rebuttal to automated militarized world. Only slight proximity to “last lighthouse keeper” elegy trope keeps from 9.5.</comment>
