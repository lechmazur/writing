<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara’s obsession with “the texture of time” is viscerally embodied in the ceramic shard digging into her palm; the interior contradiction between borrowed seconds and craving fixity drives every beat. Micro-choices—kneeling, pocketing the shard—are credible under pressure. Final renunciation of mutable time lands with visible cost: her borrowed pulse slows, foreclosing eternal drift. Slight over-labeling (“obsession,” “fractured reality”) keeps it from 8.5+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the urn fragment freezes the silo’s mutations, reweighting Elara’s timeline with abrasive ash as the new constant. Causal chain intact—garage-sale signal → capsule retrieval → shard contact → stillness—each step narrows options. Orientation anchor (“apex of the Emerald Silo”) arrives at word 9; no penalty. Cost is legible in the slowed borrowed-time pulse and the pocketed shard’s perpetual cut.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Emerald Silo’s verdant gloom, toxic skyline, and scorched-titanium capsule constrain every move; the urn shard itself becomes micro-setting that halts environmental warping. Sensory hierarchy follows Elara’s priority: light pulsing, metal twisted like tree-root, ceramic grit against skin. Spatial track holds from apex to sub-basement; no floating rooms. Final image of “clear and sharp” glass recharges earlier distortion, passing 9- gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“feel time as gritty, linear progression”—tightens when the capsule’s failure collapses hope of preserved documents, forcing confrontation with death’s fixed integer. Shard contact delivers the single meaningful deepening that forecloses mutable time; price is the abrasive ash she must now carry. Agency is continuous: descent, breach, grip, pocket. No external antagonist needed; pressure is situational, coherence held.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: only death’s equation survives semantic collapse, and linearity is abrasive ash, not flowing water. Urn shard reweights prior motif of “slippery fog,” turning residue into stabilizing key. Final image offers resonant, non-moral answer: clear glass of wasteland beyond, now legible through ash. Avoids explicit thesis; slight abstract tag “the texture of time” is the only echo, forgiven.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays inside Elara’s perceptual filter: “skin hummed with static,” “rough ceramic dig into palm.” Syntax mirrors pulse—long clauses during descent, staccato fragments at shard touch. No dialogue, so voice coherence rests on interior diction, consistent. Experimental compression (“mile was merely a sensation of fatigue”) is taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High information density: single sentences deliver capsule failure, metal morphology, and cognitive leap. No loops or synonym churn; metaphor tree-root / concrete is precise. Rhythm accelerates at breach, breathes at stillness. Minor overpacking in “illogical storms that defined the era…” but does not obscure causality or dull closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: garage-sale dead-drop + post-numeric reality + urn shard as fixed point feels inevitable yet new. Conceptual risk—zero as audible hum—pays off in closure image of abrasive ash. Transformation test fails if Elara is swapped out; her borrowed-time biology is integral. No close echoes; avoids trope stampede.</comment>
