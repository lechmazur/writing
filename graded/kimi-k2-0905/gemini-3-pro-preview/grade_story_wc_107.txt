<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elias’s contemplative-glassblower identity is vivid—soot in smile-creases, ritual pipe rotation—but interior contradiction stays general; the “dangerous need” and “frozen heart” are declared rather than dramatized in micro-choices. The decisive exit is earned by prior causality (melt → collapse), yet the emotional cost is abstract (“chaotic invitation”) rather than embodied. Still, the arc from isolated preservation to risky descent is legible and stakes his life’s work, satisfying the 9− threshold.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: he abandons the sanctuary, leaving the cooling dome as monument, tangible cost etched in the final image. Causal chain (thaw → structure failure → forced exit) holds; orientation (who/where/when) is anchored by word 80. One transition (studio→slope) is clean. No lens ambiguity; pressure tightens once. Meets 9− gate with cost visible in the last line.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Abandoned control-room-turned-studio is tactile—roaring furnace, shrieking supports, slush under gantries—each detail filters through Elias’s glassblower gaze. The setting actively destabilizes choice: meltwater undercuts foundation, forcing evacuation. Micro-setting (annealing oven, cracked bookmark) constrains packing decisions. Final image of the left-behind dome “staring” reweights the locale as relic. Sufficient for 9− band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—protect vs. share clarity—signaled early. Escalation is single but sufficient: thaw → structural groan → tilt → abandon. Protagonist agency drives the exit; luck complicates but does not solve. Cost is the forfeited dome and shelter, legible on page. Holds under causal lens; meets 8.2 floor for high-band entry.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of transparency vs. exposure emerges through glass imagery and regime context without explicit thesis. Subtext resides in the unmonitored speeches to ghosts—“ignorance yields to the light”—and the final abandoned eye. Final descent offers resonant reconfiguration: clarity now demands vulnerability, not walls. Avoids moralizing; ambiguity lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Elias’s idiom—“defiant orange beast,” “weighty lightness”—with rhythmic, bardic cadence that matches the self-narrating quirk. No head-hopping; psychic distance compresses under pressure (“frantic purpose”). Distinct perceptual signature: glass-color metaphors, blowpipe theology. Minor over-alliteration in places keeps it just below 9.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and musical—“the thaw was messy and dangerous, but it was the only way anything could grow” carries triple duty. No loops or scaffold; metaphors stay coherent. Occasional elevated diction (“Artificer initiates the Great Migration”) risks register drift yet reads as character flourish. Clean grammar, strong verbs, high information density.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Fusing glassblower craft with dystopian ice-thaw surveillance state feels fresh; transparent domes as safe zones for thought is a sharp conceptual spin. The solitary prophet addressing dead monitors merges ritual and absurdity, memorable without gimmickry. Transformation test fails—core arc could transplant to another maker-craft—but specificity of glass physics and melt timetable anchors it. Sufficient risk and synthesis for 8.6.</comment>
