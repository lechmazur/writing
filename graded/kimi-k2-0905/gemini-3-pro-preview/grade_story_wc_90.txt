<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Contradictory impulses (violence/renunciation) are dramatized in the stitching scene; the final float shows earned cost. Interiority tilts into self-help register (“acknowledge that the capacity for evil…”) that softens the bite at the hinge beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the door opens only after Elian’s joy-price is paid on-page. Causal lens holds—the needle-through-shadow beat directly enables the resonance Kwan Yin demands. One micro-turn (knot transmutes agony into acceptance) tightens stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The Cenotaph’s rusted-deck and dying-reactor hum constrain every motion; the blast door’s physical weight is repeatedly tested and finally neutralized by Elian’s weightlessness—setting becomes a tool that charges the last image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—unlock the door or remain the last witness—is signaled early and tightened once: the tear rejects him, forcing the shadow-stitch. Price is visible: his nausea/rage wave and the irreversible integration of violence. Escalation is causal and sufficient.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: peace gains meaning only when the capacity for violence is owned. The final image of weightless serenity re-prices all prior pacifism. Subtext in the saline crystalline grief of strangers implies species culpability—haunting and unsentimental.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Voice is dense, lunar, and ecclesiastical—“spectral residue,” “metaphysical space where his physical heel met the elongated dark silhouette”—yet stays inside Elian’s lexicon. Rhythm swells and contracts with the stitching beat, no head-hopping, perceptual signature sustained.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>High figurative density is pattern-taught early and paid off; mixed metaphors are avoided. Occasional scaffold (“he did not push the feelings away this time; he breathed them in”) is brief and does not touch the closure beat; no template cadence loops.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Recycled-warship-after-human-extinction is familiar SF territory, but the gravitational-emotion link, tear-stitch through crystallized ancestor grief, and Buddhist bodhisattva relic yield a fresh synthesis. Risky metaphysical stitching feels inevitable in hindsight—concept commits fully.</comment>
