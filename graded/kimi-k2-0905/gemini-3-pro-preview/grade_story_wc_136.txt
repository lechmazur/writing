<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara’s obsessive need to map the unmappable is shown through tactile micro-choices—crouching to trace cracks, punching fog instead of retreating—so her flaw actively drives every beat. The final self-shatter is earned: her jar waits for her, the tool she’s carried is the only one that can open it, and the cost is the protective mania she must relinquish. No contradictory impulses are staged in simultaneous scene, only summarized, keeping this just under the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade></grade><comment>Closure is a clean Decisive Change under Causal lens: because she has followed the crack-arrows and punched void into stairs, she can smash her own suppressed truth and reintegrate. The punch’s lingering constraint—now a conductor’s key she can never unknow—shapes the final image. Cost is legible in the single line “sharp and purifying,” which makes the before/after legible. No orientation drift; midnight, city, ravine are anchored by 120-word mark.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The starlit vault literally supplies the only treadable surface; without its mist-constellations Elara cannot advance, so setting constrains tactics and charges the final image. Earlier, the collapsed train yard and dead street-lights funnel her toward the ravine, grounding the fantastical vault in palpable industrial decay. Sensory selection stays tight: ozone on tongue, cold iron oscillating to spirit, starlight as footing—never a catalog.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reach the Fortress or keep hiding behind maps—tightens once: the chasm forces the dare that dissolves her buffer between self and truth. Escalation is causal: each punch narrows escape options until the only remaining path is to break her own vessel. Cost is visible (trembling certainty, sharp wash of truth) but not persistently felt after the smash; hence stops short of 8.8+ band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the inversion of mapping: the city’s ugliest fractures are the truest guide, and the only map that matters is the one that ends at her own unvoiced fear. No explicit thesis; meaning accrues through the punch-tool, the arrow-cracks, and the jar of smoke that was always hers. Final image reweights prior motifs without moralizing—her “single, legible path” is now lived, not drawn.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person lyric distance stays stable, filtering every detail through Elara’s perceptual signature—angles, trajectories, graph-paper mind. Syntax lengthens when she calculates, fragments when she punches, mirroring stress. No filter-verb stacks; diction (“phantom train ticket punch,” “condensed moonlight”) is precise yet poetic without leaving her lexicon. Voice remains singular even at the cosmic threshold.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Rhythm breathes with tension: long cadence for city approach, staccato for punch-steps, then open vowels for vault ascent. No scaffold or synonym loops; each sentence either advances movement or reconfigures the fog-architecture. Metaphors stay internally coherent (tickets materialize like foil, starlight behaves like breath). Final line lands on monosyllabic certainty—“She had finally arrived”—after polysyllabic swirl, sharpening closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Combines urban-decay mystery cult with celestial confession vault—two rarely paired arenas—yet the synthesis feels inevitable because the same punch-tool bridges train-yard ghosts and starlit truths. Cracks-as-arrows literalizes the psychogeography trope without sliding into allegory; the specificity of ozone, rust, and graph paper keeps it grounded. Risk is high (stepping into void) but earned by early pattern and tangible tool, so novelty amplifies rather than obscures stakes.</comment>
