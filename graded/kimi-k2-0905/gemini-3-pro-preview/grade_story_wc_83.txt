<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elias’s survivor-grief obsession is visceral and embodied; every micro-choice is filtered through the wedding massacre. The “toxic hope” that drives him to trip the breakers again shows a credible, flawed endurance that forecloses safety with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal chain is tight: because the breakers cool → darkness → hunt begins → perturbation → vision → breaker snap-back → collapse. The final override key is a decisive change that reconfigures his options and costs him any return to normal life.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The Floating Observatory’s zero-g darkness and metallic ticking constrain every beat; the viewport glass and cooling-breaker clock shape tactics. The Geode is a micro-setting that literally organizes the vacuum’s ghost-energy and charges the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—access the wedding’s lost future—remains singular and tightens when each perturbation risks station integrity. Cost is palpable: the vision’s caustic joy burns him, and the final override snaps reality back, leaving him collapsed and alone.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the math of grief: momentum is conserved even for erased lives, and the survivor must pay rent on that debt. The ending’s toxic hope reweights the premise without moralizing—beauty and ruin are inseparable.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is carved, obsessive, physics-literate; negative-space metaphor and “arrested possibility” syntax feel unique to Elias. Rhythm tightens under pressure—short percussive clauses mirror the ticking metal and breakers’ countdown.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>High-density lines (“mathematical waste product of his tragedy”) do multiple jobs; only minor cadence echo around “tears floated/darkness rippled.” No mixed metaphors or scaffold clutter; the final override key lands clean and propulsive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Takes the trope of “grief-as-physics” and makes it brutally specific: drone-strike wedding, perturbation theory as séance, Geode as Fourier transformer. The risk of math-horror pays off; the concept feels inevitable and unreplicable.</comment>
