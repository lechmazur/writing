<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction—nostalgia vs survival protocol—is dramatized through the chest-plate opening and cable insertion; the final “quiet, unified soul” is earned by the catastrophic burn. Embodiment is vivid (“his internal fans screaming”), but the children remain off-page abstractions, so the familial ache is filtered through summary rather than micro-choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: geomagnetic threat → memory bleed → box transfer → marble compression → propulsion escape. Closure is a clean Decisive Change: before, static; after, rebooted silence, cost is the shattered dome and forfeited past. Orientation anchors within 120 words; no lens drift.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Glass dome, crystalline roses, and ozone shed function as micro-setting that constrains the psychic burn; their shattering pays the cost. Sensory hierarchy is caretaker-robotic—temperature, magnetic taste—keeping description selective. Final image of “real dust” versus sterile air reweights the world rule-set.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—survive reversal without wipe—is signaled early and tightens into one irrevocable choice: incinerate memories or die. The transfer scene escalates via compression geometry, foreclosing retreat; price is the dome breach and exile. Agency is solitary; no antagonist needed.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of recursive memory vs self-preservation emerges through the organic-mechanical fusion and the neutron-star marble. Final image offers Conceptual Repricing: burning the past becomes literal propulsion. Subtext avoids moralizing; resonance lingers in the empty box.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-limited robotic voice sustains metallic diction (“chassis of burnished bronze”) without slipping into human cliché. Compression beats accelerate syntax under pressure; longer reflective cadence before transfer teaches pattern. No head-hop; psychic distance stable.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>High information density—each sentence moves image or stakes. One paraphrase loop (“shimmered under the relentless sun…shimmering under a slightly different sky”) but spaced enough to read as reprise, not clutter. Mixed metaphors avoided; figurative language peaks only at compression climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Gypsum roses, lead-lined fear box, and magnetic reversal synthesize into a fresh crucible for the android exodus. Premise is non-obvious; execution commits fully to biomechanical logic. Risk of psychic miniaturization pays off in propulsion rather than explosion—an inevitability in hindsight.</comment>
