<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Silas’s cheery whistling against velvet gloom is a vivid contradiction, but his motives stay externalized; we see toolkit curiosity, no interior contradiction or cost. The “blithe” stance risks flattening into quirk because no micro-choice on the page is punished or forced. The waiting payoff is legible, yet the emotional turn is narrated rather than embodied; no felt cost hits Silas, so the closure is observed, not earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the sovereign case re-prices the chaos from rage to abandoned hope, a conceptual reweighting with mournful cost visible in the final image. The causal chain holds: border-thread decoding → dropped case → portrait of waiting; the lens is Accumulative/Textural. The one-scene orientation is taught early (Silas, silo, timer silence), so no orientation debt applies. The timer is an elegant escalator, but its single beat keeps escalation light; still, the tightening suffices under the short-form rule.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The cobalt silo, star shafts, and shroud spectrum are tactile, immediate, and filtered through Silas’s gardener eye; the setting steers every action—threads hang where he must climb, colors sort his path. The sovereign case micro-setting anchors the knot’s release and charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography stays clean; no impossible positions or prop drift. Weather is used (wind at close) but minimally; enough for atmosphere, not checklist.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—will the chaotic tapestry resolve into legible motive?—tightens once when the case drops and re-weights meaning; cost is conceptual (the dead man’s paralyzing hope) rather than felt by Silas. Agency is epistemic, not risky; Silas never faces a trade-off or price, so pressure plateaus at discovery. Under Accumulative lens the single deepening suffices, but without personal cost the escalation stays modest.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges obliquely: the desire to categorize grief collides with the mess of human yearning; the cosmos offers no symmetry, only a silver case of waiting. The final image re-configures prior color-chaos as loneliness, re-pricing the silo’s velveteen gloom into quiet pathos—an earned resonance without moralizing. Subtext stays implicit; no character spells the lesson. The motif of “tending” threads lightly unites gardener and mourner, but the gardener’s bliteness keeps thematic focus on the dead, not the living.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Voice is distinct: jaunty diction (“skip in his step,” “unruly hedges”) collides with macabre setting, creating a perceptual signature that modulates under starlight. Syntax stays controlled; no filter-verb clutter; figurative language is selective, never algorithmic. POV distance holds tight third; no head-hop. The only lift needed: let the voice crack once under pressure to show cost; currently it stays uniform to the end.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, and information-dense; sentences carry double duty (action + atmosphere) without scaffold. Metaphors (“velveteen gloom,” “garden of shrouds”) are coherent and purposeful, not stacked. Near the climax, the cadence slows to match image settle, showing rhythm control. Minor paraphrase loop—“chaotic knot of conflicting colors” repeats essence twice—drops it from 8.3.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The vertical cemetery of hanging tapestries is a fresh, visceral conceit; gardener-as-curator-of-lives transforms familiar death tropes into tactile horticulture. Risk is high but coherent; the speculative frame never breaks its own logic. The sovereign-case reveal feels inevitable in hindsight yet non-obvious, satisfying the transformation test. Specificity—thread colors as grief spectrum, timer as chess-clock—anchors universals without borrowing stock images.</comment>
