<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Kaelen’s “defiant artist” label is instantly vivified: his bone-perch intrusion, syncopated recitation, and trickster grin embody the trait while his interior wish to “refract a single truth” clarifies motive. The moment he accepts probable exile in exchange for the village’s moment of honest noise, a credible, costly renunciation is sealed. Secondary characters remain emblematic, but since only Kaelen drives turns, the piece meets single-POY demands. Emotional calibration is theatrical rather than raw, preventing 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Closure is unmistakable: the forged hush shatters, the spire is forced to hold polyphonic truths, and Kaelen stands ready for punishment—an Earned Stasis with visible cost. Causality holds: because he speaks, the canyon’s acoustic rule refracts, forcing villagers and elders to confront complexity. The lens is Causal: every stanza tightens options for both protag and community. Orientation is supplied early (“Canyon of Endless Echoes… before the ritual”), satisfying the 120-word anchor test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The bone-canyon and pale spire are not backdrop but coercive technology: their echo mechanics literally force Kaelen’s tactic and determine the climax. Sensory cues (weight of silence, vertebrae towers scraping sky) are filtered through communal fear, never tourist catalog. Micro-setting qualifies: the spire’s surface refracts rather than reflects—this physical twist enables the entire conceptual payoff. Spatial choreography is clean; Kaelen climbs, speaks, observes result, then descends.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—who controls communal memory—tightens the moment Kaelen begins speaking; each line worsens his personal risk while widening village possibility. Escalation is causal: stanza → acoustic refraction → narrative fragmentation → elders’ panic. The price (exile/silence) is legible and accepted on-page. One minor slack: villagers’ reaction is summarized, not dramatized, fractionally muting pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme—“forgiveness costs certainty”—emerges through acoustic metaphor rather than sermon. The canyon’s refusal to return a single blameless echo enacts the idea; no character spells out a moral. Subtext operates in Elders’ ear-covering, youth slowly lowering hands—gestures that reconfigure power without exposition. Final image of “honest confusion” soil is resonant, non-literal, and conceptually priced.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person omniscient stays consistently at mythic distance; no POV drift into individual villagers’ heads. Diction—“calcified horizon,” “ossuary amphitheater”—maintains elevated lyric register appropriate to fable. Rhythm modulates: long Latinate clauses for solemnity, then punchy imperative “you must hold the shards!” for climax. Compression is purposeful; no head-hopping, no filter-verb bloat.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is exuberantly figurative yet information-dense: each metaphor (silence as “forged hush,” spire as “phantom finger”) advances concept or stakes. One mixed-metaphor risk—“symphony of nuanced echoes” beside “prism of his art”—barely slips through because the acoustic motif sustains both. No scaffold loops, no template cadence, opening and closing lines ear-tested. At climax, density peaks but never muddies causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The acoustic-forgiveness conceit feels fresh yet inevitable; centuries of fear compressed into physical silence reframed as tax for absolution offers a sharp angle on collective guilt. Risk is taken—poem as weaponized physics—yet internal logic remains consistent. Details (vertebral towers, memory-fed spire) are specific to this world; swap them and the tale collapses. No derivative template detected; final reprise of shattered hush reweights all prior beats.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Setup: identified atop bone. Development: his poem refracts elders’ accusation, forcing tactical change across village. Closure: he accepts exile for the act. Cost is exile; removing him collapses entire causal chain.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Setup: described as memory receptacle. Development: mist swirls, surface refracts instead of reflects—literal pivot enabling climax. Closure: glows under polyphonic weight. Irreplaceable acoustic engine.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Early signaled as ritual purpose. Development: Kaelen’s poem enacts forgiveness by destroying single blame, forcing villagers to hold contradictory truths. Closure: “honest confusion” soil priced with his exile. Drives stakes throughout.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Grin and mud-puddle simile establish trait. Enables risky action—he speaks when silence mandated. Provides cover for sophisticated poetic attack, disguising rebellion as play. Cost still paid, so trait is consequential.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Central beat: his stanza hits spire → acoustic refraction → narrative explosion. Without this specific refract mechanic, climax cannot occur; swapping verbs would break internal physics.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Method seeded in character intro “impromptu poetry sessions.” Mechanics matter: syncopated cadence tailored to canyon’s echo rules. Two beats: launches stanza; shouts final line over cacophony. Not swappable with generic “speech.”</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Setting pressures choice: acoustic laws compel Kaelen’s tactic and determine outcome. Present in setup, exploited mid-action, referenced in final symphony of echoes. Bone towers visually echo theme of fragmented truth.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Timeframe declared in first paragraph; urgency heightened by elders already raising hand to begin Chant. Clock is narrative rather than literal minutes, but still forces Kaelen to act before ritual completes.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Motive named early and dramatized: each line of poem intentionally splits single guilt into multiple causes. Friction appears—greater fragmentation increases personal danger. Endures cost willingly, sealing motive-to-consequence arc.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>“Forged hush” established in paragraph one and maintained through acoustic dread. Tone fractures into chaotic polyphony precisely when Kaelen’s refraction succeeds, charging closure. Coherent modulation, not static mood.</comment>
