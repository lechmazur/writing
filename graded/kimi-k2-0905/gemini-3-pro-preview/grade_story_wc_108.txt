<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elias’s contradictory terror and hyper-vigilance are dramatized in trembling micro-choices (tilting the cast, keying the inversion). The final refusal—“I am not Echo”—is earned by the prior beat of weaponizing his flaw. Cost is visible: he seals himself in darkness he dreads. Interiority stays concrete; no label-speak under peak pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Causal chain is tight: betrayal → panic → cast decryption → protocol inversion. Closure is a Decisive Change with felt cost—Elias traps himself to burn Julian’s perimeter. Orientation anchors by line 4; no drift. Lens (Causal) holds without ambiguity; no teleporting props or retro-patches.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Roofless library, freezing stars, and rusted console filter through Elias’s claustrophobic gaze; every detail tightens his trap. The child-cast micro-setting supplies the override code, constraining the climax. Spatial choreography is clean—boots squeal, shutters slam. Sensory selection narrows to metallic cold and starlight, mirroring his dread.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—survive the burn—tightens at 5-minute countdown. One meaningful turn: Elias inverts the protocol, redirecting fire outward; price is self-imprisonment in feared darkness. Agency is continuous; no coincidence resolves. Pressure escalates because/therefore under Causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme—vulnerability as power—emerges through Elias’s trembling decryption and self-entombment, never stated. The child-cast relic reweights from sentimental junk to tactical key, charging closure. No moralizing; irony lingers that the “disposable” copy outlives the Original. Ambiguity remains: is darkness salvation or new cage?</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elias’s sensory panic; perceptual signature is metallic, cold, star-harsh. Syntax shortens under countdown pressure; diction stays within his lived vocabulary. No head-hopping; Julian’s voice arrives only via shell, tinny and external. Rhythm accelerates with trembling micro-moves, then lands on the final boom.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, high-density; every sentence advances stakes or texture. No scaffold loops or synonym churn. Metaphors are sparse, precise—“decaying monument,” “tetanus-laced walls”—and avoid purple overload. Filter verbs minimal; strong verbs carry motion. One paraphrase loop risk in “his breath misting… frigid air” but isolated, does not dull closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Clone-stunt-double-as-phobic-scapegoat is fresh; inversion of sanctuary protocol via child-cast indentations is specific and non-obvious. Risk taken in sealing protagonist inside his own terror pays off. Some echo of familiar “copy rebels against original” arc, but Elias’s embodied anxiety and the plaster-cast cipher transform the trope. Concept commits fully; no safety middle.</comment>
