<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid—her monocle adjustment, breath check, ruby-flake grip show a balance of scholarly caution and hunger for discovery. The “wisely adventurous” trait is dramatized when she hesitates at the unstable hologram steps, yet still climbs, pressure visible in buzzing photons and flaking void below. Final ascension fuses lore-keeper identity with ruler claim, the cost paid in irreversible exposure to sunrise. No secondary character, so relationship bullets skipped; single-POV baseline met.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens: every beat obeys because/therefore—deadline countdown strips options until she must leap onto flickering light-stair. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land by line 20; no penalty. Closure is Decisive Change: “hand syncing” with throne rewrites city’s atmospheric future and her own role; sunrise glare is visible price. No teleporting props or soft resets; mural-peel mechanic seeded early and paid off at apex.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>City’s wet ferrocrete, oil-slick coolant waterfall, acid-stained wall, chrome skeleton-trees—each tactile detail doubles as choke-point or tool: orchard supplies the key fruit-energy, wall mural literally births the stairs. Spatial choreography flawless; orchard perimeter, eastern wall, stair apex track cleanly. Ruby flake’s crystallized code-memory is micro-setting that cuts open reality, constraining her only path. Final matte-black throne overlooking ruins is image that recharges all prior neon rot with sovereign clarity.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“claim throne before sunrise incinerates zone”—tightens every beat; clock shown in vision corner and klaxon wail. Escalation causal: mural-peel → unstable stair → sunrise beam, each step forecloses retreat. Cost legible on-page: orchard skin flakes into void, final ray punch through waterfall burns away stealth, forcing public claim. No coincidence; her flake-initiated peel alone births the stair, agency absolute.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of custodianship-becoming-sovereignty emerges through staircase birth from archived mural—lore kept becomes power seized. Sun once lethal to painted utopians reframed as coronation light; mythical nostalgia repriced into pragmatic command. No overt moralizing; final “new command” line is action, not thesis. Futuristic nostalgia stays subtextual, charged by ruined chrome trees versus fresh solar authority.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person close maintains tight psychic distance; diction (“ferrocrete,” “fiber-optic,” “smart-paint”) stays within Lore-Keeper lexicon. Rhythm accelerates into staccato clauses during stair climb, mirroring flicker-grid stress. No dialogue, so no register drift; narrative voice carries idiom. Perceptual signature consistent—techno-archivist noticing layers, energy signatures, archival graffiti.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High information density: “kaleidoscopic waterfall of recycled hydro-coolant” packs world, tech, mood into seven words. Sentence length varies strategically; long sensory lines settle, then clipped fragments during quake/klaxon. Metaphors sustained—wall skin, waterfall curtain—without mixed vehicle clash. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances story or atmosphere. Opening line anchors voice/stakes; final line crystallizes new command, recharging throne motif.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Familiar “hidden control seat” trope inverted by requiring archival peel to reveal ascent stair—history itself becomes access key, not brute infiltration. Risky hard-light staircase born from painted utopia feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Specificity of ruby code-flake versus generic lock-pick freshens heist element. Emotional specificity: scholar’s reverence morphs into reluctant sovereignty, avoiding archetype trap. Concept fully committed; no retreat into safe ambiguity.</comment>
