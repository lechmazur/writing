<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara’s claustrophobia and “prudently adventurous” trait are dramatized in the moment she forces herself to keep playing while walls close in; the steel needle micro-choice embodies her method. Interiority stays concrete—“her claustrophobia screamed”—and the final slump over keys shows embodied cost. No contradictory impulses are shown in scene, so the 9+ quick test isn’t quite met, but motivation drives every beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: because she plays, the space mutinies; therefore she must keep playing to survive. The orientation anchors by line 5; closure is a decisive change—world awakened, her exhaustion the visible cost. The final image of her walking away while “echoes guard the silence” is a Charged Poise that reconfigures stakes. No teleporting props or soft resets; every turn is earned.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The obsidian organ, starlight, and contracting stone are viscerally sensed and directly constrain her tactic—she needs open-air acoustics. The “shadowed nexus” is more postcard than lived-in, but the organ-as-micro-setting charges the climax. Spatial choreography is clean: walls inch inward, compass point dances, exit gap narrows then widens. Meets 9+ gate via tool/organ that shapes tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—survival vs. suffocation—is signaled immediately and tightens geometrically with each chord. One meaningful reversal: fleeing becomes fatal, endurance becomes viable. Cost is visible: sweat-cooled skin, trembling slump. Agency is hers alone; coincidence never rescues.</question>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</question><comment>Theme of “wistful rebellion” emerges through the organ’s refusal to let the world sleep; no moral is stated. The broken-yet-defiant world is felt via the stones’ groan and her exhausted exit. Final image reweights the premise: dormancy can be ended, but price is fatigue and solitude. Complexity lingers—spring is possible, not guaranteed.</question>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</question><comment>Third-limited stays tightly welded to Elara’s perceptual filter—“marrow of her bones,” “brittle and cold.” Diction—“liturgy,” “wind chest,” “litany”—is within her pathfinder lexicon. Rhythm accelerates with sentence fragments under pressure: “To run was to be crushed.” No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks; voice modulates cleanly.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</question><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances. Metaphors stay physically coherent—“breathing down on her like living predators”—and serve urgency. Information density high: one line can set, sense, and foreshadow. Closure line “leaving the echoes to guard the silence” is crisp and resonant.</question>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</question><comment>Spatial-mutiny-via-organ is a fresh synthesis; the resonant key that re-animates earth feels mythic yet specific. Risk—using music as physics—pays off without gimmickry. Detail level is calibrated to word count; no stock explorer clichés. Slight deduction for echo of “music awakens dormant world” trope, but execution is individualized.</comment>
