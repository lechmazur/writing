<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Silas’s obsession with permanence is vivid and embodied (lead-stained skin, clanking gait). Interiority stays concrete—he wants to compress eternity into a felt moment—and every action flows from that. The final rupture is a credible, costly expression of his flaw: he literally falls with his shattered archive. No contradictory impulses on page, but the absence of any live relationship keeps the score sub-9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each beat is a because/therefore link (find frost → distil whisper → print contradiction → world tears). Closure is a decisive, irreversible change—library dies, Silas dies with it—charged by the conceptual cost of “solid consequence.” No orientation debt; world rules taught through action. Cost is unmistakable in the final image of him falling among shards.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Glass orchard library is not backdrop but engine: transparent boughs store mutable histories, so cracking them rewrites reality. Micro-setting (iron press, bottled whisper) constrains every tactical choice. Spatial choreography is immaculate; shards track across the fall. Frost patterns function as both forensic clue and sabotage tool—irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“compress eternity into a moment”—is signaled early and escalates through each mechanical step until the universe slams into one now. The protagonist’s agency drives every turn; luck is absent. Visible price: the immortal cloud-city loses its negotiability and Silas loses life. One decisive tightening suffices; cost is on-page and legible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: permanence vs. mutability, the violence of making time real. Motifs (frost, glass, bottled doubt) accrue meaning through use, not announcement. Final image of falling shards reweights prior immortality as fatal weight. No moralizing; resonance is imagistic and earned.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person tight stays locked to Silas’s perceptual filter—gray smudges, metallic clang, frost geometries. Diction is compressed, rhythm metal-on-glass: short percussive clauses mirror the press’s bite. No head-hop; psychic distance narrows under pressure. Voice distinctiveness is high, though register spikes once (“conceptual repricing”-level diction) keep it from 9.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentence lengths swell and contract with press strokes. Metaphors are clean (frost as fingerprints) and internally consistent; no mixed vehicles. One scaffold loop—“the rustling awakenings grew into a roar”—is purposeful escalation, not artifact. Information density is high; every clause advances image or causality. Minor filter-verb cluster mid-fall keeps it shy of 9.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Premise—floating library of mutable histories harvested as glass fruit—is startling yet immediately credible. Frost pattern as sabotage key and bottled doubt as chemical ink feel inevitable in hindsight. Risk (destabilize perfection) is taken fully; concept pursued to literal death. Synthesis of print culture + cosmological fragility is fresh, not gimmick. Specific detail (lead smudges, iron press groan) anchors abstraction in lived craft.</comment>
