<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elara’s obsession with vanished paths is vivid and consistent; her gleeful reaction to mass despair is a bracing flaw. The moment she projects “hope” into the crater glass crystallizes her contradictory appetites. Interiority is sharp, but the beat where she “skips over seeds” after learning she harvests souls feels tonally unearned—too light for the weight just revealed. Still, the final endurance—pocketing the glass and humming—carries visible cost: she accepts complicity in eternal entrapment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal chain: seed drop → foam reaction → glass discovery → transliteration → conjecture → revelation → acceptance, all within one geode location. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the “missing path” is redefined as deliberate self-crystallization, with the cost that Elara’s life-work is exploitation of that choice. One minor causality bump: the glass’s emotion-mapping rule is revealed only at midpoint, yet Elara instantly weaponizes it; still, the artifact’s behavior stays consistent thereafter. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no penalty.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The violet quartz geode is tactile—jagged floor, aperture, refracted star-tern shadow—and actively pressures action: the quartz wall blocks narrative completion until emotional conjecture supplies the missing frequency. Phantom sea-foam functions as micro-setting, its popping clock driving urgency. Sensory selection skews visual, but the humming glass adds dental vibration, justifying the visual dominance. Environment, body, and tool converge in the final image: glass in pocket, cave now known as inhabited tomb.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake: will Elara learn why histories vanish before the foam clock expires? Each beat narrows options: transliteration gaps → conjecture risk → final revelation that forecloses her original quest (paths disappear by choice, not tragedy). The tightening is causal and single-cycle, sufficient for 700-word scope. Cost is conceptual—her scholarship is complicity—but could be sharper if a concrete consequence (hearing voices, tooth fracture) lingered past the last line.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</question><comment>Theme emerges: the desire for neat erasure narratives collides with the messier truth that “disappearance” can be self-chosen persistence. Subtext resides in Elara’s aesthetic appetite for tragedy being fed by an unwittingly cannibalistic vocation. The final image reweights earlier “cheerful gloom” into something darker: she celebrates becoming jailer of the resigned. No moralizing statement—just the humming dirge—lets ambiguity linger.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</question><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Elara’s macabre connoisseur lens; diction (“exquisite despair,” “cheerful gloom”) is idiosyncratic yet consistent. Rhythm modulates: longer clauses for wonder, staccato for discovery. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk is zero. One filter-verb cluster (“she felt… she watched… she knew”) mid-scene, but compression returns under pressure. The perceptual signature—delight in others’ terminal emotions—never wavers.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</question><comment>Prose is dense but controlled; figurative language serves the gothic tone without purple drift. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or causality. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line recharges the dirge motif. Minor scaffold: “the glass began its work” is slightly hand-wavy, but immediacy recovers in the next sentence. Overall momentum survives the lyric load.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</question><comment>Premise fuses paleoceanic ghost-harvest with emotion-translating impact glass—fresh synthesis, not trope patchwork. The inversion that “vanished” people voluntarily embedded themselves as her daily resource is non-obvious yet inevitable once revealed. Risk: cheerful delight in genocide-level entrapment could read as edgy ornament, but the story commits to the stance without winking. Specificity of the geode, foam, and bird-seed mechanic keeps the concept grounded.</comment>
