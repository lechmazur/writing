<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—wanting to belong yet fearing to disturb—stays embodied in how she palms a skull before turning away. The “warmly curious” trait repeatedly tilts her micro-choices (tracing roots, naming skeletons), earning the closure act of hoisting the gnomon. No secondary character appears, so relationship crucible is N/A; diaspora grief threads every beat without summary labels. The only drag is two soft-focus “she felt connection” phrases that flirt with diagnostic-speak but are quickly grounded by tactile stone.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each unearthed relic adds density until the sundial shadow re-weights time itself. The ~120-word anchor rule is met (who/where/when by “diaspora returnee…catacomb orchard”). Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the moment the beam hits the dial, options reconfigure—time resumes, exile loops into circle—cost is the week of dust-lung labor and the irreversible knowledge that sky once closed. No causality breaks, though the “circle” epiphany is slightly announced rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Catacomb orchard is not backdrop but topography that dictates movement: roots force her route, bones force delicacy, blocked exit forces return. Sensory economy favors damp-earth olfaction and finger-on-bone tactility over visual catalog. The olive root that cradles a skull functions as “tool/setting hybrid,” constraining her gentle excavation style and charging the final image when the same root-system feeds the restored dial. Micro-setting qualifies; no contradictions or white-room gaps.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restart interrupted family time—announced early; pressure tightens as each relic literalizes hasty departure, narrowing her options to “mend or remain exiled.” One meaningful deepening: the sundial’s uselessness in darkness forces the week-long reconstruction, visibly costing stamina and skin. No external antagonist needed; the earth itself opposes her, and her agency (fitting stone to stone) drives every escalation. Cost is legible in cracked fingernails and the irreversible knowledge that the sky was once sealed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges from recursive inversion: life feeds on death, roots on bones, time on broken time. Subtext resides in gesture—touching skulls tenderly—rather than thesis. Final image of shadow pointing “true north” reweights exile as compassed return without moralizing. No motif echoes feel forced; the sundial’s return is earned by prior relics of interrupted departure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person close maintains consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature favors geological metaphors (“limestone ribs,” “stone stitching wound”) true to a woman who reads strata. Rhythm modulates: longer sentences for breathless descent, clipped fragments during stone-fitting. No dialogue, hence no voice convergence issue. Filter verbs minimal and purposeful; diction stays within plausible self-taught archaeologist lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Syntactic variety supports momentum—participial openers kept to 2 per paragraph, no template cadence. Figurative language is sparse and non-contradictory (“botanical embrace” is physically accurate). One buried lead: “travel sack petrified in mud” could open its paragraph for punch. Otherwise every sentence advances image or stakes; no paraphrase loops. Copy-clean except one missing comma after “fig root.”</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: orchard + ossuary + sundial creates a living clock of bones. Diaspora return is familiar, but inversion of burial site as site of rebirth feels inevitable. Risk in lyric accumulative structure pays off—reader taught the relic pattern early, so final shadow recharges all prior fragments. Could swap names/places only with great violence to root-bone imagery, satisfying transformation test.</comment>
