<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Silas’s interiority is concrete—cold refusal to shiver, tactile memory of the brass pull—and his micro-choice to hand the Commander the rose-stem lever crystallizes his “recycle mistakes” creed with visible cost. The Commander’s exhaustion is shown through gait and jaw tremor, giving both men mirrored vulnerability. Only the prisoner remains a cipher, muting relationship-as-crucible pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal chain is clean: broken lever → improvised brass stem → synchronized moon release; the snapped lever creates a Decisive Change that reconfigures both literal stakes (boy lives) and symbolic weight (Silas leaves the pull behind). Orientation is anchored by line 3; no teleporting props. Closure pays the cost: the once-tainted object becomes the literal key to forgiveness, satisfying Resonant Reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The storm-worn parapet, slick stone, and living mist are filtered through Silas’s chilled perception; the tower’s neutrality is not declared but enacted—no flags, no sides. The brass pull’s micro-setting (socket diameter) becomes the decisive environmental constraint. Spatial choreography is clean: opposite walkway, central pedestal, slumping boy—all tracked.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—prisoner’s life—signaled early; pressure tightens when corroded lever snaps, narrowing options to one improvised fix. Silas’s agency drives the turn: he risks his symbolic penance by jamming the pull into steel. Cost is felt immediately—he relinquishes the physical weight of his guilt. No coincidence resolves; moon timing was pre-set.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme of recycling failure into repair emerges through the object’s journey: burnt treaty relic → life-saving key. No explicit moralizing; final image of the abandoned rose-knob reweights prior guilt without statement. Subtext in the Commander’s tremor and Silas’s exposed face implies mutual recognition of fragility.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person lingers inside Silas’s perceptual bias—selective attention to cold, brass curves, Commander’s micro-muscles. Syntax lengthens under reflective beats, shortens during lever crisis, mirroring pulse. No head-hopping; Commander’s interior is read only through Silas’s interpretation, maintaining distance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “slick with the memory of a thousand torrential rains” fuses sensory and history in one clause. No scaffold loops; each sentence advances stakes or atmosphere. Figurative language is spare, never stacked; brass/rose metaphor arises from object, not imposed symbol. Final line lands on action, not explanation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Fantasy-tech moon-gear lock is fresh, yet grounded by tactile rust and sheared metal. Using a drawer-pull as life-saving key is specific, non-obvious, and inevitable once diameter is noted. Neutral-territory ruin avoids generic map politics; focus stays on interpersonal trust. Risk taken with magical gravity-chains pays off because mechanical failure still rules the moment.</comment>
