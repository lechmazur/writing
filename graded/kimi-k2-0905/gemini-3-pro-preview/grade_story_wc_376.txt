<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elara’s vocation & lie-allergy give her body-level stakes, but her interiority never contradicts itself under pressure; the moment she touches the plate her decision is already set, so the “change” feels announced rather than wrestled out. The clerk’s switch from denial to complicity is credible because her visible collapse makes the cost of his lie immediate. No secondary character pressure beyond that single beat. Overall, a strong crucible but short of the micro-choices that would lift it to 8+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Causal lens: each lie literally curls her skin, therefore she keeps digging; the map fragment leads to the clerk, therefore the plate is handed over. Closure is a clean Decisive Change—she pivots from decorative gilding to guerrilla truth—paid for by the violent somatic tax we’ve seen twice. No orientation drift; space/time anchors land inside 120 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The bruise-yellow sky, mossy wall, mildewed archive, and wire-mesh counter are filtered through Elara’s artisan eye; each sensory pick pressures her next move (the plate’s raised backward text literally demands her crafts-person’s gaze). Environment never lectures; it keeps shrinking her options until the final pivot. Micro-setting (the jagged zinc edge) constrains the climactic read. Dock 0.3 for a stray adjective stack (“immense glass dome…sprawling greenhouse city”) that momentarily blurs scale.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—locate the sequestered voices—tightens when each lie physically debilitates her, turning every hallway into a minefield. One meaningful escalation: the clerk’s guarded plate forces her to wager final vitality for the truth. Cost is visible on the page (skin bruising, knee-buckling) and shapes tactics—she can’t bluff. The evacuation order re-prices all prior city suffering; closure stakes feel irreversible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the inversion of decoration into weapon: gilded leaves will carry the hidden text that zinc once suppressed. No explicit sermon; the image of truth pulsing through veins of living plants reweights “beauty” as insurgent. Subtext is carried in gesture—the clerk’s tremor, Elara’s clawed fingers—rather than exposition. Final resonance lands as Conceptual Repricing: silence itself becomes the luxury resource hoarded by power.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Free-indirect texture stays close to Elara’s artisan perception: “fine-point brush,” “liquid gold,” “raised backward text” all read as her workspace vocabulary. No head-hop; clerk’s interior is read through Elara’s bodily reaction. Rhythm flexes—long humid clauses on the street, staccato gasps underground—without losing immediacy. Filter verbs appear only when they encode her strained attention, not exposition.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Sentence propulsion is high; most lines carry both world-detail and pressure (“the Governor’s lie acted upon her like a herbicide”). One paraphrase loop mid-clerk beat (“there is nothing here but dust” / “his voice trembling”) costs −0.2. No mixed metaphors; zinc’s cold edge stays metallic, vegetal imagery stays chlorotic. Opening and closing sentences both anchor voice and reverb the motif.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The lie-allergy mechanic is fresh yet fully embodied, not a gimmick; it collapses abstract civic betrayal into frost-bite flesh. Gilding as covert printing press weaponizes an ornamental craft into insurgent archive—specific, non-obvious synthesis. Oasis-heist back-story could feel trope-ish, but the postal-plate fragment as “lost conversation” re-casts familiar eco-colonial theft into linguistic violence. Risk pays off: the body-cost premise never retreats into metaphor; it stays brutally literal.</comment>
