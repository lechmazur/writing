<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elian’s interior contradiction—yearning to rescue shadows while serving a utopia that erases them—remains embodied and active; his micro-choices (lifting the stone, whispering the offer, feeling the pulse) visibly enact the hierarchy of values. No diagnostic shorthand; the regret is shown through the final image of his hands in “relentless brilliance.” Cost is felt as he shelves the obsidian geode, foreclosing reunion for the woman. The only bar to 9+ is that the shadow’s own agency is slightly abstract, muting a full two-way crucible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the obsidian geode reframes the collective dream as shallow, with luminous regret unmistakably paid on-page (“profound, luminous regret… endless, blinding peace”). The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout—density of botanical imagery and footage juxtaposition tightens until the final mineral absorption. Causality is clean: footage gap → shadow adrift → stone offer → metamorphose → irrevocable cost. No orientation debt; who/where/when are anchored within 50 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Library-as-setting actively constrains action: drifting narrative vines, phosphorescent spores, and mossy floor guide Elian’s stealthy gait and determine where shadows can hide. The river stone’s “geological patience” is tactile counterpart to the airy archive, embodying the weight the cloud-world lacks. Spatial choreography is clean; stone and shadow track logically from bench to shelf. Micro-setting success allows 9+ reach; capped at 8.9 because one spatial cue (“between two blooming encyclopedias”) could be slightly sharper.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether individual depth can survive utopian unity—tightens through footage comparison: the vanishing shadow proves the loss and triggers Elian’s介入. Agency is his deliberate offer of the stone; this narrows options (shadow fuses or dissipates) and forces a trade-off visible in the obsidian’s light-absorbing surface. Cost is felt immediately: the woman stays incomplete, the collective remains “joyous and shallow.” One meaningful intensification suffices; no reversal loops.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges without thesis statement: the price of endless peace is the surrender of contrast itself. Subtext operates in gesture—Elian’s boots stay silent, mirroring the shadow’s wordless exile. Final image of “luminous regret” reweights the glowing library as suffocating, answering the thematic question non-literally. No sermonizing; ambiguity lingers over whether any shadow can ever rejoin its host.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person close sustains a consistent, sharp-eyed perceptual signature—“photosynthesizing verbs,” “granite patience”—that filters every detail through Elian’s vocation. Compression is purposeful: “collective consciousness had long abandoned” economically signals epoch. No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens in the final pulse against his palm. Rhythm modulates from languid vine imagery to the staccato “cold draft of pure potential,” matching pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is loop-free, high-density: “darkened, turning into a dense, obsidian-like geode” packs color, material change, and metaphorical resonance in one clause. Sentence openings vary; no template cadence. Figurative language is selective—only two metaphors in the climax—each paying off the fusion of shadow and stone. Register remains within Elian’s arcane yet geological lexicon; no mixed metaphors or clarity breaks.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The “blooming library above clouds” and forensic shadow-archaeology via silent footage feel freshly synthesized; premise is more than sum of parts. Shadow-as-unbound-depth is transformed through specific mineral physics rather than allegory. Risk—the quiet, lyrical ending—heightens rather than obscures stakes. Transformation test fails if names change: the botanical archive and footage method are inseparable from this exact tale.</comment>
