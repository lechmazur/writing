<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and embodied—gloved hands sifting ice, marrow pain, the parasol tip’s cold bite against his chest. The contradiction between suicidal intent and the compulsive deferral of the act is visible in micro-choices: volunteering, pocketing the useless silver shard. The final renunciation (ready now to die) is earned by the parasol tip’s sensory proof that fragility outlasts violence, paying the cost of curiosity. Only the “grips reality loosely” label risks diagnostic-speak, but it is tethered to repeated sensory dissociation, so the flaw is hairline.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: terminal diagnosis → archipelago → deferral → salvage → parasol find → decision to proceed. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the “sound” of ending is re-tuned from cataclysm to whispered residue, felt as the parasol’s weight against his sternum. Cost is legible in the single sentence “ready now to make the short journey,” which forecloses the fold in patience. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 4 and never drift; transitions are smooth.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Drift-ice marina is not backdrop but crucible: the frozen vice literally traps boats and metaphorically traps Elias in deferral. The parasol tip functions as micro-setting whose survival logic rewrites his death-logic. Cold is filtered through bodily consequence—numb skin, phantom marrow pain—guiding his final stance. Spatial choreography is clean: rake, slush, fractured hull, tent exit track without drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—hearing the sound of ending—tightens when the marina’s groans fail to qualify, then pivots with the parasol find: the whisper of residue becomes the sought frequency. Agency is maintained throughout: he defers death, chooses salvage, pockets the shard, finally accepts injection. Cost is the lost time and bodily erosion spent trawling, plus the irrevocable decision to proceed. No external antagonist is needed; pressure is ontological.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges as the inversion of apocalypse: endings are not loud but faint, the lace relic outlasting steel. Subtext is carried by object-handling rather than statement—each scrape of rake and glint of silver reweights the meaning of “ending.” Final image reconfigures the premise without moralizing: the end is merely “a change in texture, a shifting of the ice.” Earned resonance avoids sentimentality by staying tactile.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is distinct: POV notices dissolve-ready scenery, marrow-phantom pain, microscopic lace remnants. Syntax lengthens during dissociation, shortens during find: “It was absurd…” Free indirect style is clean, no filter-verb clog. No dialogue, so no voice convergence risk. Compression (“clinical dusk”) is taught early and paid off by the final clinic walk.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with pressure: long clauses for suspended time, staccato for the parasol moment. Metaphors stay physically coherent—frozen vice, white vice, texture shift. No scaffold loops or synonym churn; each sentence advances image or motive. Minor intensifier “brutal context” is the single purple blip but does not touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The euthanasia-tourist premise is familiar, but the acoustic quest and inversion of apocalyptic noise feel fresh. Parasol tip as ontological pivot is specific to this text; swap object would break the sonic epiphany. Risky lyric compression is taught early and repaid, justifying elliptical structure. Emotional specificity lifts it above concept-piece gimmickry.</comment>
