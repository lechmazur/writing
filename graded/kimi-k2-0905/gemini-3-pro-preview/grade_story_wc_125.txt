<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Silas’s contradictory drives—artistic obsession vs. bodily self-preservation—are dramatized in the final hand-to-wall/rope release beat; the cost (accepting imperfection) is legible and scaled to the word count. Interiority stays concrete, avoiding label-speak; the rope’s remembered friction anchors motivation. One minor slip: “ethically playful” is asserted more than embodied in mid-text, but the closing renunciation still feels earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: Silas’s deliberate destruction of the spiral reweights the premise—time’s texture is friction, not transcendence—at undeniable cost (he forfeits omniscience). Causal chain holds: rope ritual → temporal contact → fiber burn → choice to retreat. Orientation is clean by line 5; no lens ambiguity. Minor time-stamp fuzziness (“three winters ago”) is allowed under lyric mode.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Terra-cotta grotto, rope, and clay wall function as micro-settings that actively constrain tactics: the damp layer alone permits temporal contact; the rope’s length limits the spiral. Sensory hierarchy favors touch and grit, filtered through poet-perception. Starlight vs. alien glow externalizes the inner fork in the final moment, charging the exit image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—finish the poem vs. stay human—tightens once when rope fibers smoke, making the trade-off visceral. Escalation is textural/accumulative: each scraped layer increases density until the single fork is forced. No false reversals; coincidence absent. Cost is visible (scorched palm, destroyed pattern) and shapes the final tactics.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges implicitly: art’s value lies in its incompleteness, not apotheosis. The rope’s reprise and the wiped spiral reweight earlier imagery without moralizing. Final line offers resonant, non-literal answer. One tiny echo risk—“texture of time” nears prompt-label—but context absorbs it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays tight to Silas’s perceptual signature: synesthetic metaphors (“silk dragged over gravel”) and rhythmic parallelism mirror his vocation. No head-hopping; psychic distance contracts under stress. Diction remains within poet’s lexicon; playful whispers carry subtext. Filter verbs appear sparingly and serve voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence detected. Figurative language is selective, never consecutive, and peaks at the tactile revelation without clutter. One scaffold spot—“his movements imbued with a passionate subtlety”—could compress, but it sits early and doesn’t touch closure. High density; every line advances atmosphere or stakes.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Fusion of post-alien pastoral with tactile time-mining feels fresh; the rope-as-anchor-of-linear-life is a specific, non-obvious synthesis. Risky lyric structure commits fully and pays off in the final reconfiguration. No familiar trope recycling; transformation test fails if names change, proving idiosyncrasy. Bold yet coherent.</comment>
