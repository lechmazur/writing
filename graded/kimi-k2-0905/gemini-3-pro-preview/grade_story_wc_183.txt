<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority is lush, body-bound, and precise; the “second heartbeat” and “phantom-like” kinesthetics make the absorbed twin feel corporeal. The turn from extraction to acceptance is earned: pocketing the green card is a micro-choice that visibly forecloses the search and costs her the fantasy of separate encounter. Flaw: one moment of diagnostic self-tag—“a woman who had learned through cold medical slides”—slips into label-speak, slightly cooling the embodied urgency. Still, the contradiction between wanting to meet the ghost and finally embracing merged existence is dramatized, not declared.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lens is Accumulative/Textural: each narrative utterance thickens the ship’s reality until the garden’s mold mirrors her cellular merger. Closure is a Charged Poise: pocketing the card crystallizes the new configuration—sister remains inside, unborn and painless. Cost is palpable: she gives up the chance to externalize the twin, accepting permanent internal haunt. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land by line 3; no debt applied.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The emerald swatch card functions as micro-setting: its color slices the monochrome fog, guides her steps, and finally reweights the garden’s oxidized green into a mirror of her own veins. Ship’s decay is tactile—velvet curtains “tattered,” decks “softening under boots”—and constrains her path, forcing narrative incantations to keep corridors solid. Ferris wheel grinding backward externalizes the inverted time-frame; the mold-coated atrium literalizes the womb. Environment actively shapes tactics and charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—retrieve the lost sister—tightens when she realizes separation is impossible; the garden’s silence forces renunciation. Escalation is density-driven: each spoken thread increases ship responsiveness, raising the cost of failure (dissolving corridor). No external antagonist needed; pressure is situational and ontological. Visible price: she abandons the quest, accepting eternal cohabitation—felt in the pocketed card and lighter step.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through color and inversion: unborn life is not loss but spared suffering. Subtext resides in the reversal—seeking shape for the nameless, she finds the shape was always inside. Final image reweights the nursery swatch from promise to peace, a non-literal answer that avoids moralizing. No thematic echo violation; no character utters a thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise; perceptual signature favors synesthetic blends—“rust smelled of salt and old perfume.” Narrative present tense stays stable; free indirect slips are clean. Elliptical compression (“We are walking past the concessions”) is taught early and paid off when the corridor solidifies. No dialogue to judge; internal diction remains within Elara’s plausible lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but propulsive; each sentence layers image and action. One scaffold stem—“the ship… unable to sail yet refusing to sink”—is repeated with variation; tolerated under pattern-teach rule. No mixed metaphors; “velvet curtains in the portholes” is precise. Final-line cadence—“silent, permanent passenger”—lands cleanly, recharging earlier voyage imagery.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Fusion of chimera myth with decrepit carnival ship feels inevitable, not gimmicky. Ontological navigation via spoken narrative threads is a fresh mechanic that grows from her need to stabilize shifting reality. Risk—lyric accumulative structure—heightens meaning without obscuring closure. Green card’s reprise transforms from nursery sample to tombstone of potential, a specific inflection impossible to swap.</comment>
