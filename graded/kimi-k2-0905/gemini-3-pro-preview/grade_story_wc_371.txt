<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elias's interior contradiction—guilt for surviving vs. need to keep memory alive—is dramatized through the tactile care he gives each seed and the bread ritual; the micro-choice to slice and taste the vanished loaf visibly costs him calm, earning the renunciation. No second character on stage, so relationship bullets waived; single-POV interiority stays concrete, never drifts into label-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of fading→reclamation→communion tightens through sensory density (color drain → invasive green → steam scent). Closure is Charged Poise: the final swallow reweights the city’s graying as inevitable yet personally refused; cost is instantly felt—“the guilt…lifted slightly…wouldn’t last.” Orientation anchor secure by line 3; no teleport props; transitions clean.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Environment-body-tool triad drives every choice: brittle earth dictates the gentleness of his fingers; camouflage netting forces the ceremonial uncloak move; rye crust’s audible crack becomes the communion bell. Palace courtyard constrains tactical path (thorn labyrinth) and charges final image with imperial decay versus insurgent green. Micro-settings (seed packet, bread knife) handled in motion, never static.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: keep memory alive against collective amnesia. Escalation is textural—each sensory absence (trees, bakery, birds) intensifies the pressure to preserve; guerrilla act and black-market loaf are visible prices paid. No reversal, but a meaningful deepening: the city keeps graying, his options narrow to covert rituals only. Cost legible on tongue and frost-bitten fingers.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from pattern of vanished color/flavor versus illicit resurrection; no statement, only image. Sacred/secular tension stays implicit in “communion” and “absolution” without sermon. Final image reconfigures premise: memory work is not victory but momentary poise against dark. Ambiguity accepted—reader left to decide if ritual sustains or merely delays forgetting.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays fixed on Elias’s perceptual filter—“color seemed to be draining,” “flavor that shouldn’t exist.” Syntax tightens under stress: clauses shorten during uncloak, lengthen again in tea-house calm. No dialogue, so voice purity judged on narrative texture; diction remains within a chronicler’s lexicon, no academic drift. Pattern of hush→crack→steam paid off at close.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>High density: “heuristically gentle” compresses years of trial into two words; sensory verbs (“cracked,” “overwhelmed”) drive sentences. Only two micro-loops detected (“the city would continue…” repeated intent), not at closure, −0.2. Metaphors stay physical and consistent (earth=brittle, bread=ghost). Rhythm breathes with scene tempo; no filter-verb clusters.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Post-collapse guerrilla-gardening + clandestine tea-house is fresh synthesis; not standard dystopia tropes. Risk: quiet rebellion via sowing seeds could feel twee, but soil’s unforgiving texture grounds it. Vanished-bakery bread as sacrament is specific to this world. Could edge higher if ritual rules or trade network were hinted earlier, but within 800 words the concept already commits fully.</comment>
