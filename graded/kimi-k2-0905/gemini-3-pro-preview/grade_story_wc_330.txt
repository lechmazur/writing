<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elias’s muteness is more label than crucible; the sudden song erupts without prior internal fracture shown. The “sealed lips” motive is asserted early but never tested in scene until the climax, so the reversal feels convenient rather than earned. Still, his tactile, work-focused interiority is concrete and consistent, and the final fusion moment does exact a visible cost (burnt palm, voice torn open), satisfying the Earned Stasis clause.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a crisp Charged Poise: the halo-light seals inside the horse, bell expires, new voice born—cost is the seared hand and forever-broken silence. Causality is accumulative/textural: every lyrical pass thickens the silence/light tension until the song ruptures it. The wrong-turn oasis is pure situational gift, not earned, but it complicates rather than resolves, so the lens holds. Orientation is taught by sound/mist cues within 120 words; spatial drift inside train cars is intentionally dreamlike and paid off by the final golden twilight that replaces the hush.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The ribcage train, iron bars strangled by orchids, and the sawdust-to-moss pedal shift are irreplicable micro-settings that directly gate the halo fragment; remove them and the wrong-turn mechanics collapse. Body-as-setting (calloused palms, searing light) constrains the handling choice. Sensory hierarchy obeys POV: carpenter notices grain, varnish vapor, blade-sound of glassy halo. Final image reuses the “misting hush” as golden twilight—environmental evolution that mirrors internal shift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—complete the horse before the bell dies—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens with every paragraph break. The bell’s decay is the live clock; each lyrical cadence shortens perceived duration, a textural escalation. Protagonist agency drives the midpoint song-turn that tames the fragment; luck only reveals, never saves. Cost is visceral: voice torn, flesh branded, silence forever forfeited—price scales to 700-word frame.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme—silence as marble to be carved—emerges through carved wood, then carved voice; no character sermonizes it. The halo fragment reprises as both literal tool and metaphor for silence shattered into song. Final image reweights premise: the circus train now contains its own eternal voice, a Conceptual Repricing that avoids moral. Slight over-reliance on “misting hush” as refrain nudges toward motif checklist, but the tonal modulation from grey absorption to golden resonance keeps it felt, not asserted.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited clings to Elias’s tool-sense: verbs are sand, carve, fuse; nouns are grain, varnish, splinter—carpenter diction throughout. Rhythm accelerates with clause-stutter during halo-handling—“a low-level radiance that seemed to hum with a frequency just below the threshold of human hearing”—then relaxes into long sentences as light gentles. No filter-verb stacks; perception stays tactile. The single lyric cry is rendered in brutal monosyllables—“raw, jagged sound”—a sonic rupture that matches content while remaining readable.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Read-aloud ear is excellent: sentence length modulates from 4-beat declaratives to 14-word lyrical coils without algorithmic pattern. Information density high; every sentence carries sensorium or clock pressure. Two mixed metaphors—“serene, golden twilight” after “sphere of that single, long-decaying note”—but they converge on light-as-sound, so coherence survives. No synonym churn, no scaffold; only one near-loop (“misting hush” twice in 50 words) forgiven because it is the pressure vessel.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The circus-train oasis is fresh synthesis: derailed liminality meets chlorophyll intrusion, not a stock image. Silence-to-song transmutation flips the usual “find voice” trope into literal carpentry of sound. Halo as varnish-source recharges angelic cliché via craft pragmatism. Risk—lyric elliptical structure—pays off in Charged Poise. Could use one more specific rail-car detail to anchor entirely new memory, but overall angle is non-obvious and inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
