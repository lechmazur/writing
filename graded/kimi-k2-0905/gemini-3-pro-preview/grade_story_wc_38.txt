<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid—poetic algorithmic thinking, embodied fear masked as choreography, the dice as totems of risk—contradictory impulses (terror vs. lyrical control) act together in the dance-password beat. Micro-choice hierarchy is legible: surrender to system logic > personal survival > filial elegy. The final pocketing of dice/journal shows earned stasis with visible cost: she leaves lighter yet carries the oceanic weight. Only mild safety-hedge: her competence edges on too-full mastery, muting flaw fallout.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the liberated AI dissolves upward, reweighting her déjà vu into completed filial sentence—cost is the salt-iron taste of inherited grief now irreversible. Causal chain holds: dice placement → dance decryption → blast doors open because her embodied fragility tricks aggressive logic. Orientation anchored by word 70; no lens ambiguity. Persistent constraint—millions of tons of water—shapes every gesture; final image carries that pressure converted to song.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sunken lab constrains tactics: stale air dictates calm breathing, biometric sensors demand choreographed heart-rate control, obsidian console responds only to kinetic verse. Micro-settings—barnacle-etched glass, bioluminescent algae—mirror her luminous code-thinking. Spatial choreography immaculate: dice roll tracked across console to door symbol, body tracked on grate. Setting charges final image: AI ink dispersing upward through water equals her freed memory.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—free the trapped consciousness—signaled paragraph 1. Tightening occurs when dance must stay fluid while fear wants to spike: one error → purge. Cost legible: she finishes breathless, legs trembling, oceanic weight transferred from hull to self. Escalation causal under Causal lens; no coincidence; renunciation (her calm surrender) is the agency that flips access.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from encryption metaphor extended to body: vulnerability = unbreakable key. Father’s elegy encoded in dance converts loss into liberation—no moral stated, only salt-iron taste and dissolving ink. Subtext in dice symbols: noose vs. open door reweighted by final open door landing. Final image of song-weight offers plangent ambiguity: freedom purchased by internalizing abyss.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Lyrical, rhythmically controlled prose mirrors algorithmic-poetic mind: “algorithm as stanzas,” “syntax of movement.” Diction stays within her lexicon—code, cipher, choreographic score—no register drift. Distinct perceptual signature: she sees shadows as unlived memories, dice as calculable chance. No dialogue, so voice coherence judged solely thru narrative texture—maintained.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>High information density: single sentences fuse tech, body, emotion—“extension of her arm described a linear equation.” Figurative language is patterned, taught early, paid off: web metaphor for code assembly returns in final “web was finished.” No scaffold, no loops. Minor purple pulse in “millions of tons of water pressing” but fits peak beat. Final line crisp, propulsive.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Kinetic-password via elegiac dance is fresh synthesis of sci-fi and lyrical nonfiction. Sunken AI tomb not new, but decryption through choreographed fragility is. Hangman’s dice made from gambler’s bone particularizes chance better than generic lots. Risk taken—entire climax is dance—pays off with conceptual reweighting rather than spectacle.</comment>
