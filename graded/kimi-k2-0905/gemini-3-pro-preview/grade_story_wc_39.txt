<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The interior contradiction between scavenger-pragmatist and elegiac archivist is vivid; every micro-choice (uncorking lullaby, tilting rain) embodies the stakes. Emotion is never labeled—"swelling in his chest" is the closest we get, and it lands because the body has been handling glass and rust. The final renunciation—sealing the jars again—forecloses the path of sharing the loft, and the tremor in his hands is enough cost. Voice specificity slips once: “a chemist” feels like an outside comparison rather than Elian’s own idiom, keeping it from 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the last golden speck of sound reconfigures the loft from hovel to ballroom and leaves the future open yet irrevocably altered. Causal chain is clean—each sound ingredient is motivated by yesterday’s screech and today’s acoustics rule. Dawn’s whistle arrives exactly on cue, the wind-flute external confirmation that the ritual window is real. Cost is legible in the unwound spring and the returning silence that is “no longer empty”; no exposition explains the triumph.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The loft’s sand-glass skylight and jar-lined walls constrain every motion; distance is measured by how far Elian can reach without upsetting a vessel. Spring-rain vapor and violet lullaby mist function as micro-setting, coating the gears and altering the acoustics in real time. Spatial choreography is flawless—knees, crank, jars, light beam tracked across the single continuous scene. The one missing twitch for 9-band: we never feel the temperature of the dune-cooled air on skin.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—save the song from mechanical death—is signaled in paragraph two and tightened when the dawn wind becomes the deadline. Agency is pure: every pour and crank actively rewrites the music box’s fate, not merely symbolizes it. One meaningful escalation: the gears’ hesitation → catch → crystalline release, the audible narrowing of options. Cost is the spent spring and the unrepeatable consumption of two stored echoes; future scavenges will be harder, but that is felt, not declared.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges as the alchemy of decay into beauty through attentive labor—never named, only enacted. The waltz itself is the argument; no sentence moralizes about “preserving culture.” The final image of silence filled with lingering gold reweights the premise: art is not hoarded noise but a momentary gift that exhausts its source. Counter-readings (is this mere nostalgia?) are plausible because the cost to Elian’s solitude is left open, satisfying complexity without didacticism.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elian’s sensorium; we taste dust and hear the gears as he does. Diction—“feral loft,” “gleaned redemption,” “sand-glass skylight”—is idiosyncratic yet consistent, never drifting into poetical overload. Rhythm modulates: long sentences for the ritual prep, staccato clauses for the crank-release beat. One tiny register slip: “translator between generations” sounds like an editorial gloss; if it had been his own phrase, 9-band would open.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sentences perform double duty: “He uncorked the lullaby first, tilting the jar carefully over the open mechanism” shows gesture, stakes, and tactile caution in one motion. No paraphrase loops; each metaphor (violet mist, silver vapor) is deployed once and paid off in the transformed sound. Syntax breathes—paragraph lengths vary from single-line crescendo to three-line denouement. Proofing is clean; the only micro-twitch is “bit, hesitated, and then turned,” where the comma after “then” is unnecessary yet harmless.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The echo-vault premise is fresh, yet the story’s triumph is refusing to make it a gimmick; the jars’ mechanics stay tactile and risky. Risk: turning a music box into a climax could feel quaint, but the text weaponizes sentiment into genuine acoustic alchemy. Synthesis feels inevitable: scavenger + sound alchemist + dawn wind = audible resurrection. Not 9-band only because “penny poet” and “feral loft” flirt with indie-quirk vocabulary; the emotional specificity ultimately overrides the surface sheen.</comment>
