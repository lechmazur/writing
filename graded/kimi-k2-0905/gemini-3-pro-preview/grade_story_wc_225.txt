<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Silas’s guilt-driven paralysis and the tactile ritual of the platinum labyrinth give us a vivid, embodied mind; the final act of unpicking the tapestry is the earned release of a man who has spent his own pawn-self. Interior contradiction is present but stays a hair below the 9+ threshold because the text once labels his “cold focus” instead of letting the gesture speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal chain is immaculate: because he once weaponised strategy, therefore he freezes the board, therefore he must sacrifice stasis to restart time—cost registered in the snapped ozone thread and the first audible splash. Closure lands as Decisive Change with felt price; lens stays causal throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Market-square still-life, suspended droplet, and ozone-scented knot anchor orientation early; the tapestry’s ragged border becomes the micro-arena that literally constrains his final tactic. Environment charges the last image—smoke loosens, water falls—so the 9+ gate is met.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“stop hiding from consequence”—tightens when each teased thread increases audible vibration, turning abstract guilt into tactile resistance. One meaningful escalation suffices; the final snap forecloses the option to remain frozen, price paid on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme of “strategy versus mercy” emerges through the chess-tutor past and the literal unpicking of a war-knot; no character sermonises. Final image of the solved pocket-labyrinth quietly reweights the premise: victory now means letting the board move again.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person lens stays tight to Silas’s tactical perception; syntax is rhythmic, compressive, chess-like (“coiled, calculated, ready to strike”). No head-hop or register drift; perceptual signature distinct enough for 9-band, but one clause edges toward elevated diction under peak pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no scaffold, loops, or mixed metaphors. High information density—each thread-pull simultaneously advances plot, sensory texture, and metaphor—while rhythm accelerates with the rippling shockwave. Clean mechanics at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Frozen-time village trope is refreshed by treating it as a self-inflicted chess clock; the tapestry-as-code mechanic feels novel and inevitable. Specific occupational lens (chess pedagogy) transforms generic “wild magic” into a strategic puzzle, satisfying transformation test.</comment>
