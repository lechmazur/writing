<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—yearning for stars while grounded by fire-trauma—drives every beat; her tremor when the wheel triggers the inferno memory is visceral, and her micro-choice to inhale and keep polishing embodies the “pearl of stillness” she seeks. The lack of a second on-page character keeps status and relational crucible off the table, but her solitary stance crystallizes into Earned Stasis: she finishes the gem, foreclosing fire-light forever. The only minor slack is a slight over-articulation of motive (“she could not forget…”) when the sensory flashback already shows it.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the lantern jewel glows, reconfiguring village futures without fire, cost paid by her tremor and the years of sky-loss compressed into that green tear. Causal lens holds: because the torches once burned the harbor, she therefore polishes light that cannot burn, narrowing options to this single prism. Orientation is anchored by word 30 (“serpentine grotto”), well within the 120-word allowance. No meaningful tightening occurs after the memory flare; escalation plateaus rather than spikes again, keeping it just shy of 9.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The mist-gutted grotto functions as micro-setting: its damp limestone ribs coerce her into earthbound craft and literally cool the memory-heat that surges mid-scene. Sea-glass shards, lapidary wheel, and brass scale are tools whose tactile handling choreographs every causal step. Final image—“a cool tear of crystallized ocean”—recharges the grotto’s saline breath, proving environment and object constrain outcome. One hairline slip: “zephyr bloom” is lovely but abstractions briefly dilute sensory density.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—safe light without fire—is signaled early and deepened when the memory-flash tightens her resolve; the brass-scale weighing is the visible price of balance. Agency is present yet singular: once she survives the tremor, no new external pressure tests her again, so escalation plateaus rather than compounds. Cost is legible in the tremor and the forfeiture of ever using flame, satisfying the lens. A second tightening beat would have pushed this into 8.5+ territory.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: light as knowledge that must not consume its maker. The green shard’s transformation from trash to beacon reweights “stillness” as antidote to conflagration, avoiding any moralizing statement. Subtext resides in silence after the memory-roar: no dialogue, only wheel-hum and salt air, letting gesture carry meaning. The ending’s glow answers the thematic question without sermon, though the phrase “pearl of stillness” inches toward echo; its prior anchoring in the gem’s optical center mostly earns the line.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person intimate sustains a star-watcher’s lexicon—“orbital mechanics,” “celestial vault,” “optical center”—while staying inside her perceptual bias. Rhythm modulates: long, humid clauses mirror cave breath, then shorten during the flare-memory, then settle into the quiet glow. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk is zero. Filter verbs are minimal; when they appear (“she saw…”) they serve the flashback rupture, justified by trauma perspective.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sentence variety is orchestral: participle openers, braided clauses, and single-word beats (“She inhaled.”) pace the lapidary drone. Metaphors stay coherent—leviathan ribs, jagged maw—without mixed logic. Information density is high; one line often does three jobs (setting, emotion, tool mechanics). Zero loops or scaffold; no synonym churn; the only near-purple phrase, “zephyr bloom,” is isolated and thematically earned, not repeated.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The fusion of lapidary craft, fire-trauma, and star-longing feels fresh and inevitable: no stock fantasy trope or workshop template governs this plot. Risk is taken in the quiet, lyric ending that trusts image over twist. Specificity of-tool-process (treadle rhythm, grit feed) anchors the concept in lived detail, preventing abstraction. While “lantern of safe light” has folkloric echoes, the sea-glass origin and weighing ritual transform the motif into something particular.</comment>
