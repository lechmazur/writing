<question>1</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Elian’s interiority is poetically rendered, but his contradictory impulses remain abstract; the “insatiably creative” trait is asserted rather than dramatized through micro-choices on the page. His final stance crystallizes as an Earned Stasis, yet the cost feels diffuse because no alternative path is foreclosed inside the scene. The characterization is vivid, but not yet tested under interpersonal pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the dispersed dream reweights the lower realm’s reality, with the felt cost Elian’s solitary exhaustion. Causality is lyric-accumulative rather than strictly causal; the pattern is taught early and holds. The orientation test is waived: deliberate disorientation (void waterfall, dimension grafting) pays off in the final image. One transition (parapet → city) is legible; lens holds.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The parapet-waterfall–void construct functions as micro-setting that directly constrains the grafting action; every descriptor is filtered through Elian’s orchardist perception. Sensory hierarchy is tight: glowing mist, moss under palm, shears’ weight. Spatial choreography is clean across the single continuous scene. The environment charges the final image by converting waterfall into delivery system.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve wonder—signals early; escalation is the deepening density of the grafting act that narrows Elian’s stamina and forecloses retrieval. No antagonist is needed: pressure is situational and cosmological. Cost is visible in bodily fatigue and the irreversible dispersal of the seed. Sufficient tightening for 800-word scope; could sharpen one tangible forfeiture to breach 8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of imaginative sustenance emerges through the seed’s transmutation rather than direct statement. Final image reweights earlier “color of wonder” motif without moralizing. Subtext resides in the silence after the snip and the unseen rain. Minor abstraction keeps it from 9.0; the insight is felt but not crystallized into one undeniable new rule.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person lyric voice sustains a consistent orchardist diction: “grafting,” “rootstock,” “pruner.” Syntax lengthens and shortens with breathing of action; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is strong—Elian notices growth habits, branch angles, sap scent. Dialogue absent by design; voice remains individual and coherent under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentences carry double duty (description + causality). Only minor scaffold: “the process was exhausting” could be shown via body. Metaphors are coherent within arboreal lexicon. No loops, no mixed vehicles. Density is high; one paraphrase loop near midpoint (−0.2). Closure image is clean and charged.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Seed-as-dream vector and waterfall-as-grafting-loom combine horticulture with metaphysics in a non-obvious synthesis. Stakes hinge on imagination starvation, yet delivered through tactile orchardist tools. Risky lyric structure pays off in resonant closure. Transformation passes: if you swap out pruning/grafting, the entire mechanics collapse, proving integration.</comment>
