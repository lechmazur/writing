<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is specific—her glass-maker’s attention to temperature as memory, the tremor in her cold hands—yet the moment of resolve at the end is slightly too smooth; the cost of stepping onto the trail is asserted rather than embodied. Still, her shift from aesthetic observer to thermal tracker feels inevitable in hindsight, satisfying the 9+ test.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a crisp Resonant Reconfiguration: the frost-negative tracks re-weight her world, turning passive survival into active pursuit; the ledger strip vibrates in her hand, a felt cost that locks the lens (Accumulative/Textural) without contradiction. Causality is tight—thermal memory → frost pattern → forward motion—no plot amnesia or soft reset.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The canyon is never backdrop: its sandstone roughness mirrors her skin, the wind-bottle resonance guides her ears, and the frost finally writes the map she reads. Environment constrains and enables the decisive choice, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Single dominant stake—find the stolen art’s destination—tightens once via the frost reveal; the price is the exposed trail she must now walk, foreclosing anonymity. Pressure is coherent under Accumulative lens, but a second tightening beat would have pushed it into the 8.8+ band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the temperature metaphor: destruction (fire) → pause (cold) → readable memory (frost), suggesting meaning is soldered in stillness. No moralizing; the final image hums with Conceptual Repricing that revalues silence as instrument rather than void.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice carries glass-maker precision—viscosity, silica, thermal layers—without jargon overload; syntax lengthens and shortens with breath, echoing the wind-bottle drone. Perceptual signature stays consistent, no filter-verb clutter, and the lyric compression is taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is dense but breathable; figurative layering (“white lace,” “bruised plums”) is selective and purposeful. One scaffold pair (“she waited… she had to wait”) is minor; no loops or register drift in peak beats, keeping closure image sharp.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Frost-negative tracking as forensic method feels fresh, rooted in her craft-specific perception rather than detective cliché. Risk taken in quiet, almost scientific climax is rewarded by conceptual reconfiguration; not radical but notably non-obvious.</comment>
