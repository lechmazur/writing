<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Silas’s interiority is vivid and embodied—“heartbeat of a ghost,” “fluid and incandescent”—but the final surrender is asserted, not dramatized through micro-choice. The absence of any second character keeps status dynamics off-stage, so the crucible is purely internal; the arc holds but feels slightly monochromatic. The causal link between giving away boots → sand heat → exact release second is elegant, yet the prophecy beat arrives as retrospective label, not lived uncertainty. Still, his flawed generosity stays legible and particular throughout.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the mountain’s white plume reweights every prior act of giving, and the cost—“hands empty once more”—is visible. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern of coincidence is taught early (“master jeweler”) and pays off in the violet spiral. Orientation is anchored by ~100 words; no ambiguity at closure. One meaningful tightening: the bugs’ light sinking into sand reconfigures eruption stakes on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Black sand, tidal pool mirror, magma chamber form a micro-setting triad that directly channels the protagonist’s final act; remove any layer and the spiral fails. Sensory hierarchy obeys POV: merchant-prince-turned-vagabond notices texture, temperature, and monetary absence. Environment forces the stop (heat → bare feet) and supplies the only currency the mountain accepts. Final white plume is setting evolving in response to action—clean spatial choreography throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake is “soothe the mountain with living light”; signaled in first third. Escalation is textural: each released bug increases vibrational density until sand becomes permeable conduit. Protagonist agency is present—he chooses to open jars—but the price is conceptual (emptiness) rather than a live option foreclosed. Coincidence complicates but does not resolve; eruption merely pauses, leaving cost legible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of surrender-as-transformation emerges from tactile specifics, not thesis: rags, crate, violet spiral. Final image—“felt fuller than when he owned cities”—repackages prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture (kneeling, unscrewing) and color shift (green → violet → white). Ambiguity lingers: mountain may still erupt; surrender is ongoing stance, not answer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Silas; no head-hop. Perceptual signature is mercantile-lyric: “heavy fruit ready to drop,” “currency the mountain accepted.” Rhythm accelerates with vibration that “rattled teeth,” matching rising tectonic pressure. No dialogue, so voice distinctness rests on syntax; it holds. One register drift: “subterranean groan” edges toward epic diction but is earned by volcano scale.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>High density: “obsidian earth,” “bioluminescent swamps,” “pulsating neon abdomens” all in one breath without padding. Metaphors stay coherent—jeweler, fruit, spiral—no mixed vehicles. One paraphrase loop: “texture of transformation” stated twice; minor. Final sentence cadence mirrors opening barefoot walk, giving circular propulsion. No artifact touches closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: destitute philanthropist + bottled lightning bugs as volcanic currency is non-obvious and inevitable in hindsight. Risk of mythic register is high but justified by setting; no retreat into safety. Specificity of “sunken continent swamps” prevents swap with generic insects. Conceptual integrity holds: every gift earlier in life funnels toward this single barter with magma.</comment>
