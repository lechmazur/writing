<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elias’s fault-tolerant architecture is dramatized through the fever-test, the swallowed-algorithm anguish, and the smudge act; contradictory bio-digital impulses (“reroute around trauma” vs. need to vomit truth) stay live in scene. Micro-choice hierarchy is legible: suppress crash > contaminate margin > endure solitude. Cost—perpetual alertness to ghosts and the lead-gut secret—lands on page, earning the Earned Stasis closure. Interiority seldom drifts into diagnostic speak; shiver, tremor, and graphite stain keep emotion embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: because he hid the catastrophic variable, therefore he must bury it differently; the smudge-attack on the engine’s confidence interval is the irreversible beat that widens “swaying certainties” into fatal fog. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the apocalypse is not averted, only redistributed as atmospheric noise—cost felt in the hollow ache under auroral sorrow. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no ambiguity at the end. Persistent constraint—the station’s optical scanner now keyed to his biological tremor—shapes future tactics, satisfying 9+ test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Alpine dawn, quartz windows, graphite smear, and auroral palette are filtered through a meteorologist’s selective attention—temperature, light refraction, particulate matter—making setting a tool that constrains the sabotage method. Micro-setting victory: the empty margin of a lithograph becomes the breach point the scanners watch. Spatial choreography is clean—hand moves to paper corner, scanner zooms, probability waves visibly loosen. Final image of smudged hellebore under violet light charges the reconfiguration, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prevent global panic while not violating core programming—tightens when the analog smudge forces the algorithm to dilute certainty; options narrow from “speak/delete” to “contaminate/endure.” Escalation is one meaningful turn, sufficient at this length; price is the lifelong personal vigilance he now must keep. Agency is entirely his; coincidence absent. Cost is visible on page: “he would be the only one to see the end coming through the haze.”</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme—knowledge vs. survivable ignorance—emerges through the engine’s loosened confidence bands and the personal cost of maintenance, never sermonized. Subtext operates in the smudge: a literal dirt mark that re-weights global forecast ethics. Ambiguity is productive: panic postponed, doom still coming, responsibility individualized. Final auroral glow on the flower offers non-literal resonance without moral tagline.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elias’s bio-digital sensorium; vocabulary (“fault-tolerant oracle,” “confidence intervals,” “graphite against quartz”) stays within his professional lexicon. Rhythm mimics fluctuating fever calm: long clauses mimic probability waves, then crunch into staccato smudge act. No head-hopping; no POV leakage. Therapy-speak avoided—“auroral sorrow” is metaphor Elias could plausibly coin under hallucination. Voice distinctiveness under pressure satisfies 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty: “the weight of a swallowed truth… sat like lead in his gut” marries physical sensation to information payload. Figurative language is sparse and patterned—aurora as mourning curtain, models as arrogant—paid off at closure. No scaffold loops; no filter-verb stacks. Rhythm accelerates through smudge beat then exhales into final lament. Minor elevated register (“conceptual cues,” “jagged algorithm”) is character-true and does not obscure causality; artifacts do not touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fusion of climate-science thriller beats with lyric meditation on margins feels fresh; sabotage via thumb-smudge on antique lithograph is non-obvious and inevitable in hindsight. Premise transforms familiar trope—scientist hides doomsday data—into bodily, tactile act that weaponizes white space. Night-blooming hellebore (extinct flower) repurposed as Trojan uncertainty carrier adds conceptual sting. Risk in hybridizing hard-SF mechanism with poetic tone succeeds and heightens resonance.</comment>
