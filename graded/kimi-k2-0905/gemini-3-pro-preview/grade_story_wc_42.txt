<comment>Interiority is sensor-rich and profession-specific; the grief for irreversible time is embodied in the spinning hand against his chest. Contradictory impulse—letting the hand flee vs caging its speed—drives every micro-turn. The final renunciation (he shelters the camera with his body while releasing the shutter) is earned by the acoustic trial sequence and carries visible cost. Voice never slips into diagnostic label-speak; ache stays metallic and auditory.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the shutter’s breath reweights the premise—grief becomes portable lantern, not cure. Causal chain is intact: because hand escapes governor → therefore Elian restructures shutter to match its speed → therefore Green Flash is captured → ache is transmuted. Orientation is anchored by word 30 (“cold iron floor of the Spire”) and never wavers. Cost is legible in the final line: “did not vanish, but it glowed now.”</comment>

<comment>The failing clock hand itself functions as micro-setting; its centrifugal heat alters Elian’s finger placement and timing tactics. Ozone taste and stratosphere churn are filtered through a lens-smith’s priorities (dust = enemy, vibration = timer). Spatial choreography tracks cleanly: tools slide toward open hatch → he shields camera with torso. Final image of glowing ache is charged by the vacuum of heat the hand created—setting literally fuels the closure.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—capture the ephemeral Green Flash—is signaled in paragraph 2 and tightened by the quake’s countdown. One meaningful deepening: when the hand’s whine syncs with the seismic rhythm, Elian abandons visual tuning for acoustic, narrowing options irrevocably. Cost is visible—he risks losing the lenses and his own balance. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under causal lens; luck (quake) complicates but does not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the paradox of capturing impermanence by surrendering to acceleration. Subtext resides in acoustic imagery: leaf-whisper shutter = acceptance of entropy. Final image answers the thematic question—grief is not fixed but made portable. No overt moralizing; resonance arises from the specificity of brass, ozone, and centrifugal heat.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person POV remains tight internal, never exceeding Elian’s sensory field. Diction stays within a tech-artisan lexicon (“escapement,” “mainspring,” “governor”). Rhythmic compression under stress—“Softly,” he commanded”—mirrors mechanical tension. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is auditory-first, consistent with the leaf-fall trigger.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm accelerates with em-dash fragments and single-word imperatives during quake lurches. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances camera, body, or seismic stakes. Figurative language is sparse and physics-true (“vacuum of heat near his face”). Opening and closing lines are acoustically linked (“cold iron floor” vs “glowed now, a permanent lantern”), creating textural bookends.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses horology, astrophotography, and seismology into a fresh triangulation. Risk—using a runaway clock hand as shutter engine—pays off logically. Green Flash trope is subverted: image is captured yet grief persists, avoiding sentimental resolution. Specificity of brass dust, lunar aperture, and leaf-whisper threshold prevents generic “steampunk” feel.</comment>
