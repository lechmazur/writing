<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Elias’s “conscience for hire” persona is vividly embodied in the silk-cuffs gesture and the wind-chime gambit, giving us a consistent, idiosyncratic worldview. Vance’s arc from monolith to trembling “What if I am wrong?” is credible because the mirror shard dramatizes the crack rather than narrating it. Interior contradiction is present—Elias both cares and performs caring—yet the final micro-choice (draping the cloak) is slightly under-motivated; we don’t see why Elias privileges mercy over professional spectacle. Still, the visible cost on Vance (shaking hand, foreign taste of doubt) scales to length and lands as earned stasis.</comment>

<comment>The causal lattice is tight: mirror shard → visible boy-self → doubt → cloak acceptance → bombardment foreclosed. Orientation is secured by word 60 (“iron gallery of the breezy lighthouse at dawn”). The closure beat—Vance wrapping the Cloak tighter while fleet waits—delivers a Charged Poise that reweights his authority without expository gloss. One hairline slip: the velvet pouch appears from “western wall” without prior spatial seed, a micro-teleport, but it neither breaks causality nor dulls the cost image.</comment>

<comment>The lighthouse itself functions as micro-setting: rusted railing constrains stance, salt-crusted glass refracts dawn light onto the mirror shard. Wind-chime orchestra is a tactile prop that constrains Elias’s method and Vance’s choice; iron rods beaten flat echo Vance’s worldview. Sensory hierarchy obeys POV—Elias notices silk cuffs, Vance the violet horizon—no tourist catalog. Environment directly charges the final image: dawn gray indifference versus the dark textile Vance clutches, a concrete, irreplaceable contrast.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“will Vance fire?”—is signaled in the second paragraph and tightened by each artifact: chime choice → mirror crack → cloak acceptance. Agency remains Vance’s; Elias facilitates but cannot force the trembling hand. Visible price: Vance’s absolutist identity is publicly fractured inside the lighthouse gallery; the fleet’s hold is the off-page consequence that now carries felt cost. One meaningful turn is sufficient at this length; the escalation is causally legible and lens-holding.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from concrete apparatus: wind chimes as moral stethoscope, mirror as excavator of buried boy, cloak as woven hesitation—no abstract sermon. The final image reweights “necessary order” into “man weighing moral cost” without declarative thesis. Ambiguity is purposeful: Elias’s sincerity remains unreadable, preserving ethical tension. Resonance arises from particular objects, not prompt-label echo, satisfying the non-literal answer requirement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is lush yet controlled: “sincerely insincere” and “definition of a calculated mask” compress Elias’s paradox in syntactically balanced clauses. Perceptual signature is consistent—Elias’s silk, Vance’s calloused fist—no filter-verb clusters. Diction stays within plausible lexicon except “monolith of conviction,” which reads as permissible heightening. Rhythm modulates: long sentence for Elias’s purr, staccato for Vance’s sneer; no drumbeat template. Under stress, syntax shortens (“I… I might be wrong”) without voice collapse.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or synonym churn; every sentence advances image, causality, or atmosphere. Figurative language is sparse and precise: “embers… surrendered,” “roof collapses and buries you,” avoiding purple density. Strong verbs—“purred,” “sneered,” “crumpled”—replace modifier stacks. Opening and closing lines are image-anchored, no scaffolding. Micro-teleport of pouch is the only line-level blemish, too minor to dull the resonant final cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: moral consultancy via wind-chime diagnostics is specific, not a trope checklist. Mirror-as-boy-extractor transforms familiar “confront your past” into physical prop with vacuum physics. Cloak of doubt as psychological weight made textile is an organic metaphor that charges closure. Risk—abstract concept as fabric—heightens coherence rather than gimmickry. Transformation test fails if names/places swapped; the lighthouse, chimes, and mirror are irreplaceable to the moral mechanics.</comment>
