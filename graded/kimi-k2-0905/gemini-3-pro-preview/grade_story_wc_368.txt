<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete, dye-master craft shapes every beat; the donor-heart as wild-animal metaphor is embodied, not label-speak. Micro-choice of aligning sun and wing shows hierarchy of values. Only nit: six-month transplant adjustment is asserted, not dramatized—cost is felt but could bite harder.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: because he calculates sun angle → therefore submerges wing → decisive change blooms. Closure lands with conceptual cost—he reframes life as prism, not sponge. Mid-point orientation is clean; floating-tea-house rules taught early. Sun-trail chalk lines keep causality visible, payoff reconfigures premise.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Floating rock tea house is not backdrop—it supplies isolation, altitude, and rotating floor that calibrate the experiment. Micro-setting of wing ridges and solvent viscosity constrain timing and gesture. Valley-mist vapor literally parts to mirror revelation, charging final image. Sensory selection favors dye-master priorities: color, light, refraction.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single stake: distill charisma into color. Escalation is tightening of sunlight across chalk marks; failure = gray dust, success = living blue. Agency is precise—he angles wing at solvent; cost is risk of ruin and implicit donor-heart stakes. Price lands conceptually, not viscerally—reason for 8.8 not 9+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges: charisma as geometric attention, not mythic magnetism. Morpho wing reprises as metaphor for refracting life; ending image reweights prior donor-heart motif. Avoids explicit moral; resonance is imagistic. Slight abstraction keeps it from 9—cost is felt but intellectual rather than gut.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person floats close to Elian’s dye-master diction: “iridescent caution,” “blood of beetles.” Perceptual signature filters every detail through color-craft. Rhythm accelerates with sun-beam creep; no filter-verb stacks. One POV, stable distance; no dialogue to test, so evaluated as lyric interior monologue.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sentences vary; no scaffold loops. “Quietly explosive” is oxymoron that earns its keep. Information density high—each line adds sensory or causal data. Metaphors stay inside optical physics logic; no mixed vehicles. Final line crystallizes without overwriting. Minor: “valley-mist wonder” borders lyric cliché but is saved by earned context.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: dye-craft + donor-heart + morpho optics = charisma-as-geometry. Risk of structural-color distillation pays off. Premise is familiar “artist steals essence” but transformed through specific craft detail and iridescent-caution ethic. Could push to 9+ if cost were more bodily, less conceptual.</comment>
