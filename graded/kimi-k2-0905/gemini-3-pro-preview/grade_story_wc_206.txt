<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is concrete—his bone-marrow memory of frequency, his terror of the glowing chip—and his “mender” identity steers every micro-choice. The single contradiction (faith vs. doubt) is acted out live, not summarized. Cost is felt: he literally stakes reality on a whispered truth, foreclosing retreat. No second character, so status/relationship bullets are N/A.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens: because he clings to perfectability, therefore the machine remembers its unbroken state. Closure is a Decisive Change with felt cost—the harmonic wave knocks dust from rafters and from Elias’s own doubt. Orientation anchored in first 60 words; no teleporting props. The persistent price: the stone’s light now owns the city’s lung, binding Elias to perpetual honesty.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The Resonance Chamber is not backdrop but antagonist—its walls, rafters, and iron doors visibly corrode or re-bloom under the harmonic assault. Micro-setting (the master gear’s empty socket) literally accepts the stone and decides the world. Sensory hierarchy obeys Elias’s craft: brass pins, spring steel tension, “choir of metal birds.” Tool-as-setting constrains and charges closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—world unmaking via conceptual rust—signaled line 1 and tightened when the rust scratches the doors mid-scene. One meaningful reversal: instead of replacing broken gears, he polishes the intact, forcing the rust to lose purchase. Tactic change is visible; cost is the irreversible binding of city’s lung to his truth. Escalation is causal under the chosen lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the method: perfection remembered tramps damage repaired. Subtext lives in the chip’s light—truth as living, consuming force. No final sermon; the golden audible clarity is the answer. Ambiguity remains: who ordained the Covenant? Complexity accepted, not tidied.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Perceptual signature is consistent—mechanical metaphors, microscopic brass topography, harmonic vocabulary. Syntax mirrors a music box: balanced phrases, ratcheted clauses, crescendo in the shockwave paragraph. No head-hopping; compression taught early (“memory than a sound”) and paid off in final fugue. Register stays within a repairman’s lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>High density: “rasp of rust,” “kaleidoscope of ruby shadows,” each sentence layers sense and stakes. Rhythm accelerates with the spinning gear, breathes during polishing beats. One mixed metaphor (“city’s last lung” alongside “music box”) is earned by world logic. No loops, no filter-verb stacks, no scaffold. Closure line is clean, resonant.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: alchemy + clockwork + anti-entropy acoustics, all bound to vocational specificity. Risk—the counter-intuitive repair method—pays off logically. The Covenant of Rust as conceptual decay feels novel, not zombie-steampunk retread. Final reconfiguration (restoration by affirmation) is non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
