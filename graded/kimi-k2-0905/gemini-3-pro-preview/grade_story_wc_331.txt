<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s “sanely eccentric” logic is shown through her shelf-sorting by heartbreak gravity and her hyperbolic origami, but the piece withholds any interior contradiction or shifting micro-choice inside the portal beat; she remains composed before and after, so the cost is atmospheric, not felt on her body or psyche. The scarf slip lands as external mishap rather than character-driven failure, capping the score just below 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the failed breach snaps shut, leaving Elara in earned stasis—she now knows the abyss exists but must shelve it. Cost is legible in the ozone-to-dust tonal shift and her resolute return to stamping books; causality holds under Accumulative lens as the scarf’s accumulated memories buckle space. Hyperbolic pleats are taught early and paid off at collapse, satisfying pattern. No orientation debt; who/where/when anchored within first 120 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The library as micro-setting constrains every move: mahogany desk, rotunda shadows, thermodynamical limericks—all filter through Elara’s poetic-science idiom. Silk scarf doubles as portable setting/object that materially alters the room’s geometry at climax. Sensory hierarchy obeys her odd-hour solitude—narrowed to scent, sound, texture—then widens into cosmic vista without losing spatial coherence. Setting charges the final stillness once oceanic void reseals.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—access the pre-narrative abyss—tightens when hyperbolic folds bend real light; option narrows to “hold or snap.” Scarf’s tension supplies visible price, paid on-page when silk slips and vision collapses. Agency is manipulation of fabric, not confrontation; suffices under Accumulative design. Secondary stakes (patrons’ ambient browsing) remain decorative, preventing 9+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: the irreducible gap between data and lived heat, between catalogued verse and unwritten source. Final image—Elara calmly stamping books beside sealed abyss—delivers Conceptual Repricing: knowledge of infinite story-origin now sits silently under routine labor, reweighting every future checkout. No explicit thesis; resonance arises from silk’s failure to hold memory-space. Counter-reading lingers: obsession validated yet indefinitely deferred.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is dense, scientific-poetic: “stanzas describing string theory spiraled up the rotunda walls,” “specific gravity of heartbreak.” Syntax mirrors Elara’s precision—layered clauses, disciplined metaphors—then compresses during portal beat into shorter, breath-hitched phrasing. No head-hopping; third-person hover stays tight. Register stays within her plausible lexicon; eccentrics can speak cathedral-and-calculus without rupture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose carries high info density: each sentence layers metaphor with material action (“curves that flared outward like saddle shapes” advances fold AND geometry). Rhythm modulates—long cadences for library hush, staccato for snap release—without template loops. One mixed metaphor risk: “forgotten thought” + “vibrating weight” but resolved within two lines. No line artifacts touch closure beat; final sentence lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: using differential geometry as portal-tech inside a poetry library collapses science/art binaries in a way that feels inevitable, not gimmicky. Risk—hyperbolic scarf origami—heightens stakes and is grounded in tactile description. “Specific gravity of heartbreak” as shelving algorithm is a novel compression of emotion into physics. Conceptual integrity holds; piece never flinches from its non-Euclidean premise.</comment>
