<comment>Elian’s lone-mage profile is vividly sketched through bodily ritual and a single, high-stakes micro-choice—dropping the wing. The lack of any contradictory impulse keeps him just shy of the 9+ gate; we see no moment where he doubts or where the cost of his solitude bites. Still, his sensory-biased attention and the quiet, earned stasis at the end make the characterization resonant and complete for this length.</comment>

<comment>Causal chain is lean but intact: hostile night-sounds → cartography of silence → wing-drop → prophecy neutralized. Closure lands as a Charged Poise—the world’s options re-weighted by the velvet hush—with the wing’s disappearance carrying visible conceptual cost. Orientation is anchored by word 30, lens holds; only the lack of a second tightening beat keeps it sub-9.</comment>

<comment>The glade is rendered through touch, temperature, and acoustic micro-detail; the brook’s surface-tension shift even becomes the final image. Environment directly supplies the tool (water) and the medium (sound waves) that Elian weaponizes. Missing a 9-point only because the “nocturnal haven” itself never endangers or limits him—it is stage, not antagonist.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—silence the coded prophecy—is signaled in paragraph 3 and escalates once: the night’s syntax nearly completes. The protagonist’s agency is the mapping/dropping act; price is paid when the wing—and a timeline—are lost downstream. Escalation is single-point rather than compounding, but it cleanly narrows to the hush-under-stars payoff.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges obliquely: intervention versus acceptance, the ethics of erasing a future to spare the world. No character moralizes; meaning accrues through the wing’s interrupted-flight metaphor and the final velvet stillness. The quiet image re-prices prophecy itself as disposable—an insight earned, not stated.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person voice is steady, compressive, and cosmically scaled without slipping into omniscient lecture. Perceptual signature is Elian’s: he “maps silence,” feels “geological weight,” sees water as “liquid obsidian.” No head-hop, no filter-stack; patterned elision (“he marked it”) is taught early and paid off in the hush-drop.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and syntactic shape; no scaffolding loops or synonym churn. Metaphors stay internally coherent (obsidian water, velvet hush). High information density—each sentence does two jobs (image + causal cue). A single near-purple phrase (“terrestrially cosmic”) is earned by context and does not obscure the final image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>“Silence as active magic” is familiar, but the mechanics—cartography of micro-pauses, severed origami wing as vacuum—are specific and non-obvious. Risky compression succeeds: no mentor, no spell words, no antagonist, yet stakes feel large. Synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight; the piece could not swap wing for coin or leaf without breaking its metaphysical logic.</comment>
