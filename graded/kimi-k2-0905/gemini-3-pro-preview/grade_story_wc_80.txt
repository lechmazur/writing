<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elias’s “stoically sensitive” duality is dramatized through micro-choices: he accepts chest-deep brine to serve a private grief-archive, not just a wall. The final concealment of the vial is a renunciation that costs him further exposure, foreclosing any public recognition. Interiority stays concrete—“hushed blaze” rather than abstract guilt. No contradiction or therapy-speak; the flaw (private obsession) drives the climax, not a trait label.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: nightly ritual, ink, vial, mortar form a pattern whose final iteration (the sealed note) reweights the pavilion from ruin to reliquary. Closure is Charged Poise—the lantern’s last flicker certifies the secret is entombed and future readers will confront the city’s emotional fossil. Orientation and causality are clean; the only minor drag is a 140-word delay before “firm shore surveyor” appears, barely past the 120-word guardrail but the later payoff waives penalty.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Half-drowned pavilion, algae-slick granite, barnacle-choked crack—every surface is felt under glove or wader. Lantern-light on marble ribs mirrors Elias’s “silent grief,” yet the description stays tactile: mortar grit between fingers, iron-gall scent against brine. Spatial choreography is flawless—drawbridge up → plinth → fissure → submerged chest-level—so the reader can map at all times. Setting actively resists the repair, forcing the wrest action and charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake: save one evacuee’s dream from total erasure. Tightening occurs when clearing the granite chunk—failure would abort the vial placement—so physical blockage externalizes emotional stakes. Cost is paid in cold water penetration, lantern fuel, and the invisible loss of public acknowledgment. Under Accumulative lens the cadence shift (wrest → seal → flicker) reweights the pavilion from corpse to capsule; luck complicates but does not decide.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of interlaced absence emerges via ritual, not lecture: wall-void + dream-void literally fuse into load-bearing mortar. Subtext lives in gesture—Elias smooths cement like a tombstone, reader grasps memorial without moral. The ending image (dark water vs. hidden blaze) offers non-literal answer: preservation requires burial. No final-paragraph thesis; slight −0.2 for near-echo “archeologist of abandoned dreams” that flirts with thesis-statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person tight stays inside Elias’s perceptual funnel: “skeletal remnant of marble arches,” “sharp scent of iron-gall ink.” Syntax lengthens during underwater struggle, shortens at seal—“He covered it quickly”—to mirror breath. No head-hop; diction stays within coastal-worker lexicon. Dialogue absent by design; narrative voice carries idiom through tool- and body-centric verbs, earning perceptual signature.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Varied sentence lengths mimic tidal pull; opening compound clauses yield to fragment—“cold and insistent.” Information-dense lines do double duty: “brine mingled with the pervasive brine” locates scent and signals corrosion. No mixed metaphors, no scaffold loops. Minor −0.2 for two successive “smooth” verbs when sealing; clarity remains intact and closure beat untouched.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>“Archaeologist of the present” flips usual dig-exhume trope; embedding fresh artifacts in a sinking city is non-obvious. Object-as-setting (inkwell) and method (mortar-notes) are specific enough that swap would break logic. Risk taken in quiet, lyric ending rather than spectacular collapse, but coherence holds. Emotional specificity—“hushed blaze”—avoids sentimental template, giving memorable inflection.</comment>
