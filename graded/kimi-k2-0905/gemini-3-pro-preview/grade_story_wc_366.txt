<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elias’s reticence and “warmly observant” trait are shown through concrete micro-choices—slow climb, cataloging tremor, selecting sea-glass—and the final gesture balances both motives. Thomas’s unraveling is viscerally embodied; his loosening posture after the glow lands is credible. The internal contradiction (silence vs. need to intervene) is present but soft; Elias’s stoic coat never truly threatens his intervention, so the cost feels donated rather than wrested. Still, the single-scene crucible and visible endurance yield a clean Earned Stasis.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: lamp fails ∴ psychological plunge ∴ Elias ascends ∴ sea-glass corrects cairn ∴ amber bloom re-weights darkness. Each beat narrows options toward the final image where safety is bottled and decanted. The closure—Charged Poise in the glowing stone—carries felt cost: Elias exits into blackness having spent his found talisman. Orientation is anchored by the third sentence; no debt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lantern room as glass trap, granite cairn as micro-setting, and storm-pressed glass conspire to constrain every move; the sea-glass’s final placement literally alters the physical layout of the “letter.” Sensory triage favors wind-whine and metal toll over visual clutter. Spatial choreography is immaculate—crate, stair, sill, hand, boot-heel match strike—no floating bodies. Environment charges the closing image without overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake: keep Thomas from psychological shipwreck; signaled when Elias notes the “cry for help” cairn. Escalation is internal—darkness tightens, unseen presence creeps—but agency stays active: Elias decides to climb, to add glass, to strike match. Cost is present yet mild; the true price is the surrender of his private treasure, paid in the final third. One tightening is sufficient; luck never rescues.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of mute solidarity emerges through gesture, never slogan: silence as coat, stones as syntax, glass as bottled safety. Subtext lives in the amber bloom that acknowledges darkness without sermon. The stacked-stone lexicon and the skipper’s refusal to speak create a plausible counter-reading—intervention without intimacy—that complicates easy rescue myths. Final image reweights the whole: light not to guide ships but to guide souls.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited clings to Elias’s reticent perceptual signature: “cataloging human erosion,” noticing tremor not tears. Syntax is compressed, maritime, rhythmic—no filter-verb fat. Compression taught early (“carried silence like a heavy coat”) and paid off in the match-flare bloom. No head-hopping; Thomas’s interior is read only through Elias’s biased lens, maintaining distance integrity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Sentence music rises and falls with ascent/strike/bloom; no template cadence detected. Metaphors are spare and coherent—“glass-walled chamber that felt less like a shelter and more like a trap” is exact, not purple. Information density high: single clause often conveys motion, tool, and emotional valence. Minor scaffold: “the vibration of the sea floor humming through the tower’s bones” could lose “the vibration of,” but it does not blur causality or dull the final image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fresnel-lens ghost story is familiar terrain; freshness comes from the silent stone-cairn postal system and the inversion of lighthouse optics—light not for ships but for keeper. Risk taken: climax is a soft amber glow, not mechanical repair. Specificity of pebble lexicon and sea-glass talisman makes the rescue feel bespoke rather than template. Synthesis earns its inevitability in hindsight.</comment>
