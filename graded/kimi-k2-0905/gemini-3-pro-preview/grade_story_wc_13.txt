<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s hunger to “capture the likeness of a dying sound” is visceral, embodied, and escalates through micro-choices (trading a week of life for one frozen hour). The internal contradiction—obsession versus self-preservation—plays out in scene, not summary. Physical cost (wrinkled hands, white streak) lands as irrefutable proof of motive. No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible waived; single-POV interiority remains consistent, specific, and pressure-tested.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: because she needs speed she borrows time; therefore the world freezes; because the giant stirs the stasis cracks; therefore she must flee. Closure is a Charged Poise—the sketch finished, the city roaring, her body aged—“a masterpiece stolen from the edge of oblivion” reweights all prior bargains. Cost is visible in the same sentence as the final image. Orientation taught by word 70 (“rooftop canal system”)—no penalty.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The rooftop canal system is not backdrop but bloodstream—water as city-blood, sky as ceiling—filtering every perception. Micro-setting (the pendant against sternum, the iron lattice at the spire’s peak) constrains the final uncaging act. Sensory hierarchy obeys illustrator priorities: color, line, translucence. Spatial choreography is immaculate; no impossible moves as she climbs paralyzed stonework.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—capture the origin of echo before the giant wakes—signaled in paragraph 1 and tightened twice: first when twilight shortens natural minutes, second when the pendant’s hour is shredded into seconds. Agency: she decides to slide the bolt; the rush of echo and the crack in time are direct consequences. Cost is literal lifespan, visible on her body. One meaningful escalation suffices; no reversals required.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from concrete particulars: obsession versus mortality, art versus time. No moralizing sentence intrudes; final image of “perfectly silent” echo on the page is Conceptual Repricing—sound frozen into visual, life traded for silence. Subtext lives in the pendant’s cold burn and the illustrator’s charcoal streaks. Complexity lingers: she smiles while the city roars—triumph and loss inseparable.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is compressed, lyrical, illustrator-specific: “water served as the blood of the city,” “shimmering, translucent entity of pure vibration.” Syntax mirrors urgency—sentence length collapses under temporal stress. No dialogue, so bullets waived. Perceptual signature remains stable: color, texture, line, translucence. No head-hop, no register drift; even elevated diction (“subterranean snore”) feels earned by the fabular frame.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>High information density: one sentence often does three jobs— world, body, stake. Figurative language is patterned and paid off: “city’s blood,” “giant’s nap,” “diamonds” of frozen water. No synonym loops, no scaffold, no mixed metaphors. Rhythm accelerates into the final beat without muddle. Minor filter verbs appear but are voice-motivated. Closure line is clean, resonant, uncluttered.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>City-sized sleeper whose breath is tectonic, echoes born in a spire, time literally carved from lifespan—synthesis feels inevitable, not gimmicky. Illustrator protagonist is fresh angle on “art at any cost.” Pendant’s ∞ shape reweights from ornament to mortal currency. Risk—borrowing future life for one sketch—heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Transformation test passed: swap illustrator for thief and whole arc collapses.</comment>
