<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elian’s solitary caretaker identity is vivid—his ritual choreography, sensory attunement, and foxglove regret are embodied in gesture and perception. The contradiction between infinite custodial duty and human loneliness is present but never crystallizes into a visible micro-choice that forecloses a path; his repair succeeds without sacrifice or visible cost. Interiority stays concrete, but the ending renunciation is implied rather than dramatized on-page, capping the arc just below the 8+ threshold.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each polished leaf and tuned chime thickens the texture until the cracked bamboo snaps the pattern, forcing a sonic seam that re-ignites the orchid. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the crystalline note reweights the premise—names stay adrift, Elian stays, loneliness endures—charged poise with felt cost. No orientation debt; pattern taught by 25 % mark. Cost is legible in the final image of rain-like names falling to a dead world.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Opal stone corridors, silica vines, and high-altitude wind are filtered through Elian’s professional caretaker gaze; every sensory note either feeds or starves the orchids, so description never stalls action. The bamboo tube’s fracture and blue acoustic weld act as micro-setting that directly constrains the repair choice. Spatial choreography is clean; no credibility errors. Environment does not charge the final image as strongly as the sound itself, keeping it just under 9.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preservation of forgotten names—is signaled early and tightened when gray petals reveal sonic starvation. Agency is renunciation/continuation: Elian chooses to keep serving emptiness; the cost is the renewed recognition of eternal solitude. One meaningful deepening suffices; no reversal required. Price is conceptual—he remains lone witness—but the moment of choice is distilled rather than dramatized, holding the score sub-8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of memorial persistence emerges from orchid nutrition logic, not assertion. Subtext lives in gesture: polishing history’s exhalations, humming a predecessor’s song, listening for ghosts. Final image of names raining onto dead cities reweights the caretaker’s labor as both futile and transcendent—earned conceptual repricing without moralizing. No thematic echo or summarizing statement; ambiguity lingers cleanly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person intimate delivers a consistent perceptual signature: cathedral silence, translucent page-turn of centuries, foxglove regret—each phrase mirrors Elian’s refined, poisoned devotion. Syntax breathes with cathedral reverb: long clauses when calm, clipped fragments during repair. No head-hopping; diction stays within caretaker-mystic lexicon. Compression is patterned and paid off; rhythm control heightens pressure without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud cadence varies; sentence openings rotate; paragraphs taper to mirror orchid flicker. Figurative density is high but taught early and justified by glass-garden cathedral aesthetics—no muddle in climax. One paraphrase loop: “fragile lattice... fragile miracle” conceptually rhymes without advancing pressure, −0.2. No scaffold, no synonym churn elsewhere. Information density strong; opening and final lines carry double duty.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Premise—sound-fed glass orchids in sky-library—feels inevitable yet fresh, synthesized through acoustic botany and atmospheric caretaking. Trope of last-man-in-wonderland is re-ignited by sonic horticulture and foxglove regret metaphor. Risky lyric accumulative structure is taught early and lands cleanly. Specific detail (condensed-atmosphere weld, silica vine pulse) detaches story from generic elegy. Transformation test fails if settings swapped—acoustic ecology is integral.</comment>
