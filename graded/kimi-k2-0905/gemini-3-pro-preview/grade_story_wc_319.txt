<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The feral guardian’s contradictory impulses—predatory instinct vs. hunger for company—stay active in scene: the rumble that is “half-purr, half-growl” embodies the split. The final choice to sit, not pounce, is prepared by the earlier ache for “variable” contact, so the renunciation feels earned. Interiority is concrete and bias-driven; the cultist tastes of “ozone and old paper,” a sensory hook that reveals the narrator’s alien appetite. No therapy-speak or label-summary flattens the peak beat, so the 9-gate is missed only because the cost is more conceptual than viscerally felt.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the shared suspended breath reweights the stake from solitary exile to possible coexistence, with the “crushing geometry” still looming—undeniable conceptual cost. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; density increases via recurring “frost,” “mist,” “geometry” until the final dimming reconfigures meaning. Orientation is taught early (guardian, frozen garden, now) and the deliberate disorientation (mind-as-terrain) pays off inside the same scene, so no penalty. Causality is internal but coherent: “interiorizing exteriors” swallows the battlefield, forcing the guardian to confront the intruder inside its own psyche, narrowing options to speak or destroy.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The frozen garden is not backdrop; its “solidified silence” and “thorny briars” of sentences actively constrain movement and mirror the guardian’s mental state. The pendant’s cutting light is a micro-setting object that literally reshapes perception—forcing the guardian to squint and re-evaluate tactics. Spatial choreography is clean: from underbrush to Philosophy section overgrown with hemlock, bodies and fog remain trackable. Environment, body (ribcage ache, fur ripple), and tool (pendant) all charge the final image where shadows “embrace us both,” satisfying the 9-gate constraint test.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—guardian’s need to decide whether to destroy or welcome uncertainty—is signaled in paragraph one. Escalation is textural: each recurrence of “light as violent edge” intensifies the cost of tolerating definition; the dimming pendant is the single decisive intensification. Agency is present—waiting is an active tactical choice that forecloses the kill-path. Cost is conceptual but legible: “the crushing geometry of this world felt a little less lonely” shows the price of choosing companionship over categorical purity.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: the value of ambiguity over absolutist taxonomy is enacted, not declared. The pendant’s glare = categorical knife, the dimming = tolerance of vagueness; image carries subtext. No final-paragraph moralizing; the last line is imagistic suspension. Counter-reading possible—guardian may still devour later—preserving complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>First-person perceptual signature is relentless: “claws clicking softly against the roots of sentences,” “fear tasted like ozone and old paper.” Syntax flexes with stress—compressed appositions when the guardian coils, longer voluptuous phrases when savoring intruder’s fear. No head-hop; knowledge stays strictly guardian-bound. Dialogue is minimal but subtextual—cultist’s single whispered line carries plea and terror, answered by rumble rather than words.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally; sentence length contracts in predatory moments, expands in lyrical passages. Information density high: one line can world-build (“solidified silence that had drifted down from the canopy”) and advance plot (breach signaled). No paraphrase loops or synonym churn; each metaphor extends rather than repeats. Minor register elevation (“conceptual core of my exile”) is voice-motivated and patterned, not artifactual.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Feral librarian as alien apex predator is fresh; “interiorizing exteriors” tactical consumption of landscape into mind is a conceptual twist not seen in stock fantasy. Transformation test passed: exile’s ache for non-Euclidean home and refusal to kill the question mark is inseparable from this narrator. Risky second-person address to intruder inside own mind succeeds without gimmickry. Specificity of “hemlock-entwined Philosophy section” roots the surreal in concrete library logic.</comment>
