<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lyra’s exile-motive and embodied ritual feel lived-in; the moonstone dissolution beat crystallizes her interior contradiction. Yet the decision to tattoo is declared rather than wrung through a visible dilemma—no moment where she nearly turns back—so the cost reads as aesthetic more than visceral. Interiority is vivid (“slow, dry suffocation”) but remains monolithic; we see no ripple of fear or second thought under the stylus. Still, the obsidian grace stance is consistent and the final image of her as tide-vessel earns credible renunciation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the verse hardens into biology, foreclosing return with luminous cost visible on the skin. Causal chain is lean—alignment → inscription → irreversible fusion—taught early and paid off. The nostalgia ban is sketched only as backdrop; because it never threatens in-scene, the political stake feels conceptual rather than imminent, muting the tightening. Still, the final step into darkness reconfigures her universe and the lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The twilight garden is rendered through tactile micro-detail—synthetic moss, false constellations—whose artifice mirrors Lyra’s alienation. The body itself becomes micro-setting: the forearm’s dermis as cosmic parchment constrains the ritual and charges the final image. Sensory hierarchy is tight; breathless stillness against remembered wind keeps the oceanic longing alive. Spatial choreography is immaculate; no prop drift or impossible positions.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—permanent self-inscription versus enforced amnesia—is signaled early and tightens once: the ink locks, foreclosing erase. The pain acts as visible price, but the scene stops short of a second reversal (no drone almost-spotting her), so escalation plateaus after the fusion beat. Agency is interior and sufficient for the lyric mode; the moment she stands, the path home is sealed. Cost is legible but not compounded; still, the single deepening satisfies the length.</answer>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of outlawed memory emerges through the moonstone’s ancestral dust and the verse’s unbanishable gravity, never sermonized. The oceanic pull as map home reweights the banished past without declaring a moral. Subtext lives in gesture—the sleeve pulled down to hide light from drones—showing surveillance culture better than exposition. Final image reframes exile as return, inviting reflection beyond the page.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is compressed, lyrical, and POV-true: “obsidian grace,” “fledged artwork”—diction stays within a dancer-poet’s ken. Rhythm modulates from languid garden pacing to clipped surgical strokes under the skin. No head-hop; perceptual signature is consistent (“synthetic constellations” read as alien to her). Filter verbs are scarce; immediacy dominates. The lyric cadence teaches its pattern early and pays off in the glowing final line.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry triple duty—world, body, metaphor—without clog. “Ink…began to fledge” is fresh yet clear; no mixed metaphor. Micro-loop check clean: no paraphrase pairs or template cadence runs. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image. Minor density alert: three adjective clusters in one sentence mid-ritual, but they serve the feathering image and do not obscure causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</comment>
<comment>Fusing tide-dance with cosmic tattooing feels inevitable yet new; the moonstone dust as ancestor-data crystal is a sharp specific. Nostalgia-ban is a familiar dystopian trope, but grounding it in skin-grade rewriting avoids abstract allegory. Risk in lyric compression pays off: the story commits fully to ritual over plot spectacle. Transformation test passes: swap dancer/surgeon/tattooist and the arc collapses.</comment>
