<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elian’s solitary grief and tinker-musician idiom stay vivid; every micro-movement (shaking the can, pressing the bolt plate) is a choice that costs him calm and risks electrocution. Interiority is sensorial—humming counter-melodies, tasting ozone—never abstract. Flaw: no second character on-stage, so relationship-as-crucible is absent; that caps the score at 8.7 per scope note.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the upload reweights Kaelen’s static into music, the price is Elian’s soaked solitude and the bolt plate’s residual heat—cost is palpable in two lines. Causal chain is airtight: aerosol → mural → iron plate → lightning strike → discharge → buffer purge. Orientation taught by 60 words; no lens ambiguity. Meets 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The mist-slick courtyard, ionised air, and rust-flowered plate constrain every move—spray angle, grounding, timing. Micro-setting (bolt plate) literally channels the lightning and final image. Sensory hierarchy is musician-biased: electromagnetic hum > visual. No orientation debt. Gate satisfied: tool charges closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—free Kaelen—tightens from static screams to calm glow; one decisive deepening suffices. Agency is continuous: each spray stroke is an irreversible gamble with high-voltage death. Cost is felt in soaked clothes and smoking iron. Could hit 8.8 if a secondary tangible loss (tool cracks?) were dramatised.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: analog love can debug digital grief. Image of hand-pressed iron repurposing lightning into lullaby reweights “upload” from horror to elegy. Avoids explicit moral; final drip-echo is quietly resonant. Minor slip: “tinker’s miracle” edges toward label-speak but is saved by embodied context.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person slips into lyrical compression without losing clarity: “tinkersong wonder,” “hummed frequencies” teach sonic diction early. Syntax mirrors musician ear—cadenced parallelisms, onomatopoeic hiss-clicks. No dialogue, hence no voice convergence risk. Distinct perceptual signature sustained under peak pressure; eligible for 9-band.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>High information density: one sentence often delivers sensorial detail, backstory shard, and causal cue. Varied rhythm accelerates during lightning beat; no template cadence detected. Metaphors stay physical—no mixed vehicles. Minor scaffold: “the mist curled… the mist into a glowing veil” repeats ‘mist’ without new pressure; −0.2 already reflected. Closure line clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Fusing aerosol graffiti with lightning-grounding physics to exorcise a code-ghost is genuinely fresh; flower-press bolt plate as analog talisman is irreplaceable. Synthesis feels inevitable after setup. Risk—using atmospheric electricity for data purge—pays off without logic break. Specificity of musician-tinker subculture anchors concept.</comment>
