<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s shift from accuser to caretaker is dramatized through her micro-choice to cradle rather than crush the ampoule; the embodied contradiction holds. Caelum’s “incisively kind” stance is shown, not labeled, when his telepathic tone cuts yet comforts. Interiority stays concrete—taste of stale air, loosening grip—avoiding therapy-speak. The only friction: we never learn why Elara alone could descend or what personal loss drove her certainty, so the cost feels collective rather than individually earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure is a textbook Conceptual Repricing: the poison becomes cure, stone becomes womb, ampoule transforms from weapon to key. Causality holds under the Accumulative lens—each glowing vein reweights the moral frame until Elara’s stance flips. Cost is legible in her loosened grip and the expectant ocean silence. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) surface within 120 words; no penalty applied.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The body-as-setting micro-loop (crushing suit vs. chest weight) and the ampoule-as-tool both constrain her final choice. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven—visual gloom, tactile marble grind, taste of stale air—never tourist catalog. Spatial choreography is clean: pedestal-to-arch-to-dais tracked without drift. One minor slip: “groaning tides” is an auditory cliché amid otherwise fresh texture.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—expose murder vs. accept mercy—tightens once, hard, when the sarcophagus children are revealed. The reversal is protagonist-driven: she chooses to break the ampoule after the new frame locks in. Cost is conceptual—her moral identity as avenger is foreclosed—but not viscerally personal; no lost object or social credit is forfeited on-page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the flipped binary poison/cure, stone/skin, accusation/sacrifice. No final-paragraph moralizing; the last image of expectant ocean silence lets the reader reprice the concept. Ambiguity lingers: was stasis truly mercy or still a violation? The foxglove motif returns reweighted without symbolic convenience. One hairline slip: “we became the vault” drifts toward thesis-statement, but is saved by its placement inside telepathic voice.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person lyric voice sustains a consistent perceptual signature—Elara’s attention narrows from crushing gloom to glowing crack to sleeping faces. Syntax modulates with pressure: long clauses under watery suspension tighten into fragment-like beats at the reveal. No head-hopping; Caelum’s telepathy is an external voice, not POV breach. Filter verbs are minimal and voice-motivated.</comment>

<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings avoid mechanical pattern. High information density—one sentence often layers sensory, emotional, and conceptual data (“foxglove-stained glass ampoule in her hand, the purple residue inside appearing black in the crushing gloom”). Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold. One register drift: “conceptual repricing” is evaluator jargon, not in-story language; no character utters it, so no penalty.</comment>

<comment>The stasis-garden premise is fresh, yet the emotional reversal grows inevitably from the revealed mechanics. Risky underwater gothic is executed without purple overload; stone-suspended children feel mythic, not gimmicky. Synthesis of foxglove, marble, and bioluminescent vine is particular to this world—swappable names would break the image. Bonus +0.3 for bold aesthetic that heightens stakes without clarity loss.</comment>
