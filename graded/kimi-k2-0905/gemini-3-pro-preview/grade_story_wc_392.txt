<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elias’s contradictory pull between bureaucratic survival and empathic openness is dramatized in concrete micro-choices—scanning the mud, touching the lantern, uploading the report while hands shake. The final refusal costs him career security; that stakes jump is earned by the prior beats where we see the lantern-induced overload threaten his own nervous system. Interiority stays specific to his investigator lens (“tasting copper and ozone”) rather than diagnostic labels. The only minor slack is that Halloway’s antagonism is off-page voice, so his status shift is asserted not witnessed, but the embodied cost on him is still legible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds throughout: because the rising water dislodges the lantern → entangled memory spike → worker death; because Elias experiences the same infrasound → he recognizes the hazard; therefore he uploads the heritage flag, breaking Halloway’s chain. Closure is a Decisive Change with visible cost: “his own silence, not one imposed.” No orientation drift; geography and timeline stay tight inside the tunnel. Upload bar turning green is the on-page pivot that locks the consequence; the choice is irreversible within the story’s rules.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The tunnel’s dripping water, conductive mud, and infrasound spikes are not backdrop but active hazards that amplify the lantern’s psychic field, directly shaping Elias’s tactics and the fatal mechanism. The lantern itself operates as micro-setting—its rust flaking under gloved fingers catalyzes the memory overlay, then remains anchored in the final image as sentinel. Spatial choreography is immaculate: kneel, scan, brush, stand, upload—all moves track against the subsidence pool and rail geometry. Environment literally resonates into the protagonist’s body, fulfilling the 9+ constraint test.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—professional survival versus moral duty—is signaled by line 3 and tightens when Halloway orders “equipment failure.” The lantern discovery mid-story forces a binary: falsify and keep career, or tell truth and face exile. Escalation is causal under rising infrasound readings that parallel Elias’s dawning recognition of repeatable danger. Cost is explicit: uploading the packet severs his “leash,” a lived loss rendered in the silence that follows.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the collision of historical trauma and corporate erasure; no thesis is stated. The lantern’s reappearance makes the buried past an active toxin, so the moral calculus is dramatized rather than preached. Final image of dripping water “carrying stories he had finally refused to let drown” reweights all prior motif instances without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers: the tunnel will still kill, the city will still profit, but Elias’s refusal is personal, not victorious—an earned stasis that resists tidy uplift.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person tight stays strictly inside Elias’s perceptual filter: “tasting copper,” “sterile voice,” “scream of the past echoing.” Syntax compresses under stress—single-line upload beat with zero exposition. Dialogue is minimal but carries subtext: “Status, Thorne?” is pure power move; his measured reply masks tremoring hands. No head-hop; Halloway’s menace is filtered through his earpiece, preserving distance control.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm mirrors infrasound hum, accelerating into staccato upload beat, then easing into final lyrical cadence. Figurative language is selective: “weeping wound of concrete,” “cognitive residue,” each chosen to fuse body and infrastructure. No mixed metaphors or scaffolding; information density high—one sentence often fuses sensor data, memory overlay, and ethical calculation. Minor paraphrase loop at “silence that followed on the comms was heavy” slightly dulls the landing punch, keeping it sub 9.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fusion of psychic archaeology with infrasound fatality feels fresh yet inevitable given the buried tunnel history. The lantern is not symbol but functional catalyst; its reweighting from relic to hazard source drives the entire second half. Corporate cover-up trope is refreshed through the psycho-acoustic mechanism rather than simple greed. Risky choice to hinge death on paranormal science is fully committed to and paid off with empirical scanner data, making the speculative element integral not ornamental.</comment>
