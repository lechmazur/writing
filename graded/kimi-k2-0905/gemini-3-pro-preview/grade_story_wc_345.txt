<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—hope laced with fatalism—surfaces in her calloused hand gripping the bell and the chalk dust on her boots; Jaxon’s grudging curiosity is embodied in a single grease-stained tap. The collective “family” remains a chorus rather than individuated voices, but the visible cost (bloody thorns, groaning anchors) scales to length and the final earned stasis under the mended sky lands cleanly.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the thickened nebula sealed by communal action reconfigures survival itself, price paid in the bruised-purple twilight and the boot-felt thrum. Causal chain holds—chalk diagram → bell resonance → butterfly amplification—without off-stage magic. Lens stays accumulative/textural; one deepening suffices.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Floating granite arches, root-dangling orchards, and misty void are filtered through orchardists’ practiced eyes; the ceramic bell’s micro-perforations become the pivotal constraint that literally tunes the sky. Sensory hierarchy obeys crisis—narrowed to wind howl and vibrating soles—charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—thinning Nebula—tightens once when resonance frequency converts a garden sprinkler into an atmospheric suture. Visible price: months of graying leaves and groaning anchors translate into boot-level vibration and radiation meters snapping safe. Protagonist agency is collective but unmistakable.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>“Brambled hope” emerges from thorn-blood juice, crystallizes in the ghost’s chalk imperative, and ripens into the sturdy real beneath a mended sky—no moral, just reconfigured air. Theme stays implicit, carried by concrete particulars; the spectral intuition never collapses into message.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person omniscient stays modest, filtering planetary grandeur through colonist pragmatism (“grease-stained fingernail,” “calloused hands”). Lyric compression (“frozen lightning,” “bruised purples”) is pattern-taught early and paid off in the final image; no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Syntax modulates from long aerial vistas to hammer-short clauses at pump ignition; no scaffold loops, no mixed metaphors. Opening–closing resonance (“brambled hope” → “sturdy and real”) provides cadence payoff without redundancy. High information density per sentence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Butterfly sprinkler as atmospheric tuning fork is a non-obvious synthesis; spectral chalk engineer repurposing orphan gardenware feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk—using a ghost mentor—pays off by converting elegy into engineering, dodging deus-ex-machina via on-page physics.</comment>
