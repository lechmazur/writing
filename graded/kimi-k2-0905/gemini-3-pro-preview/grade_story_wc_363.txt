<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s longing to reach “another soul” is visceral, embodied in the tremor of her fingers and the amber bead she risks everything for. The sacrifice is foreshadowed early—her body already “curved like a question mark”—so her final dissolution feels earned rather than convenient. Interior contradiction is present: she both clings to memory and feeds it to the void. The only thing missing is a second micro-choice that would show her hierarchy of values under even sharper pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the loom’s square of cardboard borders and amber light sails outward, re-weighting the rule-set—memory now has a physical edge the silence cannot swallow. Causal chain is tight: jigsaw edges → loom frame → sacrificed life → message launched. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 5 and again at “gray dusk,” well inside the 120-word window. The lens is Causal throughout; every beat is a because/therefore linkage.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The orchard floor “tasted of lost years,” the bamboo cage “rattling,” the bead holds “fossilized laugh”—all sensory, all POV-filtered. Micro-setting is the loom itself; its wooden frame becomes the raft’s hull, constraining the final launch. Spatial choreography is flawless: we track from clearing to encroaching white wall to airborne tapestry without drift. The environment is not backdrop; its erasure is the ticking clock that forces the sacrifice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—deliver the bead or annihilation of meaning—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens exactly once: when the apple tree flickers out, the cost turns visceral. Protagonist agency drives the turn: she alone welds puzzle edges into warp, she alone speaks “Recommence,” she alone steps into the gears. The price—her life—alters later tactics (there are none; the path is foreclosed). Under the Causal lens, this single escalation is sufficient and legible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: memory needs material edges to survive entropy. The jigsaw edge motif re-weights at closure—what was trash becomes the keystone of eternity. No character sermonizes; the final image of the cardboard square piercing white silence is the non-literal answer. Subtext sits in the bead’s “fossilized laugh,” implying that joy, not data, is the payload worth dying for.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays tight to Elara’s perceptual filter: she smells mildew, feels the loom groan, tastes metallic sacrifice. Rhythm compresses under stress—“Recommence” stands alone as one-word paragraph. Diction remains within her plausible lexicon—no academic register intrudes. No dialogue appears, so voice coherence rests on internal texture, which is consistent and singular.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies: long breath of orchard description, then staccato “Recommence.” No filter-verb stacks or synonym churn. One mixed metaphor—“ocean of non-existence”—but it is taught early and pays off when the cardboard raft actually floats. Sentences do double duty: “Her body dissolved into light and motion” advances both plot and image.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Familiar tropes—entropy void, last-message story—are re-forged through the concrete jigsaw-edge macguffin and amber bead. The loom-as-star-gate feels inevitable yet fresh because the physics is built from yard-sale scraps. Risk in form (lyric compression, single-scene sacrifice) heightens stakes without obscuring causality. Final image could belong to no other story.</comment>
