<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elias’s rational-obsessive identity is cleanly signaled and stays consistent; his tweezers-and-dust patience embodies the debunker ethos under lethal pressure. The leap from data to gut-frequency tuning shows a credible fracture in his certainty, paid for by the orchard’s survival. Interiority stays concrete—“watched the diamond wobble”—never drifting into label-speak. The final renunciation—expose the truth, end the sanctuary—carries visible moral cost that scales to the length.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal linkage holds: shredded letters → missing manual → forced intuitive calibration → restored shield. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: by saving the machine he preserves the myth, yet chooses to shatter it, reweighting the rule-set with social cost. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land by line 3; no debt applied. One meaningful tightening—erratic hum forcing the intuitive leap—sufficient for this length. Lens stays causal throughout; no ambiguity at end.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The electromagnetic barrier, ash-laden boughs, and pulsing diamond are selective, sensory, and tied to choice: the orchard’s micro-setting literally keeps Elias alive while pressuring the calibration gamble. The “wobbling floorboard” transmits frequency data, turning environment into instrument. Spatial choreography across the lab is clean; no floating bodies. The shield’s flicker directly constrains the final dial turn, qualifying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—truth vs. survival of the only safe haven—surfaces in paragraph 2 and tightens when the field flickers. The intuitive calibration is the single meaningful turn that forecloses the safe ignorance option with felt cost: if he fails, the storm kills him; if he succeeds, he must later destroy the myth. Escalation is coherent under causal lens; no coincidence resolves the crisis. Price is visible—sweat-slicked brow, moral weight of future exposure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: the reflex to expose comfort can destroy the only comfort left. Subtext lives in the diamond’s “flaw” that is actually necessity, mirroring Elias’s own flaw—rationalism that must betray the sanctuary it saves. Final image of him walking back through “silent trees” quietly reprices the orchard as doomed Eden. No tidy moral; ambiguity lingers about whether truth is worth extinction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elias; no filter-verb clusters. Diction—“geiger counter remained stubbornly silent,” “liquefy the organs”—carries his skeptical cadence. Rhythm tightens under pressure: short clauses during calibration mimic the coil whine. Technical register stays within a debunker’s plausible lexicon; no corporate drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentence openings diversify without template cadence. Information density high: one line can deliver atmosphere, character, and causality—“the diamond wobbled, the protective field around the orchard flickering.” No mixed metaphors; figurative language appears ≤1 per paragraph, avoiding purple swell. Zero paraphrase loops or synonym churn. Line-level artifacts do not touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Post-apple-orchard sanctuary kept viable by a lattice-flaw diamond is a fresh synthesis; trope of cursed gem is inverted into engineered stillpoint. The “lie that protects” angle is familiar, but grounding it in shredded-paper forensics and seismic dial-turning gives specificity. Risk: intuitive tuning without schematic—paid off by bodily ear-to-floor tactic. Conceptual integrity holds; no late rule change. Removing the diamond collapses both shield and story.</comment>
