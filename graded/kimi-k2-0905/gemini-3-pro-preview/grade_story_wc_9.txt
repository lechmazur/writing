<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid—“he had seduced himself with the belief…”—but the epiphany is filtered through a single, summary-laden paragraph rather than dramatized micro-choices; the final refusal to understand is asserted, not shown in a fresh beat. Flaw (ambition-over-family) is clear, yet the moment of self-indictment lands as abstract label (“anatomy of his neglect”) rather than embodied cost. Still, Silas’s perceptual signature and the ritual’s tactile detail keep him above mid-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Closure is clean: the cards indict → he feigns incomprehension → ritual ends in Earned Stasis with felt cost (he forfeits the reclaimed time). Causal chain is tight under the Accumulative/Textural lens: ink saturates crack → images rise → spiral of cards reweights the stake. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 3; no penalty. One micro-turn—recognition then refusal—sufficient for length; no escalation break. Persistent constraint: the empty linen spaces remain blank, foreclosing reconciliation; this charges the final image and satisfies 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>“Midnight glade above the clouds” is anchored through frost-kissed turf, starlight-scent, and the porcelain dish that literally drinks moonlight; environment is micro-setting-as-tool, constraining the ritual’s physics. Sensory hierarchy matches cartomancer’s vocation—light absorbed, sound of snapping cards—never tourist-catalog. Spatial choreography is clean: linen spread → saucer centered → spiral dealt; no floating props. Final image of blank linen reuses earlier anchor and recharges theme; satisfies 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“to find where lost time accumulates”—is signaled in paragraph 1; pressure tightens once when the cards reveal the time was discarded, not lost, foreclosing retrieval. Agency: he chooses to misunderstand, paying with permanent forfeiture of reconciliation; cost is visible (“feigned confusion,” shaking finger). Under Accumulative lens, the single deepening is sufficient; no reversal required. Coincidence absent; luck does not resolve. Meets 8.8 band gate; short of 9.0 only because price is emotionally oblique rather than viscerally hammered.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the specific linen voids and the cracked saucer rather than abstract sermon: absence as artifact. Subtext resides in the refusal to comprehend—silence after the cards speak carries more weight than any statement. Final image of tracing empty space offers resonant non-literal answer; no moralizing paragraph. Could reach 9+ if thecost were more explicitly social (daughter’s lived absence felt on-page), but complexity and ambiguity are intact.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Silas; perceptual signature—“ink seemed to absorb moonlight rather than reflect”—is character-particular and consistent. Syntax grows clipped under stress (“He uncorked… He unfastened…”) mirroring ritual urgency; no template cadence spills into over-writing. Diction remains within cartomancer’s lexicon; no corporate register drift. Dialogue absent; voice coherence sustained through interiority and ritual choreography. No POV leakage or filter-verb stacks; qualifies for 9-band, held to 8.8 only by slight lyric repetition (“choking beauty” twice).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies: long breathless sentences for ascent, staccato fragments for dealing spiral. Information density high—“porcelain dish…drinking darkness”—compresses world-rule and metaphor in one clause. No mixed metaphors; vehicles obey internal logic. Minor template echo: “he had…he had…he had” in backstory block (−0.2), but outside closure zone. Artifacts do not touch final image; propulsion remains strong. Within hairline of 9.0; capped at 8.7 by that early scaffold ripple.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: cartomancy + cloudbound observatory + childhood hand-traces as absent map; not a checklist but an organic fusion. The cracked toy saucer becoming a literal fault-line in reality transforms familiar nursery prop into occult tool. Risk—ritual without overt antagonist—pays off via conceptual repricing. Could push 9-band if daughter’s perspective intruded even as absence; still, angle feels memorable and inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
