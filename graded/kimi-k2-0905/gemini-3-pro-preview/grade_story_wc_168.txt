<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interiority is rich and embodied—his thumb on the glaze fracture, the “map of destruction on his own dermis”—but the interior contradiction never crystallizes into a visible on-page choice that costs him something tangible. The final scatter of soot is ritual, not a fork that forecloses a path; the pain-translation is declared rather than dramatized as a renunciation we watch him pay for. Still, the voice-specific perceptual bias and scar-topography keep him singular and flawed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the soot release reweights his bargain with innocence, and the cost—ash of a friend now irretrievably wind-borne—is legible. Causal linkage is lyric-accumulative rather than because/therefore; the lens is Accumulative/Textural, pattern-taught early via kiln/fire sibling metaphor and held to the final image. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no ambiguity at closure. The only hairline slip: the tightening turn (scatter) is more ceremonial than tactical, so the cost feels symbolic rather than constraint-shaping.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The moonlit ridge and burn-scarred terrain function as micro-setting: loose shale that must not be dislodged underfoot, porcelain glaze that mirrors exoskeleton of keloids—both constrain his ghost-like stride and the final scattering. Sensory hierarchy is firefighter-specific: breath-plume, heat-kiss, ash weight. Spatial choreography is flawless; no floating objects. The environment’s refusal to offer purchase or forgiveness charges the final image, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—pain translation—signals early; pressure tightens once when he decides to scatter, a visible forfeiture of private grief to the cosmos. Agency is present but contemplative rather than tactical; the escalation is cadence-deepening, not option-narrowing. Cost is conceptual (soot lost to wind) yet undeniable under Accumulative lens. Lacks a persistent constraint that reshapes later tactics, keeping it shy of 8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the kiln/wildfire sibling metaphor and the porcelain→soot return; no explicit thesis. The final image reweights “bargained innocence” as cosmic inscription rather than personal defect, achieving resonant ambiguity. Subtext operates in the cracked glaze = cracked self, ash = former innocence, all relayed through tactile gesture. No moralizing, only image-based repricing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is pyro-poetic, lexicon of Pulaskis and thermal columns, rhythm mirroring inhale/exhale of altitude. Perceptual signature—heat-kissed skin read as topography—stays consistent. No dialogue, so no convergence risk. Compression taught early (“moonlit ridge path cutting…”) and paid off in final scatter; no head-hop, no register drift. Under peak stress the diction tightens to monosyllabic prayer-toss, a controlled modulation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>High information density: single sentences braid scar, terrain, cosmology. Figurative language is patterned (kiln/fire siblings) and paid off, avoiding purple clutter. One scaffold trace: “hard softness” repeated conceptually but accepted as thematic aperture. No paraphrase loops, no mixed metaphors; closure image remains luminous and uncluttered.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: wildfire trauma translated into cosmic pottery cycle; porcelain box as urn-thermometer of lost innocence. Risk-taking lies in quiet lyric closure rather than rescue or revenge, and it pays off. Could edge to 8.8 if the scatter carried a sharper irreversible consequence on his future tactics.</comment>
