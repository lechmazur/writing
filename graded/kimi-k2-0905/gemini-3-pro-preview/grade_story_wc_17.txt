<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elias’s empathic link to stone is a vivid, character-specific filter that drives every perception; the micro-choice to exhume the diaries rather than just scan the hearth shows his esoteric motive converting into risk-taking action. The trembling gloves and chest-tightening frequency response embody emotion without labels, and the final burden he shoulders is a credible renunciation that forecloses his former detachment. Interiority stays concrete—no stock “I felt” loops—and the empathy flaw genuinely complicates the mission by making the building’s betrayal physically painful. No second character on page, so status/relationship bullets N/A; single-POY baseline fully satisfied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal linkage is tight: because the echo feels heavy with despair, therefore Elias digs, therefore he finds the diaries and film, therefore the acoustic map in his mind is permanently re-weighted—an undeniable Conceptual Repricing with felt cost. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) are crystal-clear within first 60 words; no penalty. Closure lands on the page: the final click returns a “changed and somber” sound that embodies the new knowledge, closing the loop between premise and ending under the inferred Causal lens. Cost is visible: he physically pockets the evidence and accepts the audible scream as his own burden, foreclosing the option to remain a detached surveyor.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Environment is not backdrop: the ivy-veiled passage constricts movement, the moss carpet muffles his footfalls and thus his sonic readings, and the roofless library exposes the hearth to the sky—each detail alters acoustic behavior and forces tactical adjustment. The hearth itself functions as micro-setting, constraining excavation space and hiding the archive of atrocity; its ash and moisture are handled tactilely. Sensory hierarchy obeys Elias’s profession—sound texture comes first, smell of rain/rot second, visual last—so detail never feels touristic. Final image charges the setting: the same corridor now “screams,” re-weighting every prior sonic map.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“will he keep surveying detached or accept the building’s nightmare as his own?”—is signaled in paragraph one and tightens when the echo registers betrayal. One meaningful deepening: the moment he realizes the heavy frequency is suffocation, his options narrow to either drop the pack and flee or bear witness; he chooses the latter with visible cost (trembling, pockets the evidence). Agency remains causal throughout; no luck rescue. Moral calculus is sharp: preservation of culture vs. murder of colleagues, crystallized in the champagne toast negative. Price paid: the acoustic map in his mind is forever contaminated.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme—inheritance of moral taint encoded in physical structures—emerges entirely through concrete events: ash-packed diaries, inverted faces on celluloid, sonic echo that literally carries the frequency of betrayal. No meta commentary or final moralizing; the closest to a thesis is Elias’s mutely stuffing negatives into his pack, letting the image speak. Ambiguity lingers: we are never told whether exposing the truth will heal or merely spread the infection, so reflection is invited, not dictated. The resonance is earned: the same “walls dream” motif returns as “walls scream,” re-weighting the premise without verbal statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is unmistakable: sonic emitter diction (“high-frequency snap,” “visual topography of sound”) permeates every clause, and sentence rhythm tightens under pressure—short percussive fragments during excavation, longer ebbing cadences when ash yields its secrets. No head-hopping; distance stays mid-deep, consistent. Free indirect style is clean: “the weight... settled onto Elias” keeps filter while remaining inside his skin. Register never drifts into academic abstraction; every metaphor is acoustically grounded (“dark throat of the building”) and stays within POV lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>High information density: one sentence often performs scene-setting, sensory data, and emotional charge (“The echo told him the passage was narrow but stable, though the return signal carried a heaviness that made his chest tighten”). Virtually zero scaffold—no “he thought to himself” padding, no synonym churn. Figurative language is sparse and pattern-taught: the building’s “dark throat” reappears in the scream motif, paying off at closure. Rhythm modulates with scene tempo; no template cadence or paraphrase loops. Opening and closing lines are crisp and propulsive.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The “corridor echo cartographer” profession is non-generic world-building that fuses climate-collapse salvage with ghost-hunter metaphysics, creating a fresh investigative engine. Conceptual risk—walls as emotional recording media—could slide into gimmickry, yet is grounded in Elias’s sensory labor and paid for with genuine moral cost. Inevitable in hindsight: every acoustic detail foreshadows the suffocation frequency, so the twist feels discovered, not contrived. Specificity of the toast-negative image is memorable and could not swap into another story without collapsing the stakes.</comment>
