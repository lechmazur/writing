<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elian’s rolling gait, scarred face, and frantic hand-work embody the capsize trauma; the obsession with “translating silence” drives every beat. Interiority stays concrete—heat-maps as auroras, memory of freezing water—yet contradictory impulses (stoic mask vs. fluttering hands) appear only in description, not during the high-pressure rescue. The final act is credible endurance, but the cost is purely external (orchid saved); no internal path is foreclosed, keeping the score just below 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal chain is clean: cold spot threatens orchids → fork-rod intervention → thermal bloom restored. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the white flare of the orchid is a silent shout that reweights the premise—music now equals visible heat. Cost is visible—chest heaving, rod dulled—but the lens stays Causal throughout. A hairline slip: “memory of the freezing ocean wave” is told, not shown mid-act, barely holding it under 9.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The Winterglass Conservatory is rendered through prisms of temperature, not vistas; ice and glass constrain every move. Micro-setting rule satisfied: the tuning-fork case and visor’s heat-overlay function as extensions of the space, dictating tactics. Spatial choreography is flawless—pedestal, containment wall, root zone tracked in motion. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: infrared orchid-auroras matter more than visual décor.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—orchid survival—signaled in first third; escalation is single but decisive: thermal flicker → rod strike → white flare. Protagonist agency is absolute; no coincidence rescues. The tightening is physical, not emotional, so the felt cost is mild—hence 8.8 not 9+. Still, the price is visible on the page (latent hum lost, energy spent), satisfying the 8+ gate.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: endurance as silent music, life as heat against indifferent cold. No moralizing; the final white flare is the non-literal answer. Motifs (tuning case, capsize memory) recur with shifted meaning, charging closure. Ambiguity survives: is the triumph tiny against cosmic silence? Complexity intact, but breadth is narrow for 9.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is maritime-engineer-poet: “indelible muscle memory of a capsize survivor,” “glass belly of the conservatory.” Syntax lengthens and compresses with thermal surges—no template cadence. Diction stays within Elian’s plausible lexicon yet reaches for lyric height. Perceptual signature—heat as emotion—never slips; every metaphor is thermodynamic, never decorative.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm pulses like a conductor’s baton; sentence openings vary from participial to noun-clause without drift. Information density high—single sentences do triple duty (e.g., “He waved the rod like a baton, guiding the heat…”). One scaffold spotted: “the capsize had taught him…” repeats the lesson twice; minor, but keeps it under 9. No mixed metaphors, no filter-verb stacks.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The “silent world where pitch no longer travels” is a fresh speculative hook; merging it with antique tuning forks re-weaponized for heat is ingenious. Conceptual integrity absolute—every implication followed (no sound → heat as music). Risk taken: entire emotional arc carried by invisible temperature, yet clarity never falters. Transformative enough to feel inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
