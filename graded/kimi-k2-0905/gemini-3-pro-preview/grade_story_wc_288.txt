<comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses—grief for the Sun-Drinkers vs. the need to survive alone—are staged inside her body from the first gasp; the atomically reflective disc forces a micro-choice that visibly hardens resolve, paying the cost of forever witnessing rather than drowning. Interiority stays concrete (“the vibration started in her teeth”), never resorting to label-speak. The shift from passive vessel to sovereign witness is earned and irreversible.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the final image of Elara curating “the endless volumes of the sky” re-weights the rule-set—she is no graveyard but librarian/witness, a social role with perpetual cost. Causal linkage holds: every beat (rising tide, obsidian mirror, stone hum) tightens options until stance crystallizes. Orientation anchored by word 80; no lens ambiguity. The price is palpable in the last sentence.</comment>

<comment>The tidal library, brass sundial, and obsidian disc are not backdrop; they constrain movement (cloud-tide laps at steps), measure pressure (sundial hums), and force the decisive self-confrontation (mirror). Micro-setting (the terrace stones’ cold) acts as emotional barometer. Final image of rising white sea recharges opening vista with new meaning. Only the Sun-Drinker valleys remain slightly generic—keeps this from 9.0.</comment>

<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—will she stay drowned in past grief or forge autonomous self—signaled in paragraph 2. Single meaningful tightening: the obsidian refusal, which forecloses fusion with ghosts and forces stewardship. Cost is the lifelong burden of witness, legible in “she was their witness.” Pressure escalates under situational lens as atmospheric tide literally climbs the steps, mirroring internal rise to stance.</comment>

<grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme (memory as archive vs. prison) emerges through the library metaphor and culminates in the curator image—no moral stated. Subtext operates in gestures: stepping off the disc = self-shelving the past. The silence after extinction is re-cast from echo of loss to empty reading room awaiting cataloguing. Resonance is concrete, not abstract assertion.</comment>

<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Lyric third-person adheres tightly to Elara’s perceptual filter; diction (“brittle awakenings,” “atomically reflective”) is specific to her scholarly antiquarian mind. Rhythm swells with the tide, sentences lengthen then contract as vibration peaks. No dialogue, so voice purity remains intact; free indirect modulation cleanly tracks emotional crescendo.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is scaffold-free, high-density: “silk sheets pooling” does setting + tactile grounding + emotional vulnerability in five words. Metaphors are coherent—clouds as ocean, silence as unread book. No filter-verb stacks; strong verbs (“lapping,” “rattled”) propel. Final sentence cadence mirrors inhalation of new air, satisfying ear-test.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: reincarnation grief + atmospheric library + quantum mirror = new emotional physics. Sun-Drinkers avoid dragon cliché by remaining offstage myths; focus on archivist aftermath is novel angle. Conceptual risk (time measured by mist depth) paid off by integrating into climax as literal rising tide. Only half-point deduction for faint scent of “memory palace” trope inherited from genre.</comment>
