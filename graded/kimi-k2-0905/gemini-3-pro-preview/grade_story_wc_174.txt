<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Silas’s serenity is shown through precise physical control—smoothing cuffs, steady hand on the stick—so the trait feels embodied rather than labelled. The interior contradiction is lightly sketched; we see discipline but not the psychic cost of that poise under accusation. His micro-choice to freeze the puppet sword is the single visible hinge where motive becomes action, and it lands cleanly. Still, we get no glimpse of what he risks or forfeits, so the “earned” bar is only half met.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The piece teaches its backwards-run pattern early and lands a Conceptual Repricing closure: the undoing of the tragedy reweights the audience’s (and reader’s) moral calculus. Causality is lyric-accumulative rather than tight because/therefore, but the lens holds. Cost is felt in the hush itself—an echo of violence that never happened—though the price to Silas remains implicit. The Orientation Test is passed inside 120 words; spatial anchors (acoustic tiles, swinging bulb) are crisp and continuous.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The radar dome is not postcard backdrop; its acoustic tiles swallow the drunkard’s shout and later amplify the scratch of retreating puppets, so the environment literally shapes the audience’s perception. The swinging bulb acts as a micro-setting clock, slowing to stasis at closure. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: Silas notices silk, velvet, ink metaphors—calligrapher’s vocabulary. One minor slip: “concrete floor” appears only at the end, risking a spatial hiccup, but the prior tile image keeps the dome image coherent.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—moral culability of narrative itself—is signaled in the opening shout. Escalation is a single deepening: the rewind that forces the crowd to confront bypassed choices. Agency is Silas’s interruption of the puppet strike; cost is the communal recognition of preventable error. Because the lens is accumulative, the tightening is tonal density rather than narrowing options; the price is conceptual, felt in the shared hush.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the backwards motion itself: stories are not fate but accumulations of reversible choices. Subtext lives in the puppets’ wooden eyes that “un-cry”—a visceral image that avoids thesis-speak. The final image refuses moralizing; it leaves the puppets innocent and the audience holding the guilt. No character articulates “the moral,” so the emergent question lingers as charged ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is calligrapher-precise: ink-sucked-into-nib metaphor extends across syntax, each clause a controlled stroke. Perceptual signature is decisive—“high-grade ink,” “velvet folds,” “manicured fingers”—all diction filtered through Silas’s profession. Rhythm modulates: long sentences during the rewind mimic the unspooling, then collapse into static final fragments. No head-hopping; the dome audience remains externally observed. Experimental backwards pacing is taught early and paid off without clarity loss.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Line-level craft is high-density: “meteor hush” compresses cosmic and acoustic scales in two syllables. No synonym loops or scaffold; each metaphor extends the ink/parchment palette. The single filter-verb cluster (“began to reverse”) is grammatically justified by the continuous aspect of undoing. Final paragraph slows with paragraph-length sentences that breathe toward stillness, earning the cadence shift. Only hairline slip: “painted eyes of the wooden actors” is minor reuse within one sentence, but it echoes the puppet trope acceptably.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The puppet-rewind as moral intervention feels fresh; the radar dome repurposed as ethics theater is specific enough to resist swap-test. The backwards-narrative trick is grounded in Silas’s calligrapher identity, transforming a gimmick into character logic. Risk is taken—non-linear undoing in <800 words—yet coherence remains. Minor proximity to “rewind theater” tropes exists, but the acoustic dome and stick-conductor angle supply new inflection.</comment>
