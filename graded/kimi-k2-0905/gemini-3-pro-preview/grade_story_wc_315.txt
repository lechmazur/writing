<comment>Kael’s embodied panic-to-precise calm under pressure is sharply rendered; interior contradiction (“terror” vs “monk-like calm”) drives the scene. His choice to swap buckles without letting Lyra see the danger crystallizes his protective flaw and the price of trust. The micro-choice hierarchy (her life > his gear > his own exposure) is legible and costly. Slight over-reliance on abstract “weight” metaphors keeps it just shy of 9.</comment>

<comment>Causal lens holds: micro-fracture discovery → buckle swap → silent countdown → visual confirmation. Closure lands as Charged Poise—the white silk bloom reweights the premise, making the cost of his vigil indelible. Orientation anchors (who/when/where) arrive by line 3; no disorientation penalty. The beat sequence is tight, every action narrows options, and the final image is the Decisive Change with felt cost.</comment>

<comment>The nocturnal arbor is not backdrop: the glass leaves, frost, and star-dusted void physically constrain visibility, sound, and time. Titanium clip, ivy controls, and G-force rules all shape the fix. Setting is taught through Kael’s pattern-seeking perception, never inventory. Closure is charged by the moonlit parachute against that void—environment re-weights meaning.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake: Lyra’s survival under absolute time pressure (radio-window). Tightening occurs the instant the fracture is felt—options collapse to one improvised fix. Cost is visceral: Kael’s own retention gear is sacrificed, his future risk amplified. Escalation is causal and single-cycle, appropriate to 760-word scope.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges silently: guardianship as asymmetrical weight—the watcher must grow heavy so the watched stays light. Subtext lives in gesture (shielding her view) and object (his buckle now bears her life). Final image reconfigures: the falling petal is both fragility and successful burden-transfer. No moralizing; resonance is imagistic.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited clings to Kael’s fingertips; diction is tactile, metallic, frost-laced. Rhythm accelerates with clause-stacked urgency during the swap, then exhales into monosyllabic countdown. No head-hop; perceptual signature (“midnight pattern seeker”) colors every observation. Compression (“He did not dare look…”) teaches the elision pattern early and pays it off under peak stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Near-flawless line economy: every sentence advances gear, body, or atmosphere. No loops, no filler filters, no mixed metaphors. “Silence so profound it felt heavy” risks cliché but is earned by subsequent physicalization. Only minor scaffold: “a flaw that would shear…” is slightly explanatory; keeps it sub-9.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Familiar trope—last-minute gear fix—made fresh by zero-G arbor setting and tactile silence. Synthesis of wind-shear cartography with emotional cartography (trust mapping) feels particular. Risk taken: no dialogue, all pressure through touch and silence; succeeds. Not radically novel, but specificity and compressed lyricism elevate beyond template.</comment>
