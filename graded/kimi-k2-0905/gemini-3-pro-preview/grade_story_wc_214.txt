<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her fingertip tracing the meteor’s path while pressing the glass to her eye is a micro-choice that fuses tool, body, and metaphysics. The contradiction between her cosmic-janitor insignificance and her private priesthood is kept alive in every beat; even the mop becomes a reliquary. Yet the “spiritual curiosity” trait is named once rather than revealed through further complicating action, and the final stance, while earned, lacks a second beat that would expose a fresh flaw or cost beyond the single epiphany. Still, the arc of fragility-to-radiance is credible and individual.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens is taught early—each meteor is a textural pulse that layers density until the final flare reconfigures meaning. Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the station’s silence becomes “a flourishing stillness,” reweighting the premise that stillness = emptiness. Cost is legible in the final line—“the willingness to burn” is now an internalized constraint that will shape every future sweep. No orientation debt; spatial and temporal anchors are clear within the first 60 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The orbital outpost is rendered through Elara’s janitor-eye: she notices dust on sensor arrays, the obsidian viewport’s smudges, the low hum that “purrs.” The yellow lantern glass functions as micro-setting—its amber filter literally recolors the galaxy and constrains her perception during the climax. Sensory economy is strict: only touch (cold pane, warm shard) and sight (clinical blue → amber bloom) are needed; sound is the slept-panther hum that modulates tension. No credibility breaks; vacuum physics respected.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake is legible by line three: can insignificance become radiance? Pressure tightens texturally—each meteor is a rehearsal for her own eventual surrender. The climax is the moment she chooses to “burn” symbolically; the cost is the irrevocable internal shift that forecloses forever the option of seeing dust as merely filth. One meaningful escalation suffices under Accumulative lens; no reversals required.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the repeating meteor-to-self equation: “fragility was the precursor to radiance.” The lantern glass’s color shift literalizes the conceptual repricing—emptiness re-valued as plenitude—without any narrator commentary. Final image (“willingness to burn”) offers a non-literal answer to the central question; no moral is stated, only exemplified. Ambiguity remains: we do not know if she will ever act externally on this insight, but the internal cost is paid.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is dense, languid, priestly—long vowel cascades (“velvet void,” “primal elegance”) that mirror the slow-motion meteor. Psychic distance stays tight; no filter-verb stacks; metaphors are consistent (panther hum, lantern glass as retina). Diction slightly exceeds a janitor’s lexicon, but the lyric register is motivated by her self-taught mysticism and is internally consistent. No dialogue, so no convergence risk.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Line-level craft is high: information-dense sentences (“she considered herself a custodian of mysteries” does triple duty—job, identity, metaphysics). Rhythm modulates—long breathless clauses build to the flare, then short sentences for disintegration. Only minor scaffold: “the light faded, leaving the darkness to rush back in” is a near-paraphrase of the prior sentence; one −0.2 loop does not touch closure. Metaphors stay coherent (no mixed vehicles); no register drift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The cosmic-janitor who baptizes meteors with a pre-electric artifact is a fresh angle; trope of stargazer is inverted into floor-sweeper mystic. The yellow glass’s amber filter repurposes a nostalgia object into a scientific instrument, a synthesis that feels inevitable after the fact. Risk is taken: 750-word lyric meditation with no external plot, but coherence holds. Could drop 0.3 if the spiritual-curiosity label were dramatized more uniquely, but the core is non-obvious and memorable.</comment>
