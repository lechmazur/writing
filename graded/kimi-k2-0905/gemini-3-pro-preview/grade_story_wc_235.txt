<question>1</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>The lone narrator’s jealousy-driven memory-dive is viscerally embodied (“tears at my throat with wolfish teeth”), and the micro-choice to write on birch bark anchors the closing beat; still, the inner contradiction between envy and creative duty could be sharpened earlier to charge every beat.</comment>

<question>2</question>
<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Ambiguous-lens (Accumulative/Textural) is taught by the scroll-to-dream-to-scroll loop; the Charged Poise lands on-page as the charcoal “scratches” the dream into contested existence—cost felt, timeline still broken. Orientation is secure inside the cabin by ~100 words; causality holds under dream-logic rules.</comment>

<question>3</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Scroll and charcoal function as micro-setting that constrains the final act; mountain cabin supplies cold, wind, timber to counterpose the dream-heat. Ozone tang / purple sun are vivid yet filtered through jaded dream-architect perception, never tourist catalogue.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“prove aliveness by capturing flight”—tightens once when dream collapses back to cabin; price is the returned wet-blanket confusion. Escalation is single-wave (soar → fall) rather than iterative, but the re-weighting of the scroll is legible and felt.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme of time-rupture and authorship as resistance emerges from iterated images (scroll, grave, charcoal) rather than assertion. Final image re-prices the act of writing as the only linearity left—an oblique, earned answer.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>First-person voice owns a perceptual signature: “jaded wonder,” “slurry of disjointed moments,” charcoal darker than shadows. Rhythm modulates between long dream-glides and staccato cabin beats; no head-hop or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>High density—every sentence advances stakes, texture, or image; no scaffold loops or synonym churn. Metaphors stay internally coherent; only minor overpacking (“velvet texture of the mind”) keeps it from 9+.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Grave-dated-two-years-past + jealous time-travel via envy is a fresh synthesis; the lucid-dream-as-archive trope is owned through “historian of the impossible” diction and scroll artifact. Risk heightens stakes without obscuring closure.</comment>
