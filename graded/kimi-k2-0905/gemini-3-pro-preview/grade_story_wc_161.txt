<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elian’s contradictory impulses—hoarding secrecy yet craving the song’s release—are alive in scene; the moment he chooses shared risk with the woman, his hand trembles over the meteorite, foreclosing solitude. Micro-choices (fabricated backstory abandoned, dust-mote ritual performed under observation) carry visible cost. The woman’s pressure is secondary but sufficient to tilt his hierarchy; no diagnostic labels, only embodied contradiction. The only keep from 9 is that her interiority is absent, so the relationship crucible is felt only from his side.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the bird’s upward arc reconfigures both solitude and secrecy into fragile shared hope, cost felt in the simultaneous bloom/decay of “blooming withering.” Causal lens holds: because she followed paper receipts, therefore trust is risked; because attic air swirls, therefore capsule is balanced; because meteorite needs altitude, therefore silence is released. Single scene, one transition (trapdoor entry), orientation clear by word 80. No off-stage resolution; final image crystallizes stakes without exposition. Minor keep from 9: the woman’s off-page navigation of receipts is recounted, not dramatized, a hairline causality scuff.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Attic as micro-setting constrains every beat: updraft through skylight dictates capsule engineering; dust motes become barometer; book-ladders determine spatial choreography. Sensory hierarchy obeys Elian’s pigeon-trained ear—coo overrides creak, mold over perfume. Tool-integration: aluminum capsule and meteorite density hinge on attic’s fickle draft. No static catalogue; every detail either enables or threatens flight. Final image of lofted bird recharges attic’s vertical axis, making the setting indispensable to closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake: preserve alien song vs. preserve self-erasure. Escalation is single but decisive: woman’s arrival narrows option from perfect anonymity to shared risk. Cost is legible—he relinquishes absolute control of launch to her witness. Under causal lens, because secrecy is pierced, therefore silence must be converted into shared listening; no coincidence, no reversal inflation. Enough for high band, but not 9 because the external antagonistic pressure (authorities? time?) stays hypothetical; only internal/social cost is dramatized.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of “blooming withering” emerges through particulate imagery: dust motes as pollen of decay, meteorite as seed of dead planet, solitude split open to admit fragile trust. No explicit thesis; final reprise of scent and rising air reweights opening paradox into hopeful cadence. Subtext carries in gesture—she points instead of naming; he answers with flight instead of confession. Avoids tidy moral; resonance lingers in unheard alien melody. Dock sliver for early abstract label “blooming withering” before image teaches it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person close sustains Elian’s perceptual signature: pigeon-coo lexicon, naval precision in balance ritual, synesthetic scent vocabulary. No head-hop; woman observed only externally, matching his guarded stance. Rhythm compresses under launch countdown: parataxis mirrors pulse. Figurative layering (“scent of blooming withering”) taught early and paid off in final breath. Clean quote-free dialogue carries subtext. Minor keep from 9: one register lift—“conceptual cost of conceptual repricing” voice drifts toward editorial diction in closing clause.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High information density: one sentence can launch bird, reveal meteorite origin, and tilt trust. No loops; no synonym churn. Metaphors stay coherent—dust = pollen, attic = nest, bird = stylus. Scaffolding excised; no filler gestures. Read-aloud rhythm: varied sentence openings, paragraph breaths match emotional fall/rise. Proofing clean. Final line reprises opening scent, achieving circular cadence without redundancy. One hairline mixed metaphor—“jagged fragment…colder than room” is physically impossible yet poetically licensed; does not dull closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: Martian phonograph via pigeon courier is conceptually bold yet grounded in 19th-century amateur science vibe. Risk—lyric accumulation instead of plot pyrotechnics—heightens intimacy and pays off in resonant final image. Tropes transformed: “anonymous recluse” becomes song-keeper; “woman with receipts” becomes co-listener rather than expositional detective. Specificity of aluminum capsule machined for hen aerodynamics feels non-obvious yet inevitable. Emotional specificity avoids quirky-for-its-own-sake ornament. Closure would collapse if any element swapped; vision is integral.</comment>
