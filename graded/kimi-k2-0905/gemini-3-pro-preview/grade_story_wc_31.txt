<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Interiority is rich and embodied—grief is shown through brass weights, the act of turning his back on the lanterns, the weeping indistinguishable from seawater. One contradiction pulses throughout: he claims “simply retrieving lost property” while actually hunting the color of her vow; this self-deception is dramatized, not asserted. The micro-choice to lift jar 707 after the key click is a hierarchy-revealing beat: precedence of memory over surface duty. Closure cost is present—he will still light the pier, but dawn no longer annihilates him—yet the renunciation is more quiet than wrenching, keeping it below the top band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the violet sunrise of her vow rewires his capacity to face daylight. The causal chain is tight—key tag → cabinet → jar → color → tears → stance shift—each step contingent, no shortcuts. Accumulation lens holds; the density of drowned promises charges the final image. Cost is legible in the line “he would no longer fear the silence,” a conceptual repricing that makes the before/after legible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The sunken library is not backdrop but tool: the anaerobic gloom preserves the jarred vows, directly enabling the color reveal. Spatial choreography is clean—weights, silt deck, double doors, brass vibration in teeth—each detail filters through Silas’s professional attentiveness. The sky lanterns above contrast the depths, recharging when their glow refracts in the water around the opened jar. Micro-setting (brass key tag) literally unlocks the stakes, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“to discover the color of sound”—is signaled in paragraph four and never diluted. Pressure tightens once: the key click vibrates his teeth, foreclosing retreat; refusal would leave the violet unknown. No external antagonist is needed; the archive itself exerts passive resistance. Cost is present but internal (acceptance of dawn), slightly below the visible-price threshold for 8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the equation of sound = color = memory = dawn; no character lectures us on “the nature of promises.” The violet sunrise image reweights earlier lantern imagery without moralizing. Subtext operates in the act of extinguishing surface light to find deeper illumination. Complexity lingers: the promise was kept, yet decades were still lost; no tidy maxim is offered.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays welded to Silas’s perceptual filter—brass weight on belt, meteor hush in bones, violet blooming in water. Syntax lengthens underwater, mirroring slowed motion; shorter clauses surface as he ascends. No head-hop. Word choice—“curated the boundary,” “luminous vows”—elevates without drifting into purple because it aligns with his occupational reverence. Voice modulation under pressure is precise: the hum bypasses ears and “resonated directly in his bones,” a sensory signature unattributable to any other character.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Rhythm breathes with ascent/descent; paragraph lengths visually echo surfacing. Figurative control is disciplined—no mixed metaphors, no filter-verb clusters. One scaffold trace: “he told himself he was simply retrieving lost property” is paraphrased twice, but each recurrence gains ironic weight, so loop is purposeful. Density is high; single sentences fuse action, tool, and atmosphere—“He adjusted the brass weights on his belt and stepped off the edge, plunging into the cold embrace of the harbor.”</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The luminous-vow archive is a fresh conceptual engine; drowned promises bottled as bioluminescent cargo feels inevitable yet unheard-of. Tropes (lost love, sunken ship) are inverted through the color-of-sound payoff. Risk—letting the climax hinge on an abstract chromatic reveal—pays off because the violet sunrise reconfigures both memory and future. Specificity of the 707 key tag prevents generic substitution; its brass teeth-vibration is unique to this world.</comment>
