<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Eleanor’s interiority is sharp—her “orbit of regret” metaphor anchors every move—but the moment she pivots from defensive daughter to logician-avenger feels slightly too frictionless; no visible tremor of doubt undercuts the triumph. The rosewood pen is handled twice, yet its second appearance is ceremonial rather than revealing a new layer of her. Still, her value hierarchy (truth > reputation) is legible in micro-choice and the final phone call carries a crisp cost: the story she saves is the one that erases her father’s suspected guilt. The missing hairline flaw is an embodied contradiction at the climax—she never lets us see the pulse quicken or hand shake while she “does the math.”</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal chain is immaculate: assumption → ledger contradiction → narrative collapse → phone coup. Closure lands as Charged Poise—the clouds still drift, but the regret-orbit has been forcibly re-calc’d—cost is the permanent recalibration of her father’s legacy in her own eyes. One minor drag: the “timeframe after journalist calls” is announced rather than felt as a lived countdown; we never hear a second tick. Orientation is clean by line 5; no caps triggered.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Observatory above clouds is more than postcard: the glass walls refract her isolation and the indigo ink literally mirrors the sky, bonding setting to tool. Spatial choreography is pristine—her walk from precipice to chart table to phone is tracked without a single floating prop. Micro-setting triumph: the cedar-iron scent of the pen roots us inside her father’s ghost. Weather stays atmospheric rather than tactical—no gust slams the dome to raise stakes—so it never quite constrains choice, capping entry to 9-band.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—protect truth about father—signals on first page and tightens when Sterling threatens morning print. Escalation is intellectual rather than physical: each ledger fact narrows Sterling’s room to maneuver and widens Eleanor’s. Visible price is the moral repositioning she must perform—her father becomes publicly altruistic yet privately secret, forcing her to embrace opacity as the lesser evil. No second reversal needed; the single deepening is sufficient under causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</comment><comment>Theme emerges cleanly: truth is orbital—periodic, calculable, and alterable if you apply enough vectored force. Subtext lives in the pen: writing as engineered trajectory, not sentiment. Final image of clouds “shifting below” reweights the opening vista—she has literally moved the sky of public narrative. Avoids sermon, but the metaphor is so foregrounded it borders on thesis-statement; half-step off the 9-line.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Voice is cerebral yet visceral—“voice like tearing paper,” “solemn playfulness of logic”—sustained diction stays within lexicon of mathematically inclined heiress. Perceptual signature is stellar: she sees cumulus as “solid floor,” hears pen scratch as echo against dome. Rhythm modulates—long Latinate clauses for contemplation, staccato proof steps for attack. No dialogue contamination; phone lines carry subtextual power shift without voice bleed.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sentence economy is excellent; almost every line both paints and advances. Only micro-loop: “the silence here was usually absolute, a sanctuary for thought, but today it had been shattered…” restates the same binary. Indigo-ink-as-sky reflection is fresh; no mixed metaphor. No filter-verb stacks, no scaffold. Final line “sending the regret spinning away into the dark” is crisp, propulsive, earns its lyric leap.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: investigative thriller meets Euclidean proof, staged in an above-cloud observatory—specific enough to feel inevitable. “Orbits of regret” converts abstract guilt into navigational math; risk pays off without gimmickry. Pen-as-weapon twist on Chekhov’s gun is subtle yet causal. Deduction for near-allegorical neatness: the ledger morality feels engineered for the proof rather than discovered in messy archives.</comment>
