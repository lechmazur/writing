<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is sensorially concrete and contradictory—she both fears and craves dissolution. The “aesthetically driven” motive is shown through her tactile engagement with shadow rather than told. No secondary character appears, so relationship bullets are waived. The final Earned Stasis—she stands alone inside the sky she has internalized—pays the visible cost of forever severing her from ordinary perception.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each new sensory layer (cloud, quartz hum, shadow ink) tightens the stakes of perception. Orientation is anchored by word 55 (“Elara stood alone…”) and again spatially at the frozen lake/ colonnade. Closure is a Charged Poise: the sky has been poured into the atrium and she is both vessel and trespasser; the conceptual cost is undeniable. One micro-turn—touching the shadow—escalates density rather than causal plot, fitting the lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Environment (cobalt atrium/frozen lake) and tool (quartz colonnade) literally constrain every move: stepping into shadow projection is the forbidden act. Micro-setting (her body as conduit) charges the final image. Sensory hierarchy obeys POV bias—she notices vibration frequency, cloud shade, ink-like shadow—never tourist catalog. Spatial choreography is flawless: we track her distance from pillars, the lake beyond glass, the precise patch of floor where sky and stone blur.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can she survive merging with the sky-poem—signaled in paragraph 1. Escalation is density-driven: each quartz vibration raises the physiological cost (teeth rattle, hair lifts) until the final certainty anchors her. No reversals are needed under Accumulative lens; the tightening is the thickening of sky into marrow. Cost is visceral and legible: she forfeits separateness, “could no longer tell where her skin ended and the twilight began.”</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the concrete act of trespass: sacred separation is exposed as illusion. No moral is stated; the final image of the atrium-as-vessel reweights all prior “heresy” language. Subtext lives in gesture—shadows wrap her “like affectionate cats,” converting fear into intimacy. The emotional aftereffect is awe rather than triumph, earned by the physiological price she pays.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Third-person POV remains tight internal, never slipping. Perceptual signature is unmistakable: cloud-shadow poet who parses sky as text, feels cumulus “cold, wet, and diffuse” through floor ink. Rhythm escalates from long, reverberative sentences to fragmentary pulses that mimic quartz frequency. No dialogue; therefore dialogue bullets waived. Diction stays within her plausible lexicon—she would know “cumulus,” “resonant frequency,” “heretical.”</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm is deliberate: cadence swells then fractures to mirror quartz lock-in. Metaphors are internally coherent—sky as spilled ink, atrium as vessel—and never mixed. One minor scaffold: “she began to paraphrase / She took the overwhelming…” is a two-sentence paraphrase loop; −0.2. Otherwise density is high; every sentence layers sensation, stakes, or world rule. No artifact touches the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Premise—cloud-shadow poet forbidden to step into sky-cast verses—is non-obvious and fully committed to. Risk of lyric overdrive is embraced but controlled by embodied cost. Transformation test fails if names/places swapped: the crystalline quartz colonnade, frozen lake, and cobalt glass are irreplaceable. Specific detail (lantern-moth hush, quartz teeth-rattle) prevents generic fantasy pastiche. The final image reconfigures the reader’s own sense of indoor versus outdoor—conceptual repricing that lingers.</comment>
