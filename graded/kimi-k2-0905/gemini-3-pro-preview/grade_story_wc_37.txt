<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara’s memory-shattered interiority is vivid—her mind literally frays under the loom-work, a lived cost. The single POV stays anchored in her body (burnt palms, heaving chest) and her final collapse is a credible renunciation. No contradictory impulses are staged in scene, only narrated, so the micro-turn feels one-note; still, the chord is consistent and the price is felt.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens: because she is the last weaver, therefore she sings, therefore the sap rises, therefore the sun is loomed and finally flung. The swaddle→thrust sequence is the decisive change with unmistakable cost: her palms blister, her memories “burn through.” Closure lands on the image of the lattice sky—an earned, irreversible reconfiguration of the world rule-set.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The orchard-body-window triad is spatially coherent and constrains every beat: only the mica pane allows egress; only the silver trees bleed photonic filament; only her scorched hands can shuttle. Sensory economy is biased to metallic tastes and ozone, mirroring the alchemical premise. The final image—“lattice of burning gold and violet”—recharges the micro-setting of her upturned face, passing the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—rekindle a dead realm—is signaled in paragraph one and tightened once: the wild light must be swaddled or it will incinerate the orchard. Escalation is causal: each harmonic stanza raises physical cost (heat, sap, palm-blister) until the single option is forced—thrust the bundle through the pane. Price is visible but not persistent beyond the burnt hands; still, the tightening suffices for this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the paradox of binding to free: dawn must be swaddled in shadow-root before it can burn. No explicit moral is stated; the final image of the lattice sky reweights the earlier “obsidian” frame. Subtext is carried in gesture—her scream matches song’s crescendo, a surrender to artifactual motherhood. Complexity is honored: the new day is artificial, survival bought with her remaining sanity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is lyric-cosmic, compressing chemistry and cosmology into a single perceptual signature—“copper and ozone,” “sap spun into golden filaments.” Syntax swells and contracts with loom-rhythm; fragments like “weightless things” read as taught pattern, not error. No dialogue, so no convergence risk. Under peak stress the diction shortens—“she screamed”—a clean release that holds the choral cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm is controlled: long anaphoric clauses mimic shuttle-motion, then a staccato thrust line—“she thrust the burning package.” No synonym loops or mixed metaphors; vehicles stay optical/textile. Minor scaffold in “glowing filaments...glowing core” but the repetition is purposeful thermal echo. Closure line—“some things, once woven, could never be undone”—lands clean, no artifact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fuses solar weaving with memory-librarian in a non-obvious synthesis; the loom becomes both star-forge and psychic archive. “Woven dawns” risks prettiness but is grounded in metallurgical detail—mica pane, silver sap, shadow-root cloth—so the concept stays material. Final reconfiguration feels inevitable: the artificial sun is literally textile, not metaphor. Risk is embraced; no fallback to generic fantasy engine.</comment>
