<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Bel-ibni’s interiority is razor-sharp; his obsessive thrift is shown through the chalk nub saved three years and the torch-snuffing march, not labeled. The contradiction between lifelong empiricism and last-minute metaphysical gamble is dramatized in the chalk diagrams and the nod that costs him a heartbeat. The final renunciation—extinguishing the last candle—caps his arc with visible cost: personal darkness accepted to hide cosmic light.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a pristine Charged Poise: the covenant is sealed, knowledge hidden forever, and the cost is the astronomer’s lifelong light. Causal chain holds—each torch snuffed, each chalk line drawn, leads to the stasis of lights above the tile. The lens is Accumulative/Textural: density of oil saved, stars mapped, and diagrams hum until pattern crystallizes in the final dark. The price is legible in the last breath of ozone and the absolute black he chooses.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The reimagined palace is evoked through tactile specifics—blue-glazed brick, silver-dust obsidian, brass gears—filtered by Bel-ibni’s miserly eye. Micro-setting dominates: the chalk stub, the conserved oil, the tile’s heft constrain every move. Spatial choreography is clean; torch, chalk, tile, candle are tracked without drift. The observatory itself becomes the tool that births the rift, charging the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve knowledge from iconoclasts—is signaled in paragraph three and tightens with each torch snuffed. The single deepening occurs when empirical data forces him into mystic ritual; the price is the oil he hoarded and the light he surrenders. No reversals are needed; pressure accumulates until the only option is to hide truth in ether. The cost is palpable: eternal personal darkness traded for eternal communal memory.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme—knowledge needs secrecy more than spectacle—emerges from the friction between data and faith, never stated. The magic square, chalk diagrams, and final blackout form a mute triptych that reweights “waste” as sacrificial generosity. Subtext hums in the silence after the nod: what survives is what frugality protected. The reader is left to feel that rationalism and mysticism are opposite faces of the same austerity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person POV stays locked to Bel-ibni’s perceptual filter: verbs like “navigated,” “extinguishing,” “retrieved” mirror his ledger-like mind. Syntax tightens under pressure—clauses shorten as diagrams hum—then relaxes into long sentences for the cosmic reveal. Lexicon is era-appropriate yet precise: “azimuth,” “cuneiform,” “obsidian” without pedantry. No head-hop, no filter clutter; voice is the character.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose carries dense information without scaffold: “extinguishing every second torch he passed to conserve the sacred oil” does setting, motive, and world-rule in one sweep. Rhythm modulates—compressed clauses during chalk-work, open cadences for cosmic aperture—never monotonous. Metaphors are spare and physical: “reality…peeled back like a layer of old parchment” fits the parchment-era frame. Zero loops, zero synonym churn, zero overwriting in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of frugal astronomer + magic square as data-backup device is genuinely fresh. The “encrypted devotion” concept flips genre expectation: science is the hidden scripture. Risky compression—entire regime change off-stage—pays off by keeping lens on one man’s ledger of light. The final nod is a quiet revolution against conquerors who will never know what they can’t burn.</comment>
