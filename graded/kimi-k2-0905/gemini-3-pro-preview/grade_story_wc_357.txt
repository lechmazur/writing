<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Elara’s drive to cure the blight is clear and personal, but her interiority stays largely functional—"intrepid orchard pilot" is declared, not dramatized. The moment she grips the arrow tip shows a micro-choice with cost, yet we get no contradictory impulse or visible flaw that would complicate the decision. Competence is foregrounded; genuine struggle or internal contradiction is muted, keeping the arc competent rather than revelatory.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: Flux anomaly → water ribbons → Echo amphitheatre → arrow twist → broadcast song. Closure is a Decisive Change with felt cost: the sapling erupts, gravity re-rights, Elara falls with the returning water—an image that pays for the discovery. Orientation anchors within 120 words; the lens stays situational-pressure throughout. One minor soft spot: the off-page "hour" limit is declared, not tracked on the clock, but the beat still lands.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setting detail is selective and sensory: rusted skiff, metallic air, roots groping upward. The floating rock arches and reverse waterfalls are not backdrop—they steer every tactical move and finally cradle the sapling. Environment literally inverts to create the climax; removing the amphitheater would collapse the closure image. Meets 9+ gate: setting constrains tactics and charges final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—save the groves—threads every beat. The inversion window tightens options: only pilots who fly during Flux can reach the Echoes. Escalation is single but meaningful: aligning the arrow broadcasts the life-song downward, trading her immediate safety for planetary recovery. Cost is visible in the sudden tree burst and her plummet back into normal gravity.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme of "silence as blight / resonance as life" emerges through the arrow tip and the Gathering of Echoes without overt statement. Final image of falling with the song re-weights earlier material conceptually. No moral is declared; ambiguity lingers—will the song reach everywhere or just the valley? Slight abstraction in "silence = blight" keeps it shy of 8.5.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Elara’s instrument panel, boots, blood-thrum—distinct perceptual signature. Syntax flexes with pressure: short, staccato clauses during inversion; longer liquid lines when riding the water ribbon. No head-hopping; diction stays within a working pilot’s idiom. Register elevates only in "conceptual repricing" moment, justified by awe.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic; imagery ("shattered emerald," "whirling silence") is vivid yet never clots the action. No scaffold loops; every sentence advances skiff, body, or world rule. A single mixed metaphor—"unspooling upward in shimmering, cohesive ribbons"—barely grazes clarity. Closure beat is clean, propulsive, and image-driven.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Combines agrarian orchard tropes with inverted-gravity physics and acoustic botany—fresh synthesis. The broken arrow as sonic tuning fork is a non-obvious pivot that feels inevitable once revealed. Risk-taking (flying during gravity flip, navigating by upward water) is integral, not gimmick. One point off for proximity to familiar "pilot dives anomaly to save world" scaffold; still, specificity of execution lifts it near 9.0.</comment>
