<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Silas’s ambient detachment is vivid and consistent; his yarn-needle micro-gestures externalize an interior need without psychobabble. The passenger’s shift from palimpsest guilt to “simply loved well” is earned by the visible unweaving, not an unearned epiphany. Only flaw: the woman’s pre-unraveling interiority is summarized, not embodied, so we feel the weight loss more than the weight. Still, the single-scene crucible and Silas’s calm renunciation of further waiting give a credible Earned Stasis.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lens: Accumulative/Textural—density of fog, drip cadence, and yarn-needle picking intensify until silence releases. Causality is poetic but legible: because the gutters tick, therefore wait; because the ticking stops, therefore cross. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the invisible bridge accepted at the exact moment the last drop falls, cost felt in the final white void. Orientation is swift (who, where, when by line 3); no seams break the lyric pattern.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The toll-house gutter becomes a micro-setting that literally times the scene; fog density shapes the choice to stay or cross. Obsidian carriage and bone needle are tactile, weight-bearing objects, not scenery. Sensory hierarchy stays inside Silas’s ambient skin—he feels air displacement before seeing anything. Only minus: riverbank mud is generic; a sharper sensory hook there would hit 9+.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake: will the soul reach the bridge before the gutter silence ends? Escalation is the slow drip-to-silence cadence that narrows grace; no louder threat is needed. Protagonist agency is the deliberate unweaving that lightens the carriage—without it, the bridge would remain impassable. Cost is the silence itself: once the last drop falls, the option to wait (and perhaps to refuse passage) is forever foreclosed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from action: truth is not a record but a filtration—complexity drips away until only essence remains. The palimpsest image migrates from metaphor to procedure, reweighted when the last layer hits the mud. No moral is stated; the final glow is an image, not a lesson. Ambiguity lingers: we never learn what the original promise was, only that survival is enough.</comment>

<comment>Third-person lyric stays inside Silas’s ambient sensorium without head-hopping; syntax lengthens and relaxes to mimic mist, then tightens at the gutter silence. Diction—“spindrift serenity,” “palimpsest promise”—is elevated but consistent with a mythic after-life dialect. No filter-verb stacks; perception is direct (“he felt the passenger”). Rhythm modulates with the drip cadence, teaching the reader to listen for silence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>High information density: each sentence layers stakes, texture, or sensory cue without scaffolding. Figurative language is sparse and coherent—yarn needle as stylus of fate, gutters as metronome—no mixed metaphors. Only micro-loop: “heavy…heavy” in adjacent clauses when describing the trunk; a 0.1 ding. Final line white-void image is crisp, uncluttered, earns its transcendence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>After-life ferryman trope is refreshed by ambient-sense driver who unknits rather than rows. Yarn-needle tool flips expectation: not weapon or钥匙, but surgical unpicker of narrative layers. Timeframe rule (“until gutters stop”) invents a clock both diegetic and poetic. Risk: lyric stillness could sag, yet pressure holds via drip cadence; the synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
