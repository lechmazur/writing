<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s “diligently curious” trait is never a label; it drives every micro-choice (leaning over the rail, kneeling in dust, aligning page to floor). Interiority stays concrete—wind-chapped cheeks, ink-stained cuffs—without stock phrasing. The final stance crystallization—private audience with the universe—pays the cost of permanent solitude. No contradiction under pressure; only the missing on-page flaw (no genuine mistake) keeps her short of 9.0.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the hovering sphere reconfigures meaning and stakes, the cost is the instant dissolution of the light she can never recapture. Lens is Accumulative/Textural—density and pattern (dog-ear, hopscotch, birds) tighten until the anomaly manifests. Every beat obeys because/therefore: folds lead to grid, grid to vibration, vibration to sphere. Causal chain remains legible, final image carries unmistakable conceptual price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Airship timbers, magnetic anomaly, and the cedar-scented nursery constrain tactics (where she kneels, how light manifests). The dog-eared page acts as micro-setting that literally slots into the floor, altering her next move. Sensory filter stays tight—copper groan, viscous air—never catalog. Final sphere is charged by its first physical anchor inside the ship, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—chart the unchartable—tightens when the murmuration cues magnetic anomaly and the hopscotch grid becomes the only path to light. Single deepening suffices: from speculative hunt to literal sphere in her face. Cost is instantaneous loss of the phenomenon once starlings break tension, foreclosing replication. Agency remains hers throughout; coincidence complicates but does not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of “sociable isolation” emerges solely through image and final stance, never stated. The private audience with a star that forgets to burn out reweights the premise: discovery exacts perpetual solitude. No tidy moral; ambiguity lingers whether the chart can ever be shared. Insight is earned via tactile struggle, not assertion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature—map-maker’s idiom of grids, diagonals, coordinates—colors every sentence. Syntax stays crisp, no filter-verb bloat; “wind-chapped cheeks” is lived-in diction. Rhythmic control under pressure: short clauses when sphere surfaces. No head-hopping; POV stable inside Elara’s noticing bias.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density: “the violet bruise of twilight” does triple duty (color, injury, time). No synonym loops, no template cadence. Metaphors stay coherent (star = stowaway). Sentence variety propels momentum; paragraph cuts are clean. Tense and pronoun reference flawless.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fusing ethereal cartography, hopscotch, and starling murmuration into a single discovery engine feels specific and non-obvious. Transformation test fails if names change—dog-ear angle is irreplaceable. Risk in marrying child’s game to cosmic anomaly pays off without gimmickry. Synthesis grows from character obsession, not prompt box-checking.</comment>
