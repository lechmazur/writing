<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elian’s interior contradiction—duty-bound seed-saver vs. time-thief—is dramatized in embodied micro-choices (cupping the acorn, feeling stone-as-sand). The final seated beat with the pea crystallizes his renunciation of pure duty for the illicit sensation of reclaimed moments; cost is tactile and earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens: each sensory grain of ice/light reweights the stake until the flattened vortex pane delivers Conceptual Repricing—stolen time feels gritty. Closure lands with undeniable cost: “a moment that shouldn’t exist” is both prize and sentence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Icebound atrium constrains every move (cold limits breath, glass limits escape) and the acorn-cap micro-setting becomes the tool that flattens chaos; starlight witnesses the theft, charging the final image. Spatial choreography stays clean—no impossible positions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single stake—reopen vault before cold wins—tightens when entropy-reversal exacts the price of borrowed time; the groaning air and upward-sand tactile detail make cost visceral. Agency is continuous: every scatter-particle reorganized is Elian’s choice under duress.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of temporal larceny emerges through concrete inversion (dust → stone) rather than assertion; the pea’s weight reprices existence itself. No moralizing—just the stark electricity of stolen duration.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited sustains a perceptual signature attuned to granular cold, lattice light, and woody cap texture. Syntax tightens into hyphenated compounds under pressure (“flash-frost,” “star-beast”) without register drift; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with scene—long clause for spiral, staccato for pea. No scaffold; each sentence advances image or stakes. Metaphors stay physically coherent (vacuum of organized space) and payoff at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Post-apocalyptic cryo-yolk and vortex inheritance feel inevitable yet uncloned; seed-saving + entropy reversal is a fresh synthesis. Risk—using an acorn to flatten chaos—pays off conceptually and tactually.</comment>
