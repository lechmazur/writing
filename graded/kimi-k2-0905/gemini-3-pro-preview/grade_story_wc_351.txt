<comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—ruthless self-experimentation vs. reverence for the obsolete—remains vivid and embodied; the synaptic burn is felt in her rigid spine. The “archeologist of abandoned dreams” motive is declared early and drives every micro-choice (fusing wires to cracked glass, clamping probes to temples). No second character appears, so status crucible is N/A; her only relationship is with the human race that is discarding itself, and that abstraction stays concrete through tactile artifact work. The final Earned Stasis—she is now a living library—carries visible somatic cost (trembling hands, seismic shudder) and is foreclosed by the prior causal chain.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the cracked mirror redefines her from engineer to vessel, and the cost—permanent neural rewiring, bodily vibration—is legible in the final image. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of sensory density and image accretion rather than causal reversals; the lens is taught early (“silver scar,” “static of a billion sleeping minds”) and holds to the end. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) is clean by line 3. One minor scaffold artifact—“trembling nights” followed immediately by “trembling in her hands” in the last sentence—dulls the cadence slightly but does not touch the closure image; still, it prevents 9.0.</comment>

<comment>The moonlit canyon is not backdrop but resonator: its “silver scar” and “low, resonant frequency” physically feed the mirror’s refraction, charging the final image. The broken periscope mirror functions as micro-setting; its spider-web fissures dictate the synaptic path Elara must carve into herself. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: an engineer notices silica content, fracture angles, spectra, not tourist vistas. Spatial choreography holds—she stays on the ridge, tools in lap, body grounded—environment constrains every move.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—becoming the archive of discarded psyche—tightens once: the neural coupling is irreversible, foreclosing return to baseline humanity. Escalation is textural: density of entangled memories surges into a single heavy wave that forces her stance crystallization. Agency remains hers—she clamps the probes, forces the current—so the turn is earned. Cost is visible (body tremor, seismic shudder) but not persistently constraining beyond the final moment, keeping the score below 8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: the price of digital immortality is paid by those who volunteer to carry the deleted past. Subtext lives in objects—submarine mirror once navigated oceans of water, now navigates oceans of memory—no moralizing required. The ending offers a resonant reconfiguration: the playground that never existed and the extinct sun reweight “progress” as loss. Ambiguity is purposeful—reader must decide whether she is savior or cautionary relic—yet never confuses.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Voice is engineer-poetic: recursive helix metaphor, “chaotically precise,” spectral jargon filtered through tactile obsession. Perceptual signature—she sees fracture patterns as blueprint for neurons—remains consistent. No dialogue, so no register clash. One syntactic drumbeat in the final sentence (“trembling… trembling”) is the only recurring artifact; otherwise rhythm modulates with voltage surge and memory flood.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>High information density: one sentence fuses silica ridge, moonlight, epochal shift, and biological nostalgia. Metaphors are physically coherent—cracks “trap ghostly residue,” never mixed. Only minor scaffold: “trembling nights” → “trembling in her hands” is paraphrase-loop lite; it occurs at closure but does not obscure the image, so −0.3 rather than −0.8. Strong verbs dominate; nominalizations appear only when POV-plausible (“synaptic plasticity”).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Premise—archeologist of abandoned dreams using a cracked periscope to refract psychic runoff—is non-obvious and executed with scientific rigor rather than gonzo surrealism. Risk of lyric overload is held in check by tactile engineering detail. The transformation test fails: swapping mirror for crystal ball or engineer for mystic breaks the causal logic. Fresh inflection: collective unconscious as literal electromagnetic bandwidth that can be soldered and prismed. Conceptual integrity holds—no retreat into hand-wavy transcendence.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Setup: “helix-minded engineer” declared line 1. Development: her recursive wiring plan mirrors the helix, enabling the neural bridge. Closure: helix becomes the architecture of her new brain, linking ending to opening identity.</comment>
<question>9 B</question><grade>9.5</grade>
<comment>Setup: salvage described lines 4–6. Development: fusing filaments to cracks dictates synaptic map; glass spectra guide memory sorting. Closure: mirror is the prism that finalizes her transformation—remove it and the entire causal chain collapses.</comment>
<question>9 C</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Setup: entanglement named line 25. Development: single pull yokes child-flight + old-man-letter, proving the phenomenon. Closure: unified wave hits her brain, repricing entanglement as irreversible possession.</comment>
<question>9 D</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Setup: “chaotically precise” appears line 10. Development: messy workbench yet rigorous math logic governs every solder joint. Closure: tremor in hands shows precision has cost, chaos now internalized.</comment>
<question>9 E</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Modify is the inciting action—every subsequent beat (neural probe, current flow, memory flood) is downstream of this modification. Without it, no escalation and no closure.</comment>
<question>9 F</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Method signaled mid-story; dictates the burning new pathways that lock the ending. Mechanics matter—plasticity is the only way to match cracked glass topology.</comment>
<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</question>
<comment>Moonlit canyon supplies resonant frequency that amplifies mirror refraction; remove the gorge and the psychic signal lacks medium. Description stays selective, never postcard.</comment>
<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</question>
<comment>Period of transformation is declared early, but no ticking clock narrows choices; it frames stakes rather than forcing tactical timing, so mid-band.</comment>
<question>9 I</question><grade>8.8</question>
<comment>Motivation is declared and dramatized—every soldering choice serves the dig of discarded dreams. Final realization reweights the ambition from project to prison.</comment>
<question>9 J</question><grade>8.5</question>
<comment>Quaking reverie is seeded in “trembling nights,” vibrates through canyon resonance, and ends in bodily seismic shudder. Tone modulates with voltage surge, never static mood.</comment>
