<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elian’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“profound sensitivity…deafening noise”), with contradictory impulses (pursuit vs surrender) played out in scene. The final collapse and smile are earned by prior causality and cost is visible. Single-POV keeps focus tight; no relationship crucible on page. Slight over-articulation—“singular and terrified” motivation—tilts toward label-speak in peak beat, not enough to break band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: density of celestial imagery intensifies until pattern breaks at surrender; closure is Charged Poise with felt cost (“paralyzed by exhaustion yet alive”). Anchors clear by word 60; no orientation debt. One micro-turn: frantic tracing → stillness. Persistent constraint (instrument lost, body spent) shapes final image; cost legible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Apex world, aurora arch, and Star-Loom are concretely handled, spatially tracked, and constrain choices (thin air, frost stones, lens cold). Sensory hierarchy narrows under crisis to immediacies of touch and sound. Final image reweights setting as conduit, not backdrop. Slight risk of purple in “swirling canvas of electric violets” but paid off by closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—free trapped creativity—signaled early and tightened by escalating sensory torrent that forces renunciation. Agency is renunciation/rest with visible cost (collapse, instrument lost). Under Accumulative lens, density shift from scream to music reweights stake. No coincidence; pressure coherent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from specific particulars: traced star-paths, iron blood, unwritten calendar. Final smile reconfigures premise—creativity flows only when capture ceases—without moralizing. Ambiguity remains (madness vs prophecy) that lingers. No echoic thesis statement; resonance earned.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lyric, elevated register is consistent, taught early, and modulates with pressure—short clauses under meteor shower, longer cadences at surrender. Perceptual signature is dreamer-particular: “ghostly whispers of paintings that have never been painted.” No dialogue to judge; free indirect style clean. No head-hopping; distance stable.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentences carry dual duty (info + atmosphere). Zero loops or scaffold; no mixed metaphors. One minor purple patch (“swirling canvas”) but does not obscure causality. Filter verbs minimal and voice-motivated. Final line has propulsive snap.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Freshest synthesis: Star-Loom as capture-device for unmade art, stardust as iron-blood memory, rest as active surrender. These elements feel inevitable yet non-obvious. Risky lyric compression taught early and paid off. Conceptual integrity holds; no retreat to safer realism.</comment>
