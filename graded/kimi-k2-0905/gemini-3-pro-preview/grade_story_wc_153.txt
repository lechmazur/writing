<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Julian’s shame and trembling embodiment are sharply observed; the interior contradiction between needing to see the past and fearing it drives his arc. Motivation stays crisp: he wants to know if the silence was empty or full—this governs every beat. Elara’s cryptic exterior and maternal softening create status tension that pressures his confession. The moment he lifts the re-broken shard with “lighter” weight shows earned change: knowledge irreversible, path foreclosed, cost felt.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Causal lens holds throughout: because the gargoyle broke when he left, therefore he brings it; because moonlight heals stone, the conduit opens; because the message is read, he chooses to write. Orientation is clean by line 10; no debt applied. One meaningful tightening occurs when the shard re-fuses and the window writes *Don’t go*—options narrow from “Can I fix the past?” to “Can I answer her silence?” Closure lands as Earned Stasis: he cannot unsay the knowledge; the cost is the unwriteable letter he now must write. Persistent constraint: the re-broken shard he carries out literalizes the irreversible break.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mangrove channels root-choked, humid air vibrating with singing spirits—every detail is filtered through Julian’s guilt-warped perception. The houseboat rises “on stilts from black water,” a tactile threat; grime-opaque windows mirror his emotional opacity. Micro-setting success: the granite shard’s cold weight against his palms anchors body-as-place. Final image recharges setting: he steps back into the singing spirits now overheard as chorus to the letter he will write—environment presses the next act.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—find whether her silence was empty or full—signaled paragraph 1 and tested at the window reveal. Escalation driven by his agency: he up-ends the sack, exposes the shard to moonlight, reads the condensation. Cost is visible: the stone re-breaks, the message weeps away, leaving him with irreversible knowledge. Tightening beat at *Don’t go* reweights future—apology becomes the only live option.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete particular: a rainspout gargoyle becomes the jugular of unspoken regret. Subtext works through silence-objects: unsent letters shelved like stale air, condensation writing that appears then self-erases. Final image—Julian exiting with lighter broken stone—reprises the motif: repair is impossible, articulation remains. No tidy moral, only the repriced reality that every silence is already full of something.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person intimate stays latched to Julian; perceptual signature—singing spirits heard as “weeping violins,” grime perceived as “secrets”—is consistent and character-specific. Rhythm modulates: long humid sentences in approach, staccato revelations inside the shack. Dialogue sparse but voice-specific: Elara’s parchment-rasp diction contrasts Julian’s choked whisper. No head-hop; Elara’s interior is opaque, as required.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet limpid: “the granite knitting itself back into a whole, unbroken mouth” compresses transformation + metaphor in one stroke. No loops or scaffold; sentences propel. Occasional elevated diction (“crystallized final moment”) stays within Julian’s literate guilt-register. Filter verbs minimal; sensory anchors strong. Final line cadence slows to match exit into night, earning its breath.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: gothic séance meets swamp ecological realism; spirits as humidity, not ghosts. The rainspout shard—an architectural discard—becomes the emotional fossil no other object could substitute. Risk of lyric elision taught early (“vibration of singing spirits”) and paid off when Julian re-enters that soundscape armed with new task. Conceptual integrity intact: premise commits to the impossible dialogue with erased words and follows the implication to the last broken edge.</comment>
