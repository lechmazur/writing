<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s self-sabotaging drive to “pick at scabs of history” is embodied in every beat: the frantic pry-bar tunneling rips his fresh stitches, literalizing the cost. Interiority fuses pain and obsession without lapsing into diagnostic labels; even the plant telepathy is filtered through throbbed ribs and muddy palms. The final lullaby-hum from the root he exposes earns a credible renunciation—he accepts communion with the verdant invasion he tried to excise. Only the slight abstraction of “stories in scars” keeps this from full 9-band integration.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The coffee-ring cartography is causally obeyed: sediment → pry bar → glowing root, a clean because/therefore chain. Closure is a Charged Poise: the shattered hourglass and hum reweight time and pain in one image, cost paid in blood on rubble. Orientation anchors observatory/dawn by 40 words; no drift. Lens stays causal throughout; no ambiguity at end.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The tower floor becomes a surgical table—flagstones, grout, iron spine fused to root—every chip of stone alters Elias’s tactical options. Bioluminescent moss and frost-etched glass constrain visibility and time perception, charging the final image where dawn light hits exposed root. Sensory hierarchy stays tight: surgical pain narrows perception to cold ceramic, grit under fingernails, root-thrum against skin. Micro-setting (hourglass, pry bar, coaster) doubles as topography and divination tool, directly shaping the climax.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“learn the geography of this pain”—tightens when each hammer blow costs blood and widens the psychic plant chorus. Escalation is causal: deeper breach → louder botanical screams → brighter root → shattered hourglass, each step foreclosing retreat. Visible price: torn stitches, muddy lacerations, surgical wounds reopened. Final hum is not rescue but reconfiguration—peace through infection acknowledged.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges as inversion: healing is not closure but deliberate reopening; stories reside in rupture, not skin. The scar-mapper’s obsession resolves into acceptance that his body is now text—root-lines replacing rib-lines. No moralizing; the lullaby offers ambiguous comfort, leaves reader weighing verdant colonization vs. mortal flesh. Subtext carried by tactile image, not assertion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is saturated with medical diction—“chemical fog,” “sutures,” “sediment”—yet keeps botanical lyricism in check. Syntax mirrors surgical precision under duress: clipped fragments during prying, longer susurrus sentences as plants hum. No filter-verb stacks; perception stays embodied. Pattern of frost/fog is taught early and paid off in shattered glass, no head-hop.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>High-density lines (“Instead of a smoking crater…”) do triple duty: world-build, sensory charge, theme. No scaffold, no synonym loops; every sentence advances. Metaphors stay coherent (meteor hush, Genesis-level vitality) and align with POV’s scientific bent. Only two adjacent “he began” stems, not enough to dull propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Telepathic botany via botched miracle-relay is fresh; trope of chosen-one communion inverted into invasive graft. Coffee-ring cartography as divination tool is specific, irreplaceable. Risky decision to fracture time inside frosted hourglass pays off as conceptual re-pricing at closure. Transformation test fails if any element swapped—root-fusion is Elias’s scar-story literalized.</comment>
