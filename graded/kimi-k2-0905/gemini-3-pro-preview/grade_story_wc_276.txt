<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elara’s “cool-headed fisher” identity is vividly embodied through her pulse-control and tactical zig-zag; the iron-spike choice reveals a believable hierarchy of values. Interiority stays concrete, never drifting into diagnostic self-talk. No second on-page character, so status/relationship bullets are waived. The only minor gap: we never feel a moment where her discipline almost snaps—cost is present but not viscerally internalized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the captured goddess-echo is pinned, constellations retreat, and the garden’s silence carries undeniable conceptual cost (“world that had forgotten how to sing”). Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of sonic density → rupture → crystalline vacuum—taught early and held to final image. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no debt. One causal micro-turn: collision of constellations → echo exposed → spike swung. Cost is legible in the frozen diamond air and the lullaby still clawing her mind.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The Sound-Wave-Garden is not backdrop but antagonist: every footfall triggers reactive flora, the rail-spike’s density is required to defeat acoustic buoyancy, and the final diamond prism is born from garden rules. Sensory selection is urgent—bass notes “like black tulips” against waders, cosmic static tails—never touristic. Micro-setting (iron spike) constrains tactics and charges the final image, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—capture goddess-echo—is signaled in para 2 and tightened when constellations fracture the garden’s melody, forcing the immediate spike-throw. Escalation is textural: density of sound → discordant shard → vacuum of silence that reweights the stake with visible price (frozen air, lingering lullaby). Protagonist agency drives every beat; coincidence complicates but does not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme—sound as commodified divinity—emerges through action, not statement. The final image of a “throbbing pulse of divinity wrapped in iron” conceptually re-prices the world’s lost song without moralizing. Motif of silence evolves from tactic to commodity, charging closure. Subtext in the “predatory, drowsy hum” implies colonial extraction without sermon.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Elara’s perceptual filter: she notices frequencies, densities, tactical textures, never stars’ beauty. Syntax mirrors sonic pulses—long clauses build pressure, then fracture into staccato swing. No head-hop; diction stays within her hunter-lexicon. The “feral lullaby” refrain modulates with rising threat, showing rhythmic control.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: every sentence advances world-rule, character tactic, or sensory stakes. Figurative layering is purposeful—black tulips, velvet teeth—paid off in the diamond prism image. Zero loops or scaffold; no mixed metaphors. Minor elevation near ceiling: one “resinous heavy frequencies” could lose “heavy,” but artifact does not touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Acoustic ecology as living predator, divinity-echo as silver trout—specific synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk in second-person-plural “you” is avoided; instead, the world-rules rewrite physics without exposition dump. The rail-spike-as-anchor transforms mundane object into mythic tool, fulfilling transformation test. Fresh inflection: silence weaponized as commodity, not void.</comment>
