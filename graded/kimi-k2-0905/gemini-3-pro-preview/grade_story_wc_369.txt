<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elias’s curiosity about trees is stated early but never friction-tested; no contradictory impulse or micro-choice complicates it under pressure, so the final hand-to-bark beat feels pre-decided. The “burning curiosity” is rehearsed rather than embodied in scene-level risk. Meets baseline interiority but lacks the earned contradiction required for 7+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly as Resonant Reconfiguration: the healed hedge thrums with secret history, reweighting Elias’s labour into quiet revelation. Causal chain intact—pin-drop timing triggers sextant twist → sorrow shatter → moonlight stitch. Orientation anchored inside 120 words; lens held (Causal). Cost is visible in the hush that follows the tear; no narrative amnesia.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The broken sextant functions as micro-setting that constrains every key move: mapping dreams, twisting screw, channelling moonlight. Storm-lit tower supplies immediate atmospheric pressure but remains secondary to the tool. Sensory selection stays tethered to Elias’s professional eye. Environment and instrument jointly charge the final image—mercury light sealing the hedge—passing the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—clear the sorrow before reality bursts—is declared early and tightened once: the microscopic screw-turn that collapses the dam. Stakes stay personal-scale; no visible price (injury, exhaustion, lost memory) is dramatized on Elias, so escalation feels moderate. Agency is present but singular; one decisive move suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges obliquely: silent history accretes in living wood and is worth painstaking salvage. No thesis stated; final hum of roots supplies non-literal answer. Slight reserve because Elias’s private stake (trees’ witness) never collides with an opposing value, muting thematic friction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited maintains steady psychic distance; perceptual signature filters every image through a maintenance worker’s tactile lexicon (“metaphysical grease,” “psychic mortar”). Sentence rhythm swells and contracts with storm breath, then tightens at pin-drop. No head-hop or filter-verb bloat; voice remains character-anchored to the end.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>High information density—figurative language is selective, never floods a beat. Metaphors (“vegetative nervous system,” “liquid mercury”) cohere without contradiction. One paraphrase loop (“heavy exhalations… heavy emotion”) but it does not touch closure. Read-aloud rhythm purposeful; no template cadence detected.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Marrying quantified sorrow to hedge-maintenance is fresh; using a fractured sextant as both scalpel and suture reifies the concept without exposition. The mundane-miracle tone avoids whimsy by grounding every beat in tactile procedure. Risky compression succeeds—no other story could swap these tools or setting without collapse.</comment>
