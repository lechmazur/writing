<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is poetically specific—arthritis vanishing as fingers seek the aperture in paper—and her refusal to intervene in the library’s collapse is a credible, earned renunciation. The “grip reality loosely” trait is shown through mistaking roots for scholars, not told, and her final stance crystallizes without sentimental epiphany. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene, so the 9+ quick test is narrowly missed; the cost is felt but not visibly paid on the page in a single sentence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: Elara’s passage into regenerative silence forever forecloses her role as Chronicle Keeper, the obsidian refuge reframing her witness stance into eternal stillness. Causal linkage holds—each fold in the swan is a because/therefore step narrowing location until the paper aperture literally relocates her. The orientation anchor (who/where) is taught by line 3 and payoff is the inverted whiteness → black shore transition, waiving any penalty. Cost is legible in the final image: “keeper of the quiet that follows the end of stories,” a conceptual price that reweights the premise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The overgrown library and obsidian refuge are not backdrops but instruments: the swelling river forces the folding act, the glossy shore mirrors her fragmented/whole reflection. Micro-setting (the paper swan) literally transports, satisfying the 9+ gate. Sensory economy is strict—damp earth, grey light, bioluminescent glow—each detail filtering through Elara’s archivist senses. Spatial choreography is immaculate; no impossible moves across the folding sequence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—bearing witness without judgment—tightens when the rising damp threatens her vantage; the only escape is to abandon the archive forever, a visible forfeiture. Escalation is accumulative: each sentence adds decay density until the river’s roar forces the folding choice. No external antagonist is needed; pressure is ontological. The price (loss of the library and her function) is on-page, but the tightening is single rather than iterated, keeping it below 8.8.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the inversion of preservation: the true archive is silence after rot, knowledge returns to source. The regenerative silence concept is not stated but enacted in the final image, re-weighting all prior decay as natural cycle. No moralizing sentence mars the ending; meaning is charged through the obsidian window carved from night itself. Counter-readings (complicity, failure, liberation) are plausible, satisfying complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Perceptual signature is consistent—Elara’s scholar-poet diction, synesthetic shifts (“air tasted of ancient forgetting”), and paper-as-map perception. Free-indirect folds cleanly; no filter-verb clutter. Purposeful elision (“she felt herself becoming impossibly small”) is taught early and paid off in the compression→expansion sequence. Rhythm modulates with pressure—long languid sentences in library, staccato clauses during folding, final serene cadence in obsidian hall.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentences perform double duty: “The vines had long ago decided that the books were merely trelliswork” plants decay and agency in one stroke. No synonym loops, no mixed metaphors; “white inverted into total darkness” is clean polarity flip. Figurative language is spare, each image exact: paper edges “softened to the texture of fabric.” One hairline scaffold—“the noise of history ceased”—is a touch abstract, preventing 9.0.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Origami-as-portal is familiar, but here it is interiorized: the bird is not reshaped, the user is, a fresh inflection. The collapsing archive trope is transmuted through the refusal to save anything, making entropy the moral stance. Specificity of “encyclopedia spine,” “pulp and ink layers,” roots the concept in tactile detail. Risky second-person compression (“she felt herself becoming impossibly small”) pays off in closure without obscuring causality.</comment>
