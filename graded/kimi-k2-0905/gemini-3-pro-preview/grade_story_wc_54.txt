<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s curiosity and engineering mindset are credibly rendered; his interiority is specific (“dormant potential,” “diverted currents”).  The final beat – quietly noting luminosity values after the hologram blooms – crystallizes his stoic, calculation-over-celebration nature, earning the change.  No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene, and the cost (risking the improvised lens) is only implicit; hence not quite 9+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the star-map reconfigures the trash-strewn atrium into “stardust,” making the before/after legible with conceptual cost – the terminal lives, but the city outside still decays.  Lens is Accumulative/Textural: each sensory layer (confetti→brass→ionized air) tightens the stake of reclamation.  Causality is clean: sextant curvature → refractive index → hologram ignition, all on-page.  Cost is felt in the final image; no contradiction under the lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The terminal is evoked through tactile motion – “kicking aside faux-velvet ropes,” “climbed the gantry” – rather than static postcarding.  Storm-drainage pneumatics and micro-turbine specifics ground the engineering feat.  The sextant itself becomes the micro-setting that charges the closure; without its brass arc the hologram fails, meeting the 9+ gate.  One hairline slip: “vast atrium” is generic shorthand, preventing full 9.5.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake – can the dead terminal breathe again? – is signaled early and tightened once: the missing crystal forces the sextant gamble, narrowing options.  Escalation is textural (density of trash vs. starlight) rather than causal reversal; sufficient under Accumulative lens.  The price (possible explosion, failure) is conceptual rather than corporeal, keeping it just below the 8.8 band where visible loss would be required.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of reclamation-over-resignation emerges through concrete contraposition: carnival debris vs. celestial map.  No explicit thesis is stated; the final image reweights “trash” as “stardust,” achieving Conceptual Repricing.  Ambiguity lingers – the port is still abandoned – satisfying complexity without tidy moral.  One decorative echo (“maze of intentions”) slightly over-articulates; else would touch 9.0.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elias’s perceptual signature – calculations, structural metaphors, understated awe.  Rhythm modulates: longer clauses for survey work, staccato “math held” at close.  No head-hop or register drift; “sordid remnants” fits intern’s educated lexicon.  Distinctiveness falls a hair short of the 9+ texture that would sing in every clause.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty: “He treated the building like a dying patient, finding a vein that still carried blood” advances both character and tech.  Zero paraphrase loops; no mixed metaphors.  micro-turbine/pneumatic diction is accurate yet never explanatory dump.  The final paragraph’s cadence mirrors Elias’s calm, propelling closure without scaffolding.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of carnival refuse + antique navigation tool → resurrection of star-chart is fresh, non-obvious, and inevitable in hindsight.  The “fake tool for a fake sailor” repurposed to guide the “only real ship” flips cultural decay into cosmic possibility.  Risk is taken with engineer-procedural detail, paid off by lyrical final image.  Could not transplant Elias or setting without collapsing the story’s engine.</comment>
