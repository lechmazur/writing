<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elian’s quietly obstinate caretaker persona is vivid—his gnarled hands, the way he “caresses” dormant wisteria, the micro-choice of polishing a worthless marble against his cuff. Interiority stays rooted in tactile ritual; no diagnostic self-talk. The final refusal to concede to the luck metric is a credible renunciation, but because the sub-prefect is only a foil and Elian’s flaw/change arc is subtle, the cost feels more conceptual than visceral—just shy of the 9-band threshold.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a perfect CR: the cracked marble’s refracted beam re-prices “broken=worthless” into “broken=brilliant,” forcing the reader to re-see the entire system. Causal chain is clean: because Elian kept the marbles as penance, therefore he can weaponize their flaw under the sun’s angle. Lens is accumulative/textural; the final image crystallizes meaning with undeniable conceptual cost. Orientation and causality are intact; no scaffolding artifacts dull the beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The Helix Maze is rendered through lived motion—kneeling, cairn placement, cuff-polishing—rather than static description. Sensory hierarchy is biased to caretaker priorities: scent of fermentation, temperature shift registered by the bureaucrat’s gauge. The sun shaft, wall height, and marble angle are spatially tracked; environment constrains the decisive tactic. One hairline slip: “blooming withering” is repeated verbatim, a micro-loop that keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—prove gardens answer to devotion, not algorithms—signaled early and tightened once: the marble cairn focuses sunlight, visibly stiffening the leaf while the gauge stutters. Escalation is a single deepening rather than reversal, sufficient for 800-word scope. Cost is conceptual (the sub-prefect’s worldview destabilized), but because the prefect exits without tangible consequence, the price lands more on reader than character—just below the 8.8 gate.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from concrete paradox: worthless cracked glass becomes the engine of renewal. No moralizing; the final line lets the image reweight the premise. Subtext operates in silence—the bureaucrat’s tapping screen vs. Elian’s stone placement—showing competing epistemologies. The cracked marble’s return with shifted meaning gives the resonant, non-literal answer required for 9-band.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elian’s perceptual filter: “weathering patterns of the maze” mirrors his own creased skin. Diction—“turgor,” “cairn,” “angle of incidence”—remains within a vine-dresser’s lexicon. No head-hopping; sub-prefect’s interior is only implied through gesture and dialogue. Rhythm modulates: long sentences for ritual, staccato for the gauge stutter. One register twitch: “conceptually dead” sounds like narrative thesis, not character perception—minor slip.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty: “the atmosphere…blooming withering” fuses scent and paradox in one stroke. No paraphrase loops; each pebble placement advances tension. Metaphors (“desperate hand,” “hungry light”) stay coherent to botanic and glass logic. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves via image that recharges the cracked-marble motif. Micro-hedge: “blooming withering” reused verbatim; otherwise clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Premise—measurable luck vs. tactile horticulture—feels fresh, extrapolated from actuarial culture without exposition dumps. Cracked marble refracting life is a non-obvious synthesis of fraud-to-redemption. Risky structural choice to hinge climax on a physics micro-event pays off because pattern is taught early (polishing angle). Conceptual integrity intact; no retreat to sentiment. Lacks the final daring twist that would push into 9+ originality band.</comment>
