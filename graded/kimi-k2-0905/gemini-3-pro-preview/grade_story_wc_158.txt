<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elias’s insomnia, eidetic memory, and centuries-long grief are viscerally embodied; every micro-choice (thumb-polishing the postcard, releasing the off-key song) flows from the same wound. The internal contradiction—clinging to the postcard while yearning to transmute pain—drives every beat. The final renunciation (burying the postcard inside the fern) costs the last physical tether and is earned by the visible garden that has already replaced lament with breathable air. Only the “biological alchemy” phrase flirts with diagnostic-speak, briefly cooling the embodiment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as an Earned Stasis: the postcard interred, Elias forecloses nostalgic obsession and accepts perpetual sleepless vigil. The Acc/Textural lens holds throughout—pattern of song → sprout → jungle → surrender—each cadence reweighting loss into atmosphere. Cost is unmistakable: “his hands finally empty,” alone inside a cradle he can never truly sleep in. Orientation is taught by word 40 (“bottom of the gargantuan shell”) so no penalty applies.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The calcium-cathedral shell, meteoric dust, and bioluminescent vines are not backdrop but instruments: every tendril climbs because his voice vibrates the calcium; the postcard must decompose inside that exact fern to seed the next cycle. Sensory triangulation (reef-shadow light, off-key wind, perfume of night-blooming jasmine) mirrors the tonal shift from tomb to cradle. Micro-setting rule satisfied: the postcard-as-object and fern-as-cradle directly constrain the final surrender. Density never stalls momentum; each detail either feeds the alchemy or sharpens the solitude.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—transmute grief into livable atmosphere—signaled in paragraph 4 and tightened once: the moment he “prepares to ensconce” the postcard, the option to cling is foreclosed. No antagonist is needed; the pressure is entropy and memory. Price is visible: relinquishing the last relic of the lover. A second escalation beat would have secured 8.8+, but the single deepening is meaningful and sufficient at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges as the impossibility of forgetting versus the necessity of metabolizing pain into breathable life. No overt thesis statements; the garden is the argument. Final image—the postcard dissolving into moss—reprices memory from artifact to compost without moralizing. Slight reserve from the early “biological alchemy” phrase keeps it shy of 9.0.</comment>
