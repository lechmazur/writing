<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elian’s calm indexer-brain and methodical theft of the stamp feel lived-in; the blackout-quiet lets his tactile precision shine. His decision to risk suffocation for a statistical hunch is credible because every micro-choice (rotating the stamp three degrees, suppressing doubt) is filtered through occupational lens. The only flaw: interiority once labels his doubt “a tremor” instead of letting the hand-twitch speak. Closure’s cost is palpable—he pockets the truth while the turbines restart—so renunciation is earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The blackout is the causal pivot that makes the decryption possible; when the turbine groans back, the lie literally re-locks on the page—perfect because/therefore linkage. The shift from heroic origin myth to penal manifesto is a Decisive Change with conceptual cost (the city’s glass walls could now shatter). No orientation drift: who/where/when anchored by line 3. Lens is causal throughout; no ellipsis or coincidence resolves the stake.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The algae-dappled glass and vibrating parchment floor are not backdrop—they are the tools that let the stamp’s prism fire and the text reconfigure. Library tier, observation wall, and pump cavitation are tracked spatially; stillness is the micro-setting that enables fingertip detection of grooves. Environment directly constrains the final act: if the blackout ends seconds earlier, the decryption fails. High-band gate met: setting charges the closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—truth vs. survival—tightens with every sputter of the air scrubbers. One meaningful turn: the stamp’s click refracts light and dissolves the foundation lie; options narrow from “verify hypothesis” to “own the consequence while oxygen dwindles.” Cost is visible on-page: he accepts possible suffocation when he pockets the stamp. Escalation is causal, driven by his agency under blackout-forced stillness.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: the noise of civilization (mechanical vibration, curated history) masks prison bars; silence strips both. The algae’s dapple mirrors the dappled resolve in Elian’s chest—image returned under pressure. No moralizing; the ending’s image (glasses adjusted while turbines restart) lets the reader feel the conceptual repricing: every citizen now lives inside a submerged cell. Ambiguity lingers—will he publish or suffocate in secret?—but complexity is embraced.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person hovers at a perfect indexer-distance: perceptual signature is cataloguing motion (“alphanumeric coordinates,” “microscopic grooves”). Syntax stays precise, calm, almost bibliographic—no drumbeat monotony. Register never drifts into academic self-consciousness; vocabulary (“cavitating water pumps”) is character-appropriate. Voice modulates only once under peak stress—sentence fragments when the text shifts—then re-settles, mirroring his restored poise.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero scaffold or synonym loops; every sentence advances image, causality, or pressure. Opening line anchors voice and stakes in one punch. No mixed metaphors; “darkness became…a physical weight” is earned by subsequent tactile proof. Final line is an image-propulsion sentence that re-casts the earlier “artificial daylight” motif without repeating it—high information density with rhythmic payoff.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sunken penal-library revealed by librarian-mechanic decryption is a fresh synthesis; not a trope checklist. Stillness-as-tool feels inevitable only after the algae-prism fires. Risky structural choice—single scene, no antagonist but vibration itself—pays off because blackout stillness becomes the true opponent. Minor deduction: prison-colony twist is familiar, rescued by indexer POV and tactile execution.</comment>
