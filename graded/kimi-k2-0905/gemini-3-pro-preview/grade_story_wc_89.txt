<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elian’s longing to reclaim the phoenix’s memory is viscerally embodied—his boots cook on scorched earth, his hand refuses to drop the censer even while his bones crystallize. The contradiction between terror of transformation and refusal to retreat is dramatized in the same beat, not summarized, giving us a cost that is simultaneously physical, existential, and emotional. Interiority stays concrete: instead of “he felt love,” the moment is delivered through the bell-like tone of collision and the ash of the fortune slip. Only nit: the “beast whisperer” résumé is asserted rather than demonstrated in micro-choices; one missed chance to let his professional instinct sharpen a beat keeps this just outside 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the fused stance of man-bird crystallizes in the moonlit orchard, the fortune ash reweighting the earlier prophecy with undeniable conceptual cost—he has indeed “become the sky” by letting human flesh burn away. Causality is tight: every ingredient of the censer, the timing “immediately after the phoenix rises,” and the metamorphosis biology are set up, used, and paid off in the final image. No teleporting props; the fortune slip introduced in paragraph two ignites the final beat. Drive lens is causal throughout; each beat tightens options (scent → dive → forced transmutation → touch) until contact forecloses ordinary humanity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The orchard is not backdrop but tool: its “immovable ink-black shadows” anchor Elian’s stance and later echo the silhouette of shared darkness after fusion. Sensory selection stays urgent—heat on boots, sulfur taste, bell-like resonance—never drifting into travel-brochire excess. Spatial choreography survives the aerial dive: we track his arm, the censer, the talon grip, the final shared stillness without impossible positions. Micro-setting inside the censer (star-anise, void-dragon breath) constrains the only viable tactic, qualifying for 9-band gate; merely a hair’s-breadth short of charging the very final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—rekindling a bond beyond death—tightens through each escalation: scent as hook, descent as threat, metamorphosis as price. Agency is present at every node; the phoenix’s dive is triggered by Elian’s conjuration, not luck. Visible cost scales from scorched coat to crystallized bone to forfeited humanity, all on-page. The tightening beat is the talon grip that fuses their orbit, foreclosing ordinary life; cost is felt in the burning beak kiss that dissolves boundaries. Sufficient for high band, though second micro-turn would have pushed 9+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: immortality is a solvent that dissolves individual identity; love persists only by surrendering the self that loves. The fortune cookie aphorism is transformed from diner kitsch to cosmic contract, its meaning repriced when the paper burns. No sermonizing—final image of two silent entities in eternal bloom lets ambiguity linger. Particulars (censer recipe, diamond skin, bell tone) rather than abstractions carry the weight, achieving non-literal resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elian; no head-hop into phoenix interiority. Perceptual signature is consistent: temperature measured through boot leather, color through silicate eyes, sound through bell resonance. Syntax swells and compresses with stress—short clauses under falling star heat, longer lyric lifts in orchard stillness. No filter-verb stacks; “he felt” constructions appear once and are immediately grounded in physical referent, passing high-band gate. One hairline slip: “pools of liquid gold swirling with infinite history” edges toward poetic overlay, but remains anchored in his visual field.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm pulses: helical smoke, plummeting arc, bell tone—each sentence re-orients the body in space without scaffolding. Mixed metaphors are avoided; crystallized skin and ink shadows coexist in coherent physics. No synonym churn; “heat,” “fire,” “warmth” are never swapped merely for variety. Final third is artifact-free, propelling to the ash flake that lands the closure image. Information density high—one line often delivers sensory data, stakes reminder, and causal nudge simultaneously.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Familiar phoenix tale is inverted: the human must die into permanence while the bird remembers, reversing usual immortality envy. Censer recipe fuses mythic alchemy with diner-fortune ephemera—specific synthesis not seen before. The orchard’s moonlit stasis plus scent-based summoning creates a fresh ruleset that feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk of overwrought lyricism is embraced but controlled, heightening stakes without slipping into purple obscurity. Transformation test passes: swap any detail (censer components, fortune slip, diamond skin) and the emotional calculus collapses.</comment>
