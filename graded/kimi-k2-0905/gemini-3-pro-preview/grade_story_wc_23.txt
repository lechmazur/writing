<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara’s scarred skin, burnt maps, and willingness to wedge sacred metal into live circuitry embody a survivor who maps her own trauma. The bronze-foot beat grounds her values—she risks shock to ground ghosts—showing a hierarchy where others’ safe passage outweighs her comfort. Interior contradiction flickers only once: “raw solace” is named, not dramatized. Still, the earned stance—she absorbs grief so the flock may pass—charges the final image of her frost-breath alone under a clear sky, cost legible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens: each sensory layer (ozone, incense, copper heat) intensifies until the bronze foot glows, reweighting the stake from mechanical failure to spiritual conduit. Closure is a Charged Poise: dish aligned, corridor held, ghosts home, Elara left clutching the cooling relic—cost felt in her slumped exhale. One micro-turn at midpoint—circuit completes, metal burns—deepens pattern. No causality break; ellipse of dead phone line tightens cadence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Starlit station’s frozen altitude is rendered through breath-frost and “steel beams supporting” silence; the broken dish’s upturned paralysis mirrors Elara’s locked gaze. Bronze censer foot acts as micro-setting—its patina darkening under heat—constraining her grip and filtering grief. Sensory hierarchy narrows to ozone/incense under crisis, widening to spectral birds only after tension releases. Final image of clear sky reconfigures the sky as memory, not void.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake: can Elara build a corridor before moon-peak flood ruptures the hull? Pressure swells with lunar eye, tightening to “thousand returning ghosts pressing.” Her agency—wedge bronze, twist crank—forecloses retreat; heat absorbed by metal is visible price. Escalation is density-driven, not causal reversal, fitting accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of cartographing loss emerges from her burnt maps and the flock flying backward into erased origin. Subtext in bronze relic: sacred vessel now conducts secular electricity, re-pricing worship as service to the dead. Final ozone/incense mixture offers non-literal answer—sacred and profane must coexist to house grief. No moral stated; image of cooling bronze foot suffices.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains steady psychic distance, filtering celestial mechanics through Elara’s patched-together lexicon: “rhythmic rotation” becomes “paralyzed upward gaze.” Syntax lengthens under fatigue—“she sat alone in the high tower…”—then fractures to short clauses at peak twist. No head-hopping; distortion stays in phone voice, preserving her perceptual signature. Diction stays within navigator’s reach—coordinates as poetry, “harmonic integers.”</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose breathes with scene needs: long consonantal clusters mimic rusted gears, then clipped fragments at circuit completion. Figurative control: “swollen eye” moon is singular, not stacked. No filter-verb clusters; “she felt” appears once, justified as bone resonance. Minor scaffold: “the silence… was heavier” could tighten to “silence pressed heavier,” but momentum never stalls.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Reverse migration of spectral birds into non-existent origin re-weights familiar ghost trope as cosmological loss-management. Patina censer foot repurposed to conduct spiritual electricity fuses relic with retro-tech, generating fresh image. Risk of preciousness averted by grounded burns and frost. Specificity—bronze smells of frankincense, ozone sharpens air—renders concept inseparable from sensory moment.</comment>
