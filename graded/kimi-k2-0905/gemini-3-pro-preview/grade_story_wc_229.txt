<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elias’s “whisper > shout” creed is interiorized early and drives every beat; the silent vial-act is the logical culmination of his quiet rebellion. His embodied tremor as he “poured this agonizing care into the glass” makes the abstract motive visceral. The keeper’s snoring oblivion supplies a clean foil that sharpens Elias’s agency without bloating cast. Cost is legible: he expires a private, almost shameful tenderness in public air, leaving him chest-heaving and alone—an earned stasis.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: storm → ship blind → horn dead → vial whisper → course corrected. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the Atlantic still swells but the moral physics of rescue has been permanently redefined by scent instead of sound. One micro-turn (keeper defeated by mechanical failure) seeds the vacuum Elias fills. Slight lens wobble: “vibrations of intent” flirt with Accumulative/Textural, yet the ending lands cleanly under Causal because the ship literally turns.</comment>

<comment>The cobalt tower, porous cork, and night-garden scent are not backdrop but technology: each constrains how Elias can act. Micro-setting triumph: the vial’s “ancient, porous cork” literally filters his fear, turning body into lighthouse apparatus. Spatial choreography is flawless—gallery walkway vs. lantern room vs. bridge miles away—tracked without exposition dump. Weather shift (heat wave → storm → raw dawn) is causal, not decorative: it kills the horn and births the mist that demands the whisper.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—save the drifting ship—signals inside 50 words and tightens twice: horn failure, then zero visibility. Protagonist agency is absolute: no deus ex machina, only Elias’s refraction of will through perfume. Cost is aromatically visible: the scent he releases is non-renewable, a piece of his private soul spent. One deepening beat suffices: the realization that a shout would panic, converting the whole tactic to whisper, foreclosing the keeper’s doctrine forever.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without slogan: tenderness as directed physics, not sentiment. Subtext in the final line—“the quietest force had screamed the loudest”—reweights every prior image of iron and steam. No moralizing, only a crystallized paradox. The scent’s night-bloom carries social cost: it recasts maritime rescue as intimate seduction, complicating heroism with erotic undertones that linger unresolved.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elias; no head-hop. Diction arcs from industrial—“cobalt tiles,” “fresnel lens”—to lush olfactory lexicon, mirroring the tactic shift. Syntax lengthens during projection (“a rich, intoxicating perfume…”) then collapses to exhausted brevity when he recorks, rhythmically embodying spent force. Perceptual signature is scent-anchored, a believable sensory obsession for a keeper starved of land.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Zero loops; each sentence advances image or causation. Metaphor density peaks only during scent-projection, justified by the beat’s surrealism. No mixed vehicles: scent = carrier wave is sustained. Read-aloud rhythm modulates: storm sentences crack with hard consonants, jasmine line flows on long vowels, mirroring swell/relief.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Familiar lighthouse-storm trope is inverted: rescue via perfume, not horn. The vial cork as “spiritual filter” weaponizes a domestic object into metaphysical tech, fresh without contrivance. Risk—silent salvation—pays off: reader feels the ship turn before being told. If relocated to desert outpost with sage-smoke, core logic collapses; specificity is irreplicable.</comment>
