<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Silas’s ink-stained fingers and frayed cuffs instantly individuate him; his “rusty-needle” voice and metaphor habit are consistent, embodied tics. The interior contradiction—earning bread by spreading scandal, yet privately erasing it—drives every action and is paid for in the hollow ache he pockets with the fee. Elena’s tremor and twenty-year guilt are credibly legible, but her beat-to-beat micro-choices are fewer, so the relationship crucible is felt more through her bodily reaction (frost-burn) than through active tactics. The final renunciation—accepting an unsmashed mirror—carries visible cost and is earned by the causality of failed grace, not by authorial fiat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds throughout: because Silas needs the pre-chainsaw hush to pressure the supernatural, therefore he times the ritual; because the apology is corrupted by resentment, the burn manifests; because the field collapses, the spirit snaps back and the hush shatters. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are locked by line 4; the Chevalier Archive’s spatial logic remains coherent. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the bottle is empty, the orchard roars, and Silas walks into “the debris of the morning”—a crystallized image where the cost (no clean absolution, world moving to ruin) is undeniable. No causal breaks, no convenient amnesia.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lignin-and-neglect air, grime-streaked windows, copper coils threaded through shelving—details are filtered through Silas’s technician gaze and constrain every tactical move. The perfume bottle’s cloudy glass and viscous residue become micro-setting that literally traps memory; its final emptiness recharges the closing image. The archive’s silence is not backdrop but resource: it is weaponized into a pressure cooker and then annihilated by the chainsaw roar that syncs with the spiritual collapse. Spatial choreography is flawless; bodies, generator, vapor, and shelving track cleanly without impossible drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can overdue apology purge twenty-year resentment?—is signaled in paragraph two. Escalation is one tight coil: cork pops → frost-burn → field collapse; each step is driven by Silas dialing current and Elena stepping forward, so agency is continuous. Cost is visceral (burn, empty bottle, hush shattered) and permanently forecloses the chance of a smiling absolution. Under causal lens, the tightening is singular but sufficient: options narrow from “maybe grace” to “only residue,” with the orchard saw audible proof that destruction proceeds anyway.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: absolution technology cannot transcend emotional physics—some stains remain. Subtext operates in gesture (the nod that accepts yet does not forgive) and in the final image of debris that literalizes the moral residue. No moralizing lines; the closest—“that is all the physics allows”—is delivered internally by Silas, whose vocation is physics, so it reads as vocational credo, not authorial nudge. The orchard’s fall reframes the whole ritual as a momentary pause inside inevitable destruction, reweighting the premise rather than resolving it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited clings to Silas’s technician perception; diction stays within his register—“induction cage,” “electromagnetic residue,” “readings spike”—never drifting into academic over-precision. Metaphor habit is voice-specific and rhythmically patterned, paid off when the final “broken mirror” line reprises the motif. Elena’s minimal dialogue is distinct: shorter, breathless, no metaphors, marking her as civilian outsider. No head-hopping; focalization remains locked until the final wide-shot exit, which is justified as environmental payoff.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Varied sentence cadence; no template churn. High-density lines—“the cork popped with a pistol crack”—do double duty (sound + danger). One moment of mild scaffold: “He took his fee from the table, feeling the usual hollow ache…” could compress, but it is four words past tight and does not touch closure. Metaphors (“rusty needle,” “broken mirror”) are controlled, never stacked; no mixed-vehicle accidents. Punctuation and tense flawless. The final image—“leaving the music and the ghosts behind in the dust”—is lean, resonant, propulsive.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fusing ghost story with electromagnetic engineering feels inevitable here because world-rules are consistent and metaphor is literalized: grief literally is a current induced in leftover residue. The perfumed vapor snapping into a jagged old-man shape is an image I haven’t seen; it arises from physics, not gothic cliché. Risk—using copper shelving as spirit-cage—pays off narratively and visually. Silas’s occupation (gossip columnist) is not window-dressing: it反面 his hollow ache and justifies his metaphor habit. Specificity throughout (lignin scent, frost-burn outline) prevents this from being a generic “unfinished business” tale.</comment>
