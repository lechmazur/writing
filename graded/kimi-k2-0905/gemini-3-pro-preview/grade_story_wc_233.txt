<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Isolde’s disenchantment is embodied in frozen fingertips and the decision to keep climbing; her quiet refusal to turn back crystallizes her hierarchy of values. The interior contradiction—queenly duty vs. death-ward draw—is dramatized, not labelled. Micro-choices (grip adjustment, stumble, final step into magma) track escalating cost. Final guardianship is earned: the crown’s weight is literally seared off.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Isolde sits inside the ember grotto while cosmic wounds still drip overhead—summer’s fragile shield vs. annihilation is legible and irreversible. Causal chain holds: climb → starlight contact → firefly ignition → mantle assumption. Orientation anchor (limestone ledge, final bell) arrives before word 120. Persistent constraint: skin-numbing cold that will not abate coats every subsequent move.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>“Lacy menace” wind, viscous star-blood that sizzles stone into lace-like nothingness—tactile specificity mirrors internal erosion. Cobalt crystal frequency and magma geode heat constrain tactics: only summer-heat repels cosmic corrosion. Spatial choreography clean: ledge → precipice → cavern mouth → ridge geode; droplet miss-by-an-inch tracks. Final image reuses “lace” as annihilation pattern, now held at bay by firefly lattice—setting charges closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—personal meaning vs. cosmic death—tightens when star-droplets begin to eat the floor, forcing a timed crossing. One meaningful reversal: terror → wonder when fireflies awaken; cost is visible skin-heat trade-off. Agency remains Isolde’s; Valerius only steadies her arm—no external rescue. Escalation is situational: pressure mounts through environment, not antagonist, culminating in earned stance crystallization.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: governance hollow until exchanged for stewardship of a seasonal spark. Bleeding starlight = cosmic indifference; fireflies = mundane biology defying it—reconfiguration felt in final image. No moral spelled; resonance left in ember-glow vs. open wounds overhead. Subtext carried by gesture: crown swapped for blistered palms.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Third-person close maintains queenly diction (“royal fingers,” “safety of heavy clouds”) yet compresses under altitude: sentences shorten on ridge. Metaphor layer (“lacy menace,” “weeping viscous light”) taught early and paid off in lace-pattern dissolution at end. No head-hop; Valerius’s fear shown only through Isolde’s perception. Rhythm modulates: lyrical openings tighten to staccato gasps during droplet-dodge.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>High information density: “freezing limestone,” “jagged face,” “cavernous mouth of blue crystal” in three brisk lines. No scaffold loops; each sentence advances position or stakes. Figurative language consistent—celestial wounds, lace void—without mixed metaphors. Occasional elevated diction (“viscous,” “caustic”) justified by royal POV and scientific Valerius lens.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Fusion of cosmic horror with summer firefly emergence feels fresh; trope inversion turns apocalypse into seasonal stewardship. Specificity of star-blood chemistry and insect thermoregulation grounds surreal frame. Risk taken: quiet seated ending in magma cradle while sky still bleeds—earned, not gimmick. Image of queen trading crown for tending a living spark reframes power without preaching.</comment>
