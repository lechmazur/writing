<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority is lush and embodied—her metallic breath, trembling hand, mercury tears. Motivation pivots on a credible, aromatically cautious flaw that culminates in the self-exposure of removing the mask; the cost is lung-deep and immediate. The single-scene crucible keeps father-memory off-stage, so relationship-as-crucible is N/A; no penalty. Micro-choice hierarchy (scent > safety > grief) is legible and paid for in the final image of the resealed vial.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of escalating sensory density (grey → neon → iridescent) tightens until the Lily’s bloom releases the blue cloud that reweights the stake. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: she reseals the vial, accepting perpetual haunting—Earned Stasis with felt cost (“dull, rhythmic ache”). No orientation debt; UV reveal rules taught on-page. Causality intact: because she risks inhalation, therefore memory floods, therefore she traps the ghost again.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Glass cathedral, UV-ignited pollen, and respirator straps all constrain the final gesture. The greenhouse’s humidity and spatialized scent function as proximate antagonists, forcing the mask-off decision. Micro-setting (crystal vial facets, iron case latch) doubles as tool and totem. Setting detail is selective—no tourist catalog—filtered through an olfactory-centric POV.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake: verify why scent mutilates her. Escalation = densifying visualized aroma that narrows options to inhale or retreat. Agency: she chooses full exposure, pays with hemorrhagic memory. Cost is on-page: “drops of mercury under the blacklight” and later ache. One meaningful tightening suffices; no external antagonist needed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulates: extinct flora, fossilized grief, and the impossibility of recovery. Subtext in gesture—resealing vial = choosing curated haunting over healing. No explicit thesis; final image reweights premise with conceptual cost: verified memory is still lost. Resists tidy moral; ambiguity lingers in “never truly recovered.”</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature is scent-obsessed, synesthetic. Diction—“wept freely…drops of mercury”—stays within POV lexicon. No dialogue, so dialogue bullets waived. Rhythm accelerates with short units during bloom release, breathes during tile-floor grief. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentence openings diversify. High info density: “crystal perfume vial, its sharp facets catching the dim starlight” shows object + light + mood in one stroke. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold. Metaphors congruent—“petals unspooled like wet silk”—no mixed vehicles. No artifacts in closure beat; final line is clean, resonant.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: aromatherapy ghost story meets extinct-plant noir. UV reveal of scent-cloud is non-obvious and visually unforgettable. Risk of sentimental olfactory nostalgia is embraced, then undercut by toxic blue cloud and resealed ghost. Specificity—Tankard’s Lily, brass respirator, mercury tears—anchors universals. Concept commits fully; no hedging.</comment>
