<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s calm restraint and transience are consistently embodied; her micro-choice to borrow the dog’s heartbeat crystallizes her values and costs her anonymity. The man’s arc is off-stage, but the mirror’s altered reflection supplies credible external evidence of her persuasion. Interiority stays concrete and specific to her perceptual lens. No contradiction under pressure, though secondary pressure (the man) is only implicit.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as a crisp Charged Poise: the bell scatters the light and the mirror snaps back, but the man is already moving—cost is the irreversible exposure of her intervention. Causal chain is tight: rain → prism → lullaby → heartbeat → image → bell break. Orientation is anchored by word 40; no lens ambiguity. The persistent constraint (acoustic suspension lost at bell) shapes every tactic and the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Wet-stone lilac air, droplet-lens parapet, and echoing terrace are filtered through Elara’s painter-eye; each sensory pick is立刻 exploited to bend light. The prism parapet literally constrains the spell mechanics; its post-rain state is the enabling resource. Spatial choreography is immaculate—body, mirror, dog, bell track cleanly. Micro-setting (mirror surface, vibrating droplets) charges the closure beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single dominant stake—get the illusion planted before the bell—signalled early and tightened by each rain-drop lens and heartbeat stitch. Agency is her decision to appropriate external life-force; the bell’s toll is the irreversible price that forecloses retry. Escalation is accumulative: each droplet aligned narrows time, intensifies risk. Cost is legible: the dog’s pulse is spent, her art is exposed, the man’s path is altered.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: the possibility of mending is shown, not preached; the mirror’s momentary lie becomes a truth the man chooses. Subtext sits in the lullaby’s innocence masking exploitation of the dog’s heartbeat—art’s beauty built on hidden cost. Final image reweights earlier motifs: bell = end of innocence, standing man = potential actualized. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers on who else might pay for her miracles.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person lyric hovers at poetic distance yet stays anchored to Elara’s sensorium: “prism parapet after rain,” “thousand tiny lenses.” Syntax lengthens during spell-casting to mimic light-bending, shortens at bell strike. No head-hop; perceptual signature is painterly, frequency-aware. Register holds without drift; no dialogue to test. Compression and elision are taught early (“elusive mirage painter”) and paid off in dissolution.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening, accelerating into the spell then fracturing at bell strike. Figurative language is sparse, each metaphor (droplets as lenses, lullaby as code) serves dual purpose—image + mechanic. Zero loops, no scaffold; “rain,” “droplet,” “light” recur only when physical state changes. Final clause “possibilities had been shown, and the seed…planted” is concise closure image without abstraction.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Fantasy trope of illusion-weaver is refreshed by acoustic physics, heartbeat theft, and architectural optics. Specificity of wet-stone lilac city and coded nursery rhyme makes the magic system feel discovered, not invented. The borrowed-dog pulse is a fresh cost for benevolent art. If transplanted to another city or artist, the mechanics collapse—integration is tight. Risk in quiet ending pays off: no battle, just a man standing, yet stakes feel world-sized to him.</comment>
