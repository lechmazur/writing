<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elara’s obsessive, embodied search for silence is visceral and consistent; her single micro-choice—tapping the stone at the triple intersection—earns the final hush. Interiority stays concrete (“the vibration traveled through bone”), never sliding into label-speak. The cost is palpable: she slumps, stone dulled to “common slate,” psyche bruised by the iron-weight silence. Only flaw: no contradictory impulse under peak pressure; she never falters, so the arc is linear rather than fractal.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure is a textbook Earned Stasis: the bloom of hush lands on-page, dissolves the beings, and leaves Elara pinned beneath a “warm blanket of iron.” Causal lens holds: each beat is “because/therefore” from first screech to final stillness. Orientation locked by line 3; no teleporting props. Cost is irreversible—stone spent, silence weaponized—meeting the 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Micro-setting—crack patterns in ice—functions as topographic map and tactical interface; it literally steers the tap that triggers the counter-song. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: she smells “ancient dust and ozone stink,” ignores visual décor unless it vibrates. The frozen lake’s density mirrors the eventual “hammered repose,” charging the final image. Spatial choreography is clean: kneel → tap → bloom expands → beings dissolve.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“quiet in the storm before mind fractures”—is signaled in paragraph two and tightened exactly once: the tap that forecloses all other frequencies. Escalation is causal under sonic assault; no coincidence. Price is immediate and irreversible: weaponized silence replaces her former guild craft. Could kiss 8.8 if a secondary cost (hearing loss, guild exile) were legible on-page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the reversal of cartography: instead of mapping sound, she maps silence into existence. Image of “hammered repose” reweights the premise—peace as metallic weight, not pastoral calm. No moralizing; the elders’ myth is paid off, not explained. Conceptual repricing lands when the hush becomes a “physical weight that pressed against her skin,” making silence a substance rather than absence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is rock- and vibration-obsessed: “scoured,” “ripple-mark,” “jagged crystalline lines.” Syntax is dense but breathable; rhythm accelerates into the single-sentence bloom, then collapses with Elara. No filter-verb stacks; diction stays within a caver’s lexicon. The one elision—how the hollow stone stores silence—is taught by ancestral myth and paid off acoustically, satisfying experimental tolerance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or synonym churn; each sentence advances sonic logic. Figurative language is spare and physical—“neon wire,” “iron blanket”—never mixed. Opening line anchors voice and stakes simultaneously. Micro-flaw: “gently luminous” appears twice in close proximity; a variance would sharpen contrast before the white flare.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses geomancy with acoustic warfare, a fresh synthesis that feels inevitable once executed. The echo chamber stone is not magical MacGuffin but geologic tool repurposed under siege. Risk—silence as weaponized mass—heightens meaning without obscuring clarity. Only hedge: energy beings remain abstract; a single concrete fragment of their prior victims could deepen moral stakes.</comment>
