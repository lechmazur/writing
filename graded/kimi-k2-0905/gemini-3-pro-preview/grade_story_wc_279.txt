<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elian’s “whimsical chalk artist” label is vivid but never complicates choices; his social perception is asserted, not dramatized via misreads or gambles. The interior contradiction is thin—he never seriously doubts his plan—so the final renunciation feels gentle, not costly. Still, the embodied sensorium of sand on wet stone and the wrist-flick that severs the mandala give us one sharp micro-choice that reveals hierarchy of values: art as ventriloquist for ghosts.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each beat (shard as antenna → sand map → sever knot) is a because/therefore linkage that narrows options until the emergent hush lands as Decisive Change with felt cost (ruined art, cold tile). Orientation is taught by the lilac mist and acoustic nexus within 120 words; no teleporting props. Closure beat—“the tile flake went cold”—pays the price and reweights the premise: order salvaged from dissolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The grotto is not backdrop; its weeping stone refuses chalk, forcing the sand pivot that drives climax. Mist color (bruised lilac) threads through emotional register and retreats only when silence is earned—setting as active constraint. Micro-setting object—the tile flake—changes temperature state to signal closure, satisfying 9+ gate. Spatial choreography is clean: knees, satchel, thumb-sweep track without drift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will the past be allowed to speak or to silence itself?—is signaled early and tightens through the acoustic feedback loop; the sever-knot is the single meaningful turn that forecloses the “let them keep arguing” option. Cost is visible: the mandala is ruined, the flake goes cold, Elian forfeits his prettiest art to purchase quiet. No escalation after that beat, but the one intensification is decisive and irreversible under causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges without thesis: memory’s desperate chatter vs. the grace of forgetting; the ruined mandala is the non-literal answer. Subtext lives in gesture—thumb severing color geometry is louder than any speech. Final image reweights earlier “whispering gallery” premise: silence can also be a collective voice. Avoids tidy moral; the lilac mist lifting is felt repricing, not explained.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person close stays latched to Elian’s synesthetic ear; perceptual signature is consistent—he hears social cues in dripping water, thinks in color-flow. Rhythm modulates: long clauses for cacophony, staccato “severed the central geometric knot” for hush. No head-hop; diction stays within artist’s lexicon. One register drift—“existential dread” leans clinical—but forgiven inside a thought that is immediately externalized into sand.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Sentences do double duty: “the chalk he usually favored was useless on the slick, weeping stone” simultaneously tags tool, obstacle, and stakes. No loops; metaphors stay coherent (mist as quilt, then as sugar). Information density high; no scaffold. Peak beat—“a path of negative space”—is clean, uncluttered. Minor filter verb in “He realized” but forgiven because next clause is an embodied mandala act.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: acoustic archaeology + sand mandala as moderator software for ghosts is non-obvious and inevitable in hindsight. Lilac mist tile-flake comeback in final line recharges opening image. Risk—using color geometry to “interject” visually into sound—pays off and is grounded in wave-cancellation physics without exposition. Whimsical artist trope is flipped into grief-technician; avoids quirky-for-quirk.</comment>
