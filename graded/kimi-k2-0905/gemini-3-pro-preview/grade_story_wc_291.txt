<comment>Silas’s prosopagnosia is dramatized through his “topographic maps of skin and bone” gaze and the decisive gesture of piercing the pupil; these micro-choices reveal hierarchy-of-values under pressure. The methodical trait is not merely labeled but enacted in the careful easel-leg check and the layered pastel/charcoal collision, grounding his interior contradiction. The moment the ribbon is pressed into wet fixative, his inability to “recognize the face” yet ability to provoke recognition in Miller crystallizes a credible, costly shift. Interiority stays concrete and avoids diagnostic label-speak even at the climax.</comment>

<comment>Mosaic accumulative lens holds: each layered stroke and texture repetition deepens the dominant stake—awakening communal empathy—until the final tear/ribbon fusion reconfigures meaning with visible conceptual cost (the detective’s “hardened expression crumbled”). Orientation anchors who/where by line 3, no debt. Closure is a Charged Poise: the image burns through the mist, undeniable, foreclosing indifference. The cost is legible in Miller’s hitched breath and the ribbon’s permanent adhesion; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The quarry’s slate-grey ground, jagged rock, and mist are not postcard scenery—they constrain Silas’s easel placement, supply the charcoal dust, and mirror the cold void he paints. The ribbon-as-micro-setting is handled twice: first as relic, finally as fused artifact that alters the portrait’s truth-status. Sensory hierarchy is POV-filtered: Silas notices texture, stability, reflected light—never faces. Final image is charged by the quarry’s persistent geometry and the ribbon’s tactile memory, reweighting the cold case stake.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>A single meaningful tightening occurs when the stylus lance perforates the canvas, converting abstract depiction into visceral wound; this escalates pressure under the Accumulative lens by breaking the surface and forcing the relic’s adhesion. The dominant stake—awakening empathy—was signaled early; the tightening narrows options from “image” to “undeniable ghost.” Cost is visible in Miller’s cracked composure and the irreversible tear. Agency is Silas’s deliberate artistic violation, not luck.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the collision of anonymity (face-blindness) and recognition (ribbon tear) without moralizing: the community’s learned indifference is lanced, not lectured. Subtext resides in the silence between Silas and Miller after the ribbon adheres—grief finally admitted. The final image reweights prior material: the festive silk against merciless rock becomes the town’s shared wound. No tidy moral; ambiguity lingers—Silas still cannot “see” her, yet the town now must.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person intimate stays locked to Silas’s tactile, geometric perception: “topographic maps of skin and bone,” “measured the distance between a jagged rock and the horizon.” Syntax grows clipped under pressure—“With a sudden, decisive movement, he used the tool to lance…” mirroring the stylus stab. No head-hopping; Miller’s interiority is revealed only through externally observed “breath hitching” and “hardened expression crumbled,” maintaining POV discipline. Voice texture is distinct and sustained.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes: long layered sentences for pastels, staccato for the lance. No synonym loops or template cadence; “charcoal,” “slate-grey,” “fixative” are precise, not purple. Information density high—“the tiny tear…mimicking the reflection of a soul realizing its end” does triple duty: image, metaphor, cost. Only micro-slip: “dampening sound until the world was reduced to a furrowed hush” leans toward poetic filler, but it is isolated and early, never touches closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Fusing prosopagnosia with cold-case portraiture is a fresh, non-obvious angle; the method of “unifying opposites” (soft pastel vs. jagged charcoal) is dramatized, not asserted. The ribbon relic evolves from static clue to living suture in the image—inevitable yet surprising. Risky choice to make the protagonist neurologically unable to “see” the victim pays off by making the viewer surrogate (Miller) bear the recognition cost. Conceptual integrity holds: no retreat into easy sentiment.</comment>
