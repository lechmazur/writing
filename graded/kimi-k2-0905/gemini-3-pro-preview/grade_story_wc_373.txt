<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is concrete—her itch-feint, the vial palmed like a pulse—but the “curiously steadfast” tag is asserted more than dramatized; still, her micro-choices under silence build a credible hierarchy of values and the final cost (trapping betrayal while forfeiting the fob) is legible, so the arc earns its renunciation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: itch-feint → reset murder rhythm → sunrise deadline → lunge → vial snap; the truce-of-hush rule is taught early and pays off when Kael’s snarl breaks it, giving a clean Decisive Change with audible cost. Orientation is anchored by line 3; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Brine-soaked pier, barnacle table, and creeping dawn are selective, pressure-filtered details; the watch-fob’s flaking gold reweights meaning at climax, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography stays clean across feints and lunge.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</question><comment>Dominant stake—capture the sound of trust-breaking—is signaled early; each feint tightens Kael’s frustration and narrows Elara’s window, forcing the final trade (fob for vial). Sunrise clock is tracked via bruised-purple horizon, keeping time legible and costly.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme of silence-as-weapon emerges through gesture, not thesis; betrayal’s audible snap literalizes the motif without moralizing. Final image of dust motes in first light reweights prior unease into warm satisfaction—an earned, non-literal answer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person intimate maintains consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature—“brine-soaked dark felt like heavy wool”—is character-specific, rhythm modulates under pressure, and no head-hop occurs. Diction stays within Elara’s sensorial lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong verb choices (“snatched,” “capped”), economical metaphors, and sentence variety propel without loops; only minor filter verbs (“felt like”) intrude. No scaffold or mixed metaphors in peak beats; closure image is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8</grade><comment>Silence-as-currency plus betrayal-distillation gives a fresh inflection on familiar smuggler-trope; the audible snap of trust-breaking is a memorable, non-obvious payoff. Risk stays integral to stakes, not gimmick.</comment>
