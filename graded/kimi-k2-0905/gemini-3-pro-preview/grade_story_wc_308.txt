<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The harmonic stone skimmer’s profession is vividly shown through concrete action and embodied listening; his interior contradiction (yearning to escape yet anchored by his own past scream) is dramatized in real time. The micro-choice to synchronize the throw with the ghost-echo visibly costs him decades of regret and physically buckles his stance, earning the closure. No second character appears, so relationship/status bullets are waived; the single-POV interiority stays specific, never lapsing into label-speak. The only minor slip is a touch of retrospective self-mythologizing in “master of an esoteric art,” but it is quickly grounded by tactile detail.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The closure is a crisp Conceptual Repricing: the exit route is re-weighted by the geometry of reflected noise, forcing the reader to feel the cost of decades lost. Causal linkage is tight—because he maps the air via the crows, therefore he can throw to intersect the old scream, so the canyon reconfigures possibility. Anchors (who/where/when) are locked by line 3 and never drift; orientation serves the final echo-payoff. The persistent constraint—“his ankles buried through centuries of dust”—shapes every tactic and is re-echoed in the final image of walking out.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The bone-tower canyon is not postcard backdrop; its hollow acoustic ribs are exploited as the literal instrument that enables the climax. Micro-setting (the obsidian arrowhead) functions as navigational stylus and is handled repeatedly, altering tactics each time. Sensory hierarchy obeys aural urgency—every visual note (crow arcs, calcium glare) is filtered through sound-propagation stakes. Spatial choreography is flawless: the arrow’s ricochet path is trackable, and the distant femur strike is credibly audible.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</question><comment>The dominant stake—“escape the canyon that holds his own scream”—is signaled in line 1 and tightens when the ghost-echo interference blooms. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length: the fresh tone intersecting the ancient pulse narrows options to a single exit vector with visible cost (shattered obsidian, knees creaking to walk). No antagonist is needed; the canyon itself exerts coherent situational pressure. The price is undeniable: decades of dust collapse into the first step he now takes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: trapped sound as metaphor for irreversible past, escape achieved only by amplifying the very echo one wants to flee. Subtext lives in gesture—the thumb on volcanic glass, the ankle grinding dust—never in exposition. Final image of walking “where the birds would refuse to fly” reweights earlier crow-map as moral map: flightless zones are now freedom. No tidy moral; ambiguity lingers in whether the exit is salvation or another loop.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays welded to Silas’s perceptual signature: every descriptor is tuned to acoustic properties (density, hush, tremolo). Psychic distance compresses under peak stress—sentence fragments mimic skipped heartbeats when the interference blooms. No dialogue appears, so dialogue bullets are waived. Diction remains within a weathered listener’s lexicon; no register drift even at highest tension.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet transparent: “calcified ribs,” “vicious hum,” “melancholy frequency” all do double duty—evoke body, motion, and tone in one stroke. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances either map-making or memory. Rhythm mirrors skipping stone: short percussive clauses for impacts, longer legato lines for echo-ride. No mixed metaphors; volcanic glass logic stays consistent from knap to shatter.</question>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The premise—navigating by sound-skipped stones in a bone canyon to find one’s own decades-old scream—is non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Risky compression (entire life in 740 words) pays off because the closure image reprises every motif without strain. Specificity of “harmonic stone skimmer” as profession feels discovered, not invented for prompt. Tropes (lost old man, canyon as labyrinth) are re-forged through acoustic physics rather than metaphoric fiat.</comment>
