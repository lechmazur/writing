<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elias’s nicotine-stained fingers, trembling chart-smoothing, and the cigarette he lights at the end give a consistent, embodied sense of a man who has traded reputation for survival; the interior contradiction between academic rigor he abandoned and the precision he still deploys is visible. Micro-choices—aligning phase variance, slamming the fader—map onto his hierarchy of values: town survival > personal safety > academic purity. No secondary character on page, so status crucible waived. The renunciation of heroics for physics-alone counterstrike lands as earned stasis, but the “hopeful” tag feels tacked on rather than wrested from visible residual fear.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: because the entities hit perigee, Elias therefore engineers destructive interference; the final silence on the quad is legible pay-off. Orientation is crisp by word 60; ley-line and perigee logic stay internally consistent. Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration—torches lower, lethargy replaces frenzy—so the because/therefore chain is intact. Cost is present (fried transmitter risk, town’s future vulnerability) but understated; the “hopeful” coda softens the price’s bite, keeping the score just below the 8.8 gate.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The cigarette-scarred booth, ozone-laced air, and flickering torchlight outside compress inside/outside tension into sensory economy. Micro-setting—patch cables, VU meters bending against plastic—functions as the only weapon Elias has, directly constraining the climax. Ley-line detail is brief but causal, not tourist. Spatial choreography is clean: glass window, master fader, oscilloscope all track. Final smoke curling toward ducts re-anchors the body in the room after cosmic scale, charging the closing image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prevent massacre via counter-signal—is signaled by paragraph 3. Escalation is single but decisive: perigee maximizes leverage → subsonic wave forecloses that option → mobs stall. Agency is all Elias; no coin-flip resolution. Visible price is the transmitter overload and the implied next attempt by the entities, but on-page cost is more technical than visceral, capping entry to 8.8 band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme of “cosmic tricksters vs. improvised human physics” emerges through action, not lecture. Subtext quietly asks how many more nights can be bought with makeshift science—question lives in the dust-and-smoke final image. Avoids moral binaries: no hymn to human triumph, just a quieter quad. The hopeful tag is stated, not dramatized, trimming the score from the 8-band.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person tight stays locked to Elias’s perceptual filter: “menacing vibration that seemed to rattle the very fillings” is subjective, not omniscient. Diction—“ethereal grit,” “poison pill,” “shadow-broadcast”—is patterned early and payoff-coherent at climax. Rhythm accelerates with paratactic clauses during fader slam, then exhales into flat-line oscilloscope. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk zero. Filter verbs (“seemed,” “felt”) are voice-motivated uncertainty, not slackness.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Sentences carry double duty: “the air smelled of stale coffee and ozone, a perfect distillation of ethereal grit” marries atmosphere to theme. Figurative control holds—no mixed metaphors under peak pressure. One minor paraphrase loop: “the signal was not just noise; it was the engine...” restates in consecutive lines, −0.2. Opening and closing images (red light → smoke in ducts) create tidy envelope without scaffolding. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with scene tempo; no template cadence detected.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Combines cosmic-horror tropes with campus-radio tech in a fresh synthesis; the ley-line transmitter as weapon against psychic vampirism feels non-obvious. Specificity—hand-drawn charts of dark sectors, VU needles bending—prevents swap-for-generic. Tricksters-as-feeders notion is familiar, but using subsonic phase-cancellation as foil rescues it from cliché. Risk is moderate, payoff clean; not groundbreaking enough for 8.8+ but well above safe middle.</comment>
