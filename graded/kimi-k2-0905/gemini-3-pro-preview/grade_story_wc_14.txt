<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elara’s artisanal obsession is vividly embodied, but her contradictory impulses appear mostly in summary (“incandescent restraint that barely contained…”) rather than dramatized under threat; no credible second choice or cost is risked, so the arc feels ornamental rather than crucible-tested.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure delivers a crisp Charged Poise: the forged memory lands with tactile cost (“cold, sharp echo…pulse against her skin”), satisfying lens consistency; causal chain is thin—why this exact lamp angle matters is asserted, not demonstrated—but the ending reconfigures stakes cleanly, fulfilling the Accumulative/Textural drive.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Bonsai mountaintop reframes the portable lamp as alien intruder, constraining Elara’s micro-movements; the fluorescent buzz as micro-setting charges the final texture. Sensory hierarchy stays anchored to her artisanal eye; spatial choreography never falters. One of the few elements that would break if transposed.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Stake—fabricate a ghost-memory for a client—remains abstract; no visible tightening or price threatens failure; the dip in lamp pitch is purely technical, not an irreversible fork. Escalation is atmospheric accumulation rather than option-narrowing; cost is asserted sensorially at the end but not paid through a trade-off mid-scene.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of curated nostalgia emerges through sensory particulars, not thesis: “a memory that never belonged to her…manufacture for a wealthy client” crystallizes cultural critique. Final image of guardian of false memories lands with oblique moral weight, avoiding moralism. Lacks a concrete counter-reading because client and society stay off-page.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person POV maintains artisanal distance consistent with “gilded-leaf stationer”; diction (“incandescent restraint,” “sonic signature of loneliness”) is character-specific without purple drift; rhythmic compression mirrors her focused ritual. No head-hop or filter-verb bloat; psychic distance stays controlled.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Sentences vary in length and cadence; imagery is dense yet targeted. A single mixed metaphor (“bleeding sky” beside “gold leaf shimmered, absorbing…sonic vibration”) momentarily fuses visual and acoustic but remains legible. No paraphrase loops, scaffolding, or algorithmic repetition; prop tracking (notepad, prism, lamp) is seamless.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Concept of forging history into stationery is fresh, but execution leans on artisanal atmospherics rather than revealed societal cost; miniature bonsai + ugly fluorescent juxtaposition supplies memorable image set. Risk is aesthetic, not moral—story never questions client complicity—so boldness feels hedged. Specificity of gilded texture manufacture keeps it from feeling purely decorative.</comment>
