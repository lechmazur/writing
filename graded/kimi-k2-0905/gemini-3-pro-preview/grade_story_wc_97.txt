<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s steely longing is shown through embodied micro-choices—trembling fingers on the clock, the decisive walk into the projector beam—so the interior contradiction registers. The final renunciation (accepting the finite encore in the arbor) is causally linked to his earlier refusal to evacuate, and the cost—eternal disappearance—is legible in the applause-darkness image. Yet the absence of any second character keeps status/relationship pressure off the table, so the arc, while taut, is solo-note. Still, within the single-POV default, the motivation→action→cost chain holds cleanly.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The causal lattice is airtight: fraying compass → stay-behind choice → clock mainspring rig → film-reel portal → arbor piano → bulb-death exit. Each step forecloses the previous option; the projector bulb’s finite life is the persistent constraint that shapes the final tempo. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the last chord dissolves into applause-shaped darkness, reweighting the entire escape as a stolen grace whose price is already spent. No orientation debt; who/where/when is crystal by line 50 and the lens (Causal) stays pure to the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The station’s bruised-purple sky and delirious compasses are immediate sensory hooks; the arbor’s swaying lattice and cloud-tide currents are tactile and POV-filtered. The broken clock and projector are handled, manipulated, and evolve state (spring tension, bulb drain), satisfying the 9+ gate that objects constrain tactics. Spatial choreography is flawless—bodies, light-cone, piano bench track cleanly. Only the arbor’s physics is lightly sketched, but that ethereality is genre-earned, not vague.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—"one last encore before erasure"—is signaled in paragraph one and tightened twice: first when the mainspring rigs the projector (tool loss), then when the sun dips toward the cloud sea (time loss). Each tightening is protagonist-driven, not coincidence. The cost is visible—bulb life, station dissolution—but the price feels slightly abstract until the final applause-darkness; a more visceral forfeiture (finger blister, memory shred) would have pushed higher. Still, the escalation obeys causal lens and forecloses retreat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as the right to author one’s own ending: the encore is not denial of death but reclamation of agency over narrative closure. No thematic statements are uttered; meaning accrues through the recurring "applause" motif that reweights from metaphor to literal darkness. The final image—darkness as applause—offers a non-literal, resonant answer without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers: is this victory or delusion? The story lets both readings stand, satisfying complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person intimate stays locked to Elias with no head-hop; perceptual signature is pianist-specific—"cold keys," "frantic rhythm of the shutter," "notes drifted out over the cloud tides." Syntax mirrors tempo: clipped clauses during portal breach, legato cadences in the arbor. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk is zero. Diction ("delirious compasses," "spectral piano") is elevated yet consistent with a man who names the world in musical idiom.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or causation. Figurative language is sparse, precise, and physics-loyal: "sky was a bruised purple" is immediate, not overwrought. High information density—every noun doubled as prop or constraint. Rhythm breathes with scene tempo: staccato during build, lengthened sentences in arbor calm. No mixed metaphors, no filter-verb stacks, no late artifacts. Opening and closing lines are ear-tested and propulsive.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The film-reel portal is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis of analog tech and metaphysical escape; it feels inevitable only in hindsight. Tropes (dying station, lone artist) are transformed through clock-work mechanics and black-and-white celluloid physics. Risk is high—concept could have collapsed into gimmick—but causality keeps it grounded. Specificity of the tidal arbor and mainspring rigging prevents generic substitution; remove any piece and the story logic fractures.</comment>
