<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is concrete and profession-specific; her micro-choice to risk the spirit by “synchronizing the dream cameos” crystallizes her hierarchy of values. The embodied contradiction—clutching a heat-warped globe inside a glacier shrine—makes her obsession tactile. One minor slip: “singular and unyielding” motivation is told, not shown, just before the final beat. Still, the renunciation of grief lands with cost: the shrine’s air lightens, foreclosing her habitual nightly communion.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the melted globe is repriced from debris to “testament,” lifting grief off the artifact under the candles’ flare. Accumulative lens holds: each dream cameo thickens the pattern until the final image reweights meaning. Causality is clean—no late rules or teleporting props. The 0.9 is withheld only because the boy’s heroic choice is revealed summarily, not dramatized on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The glacier shrine is not backdrop; its crushing silence and ice-sculpted exit-frames echo the boy’s bulkhead door, constraining Elara’s cartography of dreams. Candle-lit ice glow and “borrowed starlight” are sensory, selective, and POV-filtered. Spatial choreography is flawless: globe tracked from scorched liner to fur-covered altar. The micro-setting of the warped sphere itself functions as charged environment in the final beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“salvage something pure”—is signaled early; pressure tightens when each dream cameo risks “static” that could shatter the remnant. Accumulative escalation: density of cameos increases until the exit-door pattern crystallizes, forcing the final sync. No visible price is paid by Elara beyond cognitive strain, so ceiling is 8.4; an 8.5+ would require a forfeiture dramatized on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the inversion of debris into relic of courage; no authorial statement intrudes. The melted globe’s repricing is earned through specific dream sightings, not abstraction. Final image of lifted grief offers quiet, non-moralizing resonance. Minor deduction for “salvage something pure” edging toward prompt-echo, but the phrase is buried mid-text, not sermonized at the end.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise: “cryosphere,” “cartography of the subconscious,” “windows of connection”—each phrase teaches the pattern early and pays off at closure. Rhythm modulates: longer cadence for shrine calm, staccato noun clusters for dream fragments. No head-hopping; POV remains interior to Elara. Filter verbs are minimal and voice-motivated; perceptual signature is consistent throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; sentences carry double duty (e.g., “trapping the miniature winter scene inside a permanent, impossible swirl” fuses description with theme). Figurative language is sparse, never muddled; ice/candle metaphors stay consistent. Opening and final lines anchor and recharge the motif. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with the shrine’s hush, tightening only in the sync beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The dream-cameo cartography as a ghost-whispering technique is genuinely fresh, not a trope repaint. Risk—using global dream archives as narrative engine—pays off without exposition dump. Synthesis of cryosphere shrine + melted globe + exit-door pattern feels inevitable in hindsight. Specificity throughout prevents the concept from sliding into abstraction.</comment>
