<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s insomnia-driven obsession is viscerally embodied; every brush-stance and salt-crusted blink feels earned. The filter-for-brooch swap crystallizes his hierarchy of values—art over survival—with a cost that trembles in his pocketed fingers. Interior contradiction is alive: he both mocks “philosophy while the world drowned” and kneels to it. Minor slip: the scavenger’s interiority is ventriloquized for one beat (“voice a dry rasp”), but Elias’s lens recovers immediately.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: insomnia → rain-trail → tunnel reveal → amber → filter trade → painting vow, each because/therefore linkage narrowing options. Closure is a Charged Poise: the brooch in pocket reweights “witness” into “maker,” cost felt in the filter he will soon thirst for. No teleports; geography tracks as tide rises. The subway rib/coral image is the on-page DC that makes the ruin newly legible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The Needle’s volcanic ash, oily rain, and sheared limestone actively funnel Elias to the northern overhang; terrain is antagonist. Micro-setting—the brooch’s honeyed light against storm-bruised sky—charges the final canvas decision. Sensory hierarchy obeys insomnia: grit in eyes, salt skin, sound of surf never blunted. Spatial choreography is immaculate; no impossible positions across slick descent and ascent.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake: distill world-ruin into pigment before sleep claims him. Escalation is one sustained tightening: tide rises, tunnel disappears, filter gone—each step shrinks future options. The swap is protagonist-forced; luck only exposes, never saves. Cost is visible—filtration straw leaves his neck; thirst is now unfiltered.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the amber’s fossilized stasis versus oceanic entropy; no moral is stated, only pocketed. The brooch’s “prehistoric gnat” re-prices time: endurance is not victory but witness. Subtext sits in the silence after swap: both know the filter will fail before the amber cracks. Final image—painting “a speck of memory in the dark”—offers resonant, non-literal answer to how art thresholds experience.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is insomnia-sanded: syntax fragments under storm pressure, verbs salt-crusted. Perceptual signature is painterly—hue of decay, pigment versus void—never generic. Free indirect slips clean: “he needed the crystallized time” stays inside Elias’s lexicon. No head-hop; scavenger’s dialogue is externally observed only.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm mirrors tide: long accumulative clauses that crash into fragment shards. No loops; “rain trails” returns only when image reweights. Metaphors stay physically coherent—“metal teeth of the ruins” bites coral without contradiction. Final line cadence—“slow, magnificent end of things”—earns its abstraction through prior concrete losses.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Post-water-war subway reef is fresh synthesis; ruin is not backdrop but revealed anatomy. Amber as art-currency feels inevitable yet unwritten. Risk taken: trading potable water for beauty is a moral calculus rarely dramatized with such tangible thirst. Could tip toward allegory, but specificity of filter straw and salt-stiff canvas keeps it grounded.</comment>
