<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara’s ache for “texture of connection” is concrete; her mid-scene invention (carbide lens) is a credible micro-choice driven by that ache. The embodied shock Kael feels gives visible cost to her breakthrough. Interiority stays specific, not diagnostic. One minus: Kael’s arc is observation-only, so relationship crucible is absent.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Decisive Change with felt cost: the beam physically hits Kael, proving past can touch present. Causal lens holds: because Elara questions her own tool, she refocuses light into touch, therefore Kael receives the laugh. Orientation anchored by word 60. No telegraphing or soft resets.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>“Laboratory of Lost Sounds” is more than postcard: its acoustic damping swallows voices, forcing Elara’s tactile workaround. Carbide lens, velvet stand, and the prism-song construct are handled, not catalogued. Golden shadows return in the final image, mirroring the amber light that becomes touch.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can analog memory regain bodily truth?—tightens when digital relic fails Kael. Single escalation: Elara’s lens invention narrows options to one risky physical act; cost is the tactile blow itself. Agency is hers; coincidence absent. Pressure stays coherent under causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges without sermon: memory needs matter, not data. Final image of “golden shadows” solidifying reweights earlier light-play into flesh. No character names the moral; the body receives it. Subtext resides in the lens—an obsolete miner’s tool—re-purposed to excavate feeling.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elara’s perceptual filter: she spots the lens “salvaged,” feels “fingers tingling.” Syntax lengthens under wonder, contracts at the strike. No head-hopping. Dialogue minimal, idiom unobtrusive, serves as action.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence. “Heavy oak doors groaned” gives sound-tactile hinge. Mixed metaphors absent. High density: one sentence jobs—light converts, lens focuses, ribs receive. No loops, no filter-verb stacks, no purple patches.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fusing obsolete audio tech with synesthetic physics feels fresh yet inevitable. Carbide lamp lens repurposed as emotional prosthetic is a specific, non-obvious synthesis. Risk—turning light into mass—pays off without breaking internal logic. Premise could not swap names unchanged.</comment>
