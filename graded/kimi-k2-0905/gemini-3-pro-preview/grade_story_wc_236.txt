<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is vivid—his smell-loss reframes perception through jaw-tension and step-hesitation, not labels. The midwife-screw choice embodies his substitution of tactile legacy for lost scent, and the moment he places it on velvet crystallizes a micro-choice that alters Kael’s stance. No contradictory impulses are shown in scene, only asserted, keeping this just below the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the clock’s new heartbeat and Kael’s single nod reconfigure the shop’s emotional economy with felt cost—Elias’s perpetual sensory exile. Causal lens holds throughout: screw → valve → rhythm → nod, each step a because/therefore. Anchor (who/where/when) is clean by line 4; no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The shop is lived-in: humidity clings like a coat, fog presses the pane, cedar oil and mold are handled while characters move. The midwife screw acts as micro-setting that constrains the final mechanical fix. Single-shard scope favors this density; environment mirrors internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake: can Elias restore meaningful perception to a broken world? Pressure tightens once—screw trial → steady drip → nod—narrowing options from chaos to heartbeat. Cost is conceptual but legible: Elias trades nostalgia for functional beauty, accepting permanent sensory exile. Agency is present but singular; no secondary reversal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: substitution of tactile legacy for lost scent, the ordinary miracle of a rusted screw saving time. No explicit moral; final image of “damp silence” reweights earlier sensory absence into quiet triumph. Subtext in Kael’s nod speaks gratitude Elias cannot smell. Avoids tidy thesis yet feels complete.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</question><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elias’s perceptual grammar—“maps emotional terrain by watching micro-tension”—without filter-verb bloat. Syntax breathes with fog-damp rhythm; diction stays within artisanal lexicon. No dialogue contamination; Kael’s two gruff lines carry subtext through action beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is lean, high-density: “humid air clinging like a second, heavier coat” does three jobs (touch, mood, body). No scaffold loops; figurative language is sparse and patterned. One mixed metaphor (“ghost of itself”) is minor; does not touch closure. Sentence variety sustains read-aloud ear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: anosmic aromatherapist + water-clock shop + midwife screw fuses olfactory loss with liquid time. Risk—rust screw in brass clock—pays off emotionally and mechanically. Specificity of thread pitch and cedar oil prevents generic steampunk décor. Premise feels inevitable only after it happens.</comment>
