<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elian’s guilt-driven precision and the tremor in his hands give embodied, contradictory emotion; the brother-spirit twist is foreshadowed by “same sea” and lands with felt cost. One micro-choice—threading the final silence—crystallizes renunciation. Interiority stays concrete, never drifts into label-speak. The only missed beat is a slightly abstract “unrest would never settle” summary at the end.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each unraveled knot → denser silence → quieter mask. Closure is a Decisive Change with visible cost: the needle clatters, starlight freezes, Elian’s heart becomes war-drum. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are clear by line 3; prism sanctuary grounds optical logic that later pays off in frozen starlight. No telegraphing or plot amnesia; theft secret is revealed precisely when it re-weights the stakes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Glass prism walls actively dissect light and later freeze it, constraining the final image—environment as tactic. Net’s “fibrous architecture” and brine-stench are tactile, lived-in; spatial choreography tracks needle, hemp, mask without drift. Sensory selection narrows to heartbeat-drum under accumulating silence. Micro-setting (the mask fissure) functions as crucible for the closure beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—trap the scream—tightens through each knot; silence accumulates as visible price pressing on sternum and eardrums. One meaningful reversal: final knot releases the silence that chokes the mask, foreclosing escape. Agency is Elian’s fingers, not coincidence. Cost is legible: his own heartbeat becomes enemy drum, brother entombed in violent quiet.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of stolen silence/self-created prison emerges from image pattern (net, mask, prism) rather than statement. Final image—Elian touching the empty cheek—reweights guilt as perpetual cage, no moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture: needle = harpoon, knot = noose. Resonant ambiguity lingers: who is truly caught?</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains psychic distance; diction (“optical cage,” “psychic shriek”) stays inside restorer’s lexicon. Rhythm accelerates with short clauses during unraveling, then freezes into single-sentence final beat. No head-hopping; starlight, net, mask all filtered through Elian’s guilt-laced perception. Whale-bone needle, Nö-mask, and prism lexicon create distinct occupational texture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances atmosphere or causality. Syntax alternates between sinuous preparatory clauses and hammer-blow fragments (“The mask was whole again.”). Mixed metaphors avoided—silence as syrup, weight as lead—stay coherent. Only hairline slip: “restless spirits” skirts cliché but is immediately re-tethered to material action.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses Japanese Nö-mask restoration with maritime ghost-metaphysics; net-as-silence-battery feels non-obvious. Risk of optical cage and psychic scream pays off by literalizing silence as palpable mass. Transformation test fails if mask/net swapped—specificity is inseparable. Fresh inflection: silence becomes a violent positive presence rather than mere absence.</comment>
