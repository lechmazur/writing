<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and profession-specific; her “scientific mind” surfaces in the deliberate scan of rust patterns before the climb. Contradictory impulses—scientific curiosity vs. self-preservation—are shown, not told, as she pockets the tube while the gate splinters. The final stance (preserve data, forfeit station) carries earned cost, though the pigeon beat leans on convenient compliance rather than active choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Charged Poise: she is perched above her ruined life, thumb on the tube, options re-priced. Causal chain (pursuit → lateral escape → data saved) holds under Causal lens; the tube’s arrival is coincidence that complicates, not resolves. The orientation anchors (who/when/where) are crystalline by line 4; no debt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The courtyard micro-setting constrains every move: the decorative ridge dictates the lateral route, the ivy provides concealment, the ruined instruments below supply the visceral cost. Dusk purple shadows mirror interior eclipse without overt symbolism. Tool-as-setting (brass instruments) is tactile and choice-driving. Spatial choreography is flawless; no impossible positions.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—protect uncorrupted data—tightens the instant the gate creaks; escalation is one continuous because/therefore slope. The lateral traverse is a visible tactic shaped by persistent constraint (no silhouette, no drop). Cost is concrete: lifelong station destroyed on-page; felt price in the silent balcony landing.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of truth vs. sanctioned reality emerges through the smashed instruments and salvaged tube; no explicit thesis. Subtext lives in the absurdity of a pigeon in a dead-zone—truth resorting to pre-digital means. Final image re-weights integrity as something portable, not architectural. Quiet avoidance of moralizing keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited remains locked to Elara’s meteorologist gaze: “unnatural weather patterns,” “rust patterns and the grip of the vines.” Syntax lengthens under stress then chops as the gate gives way, mirroring breath. No head-hop; perceptual signature is consistent and profession-specific. Carrier pigeon arrival is filtered through her credulity, not authorial sleight.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>High information density: “heavy iron bolt…stone enclosure” does triple duty—sound, weight, prison tone. No filler verbs; every participle propels (“slid,” “retreating,” “smashed”). One metaphor string permitted and paid off: “breaking glass echoed like wind chimes in a gale.” Rhythm modulates from languid dusk to staccato destruction without monotony.</comment>

<comment>Rogue quarantine for “ideological contagion” flips familiar bio-thriller terrain; pigeon-as-internet is a fresh, low-tech reversion. Lateral traverse as escape method is physically specific and unexpected. Core ideas are synthesized through Elara’s vocation rather than dumped, though the premise nods to genre tropes without full inversion.</comment>
