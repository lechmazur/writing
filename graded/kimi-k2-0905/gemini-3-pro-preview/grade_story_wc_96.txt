<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elias’s monthly personality molt is stated but never dramatized as an on-page cost—no moment shows him losing a skill, memory, or relationship. The Architect stance is vivid in gesture and speech, yet the interior contradiction between old/new selves is asserted rather than enacted. Silas functions as loyal witness without status friction or secondary pressure. The Earned Stasis is credible because the garden act forecloses stealth, but the emotional price is generalized (“invincible certainty”) rather than particularized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: because the Weeper has vanished, therefore the Architect can plant; because they plant, they accept exposure. Orientation is clean by 50 words; moonrise acts as a taught temporal trigger that tightens the final beat. Closure is a Charged Poise: the seeds in cracked concrete reconfigure risk from stealth to spectacle, cost legible in the irreversible act. One scaffold dent: “It is beginning” restates the already-shown initiation; trim for 9-band.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The rusted girders, broken glass stars, and moonlit rotunda actively constrain tactics—garden geometry follows actual fissures. Micro-setting (coffee tin) doubles as tool and talisman, its false-bottom click echoing the library’s structural fracture. Sensory hierarchy skews visual, yet the single tactile beat—“dirt under their fingernails”—grounds the blessing image. Environment is inseparable from the rebellion design; removing the decayed library obviates the guerrilla-garden premise.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—beauty-out-of-ruin—is signaled in opening paragraph and tightened when the tin is buried, trading stealth for floral visibility. Agency is dual but coherent: Silas hauls scrap, Elias dictates placement; both accept the same exposure cost. No external antagonist needed; the implicit patrol suffices as environmental pressure. The moonlit planting is a single decisive turn that narrows options—no retreat once seeds are recorded by lunar witness.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the concrete inversion of garbage-into-garden; no character sermonizes. The coffee tin’s transformation (waste vessel → seed vault) performs the theme silently. Final image—moonlight on dirt under fingernails—offers non-literal answer: contamination is consecration. Resists moral binary: no guarantee flowers will survive, yet act itself is the rebuttal to nihilism.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Narration wields a builder’s diction—“geometry,” “fissure,” “veins of silver”—mirroring Architect POV. Rhythm accelerates across stacking imperatives: “Here…pack…done.” Filter verbs avoided; perception is tactile and visual. Dialogue brief, idiomatic, subtextual—“They expect fire”—voice distinction maintained. No head-hop; Silas’s interior stays opaque, appropriate to Elias’s monotropic lens.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening structure; high information density—“sled of salvaged scrap metal” does triple work (object, effort, sound). Metaphors stay physically coherent: rust as veins, glass as diamonds. One mixed image—“violet bruise of the atmosphere”—is vivid yet risks color clash; minor. No paraphrase loops; each line advances scene or atmosphere. Final line cadence earns its declaration via prior image accumulation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Guerrilla gardening in post-collapse library is fresh, but “poems on pavement” and “gardens in gutters” flirt with slogan. The personality-molt hook promises deeper disruption than delivered—monthly cycle compressed to single night. Coffee-tin seed cache is a lovely concrete invention. Overall synthesis feels inevitable yet not radically unprecedented; risk is present but hedged by lyric safety.</comment>
