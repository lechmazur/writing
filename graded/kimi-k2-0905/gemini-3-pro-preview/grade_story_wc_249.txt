<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Kael’s drumming-as-echolocation and willingness to trade sanity for shared eternity are concrete, embodied, and costly; the interior contradiction between passive compliance and secret rebellion is dramatized in scene. Grief is shown through tactile rhythm and the auric lagoon vision, never labeled. Micro-choices (perching on the tank, tempo shift) reveal value hierarchy. The final renunciation is earned by the established pattern and carries visible cost.

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: because Kael drums, the garden’s harmonics shift → therefore he can fuse memories → therefore laboratory walls dissolve. Closure is a Decisive Change with felt cost: his body is seized by scientists while his consciousness escapes, trading waking life for dream-solidified eternity. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) appear by line 3; world rule (sound → flora) is taught early and pays off at the jump. No lens ambiguity; cost is legible in the final image of golden water under sorrow-aurora.

<comment>Sound-Wave Garden is not backdrop but active constraint: frequency rules determine what can bloom, forcing Kael’s tactic. Micro-setting—the immersion tank’s metal rim—becomes percussion instrument that alters garden resonance. Sensory hierarchy favors sound > sight, matching POV’s musician-ear. Spatial choreography holds as Kael moves from table → tank → lagoon without drift.

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake (permanent reunion with Lena) is signaled early; escalation is the tightening of sonic flora toward the auric jump. One meaningful turn: the garden’s violet shift under faster drumming narrows options to “jump now or lose her.” Cost is visible—scientists rushing in while he dissolves—so price is on-page. Agency remains Kael’s throughout; no coincidence resolves the conflict.

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without sermon: permanence of shared invention bought with individual sanity. Sorrow is the auroral light that stains the sky, reweighted at closure when the same light now frames their eternal present. Subtext in gesture: hand-taking on glowing water = consent to shared delusion. No final-paragraph thesis; image carries the repricing.

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited retains tight psychic distance; perceptual signature is acoustic—everything is heard before seen. Diction stays within Kael’s lexicon (“rhythmic impact,” “oscillating air”). Rhythm accelerates with shorter cadences during tempo shift, mirrors rising pressure. No head-hopping; interiority remains Kael-bound.

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; information density high (“sonic tulips sway to his unique rhythm” does triple duty). Metaphors are coherent—sound blooms, sorrow is auroral—and remain physically consistent within garden rules. Sentence variety supports momentum; no register drift. Final line is image-based, recharging “golden water” and “sorrowful beauty” without abstract summary.

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Sound-into-flora world rule is fresh and followed rigorously; drumming-as-hacking is non-obvious synthesis of music, memory, and physics. Emotional stakes invert the rescue arc: saving the coma-bound by joining her unreality. Specificity—auric lagoon, violet shift—makes the invented geography memorable. Risk of lyric compression pays off: eternal dream as earned stasis feels inevitable yet surprising.
