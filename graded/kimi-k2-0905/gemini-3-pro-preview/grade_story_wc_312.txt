<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Elian’s earnest naïveté is vividly shown through micro-choices (trembling fingers, wide unblinking eyes), but interior contradiction is asserted rather than dramatized; the lone POV keeps the arc coherent yet leaves no relational crucible to test his flaw under pressure, so the final geyser feels like lucky miracle rather than earned character cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The causal chain is crystal: each dew-drop obeys a strict thermodynamic rhythm that fuses bronze → bell toll → geyser, satisfying closure under Causal lens. Yet the “cosmic imbalance” door never visibly swings back; the promised crushing cost is off-stage, so the Decisive Change lands without felt price on Elian, capping the score below excellence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Blue-shadowed viaduct and evaporative dawn air are selectively filtered through Elian’s peri-mechanical obsession; the bell-as-micro-setting constrains every droplet placement, and the final geyser recharges the same sapphire light, meeting the 9+ gate for object-as-setting even though broader geography stays sketchy.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Stakes are legible—restore the sea or remain barren—and tighten via micro-calibrated drip cadence that forecloses error. Yet escalation is purely technical; no emotional or relational cost accrues beat-to-beat, so pressure plateaus rather than deepening, holding the score just under the 7.0 threshold for visible price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of “brittle devotion” emerges organically from the drip-score ritual; the bell’s resurrected toll offers a resonant non-literal answer without moralizing. The concept’s cosmic scope stays implicit, inviting reflection, but the absence of character-level moral cost keeps the resonance from deepening further.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Third-limited clings to Elian’s perceptual signature—his “lukewarm” lexicon, tactile precision with viscosity, and rhythmic count under breath. Syntax mirrors his narrow mechanical focus; no head-hop or register drift; voice control stays tight through the climactic toll, meriting high-band placement.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Sentences vary cadence to match drip anticipation; figurative language is spare, purposeful, never muddled; only minor scaffold appears (“the weight of the missing ocean pressing against his temples”). Information density is high; read-aloud rhythm propels without loops; closure image remains crystal.</comment>

<question>8</question><question>8.7</question><comment>The “dripping-rate welding” magic is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis that feels inevitable in hindsight; it transforms mundane water into cosmological repair tool, while the empty-ocean premise avoids standard eco-dystopia tropes. Risk is bold yet coherent, nudging toward the 9-band boundary despite slight under-delivery on personal cost.</comment>
