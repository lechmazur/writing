<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Xylos’s grief-soaked interiority is vivid and embodied; the brass gear as “parent heart” is a charged micro-choice that tilts every beat. The final loneliness lands as a credible cost because his earlier sentimental acts (naming stars, weeping at atoms) have been established as reflex, now rendered obsolete. No contradictory impulses are staged simultaneously in scene—sentimentality is confessed rather than enacted under pressure—so the arc is more monologue than crucible. Still, the renunciation feels earned because the gear-fit is visibly imperfect and the silence after turning carries palpable loss.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the cold bioluminescent glow reweights the entire ancestral fire-curse and makes Xylos’s mourning obsolete. Causal linkage holds—because he forces the fractal gear into the stalled axle, the garden lights without combustion—cost is the immediate emotional vacuum that follows. Orientation is anchored by word 40 (“ribboned expanse of the Nebula Garden”) and the sonar ping maps spatial stakes throughout. No lens ambiguity; the story teaches its accumulative pattern early and lands under it.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The nebula is not backdrop but navigational hazard: crystallized hydrogen stalks can shred the traveler, so the sonar ping is a lived constraint. Sensory hierarchy obeys Xylos’s sentimental lens—petal-like plasma sheets, violet dark—every descriptor filtered through his grief. The brass gear’s fractal edge is micro-setting that physically bridges finite and infinite, charging the final image. Spatial choreography is flawless: clutching gear → sonar map → approach axle → press-fit → retreat under cold light.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“share light without fire”—is signaled in paragraph 5 and tested by the final non-combustive glow. One meaningful tightening: the imperfect gear-fit forces the choice to press anyway, narrowing options from “repair” to “repair with irreversible personal erasure.” Pressure is accumulative: each plasma petal shed is a quiet countdown toward either continued entropy or cold ignition. Cost is the instant obsolescence of his sentimental identity, legible in the final line’s “troubling serenity” returned in pale blue.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the fractal gear itself: children approximating infinity to fix parental failures, only to erase the role of mourner. No explicit thesis—meaning is carried by the cold light’s spectral reprise of earlier “troubling serenity.” The emotional aftereffect is a hush that questions whether breaking the fire-cycle was worth self-erasure, inviting counter-readings. Final image reweights every prior burn-reference without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays tight to Xylos’s perceptual signature: mournful hum, petal metaphors, atomic tenderness. Syntax lengthens and breathes with nebular drift, then compresses at the metallic “sharp reverence” of the sonar return. No head-hop; unreliability is hinted but never confirmed, keeping psychic distance stable. Register remains consistent—archaic diction (“Ancestor logicians”) feels motivated by the brass relic world.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm modulates from long nebular sentences to the staccato “The gear turned.” No paraphrase loops; each image advances either navigation or grief. Figurative density is high but patterned—every metaphor (orchid gas, petal plasma) serves the garden conceit and pays off in the bioluminescent bloom. One mixed vehicle: “peace that felt closer to a tomb than a nursery” is allowed because it crystallizes the stakes.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Synthesis of cosmic gardening, steampunk relic, and anti-pyric ethics feels inevitable rather than eclectic. The fractal-edge gear as bridge between finite machine and infinite chaos is a fresh inflection not transferable to another story. Risky accumulative structure—no antagonist, no dialogue—holds coherence because the sonar pattern teaches the reader how to read the silence. Transformation test passes: swap names or setting and the emotional arc collapses.</comment>
