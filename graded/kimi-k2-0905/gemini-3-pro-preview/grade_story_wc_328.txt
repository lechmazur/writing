<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s spite-driven mission is vivid and embodied; the arrowhead burn and blood smear make the cost tactile. Interiority stays specific—"curdled hope," "cosmic punchlines"—and the final floating laugh lands as earned change. The brother remains a prop, not a relationship crucible, so the +8.8 gate just misses.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal chain is airtight: arrowhead → phone → blood → gravity release → butterfly burst; each beat tightens options. Closure (CR) reweights the rule-set—ghost becomes laughing man—with visible price: dead phone, sliced thumb, frostbitten hope. Lens holds causal throughout; no teleporting props or soft resets.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Underground garden’s loam, drifting watering-can, and suspended ferns constrain the ritual space; micro-setting doubles as tool-set. Arrowhead and phone are handled, tracked, and charged. Sensory hierarchy obeys Elias’s cryptid-hunter gaze—smell of secrets, gravitational flip in the gut—anchoring the surreal in tactile specifics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—force the universe to give back a real brother—signaled by "rewrite the gag." Mid-scene reversal: gravity release forecloses retreat; cost (blood, phone death) visible on page. Escalation is causal, irreversible, and narrows to the final laugh.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme—spite as creative force—emerges from action, not thesis. Final image of frostbitten hope reconfigures earlier despair without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers: miracle may still die in the ice, keeping complexity alive.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elias’s perceptual filter—"stomach flip," "static-laden confessions." Syntax tightens under pressure: fragments during zero-g, then longer cadence as hope returns. No head-hopping; diction remains within a field-researcher’s lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and rhythm; no template cadence or synonym loops. Figurative language is sparse and precise—"broken finger" antenna, "cloud of butterflies made of light and sound." High information density; every line advances stakes or image. Clean copy, zero scaffolding.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Combines post-apocalyptic grief, cryptid science, and ritual magic into an inevitable synthesis. The cordless-phone séance and gravitational prank feel fresh yet grounded in character spite. Risk-taking (zero-g butterfly resurrection) pays off with coherent closure.</comment>
