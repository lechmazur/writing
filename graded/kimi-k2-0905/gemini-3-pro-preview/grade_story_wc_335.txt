<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Silas’s abrasive mentorship is vividly embodied—his backward walk, the sneer that masks approval, the stylus that feints reinforcement while secretly mapping escape. Lenore’s shift from shadow to solid is credible because every beat of her imprisonment has been calibrated to force self-reliance. The moment he plants his feet so she can see him stand ground crystallizes the crucible. Minor slip: “combative tenderness” is named rather than shown in the final beat, blunting cost by a hair.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lattice is immaculate: tea-leaf geometry → fracture map → Lenore’s strike → shatter. Each annotation weakens the prison it pretends to strengthen, tightening stakes under a single reversible-exile rule. Closure lands with visible cost—glass shards on the floor and the broom Silas thrusts to hide pride—earning Resonant Reconfiguration. No orientation drift; who-where-when is anchored by line 3 and never lost.</comment>

<comment>The Forgotten Library is no backdrop; dust settling on mirror-shards mirrors the slow accretion of Lenore’s resentment, while the prism’s pedestal spatially choreographs Silas’s retreat-to-desk-to-stylus advance. Micro-setting—the tea cup’s curved ceramic—becomes the diagnostic tool that dictates the next causal move. Environment constrains choice at every step; without the reflective shelves the shadow-exile conceit collapses. Final image of glittering debris recharges the initial dust motes, closing the loop.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—Lenore must earn daylight by her own force—tightens exactly once: the stylus marks convert passive rage into aimed violence, foreclosing the option of waiting for mercy. Escalation is causal under the mentor’s hidden sabotage; each scratch lowers the breaking threshold, making the final punch inevitable. Cost is legible in Silas’s trembling hands and the mess he refuses to admit pride over. No reversal beyond the single required fracture, but that fracture reweights everything.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme of self-forged resilience emerges through action, never sermon: the library’s refusal to coddle becomes Silas’s creed, the tea geometry becomes prophecy, the broom becomes graced responsibility. Subtext hums in the kicked shard—pride disguised as scolding. Final image reframes prior cruelty as costly gift, achieving Conceptual Repricing without moralizing. One echo too neat: “angles are sharp” repeats rather than evolves, trimming the top band.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited clings to Silas’s perceptual filter—his boots scuff, his spine hits the desk, his thumb wipes diamond dust—creating a metallic, abrasive rhythm that never drifts. Lexicon stays archivist-precise: “rot-resistant shelves,” “reversible exile,” “geometry of conflict.” No dialogue from Lenore keeps voice singular; Silas’s spoken taunts carry the same cadenced cruelty as his interior calculus. The moment he forces his feet still under fearful hope is peak psychic distance control.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary from curt sneers to longer crystalline clauses without falling into template cadence. Information density is high: tea-leaf read doubles as tactical instruction and emotional barometer. Zero paraphrase loops; “glass” recurs only when its state changes. One strained metaphor—“sound like a cracking glacier”—slips toward cliché amid otherwise fresh imagery, keeping the score just sub-9.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Reversible exile as magical jurisprudence feels freshly codified rather than hand-waved; the idea that the jailer must secretly weaken the cell to teach force is a non-obvious mentor twist. Mirror-shard archiving and tea-leaf structural analysis synthesize occult librarianship with geomantic engineering, particular to this world. Risk is taken and paid off: the mentor engineers his own obsolescence, a reversal rarely dramatized. Echoes of “shadow trapped in glass” recall Poe but pivot from gothic lament to empowerment, transforming rather than borrowing.</comment>
