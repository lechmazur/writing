<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elian’s interior contradiction—playful yet deadly serious—shows in every micro-choice (spinning fire amid despair, tipping hat to dead architect). Embodied emotion drives the humidity calculus; no label-speak. The final laugh is earned renunciation: he forfeits rest and safety to walk on. Cost is visible; competence balanced by risk.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Causal lattice holds: mosaic recipe → humidity adjustment → timed ignition → emerald bloom. Closure is Charged Poise: he steps into darkness, lighter for having spent his fire. Cost legible in spent mortars and his resumed chant—hope given, self emptied. Orientation anchored by dusk rampart walk within 120 words; no drift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fortress-as-garden constrains every move: creeping vines dictate fuse placement, humidity is an enemy that rewrites chemistry, stone lions become launching pads. The kerosene knot itself is micro-setting—handled, swung, extinguished—its soot pattern on his palm the final image. Sensory hierarchy filtered through pyro-artist eyes: scent of thyme = fuse risk, color of tile = formula. Environment shapes tactics; no postcard tourism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Single dominant stake—defy hopelessness—tightens when absolute night arrives: no stars, zero light, maximum psychic weight. Escalation is causal: each humidity-feel adjusts sulfur ratio; each fuse laid narrows exit options until ignition is irreversible. Visible price: spent powders, singed courtyard, refugees’ upturned faces now burdened with memory. Coincidence absent; agency pure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of manufactured starlight as moral counter-gravity emerges solely through action: no thesis lines. Mosaic-recipe = ancestral collaboration across time; final willow-shell restores heavens the sky forgot. Ambiguity lingers—will they remember tomorrow?—but cost is undeniable. Serious playfulness keeps sentimentality at bay.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tightly welded to Elian’s pyro-perception: “chemistry of stars in a canvas satchel,” “rhythmic *woosh-woosh*” as metronome. Syntax mirrors chant cadence; diction never exceeds wandering-circus lexicon. No head-hop; psychic distance compresses under spinning flame. Voice distinct, sustained, pressure-calibrated.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm breathes with spin-rate: long sentence for pendulum arc, fragment for mortar thud. Figurative density spikes only at bloom moment, pattern-taught by earlier “garden of living light.” Zero paraphrase loops; each line advances image or chemistry. Final line restores silence without scaffolding.</comment>

<question>8</question>  <grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Fusing fireworks designer with siege horror is fresh; mosaic tile as chemical score sheet is non-obvious synthesis. Risk of humid-wet fuses in ruined botanic fortress is specific to this place, person, night. Without Elian’s ambient sulfur calculus the spectacle fails—irreplaceable. Transformation survives proximity test: no prior story matches this recipe.</comment>
