<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Silas’s “infinitely patient” trait is asserted but never tested by contradictory impulse; he acts serenely from first to last. No interior contradiction surfaces while he steers strangers, so the cost of his vigil feels theoretical. The closing image of him “heaving slightly” is the sole bodily hint of strain—too late to complicate his motives. He remains a poised symbol rather than a person who might fail.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each pedestrian beat layers vibration into the arch until pattern-break (synced march) reweights stakes. Closure delivers Charged Poise—Silas retreats, city momentarily stable, entropy merely postponed—cost is the perpetual burden he accepts. Causality is metaphoric yet internally consistent; the fork’s swallowing of discord teaches the rule early. Orientation anchored by word 60; no teleporting props.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Limestone span, ebony fork, and cobblestone acoustics function as micro-setting that directly constrains Silas’s method. Selective sensory focus—sound of groaning stone, vibration in chest—keeps detail purposeful. Weather (“wild hush”) mirrors tension without overt symbolism. Spatial choreography remains clean as Silas intercepts baker then miners; no floating bodies.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—prevent collapse via rhythmic alignment—signaled in first paragraph. One meaningful tightening: chaotic footsteps accumulate until keystone threatens failure; Silas’s metronomic boot forces synchronized cadence, foreclosing dissonance. Cost is legible: he must stand vigil forever, entropy deferred not defeated. Pressure escalates under Accumulative lens; no coincidence required.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: communal rhythm as invisible architecture. Subtext resides in Silas’s silent orchestration—healers work by listening, not speaking. Final image of wild hush returning crystallizes the story’s wager: order is temporary, maintenance eternal. No moralizing; resonance lingers through sensory echo of humming stone.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Silas’s tactile perception; no head-hop. Distinct perceptual signature—sound as texture, vibration as temperature—carries voice. Syntax lengthens during patient waiting, shortens during corrective taps, mirroring tension. Diction stays within plausible lexicon of taciturn craftsman; no register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, and image-dense; every sentence advances atmosphere or beat. No paraphrase loops or mixed metaphors. Figurative language (“the masonry was failing… because the town had lost its shared balance”) is abstract but earned by prior sensory setup. Clause variety and paragraph breath control support accumulative crescendo.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Premise—urban repair via pedestrian synchronization—is fresh yet immediately intuitive. Conceptual risk (sound as structural glue) commits fully; no late rule changes. Specificity of tuning fork swallowing noise transforms familiar trope of mystic craftsman. Final reprise of wild hush feels inevitable, not gimmicky.</comment>
