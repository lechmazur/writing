<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elian’s interiority is vivid—synesthetic perception, gloved hands, phantom arm-ache—yet his “certify wonder” motive is declared rather than dramatized. The endurance of solitude is embodied, but no contradictory impulse is tested; the choice to pull the rope feels predetermined. Micro-choices (scanning ice, smoothing amber sheet) show hierarchy of values, but the absence of a visible cost or renunciation keeps the arc shy of 8+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Causal chain is tight: aurora intensifies → bell must ring → artist strikes → prism-song released → confidence seeded. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the hush rebuilds itself, proving the bell-ringer’s lifelong solitude has social utility; cost is the fresh weight of silence he must re-inhabit. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive within 60 words; no lens ambiguity. The single-scene default is met; transition-free accumulative design holds.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Ice cavern is not backdrop but instrument: translucent membrane gauges aurora, crystal rope is tactile trigger, amber sheet stores extinct sunlight. Synesthetic cross-modal detail (color-into-sound) filters every line through POV bias. Final image—the appreciative hum inside the rebuilt hush—recharges the cavern as both prison and cathedral, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stake is singular: validate wonder at the instant chisel meets stone. Escalation is auroral intensification tightening the clock; protagonist agency is the decisive pull. Cost is felt as the hush re-crystallizes around him—immediate, bodily, conceptual. No secondary reversal, but the foreclosing of quiet after quiet is sufficient for this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges without slogan: “the unnecessary is the only thing that makes the tangible worth enduring” is shown via the bell’s gratuitous beauty. Subtext resides in the paradox that silence must be shattered to propagate wonder, yet silence always returns—earned, not moralized. Final image of appreciative hum inside the hush reweights the premise with subtle conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is synesthetic, compressed, rhythmic: “sculpted hush,” “oscillating repose,” “ghostly bleed.” Syntax mirrors sensory blur—long vowels, sibilance, enjambed clauses—without purple drift. Perceptual signature is consistent: color always sings, cold always weighs. No dialogue, so no convergence risk; internal diction stays within plausible lexicon of an isolated auroral acolyte.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet breathable; figurative language is patterned (light-as-sound, hush-as-weight) and paid off in closure. No synonym loops or scaffold; sentences vary in length and stress. Single mixed metaphor (“ink into water” for aurora) is minor. Final line cadence slows to mimic re-crystallizing silence—line-level craft serving resonance.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses synesthetic bell-ringer, fossilized sunlight score, and aurora-to-inspiration pipeline—fresh synthesis of mythic science. Risk in lyric accumulation pays off: the hush rebuilt itself as earned stasis. Specificity of Vintergard ice, amber notation, and prism-song keeps concept from drifting into allegory. Transformation test passed: swap any component and the emotional machine collapses.</comment>
