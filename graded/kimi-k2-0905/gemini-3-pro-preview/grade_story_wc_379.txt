<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s “sandstorm calm” is vividly embodied and her listening method is dramatized through micro-choices, but the shift from curator label to community savior is too frictionless—no interior contradiction or cost is shown to make the victory feel earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: stories → combination → locket → legal shield; the holographic-will twist is a conceptual repricing that reweights ownership from paper to memory. Orientation is clean by 50 words; closure lands with undeniable social cost as the foreman halts. One minor loop: “terrifying composure” is told twice in the first two sentences.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Courtyard, fountain, ivy, iron pillar are tactile and filter through POV biases; the locket itself becomes the micro-setting that charges the final image. Sun-angle and cane-taps show environment guiding the Puzzle solving in real time. Spatial choreography stays clean across crowd moves.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—eviction—is signaled in paragraph two. Pressure tightens once, when machinery roar peaks at the same beat the final tumbler falls; the choice to keep listening rather than fight narrows options and visibly pays off when the foreman freezes. Cost is conceptual but legible: the community must now live the stories, not just tell them.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: communal memory as title deed. The locket’s reprise reweights “ownership” from legal paper to performed narrative, a resonant answer that avoids moralizing. Ambiguity lingers—stories can be contested—so complexity is preserved.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Third-limited stays locked to Elara; perceptual signature is curator-curatorial, noticing angles, clicks, and discarded fragments. Syntax modulates with pressure—short sentences during the final dial turns. No head-hopping; free indirect is clean. One register drift: “surgical care” sounds medical, not thrift-store.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>High information density; most sentences do two jobs. Rhythm varies; no template cadence. One mixed metaphor: “cascading lanterns of purple light” then “grinding gears” is tonal whiplash but intentional. No loops or scaffolding; opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: locked-box story asset is communal memory, not treasure. Risk of legal-absolutist twist is taken and paid off. Could echo other “memory = deed” tales, but the thrift-store curator lens and tactile puzzle mechanics keep it specific.</comment>
