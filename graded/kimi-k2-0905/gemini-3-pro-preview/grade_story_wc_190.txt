<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elian’s quiet vocation and reflexive micro-choice—uncorking the storm-glass—manifest his interior contradiction: caretaker of silence who must seed noise to save a soul. Kael’s panic-to-peace arc is embodied, not labeled. The cost (spent drop, depleted vial, silence now “kind”) is palpable, but we don’t see the vial’s depletion constrain later options; the lesson lands as gift, not enduring flaw.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the terrace’s lattice hums anew, Kael’s stance softens, and silence is re-priced as maternal. Causal linkage (whistle-shatter risk → drop → harmonic mend) is airtight. The lens is Causal; every beat is a because/therefore that tightens until the final image crystallizes cost without needing to pay it twice.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The prism terrace is no backdrop; its groaning panels and kaleidoscope sunset directly pressure the choice to deploy the vial and then refract the closing peace. Sensory economy is ruthless: one color spectrum, one low-frequency hum, one expanding drop. Micro-setting (glass floor, control deck) doubles as crucible and tool, charging the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—keep silence from turning murderous—tightens the instant the whistle fractures the air; options collapse to a single droplet. Agency is pure: Elian alone decides, and the price (spent reagent, silence now dependent on his art) is legible on the page. No reversal is needed; the deepening is the phase-shift of silence itself.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: care can inoculate absence. The storm-glass re-enchants the void without declaring a moral; the final image of “mother holding a child” reweights every prior fear of emptiness. Subtext resides in the drop’s perfect circle—order inside chaos, love inside nothing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited clings to Elian’s sensorium: camphor scent, lattice hum, liquid logic he alone decodes. Syntax mirrors his calm control—long clauses until the whistle, then staccato gasp. No head-hop, no filter-verb clutter; perceptual signature is crystalline.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops, zero scaffold. Sentences multitask: “the silence here was wild and feral” fuses metaphor and stakes in five words. Rhythm breathes with altitude—paragraphs swell and contract like lungs adjusting to thin air. No figurative muddle; every image pays rent to the climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The ether-gondola is familiar steampunk-adjacent furniture, but the inversion—noise as structural threat, silence as predator—feels freshly minted. Specificity of the storm-glass chemistry and the whistle’s “jagged echo” elevates the mix. Conceptual integrity holds: the world never breaks its own physics of sound.</comment>
