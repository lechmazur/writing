<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interiority is atmospheric but stays at a single register of world-weary; no contradictory impulse is dramatized under pressure. The “inadvertently stubborn” label is asserted, never tested by an opposing choice, so the final act feels predetermined rather than earned. Micro-choices (slotting lens, twisting housing) are procedural, not value-revealing. Still, Silas’s quiet collapse into the silence he manufactured carries a tangible, exhausted cost, satisfying the Earned Stasis bar.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Causal chain is lean and legible: package → descent → installation → acknowledgment → silence. The lighthouse-as-receiver is a crisp conceptual pivot that delivers the required Conceptual Repricing closure: the beam reframes centuries of panic into finished business. Cost is visible in the slump against the dais and the stolen moment of manufactured quiet. No orientation or continuity errors; metaphysical rule-set is announced early and holds.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Submerged library is evoked with selective sensory spikes—pulped paper, rusted beacon, bioluminescent bleed—each filtered through Silas’s funereal gaze. Spatial choreography is immaculate: we track his trench-coat slog to the dais, the slotting of the lens, the upward lance of light. Environment directly constrains the only possible solution (resurrect the beacon to receive the signal), clearing the 9+ gate. One minor gap: no tactile reckoning with the crushing pressure he supposedly ignores.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—personal sleep vs. undead clamor—is signaled early and tightens once: the ghosts’ panic escalates until the beam acknowledges them. The single turn is decisive and irreversible; options narrow from “endure noise” to “build receiver,” with the price paid in bodily exhaustion. No secondary reversal is needed at this length. Escalation is linear, not exponential, keeping it just shy of the 8.8 band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges obliquely: rescue is not arrival but being witnessed; burial is not hiding but listening. The reframed lighthouse lens reweights the moral calculus without a declarative sentence. Final image of Silas stealing his own manufactured peace refuses a tidy moral, leaving resonant ambiguity. No thematic echo or sermonizing—just the hum of current and memory.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Voice is a restrained Gothic undertaker: precise, fatigued, slightly archaic (“metaphysical trick of the trade”) yet never purple. Rhythm lengthens underwater, then snaps tight during the beam ignition. Perceptual signature is consistent—every noticed detail is something that can rot, rust, or drown. No head-hop, no register drift; the one cliché (“crushing impossibility”) is forgivable amid otherwise fresh phrasing.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty—description folded into motive, e.g., “rotting shelves” triangulates setting, decay, and Silas’s vocation. Only one paraphrase loop (“heavy…weight pressing”) and one mixed metaphor (“storm within…geometry”) slightly dull the edge. No filler verbs; nouns stay concrete. Closure sentence (“stole a moment of the peace he had manufactured”) lands clean, no scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Fusing undertaker with abyssal librarian to silence ghosts via a broken lighthouse is a synthesis that feels inevitable only after it happens. The reversal—beacon not to guide but to acknowledge—flips a centuries-old maritime symbol without forced cleverness. Specificity of the drowned library, lens geometry, and psychic clamor keeps the concept from drifting into allegory. Risky setting and metaphysical rule-set are fully committed to, not decorative.</comment>
