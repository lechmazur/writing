<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Elara’s interiority is sensorially embodied and paradox-laden (“taste of betrayal and cold abandonment”), her micro-choice to place frozen coral on tongue crystallizes the arc, and the cost—metabolic agony that lifts the fortress pall—is legible. The sole flaw: the “sandpaper rough memories” line drifts toward diagnostic shorthand, blunting full 9-band entry.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the coral dulled, fortress atmosphere lightened, Elara’s exhalation carries visible cost. Causal lens holds—each “therefore” from tide pool analysis → dig → taste → transmutation tightens stakes; no leaky set-ups or teleporting props. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) nailed within first 90 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The desert fortress, wet stones, and subterranean coral pantry are not backdrop—they force her shovel, guide her thermal reading, and supply the toxic ingredient she must metabolize. Micro-setting (iron bowl, frost-rimmed eaves) constrains the final alchemical act. One hairline slip: “mountaintop” vs. dune topography could nag geologically picky readers.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—absolve the fortress of frozen remorse—tightens through one decisive intensification: ingesting the coral shard narrows her options to endure or shatter. Cost is visceral (blizzard of silent screams) and persistent (colour drained from reef). Under causal lens, each beat escalates because she acts on discovered anomalies; coincidence never rescues.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme of metabolized collective guilt emerges through salt-iron vapor and pall-lifted air rather than thesis lines. Final image of softened melancholic taste reweights the premise without moralizing. Minor echo risk: “sandpaper rough memories” leans proverbial, but is absorbed into sensual matrix quickly enough to escape heavy penalty.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person POV stays tight in Elara’s sensorium; perceptual signature—“thick…with the suspended history of the garrison”—is chef-tuned, not touristic. Rhythmic modulation breathes with action (short clauses under shovel, elongation during oral transmutation). No head-hop, no filter-verb stacks; diction stays within culinary-alchemical lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>High information density—each sentence layers geology, gastronomy, and emotion (“wet sand heavy and resisting her spade”). Figurative language is selective: two metaphors (shipwreck fortress, blizzard of screams) both payoff in closure image. Zero loops, no mixed metaphors, no register drift; slight over-adjectival (“calcified reefs”) forgiven under lyric pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Concept of regret-as-ingredient is freshly synthesized through geothermal-coral refrigeration, not checklist gimmick. Risk in second-person tasting of despair pays off with earned physiological cost. Transformation test fails if relocated to generic wizard—chef-memory palate and tidal thermal read are inseparable. Specificity makes trope feel inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
