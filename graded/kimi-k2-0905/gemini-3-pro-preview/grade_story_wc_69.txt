<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elian’s interiority is consistently embodied (“traveled stillness,” “sorrow of a guardian”) and his micro-choice—lifting the rosette to his eye—physically externalizes the contradiction between hope and fatalism. The students remain anonymous, but their collective failure to sustain the chord functions as a single crucible that forces his resigned renunciation. The ending’s Earned Stasis is fully motivated by the prior causal chain; the cost is legible in the trembling rosette and his return to the window. No diagnostic label-speak; the only slight flattening is the generic “wary souls” tag, too minor to cap.</question>

<comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the chord emerges, breaks, and leaves the room forever altered—Elian forecloses the path of future attempts. Cost is visible in the trembling rosette and the instantaneous flood of mundane noise. The Accumulative/Textural lens is taught early (“create music not by accumulation, but by subtracting noise”) and holds through the final image of falling leaves. Orientation is anchored by sentence 3; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<comment>The velvet library, autumn leaves, and zither rosette are not backdrop: the velvet absorbs sound, enabling the subtraction method; the falling leaves reweight the final image of receding art. The rosette functions as micro-setting that literally focuses the acoustics and is handled in multiple beats. Sensory hierarchy obeys Elian’s musician ear—he “peers” through lattice gaps, feeling vibration sympathetically. Spatial choreography is spotless: students in plush aisles, Elian at window, podium placed, all track clean.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—last chance to recover collective resonance—is signaled in paragraph 4. Escalation is textural: density rises as coughs, shuffles, and mental chatter are stripped away, revealing the involuntary hum; the stakes reweight when the chord forms then shatters. The scrape of a chair is the micro-reversal that costs the fragile harmony. Price is visceral: the rosette trembles, the velvet quivers, and the students sit “stunned,” proving the loss is felt on-page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: art’s survival depends on shared vulnerability, yet the era has rendered that vulnerability intolerable. Subtext is carried by the rosette’s void—an absence that paradoxically allows presence—recharged when Elian lowers it and the echo dies. No moralizing; the final nod is gesture-as-verdict. The autumn leaves outside echo the chord’s brief flare, reconfiguring meaning without abstract statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited remains latched to Elian’s musician perception: acoustics, vibration, “dust and distance of a thousand roads.” Syntax grows breathless during subtraction—single clause heap—“suppress the mental chatter, the fear…”—then lengthens as the chord swells. No head-hopping; student interiority is only inferred through sound. The elevated diction (“celestial target,” “physics of empathy”) is justified by his poetic profession and stays consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances atmosphere, pressure, or image. Metaphors are controlled: “curtains… drank the light” is apt physicality; “physics of empathy” is a one-shot coinage that pays off. Clause variety mirrors sonic tension—short percussive fragments during subtraction, longer legato lines during resonance. Information density is high: “zither soundhole rosette, carved from ancient spruce as thin and delicate as lace” does four jobs in eleven words.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The “subtraction orchestra” conceit flips standard creation myths; the rosette-as-lens is a fresh acoustic device that materially drives plot. Autumn leaf-fall becomes the external timer for vanishing art, avoiding cliché through functional mirroring. Risky second-person imperative (“Do not add…”) is taught early and justifies the choral instruction voice. Synthesis feels inevitable: music = absence, harmony = vulnerability, rosette = void that enables sound.</comment>
