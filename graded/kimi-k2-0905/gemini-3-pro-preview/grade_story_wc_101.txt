<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s “gently persistent” trait is dramatized in the hush of the smuggling ritual and her refusal of credit; the silver bell micro-choice shows a hierarchy of values (continuity over personal glory) with felt cost. Interiority stays concrete—wind-bite, pocket-weight—never drifting into label-speak. The runners’ deference supplies status pressure, but because they are anonymous silhouettes the relationship crucible is only lightly sketched, keeping the score just below the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the bell ritual reweights contraband as sacrament, foreclosing the path of public leadership and leaving Elara on solitary guard—cost is legible in the final image of wind and bell-weight. Causal chain holds: embargo → midnight run → anonymous distribution → ritual consecration → tighter social fabric. Orientation is clean within 120 words; no lens ambiguity. One tightening beat suffices at this length; the embargo’s choke and the bell’s hush satisfy Accumulative escalation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Terra-cotta arbor, goat paths, and vacuum-sealed blocks are filtered through Elara’s tactical gaze; the lattice’s moonlit shard charges the final bell-glint. Cold wind and drone-fear narrow perception to immediacies, grounding atmosphere in stakes. The ridge’s elevation and treeline access directly enable the smuggling tactic and later visibility—setting constrains choice. Micro-setting (bell in pocket) reappears at closure, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—community survival via anonymous cohesion—tightens when the embargo closes the last road; the bell ritual is the visible price that forecloses Elara’s public-credit option. Escalation is Accumulative: each silent crate and hushed declaration increases density rather than reversing plot. No coincidence; pressure coheres under the lens. One meaningful deepening suffices; the final bell-murmur reweights stakes with undeniable cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through the paradox of invisible leadership: anonymity forges solidarity where charity would breed dependence. The bell’s muted chime re-prices continuity as a whispered asset under sanctions—no moralizing required. Subtext lives in gesture (nod, pocket-weight) and the velvet bundle passed without words. Final image of wind-as-song offers resonant ambiguity rather than a thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elara’s perceptual signature—moonlight “filtering,” scarf adjustment, bell-weight—no head-hops. Syntax lengthens under reflection, shortens during runner ingress, mirroring vigilance. Diction stays within her plausible lexicon; no filter-verb clusters. The hush-forced metaphor pattern is taught early and pays off in the final “song of endurance,” justifying stylized compression.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence or synonym loops. Figurative language is sparse and tied to stakes—wind “howled… like a song” closes the arc without purple drift. Information density is high: one sentence often does description, stakes, and emotional charge. One paraphrase loop (“silent silhouettes… practiced stealth”) is minor enough to keep the 9-band in reach.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The resistance-through-anonymity angle reframes the familiar embargo-survival template; the muted bell as sacrament feels specific to this culture. Details—vacuum-sealed blocks, goat paths, terra-cotta lattice—are not generic refugee tropes. Removing the bell or the anonymity method would collapse the plot logic and final resonance. Risk is present but not structurally destabilizing, holding the score high but not quite exceptional.</comment>
