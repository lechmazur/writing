<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s motives are cleanly tracked: data-seeking skepticism → refusal to worship → climb to test “artificial pilgrimage” hypothesis → renunciation by tossing amber. One beat of interior contradiction (“her skin pulse… betrayed her”) is dramatized under pressure. The renunciation costs her last talisman, earning the stance. Missing: a second micro-choice that shows her skepticism actually complicating tactics mid-climb; thus does not clear 9.0.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal string holds: spring rain ends → footprints spark recognition → meeting Aris confirms theory → amber toss = Decisive Change with felt cost. Closure image (amber shattering below) reweights “home” as exploitable weakness; cost is visible, audible. No lens ambiguity. Orientation anchored by line 4. Meets 9+ cost test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Basalt slickness, alien-ivy-strangled statues, copper air: selective sensory triangulation keeps POV academic-detached. Micro-setting (fly amber handled twice, finally discarded) constrains final choice. Bronze-quiet motif modulates from atmospheric to thematic at closure. Rain-washed tower surface directly enables amber’s audible crack on impact; qualifies 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake: is the “pull” real or engineered? Pressure tightens when Aris confirms engineered longing yet admits human need. Amber toss forecloses return path; cost is object + worldview. One meaningful deepening sufficient for 600-word scope; no coincidence used to resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme—nostalgia weaponized—emerges through concrete plot rather than statement. Amber’s fossilized stasis vs. Visitors’ fluid evolution recharged in final image. No explanatory sermonizing. Ambiguity preserved: human need survives the revelation, leaving resonant aftertaste.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited sustains academic diction (“hormonal and pheromonal cocktail”) without drifting into textbook dryness. Sentence rhythm flexes under emotional spike: short declarative at “Then we stop climbing.” No head-hopping; perceptual signature remains data-first, luminescence as metronome. Meets 9+ distinct-signature test.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density: “grav-lifts” vs. “dusty footprints” compress social divide in seven words. No synonym loops; metaphors coherent (“bronze quiet” extends to copper air and stone sound). One filter-verb cluster (“she noticed… she realized…”) mid-climb mildly dulls immediacy but does not obscure causality or touch closure beat; stays within 9+ tolerance.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: pilgrimage as Skinner box + nostalgia distilled into fuel. Fly amber repurposed from sentimental keepsake to rebellion token. Risk in withholding exposition until Aris info-dump pays off because confirmation reconfigures prior climb tension. Specificity (alien-ivy, jaw-less bust) prevents generic dystopia.</comment>
