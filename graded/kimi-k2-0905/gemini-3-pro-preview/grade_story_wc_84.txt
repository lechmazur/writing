<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara’s hunger to “decode the frequency of belonging” is anchored in embodied, scene-level choices—every micro-movement on the terrace is filtered through that ache. The internal contradiction between her competence and her felt incompleteness is dramatized, not labeled. The final yank costs the Pilgrim its pseudo-life and costs her the last veil of anonymity; the price is visible and scaled to the length.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: star-trail navigation → terrace arrival → chip extraction → identity restoration, each beat a therefore. Orientation is locked by line 6; no teleporting props. Closure is a Decisive Change with conceptual cost: the static becomes her autobiography, the Pilgrim’s surprise collapses into darkness, and her “missing pieces” snap into legible name-lines. Cost is on-page: “the Pilgrim slumped…into darkness.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The bruising-purple sky, calcified chip port, and bone-crunching debris underfoot are filtered through Elara’s pilot-eye hierarchy of motion and altitude. The observatory terrace functions as micro-setting: its dome, console, and corroded port physically constrain the extraction beat and charge the final image. Brilliant dimness is not decorative; it is the literal light condition that lets the star-trail overlay work and that flares into semantic brightness once the matrix activates.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—fill the self—signalled in paragraph 4 and tightened when the static refuses to speak until filtered. Escalation is causal: each star-trait streak narrows viable landing sites; each turn of the chip port raises tactile resistance and the risk of destroying the only key. The final pull forecloses retreat—Pilgrim dies, signal locks, her prior anonymity is irreversible. No reversal is required at this length; one meaningful narrowing is sufficient.</comment>
