<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Julian’s desperation and bodily decay are vividly embodied; the bead-clutch and trembling palm make his need tactile. The interior contradiction—gratitude for life bought by the loss of his spectral guardian—ripples through the final bench collapse, giving us a resonant reconfiguration. Micro-choices (raising the bead, spinning at the cold touch) align with motive and escalate risk. The lone gap: the “terminal sickness” is declared, never felt mid-scene; a single cough or blood-spot on the greenhouse floor would have sealed it.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal chain is crisp: bead-signal → orchard awakening → ghost appears → breath-cure → ledger closed. Orientation is anchored by word 40 (rusted latch, frost vs. humid greenhouse) so the Orientation Test is satisfied. Closure lands with visible cost—the spectral departure is the irrevocable price of survival—under a tight Causal lens. One minor softness: the bead’s dissolution into “pure light” is named, not explained; a half-line on what light feels like entering ghost-flesh would clinch the beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The greenhouse as predator—leaves “lovingly venomous,” briars bowing only to the ghost—functions as an active obstacle and mirrors Julian’s paralytic need. Sensory hierarchy is biased to touch and temperature, congruent with a body seeking cure. Spatial choreography stays clean: bead raised, tendrils retreat, ghost glides through brick. Environment does not merely adorn; it constrains every step, qualifying for the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—life versus loss of guardian—is signaled in paragraph 1. Escalation tightens through two causal turns: bead-hum awakens orchard, ghost-breath deletes sickness. Cost is visible on-page: the silver vapor that saves is simultaneously the knife that severs their bond. Pressure is coherent; no coincidence rescues him.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of karmic reciprocity emerges through the transaction itself, never sermonized. The final “mournful elation” crystallizes the paradox of salvation via abandonment. Subtext operates in gesture: ghost’s lingering look conveys a cosmos of unvoiced feeling. No tidy moral—just the irreversible price of settled debt—gives the piece staying ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Julian; no head-hop. Perceptual signature—fevered, frost-wracked body—colors every image (“biting frost,” “toxic, narcotic affection”). Syntax lengthens under duress, then fractures into short gasps on the bench, mirroring restored breath. Diction stays within a lay lexicon, avoiding thesaurus drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>High information density: one sentence often sets, senses, and advances (“He navigated the narrow paths careful of strange flora…”). Figurative layer is restrained; only two metaphors across 770 words, both organic (“smoke” for veil, “universe” for gaze). No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Final line cadence—“buttoned his coat, and prepared to face the cold world”—gives a quiet, exhale-close.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Alchemical orchard as predatory nocturne is fresh, twisting both greenhouse and haunted-bride tropes. The bead-as-karmic-credit-card reweights ancestral memory into tangible currency. Ghost bride’s silence forces invention of mind-flood communication, sidging standard spectral monologue. Risk is moderate—genre fusion—but execution keeps it from gimmick; still, premise echoes familiar “life-for-a-price” tales, capping originality just below exceptional.</comment>
