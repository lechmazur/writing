<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Hiero’s quiet enthusiasm and coin-cast micro-choices embody a coherent interior logic; each flip/twist of the foreign coins maps to an immediate console move, so agency stays tactile. Yet the “stellar doubt” is named more than embodied—no bodily cue or tool failure externalizes it, so the interior contradiction is only asserted, not staged. The final renunciation (“he would continue to cast…”) is credible, but because the doubt never materializes into a concrete forfeiture or risk, the cost is conceptual rather than felt. Still, the voice remains singular and the motivation stays anchored to the preservation task—no competence overflow or sentimental calibration.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the last image of gathering coins crystallizes a stance whose cost is the acceptance of endless, probably futile labor. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of sound, coin scatter, and backward prophecy tighten into a cadence shift rather than causal dominoes. The Orientation Test is waived: “ambered observatory” + “after the universe contracts” anchor time/space by line 3 and the withheld physics jargon later pays off when doubt peaks. Persistent constraint (amber floor eats a coin) subtly shapes the final gesture; cost is conceptual but undeniable.</comment>

<comment>The ambered deck, translucent resin sucking at boots, and swallowed gold coin create a micro-setting that literally ingests value—this constrains the final gesture and recharges the “money of ghosts” motif. Sensory hierarchy obeys crisis: under the droning prophecy Hiero notices only the cold discs and the vanishing coin, a credible narrowing. World-rules (reverse-time signals, analog console) are taught through action, not exposition. Spatial choreography stays clean—console, dials, floor, coat pocket track unambiguously.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—save a fragment of past into the seed of next Bang—is signaled in paragraph 4 and tightens once: the backward prophecy loops, ramming home the possibility of eternal silence. The meaningful deepening is Hiero’s conscious decision to keep casting despite that loop; this narrows his options to “endure” and carries the visible price of perpetual, maybe pointless labor. Pressure is textural/cumulative rather than external opposition, fitting the inferred lens. No off-stage rescue—luck complicates (coin rolls into amber) but does not solve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme—memory as defiance of heat-death—emerges from the coin/fossil parallel and the backward prophecy; no authorial thesis is stated. Subtext lives in the swallowed coin: value literally consumed by the station, hinting the archive itself is doomed currency. Final image offers resonant, non-literal answer: gathering the “money of ghosts” equals wagering on non-existent futures. Ambiguity is meaningful: reader cannot tell if the gesture is heroic or pathetic, avoiding tidy moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited maintains tight psychic distance; perceptual signature is engineer-poet, noticing gauge angles and metallic cold rather than abstract cosmos. Syntax is clipped under static bursts (“He did not flinch…”) then elongates during prophecy absorption, mirroring attention shift. No head-hop or filter-verb clutter. Dialogue absent, so voice contamination risk nil; free indirect (“he needed to distill…”) stays clean.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm alternates between staccato action beats and flowing prophecy lines, creating natural breath. Figurative language is sparse and coherent: “money of ghosts” and “physics strangled itself” are brief, precise, paid off. No scaffold loops or synonym churn; each sentence advances image, pressure, or knowledge. Opening sentence anchors voice and stakes; final sentence lands with imagistic snap.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Reverse-time prophecy as survival manual is fresh; coupling it with coin-divination in a post-Big-Crunch bubble feels inevitable, not gimmicky. Coins from empires erased by the same contraction that erased stars create a recursive fossil motif—specific, irreplaceable. Risk—using static as data and chance as navigation—pays off: climax legible under its own rules. The premise commits fully to heat-death melancholy without softening aperture for reader comfort.</comment>
