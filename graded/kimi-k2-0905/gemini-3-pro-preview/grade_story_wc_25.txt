<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elias’s quiet competence and the calm/chaos contradiction inside him are vivid; his micro-choices (stillness with the rod, creasing the map) flow from the whisper-philosophy. Kael stays a one-note loud obstacle, so relationship-as-crucible pressure is thin, but Elias’s interior cost lands in the final vanishing.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal chain is clean: folded map → shortcut → early arrival → silence-opens box → sirens punish noise. Closure is a sharp Resonant Reconfiguration: Elias erases the bridge, proving his thesis while Kael is trapped by his own shout. Cost is legible in the sirens and the emptied coin pedestal.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Port container maze is rendered through Elias’s kinesthetic knowledge (corrugated canyons, magnetic plate humming), never catalog. The folded map functions as micro-setting that literally bends space; storm aurora charges the final image when the rod stills the latch—environment constrains tactics and recharges theme.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“whisper > shout”—is signaled early and tightened when Kael’s racket summons sirens while Elias’s silence opens the box. One meaningful turn: the rod’s stillness, not force, unlocks the container. Cost is visible (Kael caught, Elias forfeits coin), though secondary moral stakes remain shallow.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: silence as spatial and social power. Subtext lives in gesture (Elias leaning “casually” yet precisely) and the iron rod’s mute authority. Final image—guards close on Kael while Elias melts into folds—reweights the premise, no moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person close stays locked to Elias with tight psychic distance; perceptual signature (“ghostly shades of violent green”) is consistent. Syntax grows shorter under storm static, mirroring tension. No dialogue contamination; Kael’s yell is reported, not given full voice, preserving whisper aesthetic.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, metaphors selective (“corrugated steel canyons”). No loops or scaffold; information layered (“folded corner to the top” teaches pattern). Occasional elevated diction (“conceptual spontaneity”) slightly drifts from worker lexicon but serves ironic tone.</comment>

<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: geomagnetic storm + origami port map + silent key = heist-as-epistemology. Container labyrinth as actual maze, maintenance worker as cartographer of silence, coin as decoy lesson—none feel recycled. Risk in abstract opener pays off when fold literally bridges space.</comment>
