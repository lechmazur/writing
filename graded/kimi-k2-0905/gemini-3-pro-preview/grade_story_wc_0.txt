<comment>Eli’s trait-dense interiority (“neutron-star crust” lens, implant overlay) stays particular and embodied; the micro-choice to touch the dust earns the humbled shift. No contradictory impulse is dramatized in-scene, so the arc rides on observation more than contested decision; cost is conceptual rather than viscerally felt, slightly softening the earn. Still, the hierarchy of values (data > feeling → feeling acknowledged) is legible and consistent.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the dust transfer crystallizes his reconfigured stance—cosmic scale acknowledged in terrestrial fragility—cost is the unavoidable weight of endings. Causal chain holds under Accumulative/Textural lens: each studied decay image deepens density until the final pattern break (beauty intrudes on data). Orientation anchor (who/where/when) is clear by line 4; no teleporting props. One minor elasticity: the implant “falter” beat is stated not shown, a hairline slip that doesn’t rupture causality.</comment>

<comment>Storm-ruined greenhouse supplies tactile humidity, glass shards, dripping condensation; spatial choreography stays coherent as Eli crouches, lowers loop, lifts dust. The Swallowtail wing functions as micro-setting that constraints choice—he must zoom, touch, and reckon with scale. Selective sensory triage (smell of rot, shimmer of scales) mirrors POV priorities. The tilted aqueduct of dust on a wet leaf directly charges the final image, meeting the 9-band constraint gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—can detachment insulate him from ruin?—is signaled early; pressure escalates by accrual of decay evidence until beauty fractures his filter. The tightening is single but meaningful: the iridescent “pointless beauty” beat forces acknowledgment, narrowing his options to humbled acceptance. Cost is conceptual (loss of defensive objectivity) and legible in the fingertip dust. No second reversal or external antagonist, but the lens-sustained deepening suffices for this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: entropy is not theft but transformation; significance persists even after drama is stripped. Subtext resides in sensory detail (dust = nebula) rather than exposition. The final image reweights the premise without moralizing—humility as quiet gravity. One soft echo: “stripping needless drama” is stated near start and mildly restated near end, trimming half a point.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>POV stays locked in Eli’s calculative yet haunted perceptual channel; syntax is controlled, rhythms lengthen for contemplation then compress at the “falter” flicker. Scientific register feels native, not pasted. No dialogue to test, so voice contamination risk is nil. The lyric lift of “lighter font” and “gentle, relentless laws” feels earned by prior pattern rather than injected lyricism.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty (description + metaphysics) with near-zero scaffold; variety in length supports breathing. Metaphors stay consistent (cosmic ↔ wing) and physically coherent. Only micro-loop: “dust…dust…dust” recurrence in final third borders on insistence but serves emphasis, not padding. No artifact touches the closure beat; clarity remains high.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Flood-ruined astrophysicist reading apocalypse through lepidopteran dust feels fresh and specific; risk lies in the quiet interior stakes, but coherence justifies it. The synthesis of astrophysics with micrometeorology of decay is non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. No trope subversion, but the angle transforms familiar post-disaster reflection into perceptual event. Derivative-premise guardrail not triggered.</comment>
