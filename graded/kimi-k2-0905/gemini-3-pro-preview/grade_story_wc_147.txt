<question>1</question>
<grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Elara’s interiority is concrete (oxygen burn, trembling fingers) and her hierarchy of values—history > heartbeat—pays visible cost. The psychic flashes are shown through sensory bleed rather than labels, and her final “content to become part of the signal” is a credible renunciation. No contradictory impulses are staged simultaneously, so the 9+ quick test isn’t quite met, but the arc is tight for 800 words.</comment>

<question>2</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the completed transmission crystallizes her fate while the beam’s ascent reweights the premise—she is now encoded light. Causal linkage holds (because she unsnarls → beam fires → she accepts death). Cost is unmistakable in the graying vision line. One persistent constraint (O2 countdown) shapes every tactic. Slight lens wobble early (is this Situational or Accumulative?) but the ending locks into Accumulative density; hence −0.1.</comment>

<question>3</question>
<grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The temple’s coral-choked console is not backdrop but the antagonist she must physically defeat; the dome’s pressure literally narrows her perception to “black edges.” Micro-setting (crystal vial) constrains the final act by serving as the transmission medium. Sensory choice favors urgency—taste of wine hallucination under hypoxia—rather than tourist catalog. Environment charges the closing image: the beam punching through stone and water she will never leave.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—save the ghosts or die trying—is signaled in paragraph 1 and tightens through the O2 countdown. One meaningful deepening: the vial’s psychic residue turns from liability to fuel, forcing her to keep diving. Cost is visible (vision grays) and alters later tactics (she stays hand instead of bolting). Coincidence absent; escalation is density-driven under Accumulative lens. Needed one more beat where the vial almost slips to push into 9.0.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the beam-as-immortality paradox: memory outlives flesh without moralizing. The lonesome splendor motif reframes the tomb as welcoming, reweighting loss into communion. No final-paragraph thesis statement; resonance lands in the image of her closing eyes “content to become part of the signal.” Counter-reading possible—colonial loot, suicide—adding complexity. Lacks a second motif layer to reach 9.0.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays strictly inside Elara’s perceptual filter; no head-hop. Syntax grows clipped as CO2 rises (“She kicked… She fought…”) mirroring hypoxia. Diction favors nautical-technical lexicon within her plausible range. No dialogue, so voice carries through tactile action and hallucination. The lyric compressed opening teaches the reader to accept later elliptical fragments like “content to become part of the signal.” Distinct but not yet virtuosic.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>High information density: “black ocean pressed… quartz dome… coral polyps and fibrous kelp” layers world, stakes, and obstacle in one breath. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances. Metaphors stay coherent (ocean as tomb, beam as resurrection). Rhythm accelerates across paragraph breaks to match O2 curve. One near-muddle: “velvet curtain” hush risks soft cliché but is saved by immediate sensory pivot to intake chamber. Closure beat remains pristine.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Fusing psychic-data perfume with deep-sea salvage feels non-obvious and inevitable in hindsight. The temple-as-transmitter flips ruins from relic to tool, avoiding standard Atlantis tropes. Risk: lyric elegy form could tip into preciousness, but hypoxia’s bodily cost grounds it. Not quite a new genre splice, so stays shy of 9.0 band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Setup: first line establishes her sender role. Development: O2 countdown forces micro-choices—stay, not surface. Closure: she becomes the signal she transmits. Specific cost (life) is irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question>
<grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Present in opening gear, handled twice mid-task, and poured into console to enable transmission; its psychic residue tempts surrender. Final image—beam carrying ghost-wine mist—recharges lonesome splendor. Without vial, no data, no story.</comment>

<question>9 C</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Hush first appears as sanctuary silence after altar hums; it tightens stakes by amplifying every breath-sound. Returns in final sentence as abyss “holding its breath,” reweighting death into collective anticipation. Constrains her to whispered movements.</comment>

<question>9 D</question>
<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Trait activated twice: flashes of wine/tides distract her mid-task, threatening fatal error; she overrides by slow fingers. Cost is time lost vs. O2, directly shaping tactics. Memory-touch is not ornamental but endangers mission.</comment>

<question>9 E</question>
<grade>9.5</grade>
<comment>Central physical beat; every freed wire tightens clock and raises risk of severance. Success directly enables beam firing—story pivot. Coral-invasion detail makes action irreversible and specific to this setting.</comment>

<question>9 F</question>
<grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Override signaled early (“steel-willed discipline”) and mechanics shown through slowed trembling fingers vs. panic urge. Shapes entire middle sequence. Could swap for “resisted panic” with minor loss, hence not 8.5+.</comment>

<question>9 G</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Pressure, darkness, and decaying console directly constrain every move; temple provides both antagonist (clogs) and tool (transmitter). Without flooded ruin, no salvage, no beam. Setting is crucible, not postcard.</comment>

<question>9 H</question>
<grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>O2 countdown is live, tracked by wrist beep and graying vision; each freed wire ticks against remaining air. Alters pacing from slow-careful to final surrender. Beam completion coincides with blackout—clock drives closure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question>
<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Desire to bottle collective memory is dramatized through her risking death to pour vial into console; tension between personal survival and archival mission is visible. Want vs. fear (drowning) layers authentic friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question>
<grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Lonesome splendor seeded in first paragraph and modulated: initial intrusion → kinship → proud sharing. Final beam ascent flips isolation into communion, recharging tone with earned uplift. Tone never static; it tracks surrender.</comment>
