<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara’s ever-present physical jitters are made legible through tactile micro-choices—strap-adjusting, chain-clutching, humming—so the final quieting of her body after the magic discharge feels earned. Interiority is specific (“monochrome stupor”) and her motivation germinates wonder rather than simple courier duty. The loss of Kaelen is more backstory premise than active relational pressure, so the character arc pivots on self-reliance rather than crucible dynamics; still, her value hierarchy (risk life to seed wonder) shows visible cost. Moment of stance crystallization at the summit carries a felt bodily price and qualifies as Earned Stasis, satisfying the closure quick-test.</comment>

<comment>Single causal lens: because Kaelen is gone Elara must act; therefore she climbs and vibrates the aurora to crack the pendant. Each beat advances knowledge or stakes; orientation anchored by word 64; closure is a Decisive Change with visible cost as her exhaustion and the vanished pendant foreclose return to courier anonymity. No causal gaps—missing mentor pushes rather than excuses action, and the dilation of time integrates rather than breaks continuity. Cost legible in final beat: “she fell to her knees, exhausted but strangely steady.”</comment>

<comment>Aurora-lit ridgeway is not postcard scenery; it defines thin air, cold that “felt like a knife,” and electrical hush that primes the sympathetic vibration. Spatial choreography is clean—summit circle, pendant in palm, light shooting upward. Micro-setting of the pendant itself (“delicate dragonfly-wing… suspended on woven silver”) constrains her posture and becomes the literal fulcrum of action. Environmental pressure tightens tactics and charges the final image, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake (wake the gray world) is signaled early and refocused to a single on-page test: crack pendant or fail. Escalation happens through one meaningful tightening—final climb plus aurora proximity; no reversals needed under Causal lens. Price is atmospheric and bodily—thin air, shivering endurance, ultimate energy drain—and alters later options (pendant gone, life-risk spent). Coincidence absent; agency maintained.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from concrete pattern: relic courier carries literal “spark” to re-enchant a numbed world. No explicit moralizing; resonance arrives when prismatic light seeds sky “for years to come.” Ambiguity remains—wonder may be chaos—and no character articulates the thesis. Dragonfly image binds fragility, transformation, and flight, reweighted in the final dissolve.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited adheres to Elara; perceptual signature favors tactile over visual: worn straps, cool chain, crystalline air. Syntax tightens with climb—“breath felt like a knife”—and relaxes post-discharge, mirroring jitter arc. No dialogue, so voice judged by interior diction; free of filter clutter and maintains humble courier lexicon. Rhythm controlled; opening anchors stakes and tone smoothly.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>High info density: single sentence layers task, terrain, sensory risk (“Tonight… exposed to the open sky”). Figurative choices stay internally coherent—jagged stone spine, syrup-thick time—without register drift or mixed metaphors at climax. No synonym loops or template cadence; sentence starts vary; paragraph cuts clean. Proofing immaculate, no simultaneity errors. Closure image crystalline and uncluttered.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Familiar mentor-gone quest is refreshed by making anxiety the activating force rather than obstacle, and turning cosmic light into both lock and key. Transformation test: substitute non-jittery courier and the resonance mechanic collapses. Risk of lyric dilation paid off through taught pattern and visible cost. Specific detail—woven silver chain, aurora hum—keeps concept anchored. No derivative premise penalty; combination feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
