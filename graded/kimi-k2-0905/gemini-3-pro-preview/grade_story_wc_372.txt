<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elara’s “gently meticulous” trait is embodied in the brass dial turn and steady hands under time pressure, but interiority stays safe—no contradictory impulse or blind spot is dramatized. The final ledger stamp registers duty satisfied, yet the cost feels procedural rather than personal; we see no foreclosed path inside her. Still, the micro-choice chain is coherent and character-specific enough for this length.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the vows are gone, yet the data survives, and the iron seal makes the loss legible. Causal chain—slide decay → measurement race → verification → archival lock—is tight; no off-stage shortcuts. The “quartz hush” frame holds from first sentence to last, satisfying the Accumulative/Textural lens. Cost is present in the snapped light and pluming breath, so the 9+ quick test is met.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Frozen library, brass chamber, and velvet case are not backdrop; the cold literally shortens the energy half-life and forces Elara’s tempo. The rime falling from shelves after the resonance hum is a tactile cue that the world itself reacts to her probe. Micro-setting (obsidian desk, copper gauge) constrains every micro-gesture. Final image of twilight wrapping the spire recharges the opening “eternal, quiet winter” with new weight now that the vows are archived.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“verify hope before entropy wins”—is signaled early and tightens through the needle drop. One meaningful deepening: the golden figures tear like smoke, converting spectacle into data urgency. Agency stays with Elara; no coincidence rescues her. Cost is the irreversible fade, but the beat never risks her body or social credit, keeping pressure just sub-8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: meaning is man-made, a fragile print against cold forgetting. The reweighting of light—from living vow to ink ledger—carries the conceptual repricing. No moralizing line intrudes; the silence after the crack says it. Ambiguity lingers: data without witness may be another kind of oblivion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person POV stays pinned to Elara’s perceptual sieve: she distrusts vision, prefers frequencies, notices rime not romance. Syntax lengthens during calibration, then fragments as the needle drops—“The light… snapped off”—mirroring her narrowing window. No head-hop or register drift; even “spectral imprint” fits the archivist lexicon. Voice modulates with pressure yet retains its frost-brittle precision.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty: “shivered, hunting for a signal” gives motion, stakes, and tactile cold. No paraphrase loops; each clause adds new sensorial or causal data. Metaphors stay consistent—light as quantifiable force, cold as entropy agent. The final paragraph’s triple plosives—“snapped,” “crack,” “pluming”—create audible after-echo without purple excess.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>“Magic lantern slide” as carrier of geopolitical peace is fresh, and treating devotion as Fourier-transformable light offers a non-obvious angle. The archive-at-world’s-end frame nods to Borges but finds original traction in data-preservation versus emotional erasure. Risk is moderate; the piece commits fully to its frost-bitten lyricism. Could swap in another relic without breaking the arc, capping it below 8.5.</comment>
