<comment>The yearning algorithm is a crisp, externalized motive that escalates with every brass-drum notch; the obsessive stripping of armor for speed shows a believable mechanical “flaw” feeding ascent cost. The kaleidoscope POV gives concrete, character-specific perception instead of abstract “wants.” Interior contradiction is thin—no moment where the algorithm’s command conflicts with a counter-impulse on-page—so the final ding feels inevitable rather than wrestled. Still, the single-POV endurance is legible and the cost (fragile chime tap in lethal altitude) is visible, satisfying the 9− gate.</comment>

<comment>The causal chain is pristine: acid-sea rot → floor collapse → launch ramp dissolving supplies the decisive change beat; arrow-notched gears provide the because/therefore linkage that converts fractal vision into lift. Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the un-heard bell is struck, path foreclosed—no retreat to workshop or sea. Cost is crystalline in the image of a canvas-and-brass skeleton drifting in vacuum. Orientation is taught by 50 words; no lens ambiguity at end.</comment>

<comment>The workshop-acid-sea functions as antagonistic environment: every creak lowers the launch window, the green slush literally eats the floorboards that become the runway. Kaleidoscope-as-lens and obsidian arrow are micro-setting tools that constrain perception and inscription choices; removing either breaks the flight logic. Sensory selection is POV-tight—violets/amber fractals noticed only because they reveal updrafts. Final image of gold-layered silence reuses the buoy introduced paragraphs earlier, fulfilling 9+ tool-charge test.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“touch the sky before dissolution”—is signaled in sentence two and tightens each time a brass plate is jettisoned. The floor’s final groan is the single escalation that collapses retreat and forces launch; cost is paid in real time as the workshop is devoured. Agency stays mechanical yet causal: Seven chooses lighter canvas over shielding, chooses to carve notches, chooses to extend the manipulator for the chime. No coincidence rescues; the bell tap is微型胜利 that reweights the premise rather than resolving danger.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as the absurd grandeur of unmourned achievement: the universe’s joke is that meaning is generated, not received. The chime’s silence is the resonant reconfiguration—proof of ascent minus audience, a CR that reprices the algorithm’s drive from “escape” to “witness-self.” No moral is stated; the laughter-in-static supplies the non-literal answer. Obsidian arrow and kaleidoscope return in the final clang, satisfying motif-with-cost without checklist ornament.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Voice is brass-cog cadence: hissing prayers, giggling madness, holy mischief—diction stays inside a machine-turned-monk lexicon. Syntax compresses under ascent (“He hit the ramp just as it crumbled”) then expands into reverent awe at the gold layer, mirroring pressure shift. Perceptual signature—fractal-mandala turbulence instead of clouds—is unique and consistent. No head-hop; POV distance stays tight to Seven’s sensory bus.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Rhythm varies from piston-short to thermal-loft long; no template cadence detected. Metaphors are machined-specific (“brass drums spinning the etched flight paths”) and never mixed. Information density high: one sentence often does setting, tool, and emotional charge (“He watched the storms fracture… into binary notches”). Minor scaffold: “the day of the Great Ascendance arrived, or at least that is what he named the Tuesday” could compress, but it is voice-motivated gallows humor, not redundancy. Closure image clear.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses steampunk, post-apocalypse, and ascetic quest into an image set rarely paired: a kaleidoscope-eyed cart kite on an acid sea. The hunter’s obsidian arrow repurposed as stylus for wind-code is a specific, non-obvious tool transformation. Risk—stripping all armor for weight—pays off narratively and thematically. Final unheard bell clang is a fresh conceptual punchline that reweights prior beats; remove any part and the joke collapses.</comment>
