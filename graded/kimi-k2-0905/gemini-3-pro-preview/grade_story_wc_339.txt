<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is cerebral but embodied through tactile micro-choices (isolating panic threads, grounding the globe). The single contradiction—seeking detachment yet conversing with “Mort”—is kept performative rather than dramatized, so never quite bites. The final renunciation (letting the snow settle) is properly caused by his analytic intervention, paying visible cost in the dissipating vortex. Voice remains coherent, but the “physics of letting go” thesis is stated more than lived through bodily risk.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens: pattern of density increase inside the library, cadence shift when the globe’s vortex slows, closure via Charged Poise as the silence lightens. Orientation anchored by word 70 (“submersible navigated…”), no drift. The one deepening—threads dissolve after globe is touched—reweights stakes and is legible on-page. Cost is felt in the “oppressive weight lifting,” satisfying 9+ test though not maximal.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Sunken library is tactile, selective, and biased through Elias’s archival gaze; every sensory note (stagnant water, pulp fog) feeds his analytic goal. Micro-setting object—the pristine snow globe—literally constrains the final choice and charges the image. Spatial choreography is clean: dock → swim → desk → globe → ascent. Professional sub-details (vector of swirling snow, stylus notation) are sparse but sufficient for this beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: isolate the physics of letting go; signaled in paragraph 4 and tightened when globe vortex slows, narrowing his options to intervene or retreat. No external antagonist; pressure is the refusal-energy trapped in the globe. One visible price: the library’s “oppressive weight” dissolves, implying Elias has spent psychic capital to break the loop. Escalation is textural accretion rather than causal reversals, coherent under chosen lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme—grief as thermodynamic equation—emerges via imagery (vector snow, decay rate) rather than exposition. Subtext in the silent conversation with “Mort” implies death is a co-worker, not an enemy. Final image of settling snow reweights the premise: refusal can be released, but only through analytic surrender, not emotional catharsis. Avoids explicit moral; melancholy lingers in the clipped souvenir.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person tight psychic distance, lexicon of archival science (“vector,” “dataset”) sustained without register drift. Rhythm modulates: long clauses for descent, staccato noting for vector, quiet cadence for final snow-fall. Perceptual signature—cataloguer of abyssal artifacts—colors every observation; no head-hop. Dialogue limited to one murmur, clean. No elision or experimental grammar, but voice is sufficiently idiosyncratic.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sentence variety strong; no template cadence runs or synonym loops. Metaphors are coherent (panic as lead spiderweb, vortex as kinetic memory) and do not obscure causality. Information density high: each sentence advances scene or concept. Minor scaffold: “the water here was…” repeats “water” but serves as topic pivot; not penalized. Closing line has crisp propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Premise—haunted snow globe as final radio transmission—is fresh synthesis of ghost-story and deep-sea archival salvage. Specific detail (ceramic village, stylus notation) keeps concept grounded. Risk of cerebral detachment is acknowledged by giving analyst a souvenir, charging final image. No close echo of iconic scenes; transformation test passed—plot collapses without Elias’s dataset stance. Slight deduction for familiar “man maps grief onto physics” trope, but execution is non-obvious.</comment>
