<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid—her trance-swaying, the fixed smile while needling stone—but her contradictory impulses are shown more than dramatized in a single micro-choice. The “haunting optimism” is embodied, yet the moment of highest cost (collapse risk) is sensed rather than sharply tested. Motive stays singular and coherent; still, a hairline gap between shown flaw and on-page cost keeps her just shy of 8.8.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: dawn reveals the stitched canyon, making decay reversible at felt cost—her exhaustion and the scar-visible proof. Causality follows Accumulative/Textural logic: each dream-loop stitch tightens the mesh until the canyon’s “tapestry” reweights meaning. One transition (sunset→dawn) is legible; orientation anchored by line 4. No lens ambiguity; cost is visible in the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Red canyon, draining sea, kelp-steel filament, and the illustration plate recur as constraining objects; the mesh floor created from them charges the final image. Sensory economy is tight—vanilla humidity, moonlit needle-flash—filtered through Elara’s obsessed perception. Spatial choreography tracks her spirals without drift; the labyrinth’s verticality directly shapes her footfall-stitching tactics. Micro-setting (the plate) and macro-setting (bridging chasm) both alter options, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—reversing fatalistic collapse—is signaled early and tightens as each stitch narrows the falling-apart canyon. Agency is continuous: every swing of the needle forecloses retreat and raises physical/ideological cost. Escalation is Accumulative: density of silver-stone mesh increases until the dawn-image reweights “ruin” into “reverence.” One visible price—her trance-ending collapse—locks the cost on-page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: the possibility of rewriting geography as scripture. The etched plate’s golden bridges mutate into literal stone sutures, reconfiguring myth from decay to renewal. No moralizing; the scar-tapestry is the argument. Ambiguity lingers—will the knit hold?—but complexity is honored, giving resonance beyond the scene.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays anchored to Elara’s body and hallucinatory attention; perceptual signature is distinct—sleepwalking loops, metallic taste of sandstone dust. Prose rhythm mirrors her trance: long clauses for spirals, abrupt monosyllables for needle-punches. No dialogue, so voice purity remains intact; diction stays within her artisan-poet lexicon. Filter verbs minimal and motivated; compression taught early (“she did not move in a straight line”) pays off in closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm varies from tidal cadences to hammered imperatives; no template cadence detected. Figurative language is selective—“bruising shadows,” “tapestry of silver and stone”—each image advances setting or stakes. Zero paraphrase loops; information density high (one line can weld tool, body, and philosophy). Minor elevated diction (“somnambulant”) fits trance register and does not obscure causality at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The “poetic wharf weaver” who literally sews fractured canyon walls is a fresh synthesis of mythic loom and civil-engineering insurgency. Sleepwalking as structural method converts psychological quirk into world-building logic, risking vertigo yet paying off. Familiar tropes—fallen city, oracle-optimist—are re-cast through tactile granularity of kelp-steel petrifying in moonlight. Risk-taking sharpens stakes without obscuring closure; the concept feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
