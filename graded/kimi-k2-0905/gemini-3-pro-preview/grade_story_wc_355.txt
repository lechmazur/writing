<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elias’s pacifism and “empathic locksmith” persona are vividly particular—his velvet motley coat, tuning-fork diplomacy, and refusal to “force a secret” all manifest in embodied action. Interiority stays concrete: “sorrow rots if it is not allowed to breathe” is spoken aloud, not summarized. The micro-choice to bow to the diary before touching it crystallizes his hierarchy of values and costs him time while the city counts down to fireworks, a visible price. No contradictory impulse is dramatized in-scene, however; the arc is a smooth ascent of competence rather than a struggle with flaw, capping this just below the 8.8 gate.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The causal chain is clean and elegant: because Elias refuses violence, he must locate the emotional frequency of the clasp; therefore he cycles oscillators until the lock “sighs” open. The closure is a textbook Resonant Reconfiguration: the diary’s exhale and the simultaneous crimson bloom overhead reconfigure the stakes—silence is now catalogued, regret forgiven, and the festival’s violence of color accepted. Cost is legible in the single beat of withheld fireworks: Elias stands alone while the city celebrates, his empathic labor complete but socially invisible. The lens holds without ambiguity, though the piece stops short of a persistent constraint that would shape future choices, keeping it shy of 9.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The roofless workshop under cold stars is immediately anchored and filters every action: open sky lets sound escape, forcing Elias to hunt for silence rather than noise. The vacuum tubes’ amber glow and drifting dust motes are tactile, lived-in, and economically selected. Crucially, the setting supplies the final image: fireworks light the coat into “crimson glory,” recharging the earlier velvet texture and fusing outer night with inner triumph. Environment does not constrain tactics beyond atmosphere, so the 9+ gate is just missed.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes are singular: open the diary without violence while the civic countdown looms. Pressure escalates through each rejected frequency; the tightening is the narrowing audible space before the sky itself erupts. The protagonist’s agency is absolute—every oscillation is his decision—and the final “sigh” is earned. However, the cost is aesthetic rather than practical; no tool breaks, no social credit is spent, keeping this below the 8.8 band where visible price is mandatory.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: empathy as a non-invasive resonance with locked grief. The diary’s silence shifts from defensive to confessional without a single explanatory line; the fireworks’ violent beauty externalize the paradox of tender force. No moral is stated—only the final catalog entry “The Exhale of Forgiven Regret” reweights prior material. The absence of a counter-argument or complication keeps this just under 9.0.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person keeps tight psychic distance; every metaphor is filtered through Elias’s synesthetic ear (“sharp…like ozone…like a swallowed word”). Syntax lengthens and softens during the lullaby frequency, then contracts at the metallic sigh, mirroring emotional cadence. No head-hop, no filter-verb clutter. The voice is distinctive enough that two sentences could fingerprint the piece, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet lyric: “the ghost of sounds, a symphony of attempts” compresses atmosphere and action in one breath. No paraphrase loops or mixed metaphors; each figurative vehicle is acoustically consistent. Rhythm modulates from staccato forks to the long vowels of “warm, rhythmic thrumming,” accelerating into the single-sentence firework release. One minor scaffolding—“he realized”—slips in mid-epiphany, but it does not touch the closure beat, holding the 8.6 plateau.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The empathic-picking trope is familiar from safecracker stories, yet here the lock’s emotion is not anthropomorphized but acoustically mated with a lullaby heartbeat—an auditory angle that feels freshly inevitable. Risk is taken: a 700-word story whose climax is a metallic sigh and whose antagonist is a brass spring. The synthesis of pacifist ethics, sound physics, and festival counterpoint is non-obvious and fully committed, meriting the bonus.</comment>
