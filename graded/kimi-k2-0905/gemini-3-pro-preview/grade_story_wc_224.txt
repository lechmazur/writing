<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—clinging to blindness while hunting a “shape of home”—is vivid; her mercury-glass micro-choices (reading pathways, deciding to seed) embody cost. Suppressed talent turns from label to live threat at the stone, then to deliberate tool, earning the final Planting beat. The only slip: “trauma” is named once; the embodied white eyes already showed us. Still, a renunciation that forecloses escape back to illusion is legible and paid.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: distorted reflection → find stone → tactile quill → unlock cipher → seed stone → golden roots lock shelves. Each because/therefore tightens options until the mountain’s heartbeat crystallizes the Resonant Reconfiguration: home becomes self-grown jail/garden. Cost is the burial of her last escapist exit—felt in the trembling glass she finally lowers.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The tottering book-mountain is never backdrop; shelf integrity, sliding lexicons, and paper-mulch under fingernails steer every step and final plant. Mercury glass acts as micro-setting that literally reframes chaos into path, charging the closing image when it trembles at the new rooted shelf. Sensory hierarchy skews tactile/auditory—perfect for a seer who “reads” with skin. One minor over-ripened adjective (“dust-choked”) but otherwise economy and POV filter hold.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“shape of home”—is signaled in para 2 and tightens twice: first when stone demands buried talent (she could flee), then when planting forecloses retreat to nightly hallucination. Escalation is causal under lens: each step increases physical collapse risk and emotional exposure cost until the heartbeat converts threat into stability. No external antagonist needed; fear of self-made ruin supplies pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from particulars: stacked books = fragmented memory, mercury glass = self-deceptive narrative, seeded stone = cultivated belonging. Final Conceptual Repricing re-weights “home” from external location to internal, generative act without moralizing. Subtext in the raw feather’s barbules singing into bone offers quiet aftershock: knowledge can be intimate violence. No abstract thesis statements—idea stays implicit, haunting.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person intimate maintains consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature skewed to tactile and sonic detail appropriate to blind seer. Syntax lengthens slightly in calmer beats, then compresses during quill-spark and seeding, mirroring pulse. No head-hop; “hidden thunder” idiom stays in POV as felt vibration. One clause drifts toward poetic omniscience—“the memories were sharp edges she refused to touch”—but immediately re-anchors via her thumb on feather.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>High-density lines (“petrified folios that rose miles into thinning air”) carry world-building, stakes, and image in one stroke. No filler, loops, or synonym churn. Metaphors stay internally consistent (geologic/bookish) and don’t collide. Read-aloud rhythm modulates: long anaphoric shelf descriptions vs staccato seed beat. Clean grammar, zero typos. Final line lands on concrete noun “boots,” giving stability lexical click.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>Book-mountain as memory mine, mercury-glass pathfinding, and phantom-feather stylus are fresh syntheses that feel inevitable post-seed. Premise risks allegory yet stays anchored to bodily choice. Risk in abstract stakes (“shape of home”) is justified by tactile payoff. No recognizable pop-culture or workshop template echo. Bold compression of epic into 700-word seed-myth proves concept integrity without gimmickry.</comment>
