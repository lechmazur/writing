<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elian’s contradictory motives—obedient technician vs. covert savior—are dramatized through tactile micro-choices (dissolving resin, looping chain) and embodied trembling under sabotage pressure; the final renunciation of official approval is earned and costly. Interiority stays concrete, profession-specific, free of diagnostic cliché. Only the absence of a second on-page character keeps relationship/status bullets unused, not a flaw.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal chain is airtight: resin discovery → hidden bypass plan → thermal-breath window → chain restraint → false "Closed" reading; each because/therefore link narrows options and raises exposure. Closure unit is a Charged Poise: the city’s sensors now lie, Elian is irreversibly a saboteur, chain slack in shadow = persistent future risk; cost is legible in the false gauge and his sweat. Orientation and lens hold cleanly through single-scene arc.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Volcanic amphitheater is not scenery but tool: thermal expansion timetable dictates the heist window, masonry groans supply diegetic countdown, brass chain hidden from electronic eyes embodies low-tech evasion. Details filter through machinist POV—grease, vapor, iron counterweight sway—guiding every tactical move. Micro-setting rule satisfied: the chain-as-tool constrains the final milimeter of axle turn.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—save Outer Ring without being executed—tightens once: the breathing-window is the only live option, failure snaps the chain and dooms the banished. Protagonist agency drives each escalation; coincidence is absent. Price is concrete: falsified records make him perpetually discoverable, trembling hands carry lingering adrenaline cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of encrypted mercy emerges through action: hidden blueprint in glue, mechanical sabotage masquerading as obedience. No explicit thesis; final image of slack chain in shadow reweights prior masonry grandeur as complicit accomplice. Ambiguity remains—city may still discover lie—so complexity is preserved. No closing moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person POV stays tightly anchored to Elian’s machinist perception; diction ("magmatic-resistant stone," "brass links bitten into iron") reflects his vocational lens. Rhythm accelerates with shorter clauses during wheel-turn climax, then exhales with slack chain drop. No head-hopping or register drift; figurative language stays within plausible tech-poet idiom.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty—exposition embedded in action, no paraphrase loops. Variation in length and cadence mirrors thermal inhale/exhale. Only minor hedge ("precise time of night described") could trim, yet it serves archival tone. Metaphors ("building breathes") remain coherent and physically grounded.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fusing hydraulic infrastructure with dormant-amphitheater opera house feels inevitable yet fresh; encrypted message in 300-year-old glue vaults past trope of found map. Choice to use antique chain instead of laser measure turns mundane tool into suspense fulcrum. Conceptual risk—volcano as clock—pays off without breaking physical logic.</comment>
