<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara’s refusal of neural links and embrace of slow mana are shown through embodied beats (frosted goggles, knees on permafrost). The final renunciation—shedding the regulatory pack—carries visible cost (shivering, unburdened solitude) and is earned by prior causality. Interiority stays concrete; no diagnostic self-labeling. Micro-choices (slotting the keystone, slumping against the arch) reveal value hierarchy without sermon. Flawed solitude is accepted, not cured: an Earned Stasis that forecloses return to the city.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds throughout: refusal of city → theft of keystone → ascent via mist walking → unstrapping pack → inserting stone → Looms stutter. Each beat tightens options; the arch’s impossibility is seeded early and paid off when the stone “sighs” into place. Closure is a Decisive Change: the city’s music halts, mana flows human-slow, and Elara’s cost is the eternal cold she now inhabits. No teleporting props or convenient amnesia; the keystone’s theft is motivated and tracked.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The icebound spire is no postcard: wind “bit,” mist walking tears stamina, permafrost bruises knees. The brilliant-dim paradox (pale starlight brighter than sun) is filtered through Elara’s mage-perception and charges the final white flare. Spatial choreography is clean: pack slides “into the abyss,” stone slots into “jagged, rime-covered gap.” Environment constrains the climax—only at this altitude does the arch “accommodate impossibilities”—so the setting directly enables the closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reclaim human-paced magic—signaled in paragraph one and sharpened by each beat: regulatory pack whines, mist walking drains stamina, unstrapping risks death. One meaningful tightening: shedding the pack forecloses city safety and triggers the final act. Cost is visible—shivering body, eternal exile—and alters tactics (she can never descend to the warm Looms). Escalation is causal, not spectacle-driven; the Looms’ heartbeat skip is the understated but undeniable consequence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges without thesis statement: slow human creativity vs. algorithmic perfection is dramatized by the Looms’ stutter and the keystone’s sigh. The sacred-in-simple lands as Conceptual Repricing: a rough granite wedge, not a crystal, re-anchors reality. Final image—“magic that refused to fade”—reweights earlier “lingering luminance” without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers: the city may restart, but the spire’s arch now holds a counter-frequency that can’t be unsung.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Elara’s perceptual bias: wind “bit,” goggles frost, stone feels “heavy with purpose.” No head-hop; regulatory pack’s whine is heard through her bones. Syntax mirrors mage-attention:long vowels for cold, staccato for pack buckles. The final “slow, deliberate, and deeply, terrifyingly human” is the only overt abstraction, but it is earned as the Looms fall silent. Lexicon stays within her plausible register—no corporate drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet athletic: “brilliant dimness” compresses paradox into two words; “lingering luminance” reappears only when it can reweight the ending. No scaffold or synonym loops; each sentence advances cold, cost, or concept. Metaphors (wind “bit,” stone “sighed”) are spare, mixed only once (“visual silence that screamed”) but justified by the folly’s rule-set. Read-aloud rhythm accelerates during mist-walk transitions, then settles into the final white flare. Zero filter-verb stacks; no artifacts in closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Familiar tropes—rebel mage, icy peak, artifact—are re-forged through specific pressure: the keystone is not power but a wedge of temporal friction. The “Great Looms” trope is inverted: their perfection is vulnerability, their silence the miracle. Risk-taking (arch restores by time, not magic) pays off because the premise is fully committed to; no safety-hedging explanation. Fresh synthesis feels inevitable: only a “flawed hand” could re-tune a world tuned by flawless machines.</comment>
