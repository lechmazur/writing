<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Silas’s monomaniacal drive to reseed the dead reef is vivid and embodied; his ritual gestures (listening for the tern’s three-note shriek, whispering “Aethel garda”) reveal a hierarchy of values without interior label-speak. The absence of any contradictory impulse or micro-choice that could fail keeps him from full complexity; he never hesitates, mis-throws, or questions the covenant. Still, the final image of the carriage rattling away while emerald kelp consumes rusted war machines shows an earned stasis: the battlefield is literally being swallowed by the garden he paid for with obsessive solitude. Cost is visible—he returns alone to the gloom-hill—but the story could have pushed a hair deeper had a flaw or doubt surfaced on-stage.</comment>

<comment>Causal linkage is tight: because Silas speaks dead languages, therefore he deciphers the tern’s cadence; because the cadence pinpoints the veil, therefore the pods sink and trigger bioluminescent kelp. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) appear by line 4; no penalty. A single meaningful tightening occurs when the mournful three-note shriek marks the instant pods must be cast—options narrow from “search” to “throw now.” Closure is a Charged Poise: the grey ocean reconfigures into living emerald, undeniable conceptual cost paid by the reef’s rebirth while the coachman rides back into darkness. One hairline slip: the phrase “submerged concord” is named but never tested or threatened; it lands cleanly nonetheless.</comment>

<comment>The blooming jetty is not postcard scenery; its phosphorescent creepers literally guide Silas’s hand placement and frame the precise drop zone. Salty rails, oily water, and rusted war skeletons are filtered through his re-vegetative obsession—he smells “clean salt” only after the kelp ignites. Spatial choreography is immaculate: we track boots on timber, gloved grip on satchel, the downward arc of pods, the upward spiral of spectral kelp through sunken tanks. Environment constrains the final image: the living tapestry overtakes the war wreckage, recharging the motif of roots consuming metal.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—reclaim battlefield via garden—is signaled in paragraph two and escalates through the ritual beat. Agency is high: Silas alone chooses the instant of casting after decoding the birds. Cost is visible on-page: the reef accepts, pods burst, kelp spirals—his offering is irreversible and the war machines are literally being entombed in vegetation. No secondary reversal is needed at this length; the single tightening suffices under causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: regeneration of life from militarized death, voiced through image rather than assertion. The final tapestry of emerald kelp threaded through rusted guns reweights the earlier smoke-and-shelling memory without moralizing. Subtext lingers in the coachman’s solitude—he seeds life yet rides back to “shadowy slopes,” suggesting the garden will flourish without him. Avoids sermon; lets silence after “Aethel garda” carry the prayer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Silas’s perceptual filter; no head-hop. Diction is weathered, stone-ground, sea-salt: “gloom-hill coachman,” “grinding stones,” “obsidian mares.” Rhythm swells with the ritual—long sentences for listening, staccato cast for the throw. No dialogue, so no register clash. Internal access is modest; inference tags (“he knew exactly”) match a man who traffics in half-forgotten tongues. Voice is distinctive enough to survive excerpt test.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>High information density: one sentence can deliver coat brushing rail, smell of old rain, and satchel weight. Metaphors stay physically coherent—“tapestry of living emerald” is anchored to actual kelp threads. Zero paraphrase loops; no filler filters. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image (roots consuming battlefield). One near-purple phrase “narrow vastness” is earned by structural repetition and pays off in final paragraph.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: post-apocalyptic eco-ritual performed by a coachman-linguist who gardens via ornithomancy. Tropes (dead reef, lone reseeder) are reweighted through dead-language bird-calls and iron-wheeled carriage. Risk—lyric causal compression—pays off when kelp actually rises on-page. Not generic “hopeful greening”; the garden literally swallows ordnance, a specific reconfiguration that could not swap settings without breaking logic.</comment>
