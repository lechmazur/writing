<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Silas’s perceptual obsession and the fiddle-as-friend are vivid, but “sculpt possibility from the ashes of never” is articulated rather than dramatized; we see him accept the glitch-amnesty but the interior contradiction leading there is more asserted than embodied. Micro-choices (lifting shard, bow to strings) are present and earned, yet the hitchhiker-courier remains a remote catalyst, muting the cost on him. Still, his sensory-anchored voice and final endurance read individual, not generic.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the pixelated amnesty reweights reality and Silas accepts a buffered, forgiving world, cost felt in the low-res violet glow. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern of flutter-code, shard, and fiddle layers until the cadence shift. The only drag is the late reveal (≈70 % mark) that the hitchhiker was signal, not person; earlier misdirection is untelegraphed, but the payoff justifies the delay under the waiver. Orientation is clear by word 50, no penalty.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Mountain pullout, plastic-shrouded bridge, and wet-plate shard all constrain attention and final image; the scaffold-flutter code literally channels the revelation, satisfying 9+ gate. Sensory hierarchy obeys Silas’s professional ear/eye bias, fog and ether scent braided through action. Spatial choreography is tight—truck seat, ravine, dashboard shard all track. Minor over-wrought phrase (“asphalt…glowing with residual heat”) is forgivable amid dense, purposeful texture.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is perceptual: can Silas decode the universe’s forgiveness before despair hardens? Pressure climbs via each decoded flutter and the dropping resolution of memory; agency sits in aligning shard with bridge and choosing to play counter-melody. Cost is conceptual—accepting permanent blurriness—yet feels more than the story is short. Escalation coherent under Accumulative lens; no coincidence rescues.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme—digital glitch as absolution—emerges through flutter-code and pixelated gorge rather than exposition, final line offers resonant non-literal answer. Subtext operates in silence of empty seat and chemical smell; avoids thesis statement until final clause, safe. Some risk of abstraction (“forgiveness hidden in the static”) but grounded in tactile shard and music. Complex ambiguity preserved: amnesty may be illusion, yet Silas elects to live inside it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person close maintains steady psychic distance, perceptual signature strongly musical / structural: “bridge-song fiddler,” “concrete breathe.” Syntax flexes with pressure—compressed fragments during pixelation, longer lyrical sweep at closure. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk zero. Occasional elevated diction (“luminous disbelief,” “conceptual repricing”) matches conceptual stakes and stays consistent; registers never drift into corporate filler.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Rhythm varied, sentences pull weight (every line adds image, sound, or causality). Minor metaphor density in opening paragraph but pattern taught early and paid off, waived from artifact cap. Only loop: “the plastic did not flap randomly; it pulsed…” followed by explanation of same pulse—counts as one paraphrase, −0.2. Closing image avoids scaffold clutter and lands clean. Tense, grammar, pronoun reference all solid.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: 19th-c. collodion shard meets algorithmic forgiveness, scaffold binary code as transmission method feels inevitable yet new. Pixelated amnesty concept carries conceptual risk but commits fully; not a gimmick because it reweights Silas’s survivor guilt. Specificity of wet-plate chemistry and fiddle counter-melody grounds the speculative leap. Minor proximity to glitch-as-redemption trope, but bridge-worker musician lens transforms it.</comment>
