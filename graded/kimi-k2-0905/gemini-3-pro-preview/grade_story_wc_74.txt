<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elian’s insomnia, painterly eye, and hunger to rekindle a lost kindness are vivid; the embodied exhaustion and ghost-like grace show rather than label. The memory of the bread-giver and the extinct syllable give sharp personal stakes, and the final surrender to sleep lands as earned cost. Yet the interior contradiction—how moonlight alone recharges the brush—is asserted, not dramatized, keeping him just shy of the 8-band where micro-choices under pressure would fully crystallize.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the glowing ideogram is answered by a pulse across the smog, proving kinship survives; Elian’s drained brush and sudden sleep show felt cost. Causal linkage holds: moonlight → brush → symbol → distant reply → release. Orientation is swift; greenhouse, night, and city are anchored by word 60. No lens ambiguity; the accumulative/textural design tightens once and lands.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The rooftop greenhouse—saffron quiet against gray amnesia—functions as micro-setting that both enables the ritual and isolates Elian. Condensation on the glass becomes the only canvas that can hold moon-ink, directly constraining the action. Smog-erased history is not backdrop but the very problem the symbol seeks to heal. The final blink across the ravine recharges the skyline image, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prove forgotten kindness still pulses—is signaled early and tightens once when the distant window answers. Escalation is textural: each luminous stroke increases atmospheric density until the single flash reweights the premise. Cost is visible in the spent bristles and Elian’s collapse. The beat is sufficient for this length, though a second obstacle or risk would push it past 8.2.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: language may die, but the grammar of compassion can be re-inscribed in light. The extinct syllable and moon-script tie personal memory to collective amnesia without sermonizing. The final blink reframes the city from apathetic machine to latent community. No late thesis statement; resonance is carried by image alone.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elian’s bruised perception; diction (“waxing moon’s milky beam,” “silver-white mane”) is painterly yet precise. Rhythm swells and subsides with the brush-strokes, mirroring insomnia’s cadence. No head-hopping or filter-verb clutter. Voice is distinct enough to lift into the 9 corridor, though a hairline repetition of “brush” slightly dulls the final sentence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence or synonym loops. Figurative language is selective—moon-tipped brush, saffron quiet—and each vehicle stays coherent. Information density is high: every sentence advances image, motive, or atmosphere. One mixed metaphor (“bridge built of light and memory”) is minor enough to leave the 9-band within reach.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Moon-ink calligraphy that can re-awaken a city’s empathy is a fresh synthesis of solarpunk hope and linguistic loss. The ideogram-as-signal reframes graffiti into sacred transmission. Specificity—silver mane of an extinct beast, extinct dialect for “same blood”—grounds the conceit. Risky uplift lands without gimmick, meriting the high band.</comment>
