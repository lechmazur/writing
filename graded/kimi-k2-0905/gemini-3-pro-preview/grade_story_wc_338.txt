<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s “methodically curious” trait is dramatized through the forensic video comparison and the tactile, empathic press on the stone; the micro-choice to mimic grief rather than force the wall shows interior contradiction and embodied cost. The final beat—hand dripping rain as the spiral drops— crystallizes earned access and personal exposure, fulfilling the closure cost test. No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible N/A; solo arc is coherent and specific.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: the 1920s film → locates lost lever → Elara’s empathic push → spiral opens, each step a because/therefore link. Closure is a Decisive Change with felt cost: the chapel’s “breath of stale, incensed air” rises to meet her, making the trespass visceral. Orientation anchored by 80 words; no teleporting props or causal amnesia. Persistent constraint: the rain-erased pigment can never be restored, leaving future access vulnerable—price is legible on final line.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Rain-scoured vault, collapsed roof, and henge-shadow triangulate the lever location; the lost fresco pigment literally hides the mechanism, so environment constrains tactics and charges the final image. Micro-setting—the depression smoothed by centuries of water— is handled tactilely and determines the exact hand placement that triggers the stair. Sensory hierarchy obeys Elara’s map-framer eye: visual precision first, then kinesthetic vibration. No spatial drift; weather affects action (wet stone, dripping hand) without overwriting.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—access the Whispered Chapel— is signaled in paragraph two and tightens when the only clue is a smoothed depression. One meaningful escalation: the shift from archival observation to corporeal empathy (mimicking grief) narrows options from intellectual to visceral, with visible cost: she must expose her own emotion to the stone. No coincidence resolves; the 1990s tourists’ blindness heightens stakes by showing what failure looks like. Price paid: the chapel’s stale breath rises, implying irreversible auditory exposure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme—listening to erased voices—emerges through the silent footage and the rain-erased fresco; the final image of trapped echoes reframes earlier “framing the world” vocation as ethical trespass. Subtext in the woman’s silent naming of the mourner implies personal loss Elara now inherits. No moralizing; the chapel opens but what it will ask of her remains ambiguous, inviting reflection. Recurring silence motif shifts from archival absence to imminent auditory exposure, reweighting meaning without statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tightly aligned to Elara’s perceptual bias—visual triangulation, tactile caution, synesthetic “vibration hummed through her boots.” Diction (“spectral pantomimes,” “shielded openness”) is precise to her map-framer precision and emotional reticence. No head-hopping; psychic distance contracts under pressure: clauses shorten as the stair opens. Filter verbs are minimal and voice-motivated. Rhythm mirrors emotional arc: long observational sentences early, clipped kinesthetic beats at climax.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty—description advances causality (“rain… erased the painted saints” hides the lever). Metaphors are spare and grounded: “vault’s broken archway” anchors spatially; no mixed vehicles. No loops or scaffold; each paragraph advances knowledge or pressure. Opening line anchors stakes and weather; final line resolves with image that recharges the tear motif. Proofing clean; no tense drift or simultaneity errors.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Fusion of archival forensics with empathic archaeology feels fresh; the video-comparison method turns a trope into character-specific ritual. Lost pigment as concealed switch leverages real conservation decay for plot, not ornament. Risk: quiet climax could feel anticlimactic, but the spiral’s breath reconfigures stakes from discovery to exposure. Transformation test fails if Elara isn’t a map-framer—her professional lens enables the tear repair metaphor that closes the piece.</comment>
