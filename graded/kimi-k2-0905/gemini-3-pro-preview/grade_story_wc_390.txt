<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elias’s “logically emotional” label is dramatized at the climax: he catalogs fear, then strips gloves and vocalizes—an embodied micro-choice that fuses intellect and instinct. The contradictory impulse (precision vs. surrender to sound) drives the decisive turn; the cost—bare skin freezing on iron—makes the renunciation visible. Interiority stays concrete (“the key ceased to be a solid object and became a waveform”), avoiding diagnostic speak. A hairline slip: “he understood that the terror gripping his gut was merely a biological response” drifts toward explanation; tightened, this would clear 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: failure-to-turn key → sonic matching → absolution wave, each beat a therefore linkage. Closure is a Decisive Change with felt cost—organs shaken, coat tightened against new cold—paid on the page. The key-turn obstruction is foreshadowed by psychic pressure, not retrofitted. Time/space anchors clear by 50 words; no orientation debt. Missing 9-band: the stillness lands cleanly, but the rule cost (key’s new fragility?) could be crystallized one beat longer.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setting pressure is literal: drift-ice slabs grind hulls, forcing the brass console to seize; the marina’s acoustic groan becomes the obstacle Elias must tune into. Cold brass, wool coat, and the key’s iron/bone composite are handled tactilely, their temperatures tracked across beats. Golden sunset → bruise-colored → blue night keeps time and reweights the “old bruise” motif at closure. Micro-setting (key as severed finger) charges the final image; environment shapes tactics, satisfying 9-gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—artifact protection—faces a single, tightening obstacle: mechanical torque fails, live option narrowed to vibrational surrender. Escalation is causal: each decibel of spirit-scream raises the cost of failure, forcing Elias to wager flesh. Price is visible—bare skin freezes, fillings vibrate, organs scrubbed—altering tactics (gloves off, mouth open). The absolution wave forecloses the haunting but not the cold; residual cost keeps pressure alive into night.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of acoustic mercy emerges through action: the artifact’s peace is earned by turning noise into silence via bodily risk, not sermon. The “fleshly ethereal” tone materializes as corporeal vibration, so the spiritual is sensed in meat and iron. Final image—engineer buttoning coat against real cold—reweights prior bruise-light: absolution does not warm, it only quietens. Avoids thesis statement; one near-miss: “core concept of sonic absolution” edges toward label, but embedded in wave beat, it stays tolerable.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person POV stays locked to Elias’s sensorium; perceptual signature is engineer-technical (“categorized the fear,” “applied torque,” “vibrational matching”). Syntax mirrors pressure: long clauses collapse into fragments as key yields—“a fluidity that defied the laws of friction.” Diction stays within coastal-mechanical lexicon; no thesaurus drift. Rhythm accelerates into the vocal drone, then exhales with the stillness, a conscious cadence shift that earns the lyric close.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Sentences carry dual duty: “the wool of his uniform heavy with the damp salt air” grounds body + setting in one stroke. No scaffold loops; each metaphor is single, physically coherent—“color of old bruises” recurs, accruing rather than repeating. Peak beat avoids purple: “key… became a waveform” is exact, not ornate. Opening and closing lines frame voice and reverb; minor copy polish on two comma splices would lift to 9-band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: lighthouse engineer + spectral acoustics + vibrational lock-picking transforms familiar ghost-at-sea into science-mystic heist. Specificity anchors novelty—“drift-ice marina,” “ultra-low frequency absolution”—rather than gimmick. Risk taken by making climax a vocal drone instead of brute force; payoff legible in bodily cost. Could push further if artifact’s peacetime limit were seeded earlier, but within 700 words the angle feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
