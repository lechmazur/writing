<comment>Elara’s refusal-to-evacuate backstory is dramatized through the father’s jacket and the compass, giving her stubborn survival a concrete genealogy. The interior contradiction—clinging to a useless compass while admitting “north” is impossible—survives the lyric register and peaks when she flips the symbol from comfort to charter. The final stance crystallizes a believable, scaled cost: she forfeits the hope of rescue for the solitary labor of mapping. Voice stays particular; no diagnostic self-labeling undercuts the beat.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the compass redefined from talisman to explorer’s badge, with the cost—permanent exile—felt in the “quiet concentration of a cartographer at the edge of the world.” Causal linkage holds: because she stays, she survives; because she survives, she re-sees the sky; because she re-sees, she recommits. One micro-turn (chaos → legible topography) tightens stakes under Accumulative/Textural lens. No orientation debt; who/where/when anchored by line 3 and reinforced by jacket cue.</comment>

<comment>The observation deck functions as micro-setting that constrains every choice: the gravity hum, the blue-shifted glare, the cold deck plates against her knees all veto escape and force the sketching ritual. Jacket-as-tool inherits the same work: rough fabric, gilded thread, and inherited scent tether her to filial duty while rewriting its purpose. Spatial choreography stays clean—no impossible camera moves—so the deck, body, and jacket fuse into one continuous pressure chamber. Final image charges the jacket’s compass as the new true north, qualifying 9+ gate.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—sanity vs. engulfing relativistic chaos—tightens once: the glimpse of hidden geometry converts panic into mapping mission, foreclosing the “wait for rescue” option. Escalation is textural/accumulative rather than causal-reversal: density of light-ribbons increases until pattern breaks, forcing new stance. Cost is conceptual but legible—she accepts unending, possibly futile labor in exchange for meaning. No coincidence; pressure remains coherent under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as the re-pricing of orientation itself: not locating oneself in space but choosing to generate maps when space has dissolved. The jacket’s compass, the anniversary sketch, and the “edge of the world” final line thread the motif without overt thesis. Resonance is oblique—reader left to feel the loneliness of meaning-making—yet emotionally honest. No final-paragraph moralizing; silence carries the aftertaste.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric remains tightly focalized through Elara’s perceptual filter: “wet brush” metaphor, “dying note” gravity, “hurricane inside” simile all derive from a navigator’s child trained to see skies. Syntax flexes with pressure—short clauses during glimpse, longer cadences during reflection—without losing clarity. No filter-verb stacks; no head-hop. Register stays within her plausible lexicon even at elevated moments.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Strong information density: single sentences often layer sensory data, backstory cue, and emotional charge (“heavy naval jacket she wore, her fingers brushing…gilded compass rose applique stitched over the heart”). Metaphors are kept to one per beat; no mixed vehicles. Rhythm modulates naturally; no template cadence or synonym loops detected. Minor scaffold: “the chaotic swirls were not errors…they were a language” could compress, but clarity remains intact and closure image is unmarred.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Familiar tropes—lone survivor at black hole, family heirloom—are inverted by treating the compass as anti-magnetic and the survival as accidental pariahdom rather than heroism. Sketching ritual, anniversary custom, and “edge of the world” cartography give specific cultural grain. Risk: lyric stillness inside hard-SF premise paid off by conceptual repricing rather than technobabble reveal. Synthesis feels inevitable yet not derivative; proximity to “Interstellar” visuals is transformed through hand-drawn map ethic.</comment>
