<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Elara’s contempt for tranquil oblivion is sharply embodied in her sweat-slick effort to hold “thousands of variables” at once; the bottle’s growing heat makes the cost physical. What keeps this from 9-band is that the interior contradiction—why she alone refuses the void—is asserted (“she inherently rejects…”) rather than dramatized in a micro-choice we can witness. Still, her flayed-mind imagery and trembling legs show a credible, flawed endurance that earns the impending shatter.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Amber bottle absorbs the entire civilization-simulation in a single, legible Decisive Change that will overwrite the silence; cost is the palpable flaying of her working memory. Causal linkage holds: because the town chose ease→erasure, therefore Elara reverses by bottle-birth, paying with biological overload. Orientation is clear by line 3; only minor waver is “decades ago” left hanging without anchoring date cue, but the payoff at closure makes it functional.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>“Spectral glow…unmoving water” and “friction of a wagon wheel on cobblestone” deliver selective, sensory particulars that mirror her urgency; the lanterns refuse to burn out—an environmental rule that later flares in response to her act, charging the final image. Micro-setting (bottle) literally contains the future, constraining her choice to shatter it. Proper-noun economy is tight; no geography drift. Entry to 9-band blocked because lanterns’ causal feedback is mentioned but not shown altering her tactics mid-scene.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—refuse annihilation via mental genesis—is signaled early and tightens as each added variable narrows her cognitive bandwidth to collapse-risk. Escalation is Accumulative: density of imagined bread-smell, greed, hunger, ambition intensifies pattern until the bottle glows. One visible price: sweat, trembling legs, mind “flayed.” Internal/external pressures interweave; no coincidence rescue. Missing a mid-beat option closure tighter than the single final shatter, keeping it sub-8.5.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</question><comment>Theme emerges organically: ease = erasure, struggle = existence. Subtext is in the tactile glass growing hot—abstract concept becoming physical weight. Final image of “miniature, chaotic storm” inside the bottle reweights earlier lanterns’ stasis without moralizing. No thesis statement; complexity remains: her new age will hold greed and pain. Only slight softness: “beautiful, gritty struggle” flirts with abstraction, but immediately grounded by sensory specifics.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person keeps steady psychic distance, perceptual signature filtered through alchemical attention—“seamless perfection of its surface,” “paradox of glass.” Syntax grows clipped under peak stress: “She added greed…hunger…ambition.” No head-hopping; diction stays within her plausible lexicon. Filter verbs minimal; no register drift. Dialogue absent by design; prose rhythm alone carries the crescendo to shatter.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High density: one sentence often performs ambience, stakes, and bodily cost. Metaphors are clean—“mind…flayed”—and sustained without mixed vehicles. A few contiguous “she”-openings create minor cadence echo but pattern taught early and climaxes with purposeful repetition. Small paraphrase loop: “amber bottle…amber shifting” in adjacent clauses costs −0.2. No artifact touches closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Familiar trope—last person revives dead world—made specific through cognitive-genesis bottle and working-memory overload as literal labor. Risky compression of entire society into single psychic container pays off; bottle-as-womb is fresh inflection. Transformation test passes: specificity of alchemical lineage, lantern cove, memory strain could not swap with generic post-apocalypse. Only missed 9.0 by hairline: premise still recognizable, but execution lifts it.</comment>
