<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elias’s “purposefully curious” trait is dramatized through concrete micro-choices (sneaking out, jury-rigging a chemical timer, pressing the sand grain into his finger) that escalate risk and reveal internal contradiction—he both serves and resists the colony’s efficiency ethos. The final endurance beat—holding still until the terminator—carries visible cost (frostbite ache, bleeding fingertip) and earns the image. Flaws are shown (non-conformity, obsession) rather than labeled, and the sand grain functions as a tactile anchor that keeps interiority embodied. The only limit at this length is that we get a single, albeit potent, crystallization rather than a broader arc of change.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: because he is a curious rule-breaker → illicit summit → invents undetectable timer → endures drones/frost → captures final dark → mirror array activates. The “chemical strip turns crimson” moment supplies an on-page Decisive Change with felt cost—his body shivers, fingertip bleeds, and the colony’s eternal day begins. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive within 60 words; no lens ambiguity. Closure is clean, though the conceptual repricing could be sharper—the image is strong but stops just short of reconfiguring future options on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The moonlit summit is more than backdrop: vacuum cold limits suit time, jagged ridge dictates tripod placement, low gravity shapes the slow cerulean crawl of the chemical timer. Sodium-lit colony below serves as moral counter-pressure, making Elias’s turn-away act legible. Micro-setting tools—tripod, vacuum seals, hourglass grain—constrain tactics and charge the final image. Sensory selectivity (fogging visor, gnawing teeth-ache) stays in POV filter without tourist excess.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“capture the last true night”—is signaled in paragraph one and tightens through each beat: patrol sweep, frostbite, timer limit, orbital mirror countdown. Agency is endurance rather than combat; every second he stays narrows escape options. The crimson flip of the strip is the visible price-trigger that forces the final shutter press. Cost is visceral (pain, exposure) and conceptual (eternal light begins), satisfying the 8.8+ gate for visible price even without a villain.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: industrial conquest versus irreplaceable dark; efficiency algorithms versus human hunger for mystery. The image of cerulean creeping up the strip becomes a metaphor for time itself being cornered, reprised in crimson at the climax. Final line—“saved before the lights went on forever”—offers a quiet conceptual repricing that invites reflection on loss and memory. Ambiguity is preserved: we are not told whether the photo will matter to anyone else.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elias; no head-hop. Perceptual signature is concrete and vocation-specific: “vacuum seals,” “regolith,” “sodium light,” “terminator line.” Syntax tightens under pressure—fragmented clauses during countdown, then elongated sentence for the dawn hush. No dialogue, so voice must carry all texture; it does, with tactile verbs (“crept,” “gnawing,” “sliced”). Register never drifts into editorial; every word belongs to a man who measures cracks in moondust for a living.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>High information density: one sentence can deliver tool, body warning, and moral stance (“cold seeped… a gnawing teeth-ache in his bones, but he had to remain motionless”). Metaphors are spare and precise—“razor-thin line of diamond-white light”—never stacked. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn; each sentence advances knowledge or pressure. Rhythm modulates: long buildup, staccato countdown, luminous release. Copy-clean; no scaffolding or hedge phrases. Final image is uncluttered, letting the conceptual cost resonate.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Premise flips the familiar “last sunset” trope to lunar dark, freshens it with industrial mirror array rather than natural eclipse. Chemical timer made from contraband reagent feels specific to this world, not generic spy gear. Hourglass grain as talisman is a lovely inversion of timekeeping: single particle instead of flowing sand. The photo-as-resistance angle could feel sentimental but is grounded in Elias’s inspector expertise and the bodily cost he pays. Risk is taken and landed: quiet lyric ending instead of chase or sabotage, yet stakes feel large.</comment>
