<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s retrocognitive curse is dramatized through tactile micro-choices—gripping railings, cranking gears—so her obsession with pattern feels lived-in. The final weep is earned because every bodily effort has been anchored to her need to validate coincidence. No contradictory interiority or competence inflation; struggle stays legible. Just short of 9 because the cost is more existential than materially foreclosed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal chain is pristine: prism find → silence bubble → star alignment → beam eruption, each step because/therefore. Closure delivers Decisive Change with conceptual cost—the world’s noise is momentarily defeated and watchers are forcibly re-oriented. Orientation is locked by line 3; no lens drift. Persistent constraint (the tower’s thousand-year cycle) shapes tactics throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Glass floor, brass cradle, rusted gears—each object is handled, not catalogued, and constrains the final alignment. The pavilion’s hum becomes a bodily metronome that times every move. Grime-streaked dome and star geometry are filtered through Elara’s custodian eye, never touristic. Micro-setting (the prism slot) literally decides success or failure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prove pattern exists—tightens when silence collapses and she must crank gears before entropy floods back. One meaningful escalation: the hush buys seconds, forcing physical strain under star-clock. Cost is felt in popped ears and trembling muscles, foreclosing retreat. Coincidence complicates but does not resolve; the beam is her earned act.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme—randomness vs. pattern—emerges through the prism’s silence defeating atmospheric chaos, never stated. Final image of watchers seeing “a thistle-blown hope” reweights the premise: meaning is not transmitted data but the fact of attention. No moralizing; the resonance is conceptual and visual. Ambiguity survives: the light carries no cure, only witness.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person lingers inside Elara’s perceptual bias—sweat of dead engineers, star paths as custodian geometry—creating a distinct texture. Syntax lengthens under retrocognitive overlay, then fractures into short beats during the crank, mirroring pulse. No head-hop; psychic distance tightens with physical strain. Diction stays within her plausible lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary from lyric cadence to staccato crank-by-crank without algorithmic pattern. No paraphrase loops; each image advances pressure or atmosphere. Metaphors (“lance of pure, white brilliance”) are spare, never stacked. Final line “the coincidence was a lock, and she had found the key” lands clean, no overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Shard-of-hush as anti-entropy tool feels fresh yet inevitable in a post-collapse sky. Retrocognitive custodian is a novel occupation that dictates every move. Risk taken: sci-fi lyricism that could slide into abstraction, but grounded via tactile gear-crank. Not quite 9 because the star-alignment trope is familiar, redeemed by silence twist.</comment>
