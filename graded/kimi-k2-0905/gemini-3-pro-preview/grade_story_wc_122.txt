<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Silas’s tactile synesthesia—reading stone, spinning silence—gives a singular interiority; the snapped needle and counter-clockwise symphony externalize his emotional stasis without therapy-speak. His single micro-choice—lowering the jagged arm—triggers the reversal, and the tear-streaked aftermath shows earned cost. No contradictory impulses appear, but the arc is so compressed that the flaw-to-consequence chain feels more illustrative than lived; still, the embodied deaf-music-teacher lens is inseparable from stakes.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands cleanly: the filament of hush snaps, sorrow floods in, stance is reconfigured (“ready to teach again”) with felt cost. Causal chain—broken stylus → counter-spin → filament extraction → trance → tear—holds under Accumulative/Textural lens; one meaningful tightening suffices. Orientation is anchored by ~60 words; no teleport or luck. Minor waiver: the belt-drive mechanics are elided, yet the reader is taught the ritual’s purpose early enough to accept the payoff.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Limestone dust, moss-lined vault, and drum-skin resonance are filtered through touch-centric deaf perception, turning cavern into womb. The antique turntable becomes a micro-setting that literally constrains the final action; without its mass the needle could not transmit torque. Seasonal rustle is named but never alters clock or tactic—decorative—hence capped below 9. Spatial choreography is clean; no white-room syndrome.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—break emotional numbness—signaled in line 4; pressure intensifies through tactile amplitude until the tear pays the price. Agency resides in the decision to lower the jagged arm; coincidence absent. Escalation is textural (density of vibration) rather than causal reversal, fitting the Accumulative lens; one decisive intensification suffices. Cost is unmistakably on-page: the sob he cannot hear but feels tear from throat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the inversion trope: music dismantled to spin silence becomes the path back to feeling. No character states the thesis; the final image of hand on warming drumhead reweights earlier drum-skins as silent witnesses turned resonant allies. Emotional after-effect is concrete—reader left with the ache of restored sorrow rather than a moral. The concept of “filament of hush” acts as CR, repricing silence from absence to presence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person interiority stays tightly latched to Silas’s haptic channel; no head-hop. Syntax lengthens and compresses with vibration intensity—“jagged needle bit… violence… tremor”—mirroring wave physics without purple drift. Diction stays within plausible lexicon of a music teacher feeling through bone. No dialogue, so voice contamination absent. Final sentence cadence mirrors a resolved chord, achieving Charged Poise.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>High information density: one sentence often layers geology, emotion, and tool function. No scaffold loops; metaphors (silver filament) remain consistent with physical logic. Rhythm modulates from long winding clauses to staccato gasp, supporting pulse. No mixed vehicles or filter-verb stacks in peak beats. Opening and final lines perform anchoring and resonance duties respectively.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The deaf-music-teacher premise is fresh, but the deeper novelty is using reverse-groove friction to birth silence as a positive substance. Inevitable in hindsight: drum-skins foreshadow womb, snapped stylus prefigures pain-birth. Specificity—turntable belt reversed, limestone resonance—prevents trope abstraction. Risk (technical ritual) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Could not swap elements without collapsing concept.</comment>
