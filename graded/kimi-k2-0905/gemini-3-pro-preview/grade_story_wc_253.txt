<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Ruthless interiority: the mask, the bouquet, the carving all act as pressure gauges for Silas’s self-erasing logic. Contradictory impulses—clowning vs. clinical detachment—coexist in every beat, culminating in the chilling “completely empty” stasis. Micro-choices (slicing stem, dropping persona) visibly foreclose love; cost is the hush itself. Voice specificity wavers only in the announcer register, which briefly flattens to caricature.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each shaving of wood and flower petal adds density to the “remade hush.” Closure lands in a Charged Poise—the zero-gravity quietude—whose cost is legible in the dust pile that was once his wedding bouquet. Orientation anchors by line 3; no因果 ambiguity. One tight escalation: the bouquet’s gradual disintegration reweights the stake from ‘hide grief’ to ‘erase capacity to grieve.’</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Turbine shadows as industrial scythes, knotty pine sap bleeding onto fingers, browning petals that crumble audibly—every sensory pick is filtered through Silas’s survivalist attention. Micro-setting (table, knife, bouquet) becomes the entire moral arena. Wind-farm energy is not backdrop but the heartbeat that justifies the Happiness Mandate. Final image of dust on a scarred tabletop recharges every prior tactile cue.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—avoid erasure by manufactured joy—tightens when each carved shaving makes grief lighter and humanity thinner. Agency is the whittling itself; each stroke narrows future feeling. No reversals needed: the deepening is the recognition that “lightness” equals nullity. Cost is paid on-page: the bouquet’s absolute reduction to dust.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: the state’s demand for joy colonizes even private grief, turning love into waste material. Subtext lives in the grotesque sportscast—comic escalation that hides the horror of self-lobotomy. Bouquet’s final silence reconfigures the premise: mourning is treason, so the only safe memorial is none. No moral is stated; the dust heap is the argument.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is a controlled double exposure: cold clinical observer + carnival barker. Syntax swells and contracts with the announcer persona, then snaps to surgical terseness (“Precision work”). Perceptual signature is unique—eyes slit through porcelain, ears tuned to blade friction. Free indirect slips are clean; no POV leakage. Rhythm mirrors turbine pulse; final whisper lands like blade retracting.</comment>

<comment>Zero loops; every sentence either advances carving, removes feeling, or textures the hush. Metaphors stay mechanically coherent—gladiatorial imagery maps to wood grain without stretch. High density: one sentence can embody sound, memory, and legal risk. “The remade hush settled over him” is a textbook closure clause—no scaffolding, pure payoff.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Freshens dystopia by privatizing it: not citywide revolt but one man carving his soul into compliance. Wind turbines as happiness enforcers is a concrete, non-cartoonish world rule. Whittling-as-self-lobotomy turns pastoral hobby into horror instrument. Risk—the clown commentary—could have capsized into gimmick but stays integral to the dissociation tactic.</comment>
