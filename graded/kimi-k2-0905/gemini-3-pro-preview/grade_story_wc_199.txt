<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Silas’s meticulous seed-sorter nature is shown through embodied micro-gestures (tweezers, breath held) and the final prod that costs him his hoarded seed, turning obsession into gift. Interior contradiction—delight in grey ash versus need to placate roots—stays in scene, never decays to label. Monument-building ritual grows from flaw (order as shield against ruin) and forecloses hoarding; the glowing sapling is earned renunciation. No second character on stage, so relationship/status bullets skipped; single-POV interiority remains specific and consistent.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the moonstone swallowed into living wood reweights the rule “what is planted here emerges transformed” with visible cost—Silas loses unique relic and seed. Causal lens holds: hush arrives → leaf angle signals tribute → monument → prod → transformation. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) appear by line 3; no debt. One meaningful tightening: silence collapses external wind and internal option to delay. Cost is legible in the final image—glowing leaves are both monument and memorial, no explanatory tag appended.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Floating ash-cloud arbor is not postcard backdrop; shelf-fungus workbench, star-moss patch, and wind-borne detritus constrain Silas’s physical reach and supply ritual materials. Micro-setting—the seed circle—functions as altar and crucible; removing it breaks the ritual logic. Sensory hierarchy obeys POV: tactile dampness first, visual glint of moonstone second. Final blue-glow sapling reuses setting element (moonstone) now embedded, charging closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—will Silas surrender his hoarded seed/moonstone to honor the roots’ demand—signals early and tightens once when the crimson leaf angle dictates tribute. Agency: only he can perform the prod; no outside rescue. Cost is visible: moonstone is “precious,” seed “heavy,” both consumed. Escalation is accretive rather than reversed; option to keep relic is foreclosed by his own ritual completion. Coincidence absent; hush is natural law, not lucky break.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme—memory demands living tribute—emerges from leaf angle and seed sacrifice, never stated. Subtext operates in object silence: moonstone’s journey from ground-dweller jewelry to crown to heartwood carries centuries of loss without exposition. Final image reconfigures ash as snow-like nurture, repurposing earlier “destruction” motif. No closing moral; resonance arises from blue glow refracted through leaves, a non-literal answer to decay.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person close stays strictly inside Silas’s perceptual sieve: “soft to the touch, damp with life” is seed-sorter diction, not tourist catalog. Syntax mirrors his precision—comma-bound catalogues of twigs, pebbles, grains—then fractures into breath-held fragment at climax. No head-hop; ash, fungus, and detritus are named only as he handles them. Dialogue absent by design; narrative voice carries idiom alone and remains coherent under pressure.</comment>

<comment>Prose is dense yet buoyant: single sentences deliver tactile fact, world rule, and emotional tilt (“ash continued to fall, but… looked less like destruction”). No filter-verb stacks, no paraphrase loops. Figurative vehicles stay consistent—ash = snow, seed = crown, moonstone = glint of history—without mixed-metaphor clutter. Read-aloud rhythm accelerates across the final beat (icicle crack → spiral upward) then exhales into closing snow image, matching sapling pulse.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Floating post-apocalyptic arbor seeded by ritual micro-monuments is fresh synthesis; no prior canonical template matched. Moonstone dust speck as trans-temporal relic feels inevitable yet unanticipated. Risk of quiet, non-violent climax paid off by luminous botanic payoff that reweights ash from doom to nurture. Specificity—eyelash-twigs, sand-grain pebbles—defeats generic eco-fantasy; transformation test passes: story collapses without seed-sorter discipline and relic sacrifice.</comment>
