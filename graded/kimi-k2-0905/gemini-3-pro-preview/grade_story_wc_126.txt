<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara’s hypersensitive hearing is more than label—it physically hurts, dictates how she moves barefoot on concrete to catch fire-born vibrations, and forces her to play a raw, unresolved lament rather than a triumphant tune. Her contradictory drive—to *not* heal the world yet still perform—peaks when she leaves the melody hanging; the cost is the continual ache of perception she must endure. Micro-choices (scraping resin, selecting driftwood for its resonance, bow pressure tuned to dome frequency) show value hierarchy and flaw in action. Interiority is sensuous, not clinical; no therapeutic self-diagnosis, only embodied ache and resolve.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative-textural lens: each sensory layer (hush, rust, salt-rot, glass hum) adds density until the dome itself becomes a cello body, re-weighting stakes. Closure is a Charged Poise: the final suspended note conceptually re-prices silence from void to canvas—undeniable cost is Elara’s perpetual auditory pain kept alive. Orientation anchored by word 60; no causality breaks; dome’s resonance foreshadowed in “fragile lung” opener and paid off when glass answers the violin. Fire-lighting sequence supplies because/otherwise: without her flint-spark the ritual—and thus the communal reconfiguration—cannot occur.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sunken orchard, oxidized tanker-ribs, and salt-tolerant apple micro-ecology are irreplicable; remove any piece and the resonant frequency changes, breaking the climax. Sensory hierarchy obeys Elara’s ear-dominance: sound of settling steel precedes visual catalog, ash-smell before color. Environment dictates tactics: she kneels on concrete to feel vibration, chooses driftwood for percussion, times bow stroke to dome’s glass hum. Spatial choreography tight: fire-circle centre, hull fragments as flint, audience shadows between trunks—no impossible moves.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake: prove silence is not absolute while accepting the world cannot be fixed. Escalation is textural density: hush presses glass → resin fire cracks → violin finds dome frequency, each layer raising the cost of failure. Agency resides in micro-sonic choices: tuning to shipwreck hull as amplifier, accepting perpetual ear-pain instead of seeking cure. Price is explicit: “unresolved” melody denies both audience and player catharsis, locking Elara into nightly repetition of ache.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from pattern: brokenness honored, not mended—jagged apple limbs, chipped bowl, rusted ships, deliberately dangling final note. No character sermonizes; meaning lives in gesture (bow lifted but not lowered) and image (note “hangs like visible smoke”). Subtext of communal kinship forged by shared silence reframed as shared canvas; ambiguity remains whether this is enough for future survival. Final image reweights premise: silence becomes possibility rather than absence—earned, painful, yet hopeful.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person anchored tightly to Elara’s sensorium: every descriptor filtered through acoustic bias—“low groan of settling steel,” “sigh of currents three fathoms down.” Rhythm swells with sensuous, clause-heavy cadence then thins to stark fragments at climax—“She lowered the bow”—mirroring unresolved note. Metaphor chain (dome = lung = cello) stays consistent, taught early, paid off at resonance beat. No head-hopping; lyric compression in bonfire passage is taught by prior concrete imagery, remains legible.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops, scaffold, or filter-verb stacks; high information density—one sentence often carries sensory, emotional, and symbolic freight: “glass dome…fragile lung preserving last breath.” Varied sentence openings avoid drumbeat; participles only when actions truly overlap (“feeling the vibrations…she raised”). Figurative language sparse, precise: metaphor of dome-cello is extended, not piled. Final line’s metaphor of silence-as-canvas is fresh yet inevitable, recharges “chronic hush” without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Post-drowned orchard tuned by shipwreck acoustics feels novel yet organically stitched: no trope shopping, only logical extrapolation of rising sea + rust belt. Violinist who weaponizes silence via resonant frequency converts familiar apocalypse into sensory arms race. Transformation test fails if Elara becomes generic survivor; her ear-pain and refusal to heal keep concept unique. Risk in lyric accumulative structure heightens rather than obscures clarity; payoff justifies form.</comment>
