<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s calm, methodical interiority is consistent and profession-sharp; the scorched patch moment forces a flash of empathy that complicates her detachment. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene, so the “earned cost” is more conceptual than embodied, keeping her just shy of the 9-band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The causal chain is lucid: survey → map → foresee next crash. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—her data will reweight the skies for the next pilot; the scorched patch supplies felt cost. Minor waiver: orientation is complete by word 70, lens holds throughout; one beat of micro-telling at the ladder could be tighter, stopping just short of 9.0.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The Stacks act as both terrain and antagonist: creaking metal dictates her ladder route and spawns killer vortices. Fog, rust, and saline gloom are filtered through her engineer gaze; every sensory pick serves the aerodynamic hunt. The patch micro-setting re-weights at closure, meeting the 9-gate almost fully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“decode the wind-killer to save the next crew”—is signaled early and tightens when the patch personalizes the abstract loss. The single meaningful deepening (pressure-drop → yaw corridor) forecloses option space under a causal lens; cost is legible yet second-hand, not on her skin, capping at 8.4.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges as “foresight bought with other people’s ashes.” The patch’s re-appearance re-prices the wind-data, turning cold geometry into human debt. No moralizing line is needed; the silence of the town and the singing sensors carry the after-image. Complexity is honored—no tidy moral, only transferred risk.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person close stays locked to Elara’s perceptual filter: saline goggles, anemometer clicks, rotor-assembly tolerances. Syntax flexes from clipped field-notes to lyrical fog-music without losing control. No dialogue, so voice distinctness rests solely on diction and rhythm—both hold under pressure, meriting high-band.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, and double-tasking; only two adjacent near-repeats (“shifting mist…shifting wind tunnel”) slip into template cadence. Metaphors stay aerodynamic and consistent; no mixed vehicles. The final sensor “song” is earned, not grafted. Minor loop keeps it sub-9.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The container-stacks-as-wild-wind-tunnel is a fresh industrial twist on man-made chaos; the convergence concept turns fluid dynamics into fate. Specificity of aviation hardware and scavenger-stripped crash site grounds the novelty. Risk is structural—quiet survey replacing explosive climax—yet coherence never wobbles.</comment>
