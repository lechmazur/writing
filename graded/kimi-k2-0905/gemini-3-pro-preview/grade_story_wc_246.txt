<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elian’s interiority is vivid—“arrogant flourish of a god” beside “imposter in his own life”—and his micro-choice to unbend the nib crystallizes motive. Yet the absence of any second character keeps status/relationship pressure off the page, so the arc is purely self-vs-cosmos; the cost is conceptual rather than relational, acceptable at this length but limiting depth.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each retro-edit is a because/therefore link whose cost is the darkness siphoned into the “law.” The ending delivers a clear Resonant Reconfiguration—history rewritten, ozone scent signaling new possibility—with felt conceptual cost (the room’s darkness spent). Orientation is taught by line 3, well under the 120-word window; no ambiguity at closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The octagonal chamber, DNA-shelving, and gravity anomaly are sensuously anchored and directly enable the causal edits; the nib’s satellite metal is a micro-setting that constrains the unbend action. Selective detail—pages fluttering from the deep past—filters through Elian’s POV and charges the final “ozone and possibility” image. Meets the 9+ gate: tool charges closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“thresh meaning from disaster”—is signaled early and tightens when each edit forecloses a prior timeline. One meaningful deepening: the moment he inks darkness into law, narrowing future options. Cost is conceptual (universe’s darkness spent) rather than personal injury; still legible and scaled to 700-word frame, but slightly abstract, keeping it just below 8.0.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: the ethics of editing suffering versus learning from it. No explicit moral; the ozone scent and “readable” world reweight the premise without sermon. The refrain of “wrong seeds” and “threshing” creates a sparse motif that shifts from guilt to provisional acceptance. Ambiguity remains—world may still be damned—yielding resonant complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person intimate maintains consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature—“sweet, heavy pressure,” “microscopic sigh”—is character-specific and rhythmic. No dialogue, so no voice convergence issue. Prose modulates from languid floating to crisp “arrogant flourish,” mirroring Elian’s confident uncertainty. Patterned elision (“the darkness… laid it down as law”) is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence or synonym loops. Figurative density is high but purposeful—each metaphor (DNA shelves, moth-wing bullet) serves causality. One mixed image—“dry nib scratching empty air like vellum”—barely clears logic. Information density strong; every line advances premise or image. No artifacts touch closure, sustaining high band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Premise fuses cosmic revision with tactile repair of a broken pen—fresh angle on time-travel trope. Specificity of satellite-metal nib and famine-bullet-moth linkage prevents generic swap. Risky second-person address to cosmos is earned by prior humility. Not quite 9.0 because the emotional cost remains more conceptual than viscerally new, but stands out in slush.</comment>
