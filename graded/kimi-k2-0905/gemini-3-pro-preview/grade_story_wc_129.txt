<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s craving for belonging is palpable from the first line; the reed-bundle she clutches against her chest and her instant kneel in razor-dust reveal a self-endangering empathy that earns the elders’ thread. Interior contradiction (the need to join vs. the risk of rejection) is dramatized in scene, not summarized. The final choice—binding her frail reeds around the arbor—caps the causal arc with visible cost: her palms bleed, her reeds are spent, her outsider status formally foreclosed. The only cap is the “boldly sympathetic” label repeated in meta-commentary; the character never names herself that way, so the slip is minor.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the obsidian pillar wears a living coat of grass, reweighting the orchard’s eternal hardness with mortal ephemera. Causal linkage holds: because she comforts the boy, the elders open their mental web; therefore she can complete the weave and be clasped in. Accumulated texture (chiming quartz, thermal updrafts) tightens until the final hush. Cost is legible in the last image—her spent reeds, the boy’s blood on silica—so the lens (Hybrid→Accumulative at end) stays coherent.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The crystalline orchard is never backdrop; its razor ground slices the boy’s knee and its glass roots trip him, forcing Elara’s pivotal kneel. The obsidian arbor drinks light, literally darkening the workspace where she must feel, not see, the tag—environment as tool. Spatial choreography is flawless: precipice → fracture lip → rising arbor, each move tracked without drift. The final image conjugates body, tool, and place: reed cage on volcanic glass under silent sky—setting charges closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“will they accept me?”—is signaled in paragraph two and tightened once: the boy’s injury creates a live test of her sympathy versus their stoicism. Passing that test wins access to the arbor and the right to weave, narrowing her options to a public, irreversible offering. The price is paid on the page: bleeding palms, spent reeds, permanent visibility of her fragile gift on immortal stone. No reversal is needed; one meaningful tightening suffices at 743 words.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The chord of “soft fragility grafted onto unforgiving permanence” emerges through reed vs. obsidian, hum vs. silence, wound vs. glass—never once stated. The final image reweights the premise: community is won not by mimicry but by wrapping hardness in vulnerability. Subtext in the boy’s blood on silica whispers that belonging costs flesh. No moral is declared; resonance is purely visual-tactile.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is lyric-accumulative, sentence rhythm echoing the orchard’s chime: long clauses shimmer, then fracture into single-note shards—“a low vibration of comfort.” Perceptual signature is concrete-bodily: marrow-ache, reed-sweat, silica-graze. No dialogue, so no head-hop risk; interior access stays strictly with Elara. Register never drifts into abstraction; even “luminescent ache” is felt in bone, not coined as slogan.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is taut, lyrical, and propulsive; each sentence adds sensory or causal value. Figurative layering is dense but patterned—light as violence, silence as epoch—so the risk pays off in closure image. No loops, scaffold, or template cadence detected; clause variety mirrors thermal updrafts of tension. Only micro-slip: “razor-dust” is physically contradictory (dust can’t cut), but the image is brief and doesn’t dull the final gleam.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The reed-sculptor in a post-language world is a fresh synthesis; the tag-search ritual converts street art into silent archaeology. Transforming vandalism into a living weave reverses the usual “art immortalizes” trope—here mortality completes the monument. Risk in compressing an entire rite of passage into 743 words succeeds because texture replaces plot mechanics. Specificity of marsh-reed humidity trapped inside glass feels inevitable yet non-obvious.</comment>
