<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s contradictory drives—craftsman precision vs. annihilating denial—are embodied in every fold; the bleeding thumb sealing the dream-paper is a micro-choice that costs skin and forecloses his own release. Interiority stays concrete (“rhythmic friction of gem polishing” vs. “sheer force of his denial”) without therapy-speak. The final renunciation—sending the crane to orbit mirrored spires forever—earns its stasis through prior causality and leaves him hollowed on-page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the paper crane becomes an eternal, luminous creditor circling the Basilica, re-weighting ascension as perpetual torment. Causal chain holds: prism → blood → sheet → crane → launch, each step because/therefore. Orientation anchored at word 60; no prop teleporting; cost is the invisible gem that literally deletes itself once used. Lens is Causal; no contradiction at the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The floating tea garden’s white-gold scour and gravity-glass chains are not backdrop—they funnel the crane’s paradoxical flight path and literalize “descends while ascending.” The invisible prism functions as micro-setting that constrains the entire dream-capture mechanics. Sensory hierarchy obeys Elias’s artisan eye: facets before fragrance, light before steam. No spatial drift; bodies and objects track cleanly from wrought-iron table to sky-edge launch.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can he trap her evaporating dream—tightens once: the prism vanishes, forcing blood tax and origami gamble. Escalation is causal: each polishing stroke strips possibility until only folding remains. Visible prices paid: dress hem shredded, thumb split, dream flattened, grief externalized into an immortal drone. No off-stage rescue; the final image shows the cost still climbing the sky.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the inversion of ascent: salvation equals surveillance, memory equals torment. No character articulates the thesis; the crane’s eternal orbit is the silent argument. Subtext lives in gesture: folding her laugh into a wing is simultaneously preservation and imprisonment. Resonance is non-literal—readers re-weight the Basilica’s mirrors as panopticon, not paradise.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is lantern-maker precise: “velvet hem,” “gravity-glass,” “wisp-lights” are occupational diction. Rhythm accelerates with shortened clauses during blood-bind, then lengthens with elegiac cadence at launch. No head-hopping; perception stays strictly in Elias’s calloused fingertips. Compression like “the stone vanished from sight, leaving only a hole in the air” teaches the pattern early and pays off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Syntactic variety avoids drumbeat; sentence lengths mirror emotional intake—staccato during fold, long lyrical release during flight. No paraphrase loops; each line advances image or causality. Metaphors are coherent: “luminous torment” is literalized by violet sparks scratching sky. Opening line anchors voice and paradox; final line recharges “luminous torment” by letting the crane become it.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The dream-recording prism rendered as vanishing void, grief folded into a bird that falls upward to eternal sentry duty—this synthesis feels inevitable yet unseen before. Risk distinction: the paradoxical physics is not explained but embodied in the crane’s flight path, heightening emotional stakes without gimmickry. Conceptual integrity commits fully; no retreat to generic afterlife clichés. Specificity of “wisp-lights of the lower marshlands” roots the magic in a lived trade.</comment>
