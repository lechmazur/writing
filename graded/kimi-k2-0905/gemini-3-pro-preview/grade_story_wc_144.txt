<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elias’s tactile genius is embodied in every micro-adjustment; his blindness is not a label but a lived constraint that forces inventive diagnostics. The moment he palms the drone, his fingers “read” the dented sensor array like Braille, a concrete micro-choice that alters the repair path. Interiority stays grounded in mechanic idiom—no therapy-speak. The only absence is a second on-page relationship to test status shifts, but the single-POV crucible holds.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the hummingbird’s hum fuses with the departing airship’s roar, reweighting Elias’s quiet endurance as the price of perfection. Causal chain is immaculate: misaligned gyro → refracted light → micro-servo tweak → firmware patch → flight. No teleporting props; the looming anchor lift is tracked auditorily across beats. Cost is felt in the fading sound—his world darkens again once the drone leaves.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>“Mist-coated rail depot” is re-anchored viscerally through smell of wet iron and the groan of lifting anchor. The brass kiosk becomes a micro-setting that constrains movement—its threshold literally slows frantic travelers. Water-filled basins function as both tool and environment, dictating diagnostic choreography. Final image of shadow sliding across skylights syncs external change to internal resolution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—the drone must fly before *Aethelgard* departs—tightens audibly with every engine crescendo. One meaningful deepening: the refraction data spikes smooth under Elias’s fingertips, foreclosing error and locking in the true horizon. No false reversals; pressure is accumulative/textural, intensifying through sound and vibration. Cost is the irreversible moment the ship’s shadow passes—time paid in full.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: craftsmanship as secular faith—machines have souls mended by touch. The hummingbird’s resurrection is a non-literal answer to what it means to “see.” No moralizing; resonance arrives through the final merger of hum and roar. Ambiguity lingers: is Elias’s calm liberation or confinement? The image refuses tidy equivalence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays riveted to Elias’s haptic perception; no filter-verb drift. Syntax grows clipped under deadline pressure—“upload bar ticked forward”—yet retains tactile specificity. Voice distinction is internal: courier’s breathlessness is rendered only through Elias’s ears. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is consistent blindness-to-sound-to-touch translation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary from laminar-flow long clauses to staccato ticks of data. High information density: one line can layer smell, sound, and micro-motion. Metaphors are mechanical yet lyrical—“lifeless droop” of wings—without purple excess. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances state or sensation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The blind mechanic who “sees” via water-refracted light is a fresh inversion of sighted hubris. Tropes—airship launch, ticking clock—are re-grounded in tactile specificity rather than spectacle. Risk is taken in making the climax a quiet release of sound, not a set-piece chase. The synthesis feels inevitable: only this man could mend this bird for this ship.</comment>
