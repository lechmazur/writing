<comment>Elara’s vocation and grief are fused into every gesture; the walnut-stained hands, the trembling removal of the photo, the refusal to “save an empire” all show a woman whose identity is the archive. No interior clichés—her ache is conveyed through tactile ritual, not psych talk. The micro-choice to let the locket fall is a perfect Earned Stasis: she pays with permanent loss to become guardian rather than possessor. Only the slightest safety-hedge keeps this from 9—she is never allowed to falter or misstep, so flaw feels curated rather than lived.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Causal lattice is immaculate: each physical nudge (tilt stone → divert trickle → mix ink) cascades into metaphysical payoff, proving “proximate causes” is method, not ornament. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the laugh migrates from silver to atmosphere, revaluing memory as public climate rather than private keepsake. Cost is legible in the dropped locket—she trades ownership for stewardship, forever. Time/space anchors arrive by line 3; no orientation debt; lens holds from first clause to last image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The jetty’s orchid-choked planks, salt-pollen haze, and violet bruise of sky are not backdrop but reagents—petals “sigh” open to absorb the released laugh, turning biology into archive medium. Micro-setting rule satisfied: the loose stone she tilts is both tool and topography, its new angle enabling the entire chemical rite. Sensory economy is ruthless—every scent or color later reappears as emotional data. Only the refusal to let weather obstruct her ritual keeps this from 9; storm or wind could have tightened cost further.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—can grief be converted into breathable atmosphere?—is signaled in paragraph one. Escalation is single tightening: the photo’s submersion forecloses retreat; once ink hits fiber, failure equals erasure of the last laugh. Price is visible—she forfeits the locket, the only portable relic. A second reversal or external obstacle would have pushed higher, but the solitary ritual earns its resonance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without dictation: history is not chronicle of empires but pollen in lungs, laughter in planks. The regenerated covenant reframes haunting as civic resource—ghost becomes weather. Final image answers the tacit question “what is an archive?”—a place where joy is left to bloom wild, owned by no one. No moralizing, only re-pricing; ambiguity stays alive.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric remains tightly lashed to Elara’s perceptual filter—every metaphor is something she could taste or touch (ink, salt, petals). Rhythm swells and compresses with breath: long sentences during slow steep, clipped fragments when the laugh “vibrates.” No head-hop, no filter-verb clot. Diction stays within her artisanal register—“distilled husks,” “silver halides”—without slipping into catalogue. Voice is distinctive yet never showy; a hairline repetition of “dark/darkening” is the only blemish.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet effortless: “the wooden planks…smelled of salt and heavy pollen” does world, body, and mood in one inhale. No loops, no scaffold; each sentence adds new chemical or emotional state. Metaphors obey physical logic—ink mirrors sky, petals act as reagent beds. Final line lands with crystalline snap, recharging “laughter” from noun to climate.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: archival science + tidal necromancy = grief converted into public weather. “Regenerated covenant” is not fantasy trope but ecological contract, reimagining haunting as photosynthetic. Risk—quiet lyric handling of high-concept magic—pays off by making cosmic feel intimate. Without Elara’s specific stains and the orchid-planked jetty, the spell collapses; irreplaceable parts create irreplaceable whole.</comment>
