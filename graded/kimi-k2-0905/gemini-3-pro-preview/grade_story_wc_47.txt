<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elias’s quietly proactive gardening of the ruins and his wordless offering of the pendant externalize his interior motive to “graft new meaning onto old wounds,” embodying the trait instead of labeling it. Mara’s guarded trembling and silent acceptance of the amber show fully embodied, contradictory emotion—terror and tentative trust—without diagnostic language. Their mutual silence under the honeyed hush is a credible Earned Stasis that costs them the safety of speech yet re-opens the possibility of life; the pendant is both literal talisman and micro-choice that crystallizes the shift. No interior drift into therapy-speak; every beat is filtered through tactile attention to moss, water, and breath.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The water-drip arrow is a textbook Accumulative/Textural hinge: it literally guides Elias to the amber and then to Mara, tightening both spatial and emotional vectors in one image. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration— handing over the pendant reweights the ruin from corporate relic to shared nursery; the cost is the forfeiture of speech and the shared risk of being hunted. Orientation is complete within 50 words (who, where, when), lens holds from first sentence to last, no prop or motive lapse. The final hush is felt, not declared, satisfying the cost-proof test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The breached data-center-as-biotope is never dumped; we learn it through Elias’s pruning fingers and redirected trickles, the wet-stone/ozone scent, stalactites thawing above their heads. Setting actively constrains: only the melt-drip arrow makes the pendant findable; only the moss offers hiding. Micro-setting (the amber, the dust-crack flooring) is handled twice and charges the final image when Mara clutches the resin beneath vines. Spatial choreography is pristine—distance, direction, and object state track without drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can anything still grow after public shaming?—is signaled in para 1. Escalation is the quiet tightening of the drip-arrow → amber → encounter, each step foreclosing flight and forcing stance crystallization. Agency is renunciation: Elias gives up words and safety to sit beside the exposed whistle-blower; Mara gives up solitary panic for shared stillness. Cost is visible: they remain physically exposed beneath dripping stalactites, cameras blind but hunters still possible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the accretion of organic reclamation images—lichen, condensation, clover, ambered seed—without once stating “nature heals.” Subtext of surveillance versus sanctuary is carried in the grid-down silence and the pendant’s fossilized privacy. Final image of two breathing humans under thawing ice offers a non-literal answer: survival is not escape but shared, planted vulnerability. No closing thesis; the emotional aftereffect is the hush itself, charged with risk and possibility.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person close stays locked to Elias’s perceptual field—“soft, deliberate tread of a watchful dreamer,” “topographic maps of lichen bloom”—then widens only to include what he can intuit of Mara through her tremor and eye-contact. Syntax lengthens and breathes during discovery, compresses into fragments at the approach: “He did not speak.” No head-hop; dialogue is absent by design, so voice modulation happens through cadence and image recurrence. Diction remains within a self-taught gardener’s lexicon; no corporate register leakage.</answer>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</question><comment>Sentences vary from 4-word imperatives to 30-word lyrical coils; no template cadence or synonym loops detected. Metaphors (“creeping green velvet,” “crystal daggers”) stay physically coherent within the abandoned server hall. Information density is high—each sentence advances setting, motive, or relational tension; no scaffolding. Final line (“grafting his quiet hope onto her shattered peace”) achieves closure without overwriting; no mixed vehicles or momentum drag.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>The post-digital moss garden is not a tableau but a living pressure system; the viral confession as backstory is handled in one clause yet drives every breath. Amber pendant reprises the idea of preserved bios-data without slipping into cliché. Fresh inflection: whistle-blower hideout in a server mausoleum being eaten by plants, the melt-drip as compass. Conceptual integrity holds; no retreat to cosy collapse fantasy—danger remains ambient.</comment>
