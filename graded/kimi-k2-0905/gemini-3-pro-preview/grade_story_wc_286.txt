<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Silas’s interiority is rich—his belief that the vessel “already existed” and his tactile reverence for clay make his later gentleness believable. The micro-choice to soften pressure on the clay while the thrum rises is a bodily, contradictory beat that earns the arc. No second character on-page, so relationship/status bullets skipped; the renunciation of “fixing” the wasteland is credible because the prior encounter with the keeper-through-glass foreshadows communion over intervention. Cost is present but quiet—he leaves the pot untended, accepting its fragility—yet the emotional price could be sharpened in one line to reach 8.8+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the pot stands “perfectly symmetrical” while the vision fades, re-weighting the premise—devotion, not repair. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern of light-carved clay + rising thrum intensifies texture until the final crystallizing image. Causality is intact: lantern-glass vision → gentler touch → groove carved → keeper eye-contact → acceptance. Cost is felt in the dying light and the relinquished pot, though the sentence is oblique; a hair more visceral acknowledgment would clinch 9.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The skeletal hives, red clay, and slat-roof sun-beams are continuously woven into action—clay rises as light shifts; glass reframes memory. The bee-yard’s “memory of sweetness” is a sensory ghost that guides Silas’s gentleness, satisfying the 9+ gate: setting constrains the final choice not to force the vessel. Spatial choreography is clean; wheel, bench, and glass stay tracked. One microscopic slip—“scorched wasteland” is repeated verbatim; a fresher descriptor would nail 9.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</question><comment>Dominant stake—understanding temporal resistance—tightens when the thrum translates into bodily pressure and the groove links timelines. The deepening is the keeper’s returned gaze; it crystallizes that compassion, not force, sustains the oasis, foreclosing any “fix-it” path. Under Accumulative lens, density shift is sufficient, but the price is more conceptual than visceral, keeping it below 8.5. Agency is present—carving the groove is an irreversible act of communion.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: devotion as a form of temporal stewardship. The pot becomes a quiet answer to the opening question—some places resist change because they are loved into stasis. No moralizing; final image of the raw vessel drying reweights “sharp gentleness” without naming it. Ambiguity lingers: we don’t know if the pot will survive night chill—perfect thematic echo.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</question><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Silas’s perceptions—light angles, clay wetness, vibration up the spine. Diction is potter-specific yet never glossary-heavy: “centered,” “kick-wheel,” “thinning to perilous elegance.” Rhythm mirrors wheel spin—long sentences for rotation, fragments for thrum pulses. No dialogue, so voice purity remains intact. One register wobble: “conceptual attribute” feels slightly academic amid earthy vocabulary; still, the perceptual signature is vivid and consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</question><comment>Prose is dense yet breathable: “the scorched earth to exhale its accumulated misery” loads metaphor without stall. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances texture or knowledge. Figurative control holds under pressure—mixed metaphor check passes. Read-aloud cadence is varied; paragraph cuts are crisp. A single simultaneity hiccup: “he lifted his hands...allowing the momentum to die” implies overlap that jars slightly, keeping it from 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</question><comment>Fresh synthesis: bee-yard as time-wound bound by apiarian kindness, clay vessel as suture. Concept feels inevitable yet unheard. Risk—quiet lyric ending without fix-it triumph—paid off. Timelines-as-mica metaphor is specific to this voice. No derivative premise drag; transformation is complete.</comment>
