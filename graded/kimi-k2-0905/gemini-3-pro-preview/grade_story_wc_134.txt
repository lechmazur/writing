<comment>Elara’s interiority—"the seer sat frozen, blindsided"—embodies her flaw and fuels the beat where she breaks the shadow bridge; the moment she “really sees” Kael for the first time crystallizes earned change with cost. Contradictory impulses (foreknowledge vs. present-blindness) operate simultaneously in scene, not summary. Minor slip: “vessel of breath and blood” drifts toward diagnostic abstraction; still, micro-choice hierarchy is legible and charged.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the pearl’s mundane-wonder broadcast reweights Elara’s perception of prophecy itself, cost signaled by her explicit renunciation of future-fixation. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of bioluminescent detail and cadence shift in the pearl’s song tighten the stake once. Orientation anchored by word 60; no因果 breaks. One hairline scaffold: “For the first time in her life” is template cadence, but it lands outside the closure beat.</comment>

<comment>The musical crystal cave is not backdrop; its “sharp, high-contrast silhouettes” literally enable the shadow-bridge mechanics that admit the entity, so environment constrains tactics and charges the final image. Sensory hierarchy skews visual, but the sonic motif (“symphonic resonance,” “melodic humming”) is POV-filtered and tied to agency. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly across the hand-off moment; no white-room syndrome.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—Elara’s need to control the future vs. the present’s chaotic wonder—tightens once when the pearl’s vortex forecloses her predictive mode; the cost is the loss of her clairvoyant distance, legible on-page. Escalation is textural: the steadily unpredictable magic accumulates density until the cadence of “morning dew… baking bread… held hand” breaks her paradigm. No false reversals; coincidence complicates but does not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: the insignificance of macro prophecy beside micro miracles. The pearl’s final glow is the non-literal answer, reweighting “mundane joy” as the true metaphysics. No moralizing; ambiguity remains—Elara’s future sight is gone yet she is smiling. The insight is earned through the specific sensory barrage, not platitude.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-limited clings to Elara’s perceptual signature—“bright darkness,” “geological memory”—with consistent lexicon and rhythmic variance that breathes at the reveal. No head-hop; Kael’s interior is inferred only through Elara’s filtered gaze. One minor cadence hiccup: “she remained a clairvoyant who didn’t see it coming” repeats the prompt clause verbatim, but the voice-context justifies the self-ironic beat.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>High information density: “bioluminescent pulse,” “geological memory,” and “shadow bridge” each carry causal load. No paraphrase loops; metaphors stay coherent (“swirling vortex of impossible depth” matches pearl imagery). Rhythm accelerates into the dew-bread-hand triad, then exhales with the satisfied hum—syntax mirrors epistemic collapse. Copy-clean; pronouns unambiguous.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The “clairvoyant blindsided by the mundane” angle freshens prophecy tropes; the shadow-bridge as portal to everyday wonder is non-obvious and specific. Risk-taking—lyric list of banal miracles—pays off by reconfiguring the magic system into dew and bread rather than fate and kingdoms. No derivative echo; the synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
