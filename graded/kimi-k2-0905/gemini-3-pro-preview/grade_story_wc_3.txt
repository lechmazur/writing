<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Elian’s “linguistic physics” worldview is vividly lived-in; every tactile beat—sand-brushing fingers, trowel rhythm, soil press—externalizes his translator’s patience. The internal contradiction (grief versus intellectual curiosity) is active in each micro-choice, never summarized. A visible cost is paid: the seed burial forecloses the fantasy of retrieving Aris intact, turning obsession into stewardship. Missing 9-band only because Aris’s prior motives are told not dramatized, slightly blunting the relational crucible.</comment>

<comment>Closure image—“a pulse that mimicked the rhythm of a human heart”—delivers a Conceptual Repricing: the arbor is now the text, Aris the re-inscribed cuneiform. Causal chain holds: decaying orbit → seed implant → magnetic syntax restored. No orientation debt; orbit stakes are legible by line 8. One meaningful tightening: gravity lurch forces the burial choice at peak risk. Cost is unmistakable: Elian will orbit forever with a ghost he can “brush against” but never touch.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The arbor itself functions as micro-setting: magnetic roots, iron-willows, console dials are not backdrop but circuitry Elian must re-grammar. Temperature drop, ozone scent, metallic dust tactilely braid grief with engineering stakes. Spatial choreography is clean: cross-legged → pedestal → soil bed; no impossible props. Cloud-deck altitude subtly governs the ticking-death clock. Missing 9 only because orbital decay physics is poetic, not precise enough to constrain a later tactic.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—station fall = eternal erasure of Aris’s mind—signaled in paragraph 1. Escalation is accumulative: silence → drift → lurch → sprout; each beat intensifies the cost of failure. Agency is present: Elian’s analogical burial is an irreversible tactical gamble. Price is visible: he trades partner-resurrection for arbor-immortality, accepting lifelong “touching distance.” Could reach 9 if orbit decay had sharper ticking metrics altering mid-scene tactics.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: translation as survival—clay tablet breaks, meaning migrates. Subtext lives in gesture: pressing soil is both funeral and reboot. Final reweighting: haunted ambition becomes shared, sustainable presence. No moralizing; resonance is imagistic. “Physics of transition” stays conceptual, not preachy. Quiet ending qualifies as Charged Poise with undeniable cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Voice is a physicist-poet fused: “syntax that was rapidly losing its syntax” compresses linguistics and orbital mechanics. Perceptual signature is consistent—every noticed detail is filtered through cuneiform metaphor. Rhythm modulates: long Latinate clauses calm, then staccato verbs under lurch. No head-hop; interior access stays strictly Elian-bound. Non-standard punctuation avoided; grammar clean, so no artifact penalty.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>High information density: single sentence delivers silence, timeframe, spiritual tradition, and station altitude. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances either orbit danger or grief texture. Metaphors stay internally coherent—magnetic grammar, verb agreement—never mixed. Final third is free of purple or scaffold. Minor −0.3: “weeping iron-willows” and “recycled atmosphere” lean ornamental; still, they support tone without obscuring causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Premise—orbital tree nursery for souls rendered as syntactical repair—feels inevitable yet unseen. Risk (lyric circuitry) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Cuneiform-as-operating-system transforms familiar grief-story into fresh conceptual terrain. Detail is unrepeatable: magnetic soil bed, Knowledge fruit seed, iron-willow data-veins. Transformation test passed: swap translator identity and whole metaphoric engine collapses.</comment>
