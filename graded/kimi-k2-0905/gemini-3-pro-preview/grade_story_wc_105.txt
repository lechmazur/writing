<comment>Elara’s obsession with “the sound of trust breaking” is dramatized through every micro-choice: the drone dives for black-box silences, the timed imprint during mitosis, the final exhausted lean-back. Synesthetic color-hearing is not a label but a lived filter that guides her selective attention under the aurora. The closing image of her having “captured the ghost” is a credible renunciation of innocence; cost is felt. Interior contradiction is present yet compressed—she clings to empirical precision while harvesting despair—earning the high band.</comment>

<comment>Causal lens: every beat is a because/therefore linkage—cells divide ⇒ imprint must occur now ⇒ Forge releases silence ⇒ pathways twist. Closure (Conceptual Repricing) lands on-page: the device now carriers “the memory of treason,” a social/ethical cost legible in the final line. Persistent constraint (biological window) shapes tactics throughout. No orientation debt; anchors clear by line 3. High-band quick test met with visible cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Setting is not backdrop but instrument: greenhouse oxygen limits work-time, oceanic pressure demands drone pilots, auroral light literally sings to her synesthesia. “Bruised lung” metaphor for the Forge collapses archive-dust + bio-tissue into an object that swallows light—charging the final image. Shipwreck ring externalizes the stakes of betrayal. Micro-setting (containment dish) constrains the last possible moment of intervention. 9+ gate met.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—capture betrayal’s sonic ghost—tightens via irreversible biological countdown; every sentence counts seconds of mitotic window. Escalation is causal: each drone silence narrows the emotional field until only the void remains. Protagonist agency drives each turn; failure = cellular rejection. Cost is visible: cellular shudder under “invisible shockwave of despair.” Sufficient for high band; no coincidence resolution.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from pattern of curated absences: silence as palpable residue of collapsed trust. No explicit thesis; meaning accrues through image of aurora singing minor keys over an archive-dust lung. Final reconfiguration—trust breaking is felt vibration, not sound—reweights prior motifs without moralizing. Invites counter-reading: is she weaponizing trauma? Ambiguity lingers cleanly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is synesthetic, compressed, marine-biomechanic: “spectral light…sang to her in minor keys.” Rhythm accelerates during imprint—short clauses mimic pulsing cells. No head-hopping; distance stable. Filter verbs are voice-motivated (“she saw the cells shudder”) not scaffolding. Diction stays within designer-inventor lexicon. Distinct perceptual signature under pressure with closure payoff.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>High information density: one sentence arcs greenhouse/desperation/aurora. Figurative language is patterned and paid off—“bruised lung” returns as light-swallowing organ of memory. No loops or synonym churn; each metaphor extends prior vehicle. Minor register spike (“Conceptual Repricing” etc.) is evaluator’s, not text. Closure image remains clear, no artifact touch.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses synesthetic bio-engineer, drowned shipwreck ring, and silence-mining into a non-obvious whole. Risk of over-gothic excess is averted by procedural precision—mitosis clock, drone extractions, archive-dust forge. “Collecting absences” reverses normal data-logic, creating fresh narrative physics. Transformation test: swap any element and the emotional calculus collapses. Bold, specific, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
