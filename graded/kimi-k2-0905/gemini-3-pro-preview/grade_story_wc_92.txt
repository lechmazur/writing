<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is concrete and contradictory—her calm inventiveness under blackout panic is shown via micro-choices (turning inward, sliding the quill, feeling the thrum) rather than labels. The bronze quill’s weight and the kinetic current’s “clean variance” externalize her private calculus; her smile at the end crystallizes a Charged Poise with undeniable cost. One hairline slip: “demeanor was not one of panic” drifts toward diagnostic label, but the embodied beats that follow instantly re-anchor. Overall, her traits, knowledge limits, and moral ambiguity integrate flawlessly into the closure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: blackout → therefore Elara acts; quill → therefore Cradle awakens; looping feeds → therefore fort is liberated. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the fort’s power source is permanently rerouted, felt in the “frequency change.” Orientation is anchored within 50 words; no lens ambiguity. Cost is legible in the final “winking hush” and her secret smile—she alone bears the sabotage risk. One micro-turn at the sundial tightens options decisively.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The fort’s twilight scorch, photoreactive paint, and gnomon grooves are not backdrop but tactical terrain: the blackout lets the dial reveal its UV map, the garden’s silence masks the thrum, the gnomon’s extension unlocks the cradle. Sensory hierarchy obeys Elara’s sentinel bias—she clocks angles, not colors. The bronze quill itself functions as micro-setting that constrains the final move. Only reason not 9+: the broader city grid geography is implied, not tactically detailed on page.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—sever the fort from the authoritarian grid—signals in line 3 and escalates through one decisive tightening: the gnomon rotation that births the Cradle current. Agency is continuous; every beat either smuggles the quill or decodes the dial. Cost is conceptually paid: perpetual risk of discovery and the fort’s irreversible re-frequency. No false coincidence; blackout complicates, her skill resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the shift in source of light: oppressive arc-lamps → living tidal current; “fire” is repriced from surveillance to lantern of secrets. No moralizing—meaning is encoded in the final image of looping static and her knowing smile. The photoreactive paint and kinetic energy myth reconfigure the reader’s sense of what counts as power. Ambiguity lingers: is liberation worth perpetual clandestine risk? Answer left vibrating.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Third-person intimate stays locked to Elara; perceptual signature is cold bronze, UV angles, ciphered thrum—never generic. Syntax tightens under pressure: “liquid grace of a dancer stepping onto a darkened stage” gives way to staccato “soft, metallic sigh.” No head-hopping; technicians remain opaque silhouettes. Register remains within a sentinel’s plausible lexicon; no corporate drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or causality. Figurative language is sparse, precise: “sheets of oppressive gold” marries visual and political weight. No filter verbs; perception is direct. Opening and closing lines act as volta—external blaze → internal lantern—without overwriting. One split-second tense stability in “had waited” is grammarily clean and motivated.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The kinetic-tidal Cradle and UV-coded sundial feel fresh yet inevitable; mythology grows from tactile engineering rather than exposition. Blackout-as-opportunity subverts typical sabotage tropes by making the heroine a maintenance ghost. Risk taken: archaic tech triumphs over surveillance state—coheres without gimmick. Slight deduction for familiar “regime crushes spirits” backdrop; fort specifics offset but don’t fully transform the trope.</comment>
