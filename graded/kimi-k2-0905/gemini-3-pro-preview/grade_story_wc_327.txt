<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Sylas is distinct in body and vocation, his copper-veined biology and storyteller function give immediate specificity, and his interiority (“a dry, silent rattle”) is concrete. Motivation is stable but hinges on a single abstract desire; we never glimpse competing impulses or private doubt, so the final smile feels foregone. Voice-loss is a visible cost, yet it’s external curse rather than flawed choice, so the renunciation is less “earned” than inflicted.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>The causal chain is tight: fracture alignment → bird-pattern read → vocal transduction → curse exacts voice. Orientation is complete by line 7; every beat advances the acoustic translation goal. Closure lands as Earned Stasis: silence accepted, tactile wind legacy secured, cost (voice gone) visible in final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Bone towers, femur spire, and diamond micro-fracture are tactile, operative, and directly enable the sonic climax. Sensory detail is filtered through Sylas’s resonance craft—copper glow, gritty hum—rather than catalogued. The setting literally dictates the only possible tactic (fracture-inverse mapping), meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—save the tactile from verbal extinction—is signaled early and tightened when the curse claims his voice, a visible price. Agency is continuous: each calibration, whisper, and vocal scrape narrows options toward irreversible silence. The escort starlings act as pressure conduit, not deus ex machina, satisfying lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Theme—sensory memory outlives language—emerges through the acoustic transmutation act, never stated. Subtext pulses in the rasping wind that now “remembers” bone texture. The closing smile reframes prior pain into triumph, a resonant reconfiguration without moralizing, though the concept is declared once (“translate texture into sound”) which blunts full transcendence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The third-person lyric voice is controlled, rhythmic, and sensorily precise: “grinding, resonant hum that felt like sandpaper dragging against the eardrum.” Syntax lengthens and compresses with sonic pressure; no head-hop or filter-verb clutter. Diction stays within the plausible lexicon of a resonance-tuned being; perceptual signature is unmistakable.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Sentences perform double duty—image + causality—without scaffold: “He vocalized the friction he saw in the glass.” Metaphors are consistent (sound = sandpaper = bone), never mixed. No loops, no filler; paragraph cuts are surgical. High information density yet mouth-friendly rhythm; final line lands with imagistic punch, no explanatory tag.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Acoustic-topography magic, copper-veined bards, and curse-as-tool feel freshly synthesized; familiar tropes (cursed gem, bird choreography) are re-wired through scientific acoustics. The “texture-into-sound” premise is pursued to literal endpoint, not metaphoric flourish, yielding conceptual integrity. Risk in taking birds as tunable lens is bold yet coherently taught and paid off, meriting the high-band bonus.</comment>
