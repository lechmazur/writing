<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s stubborn curiosity and refusal to abandon a “case” the bureaucracy labels untraceable give her immediate, textured agency; the embodied dread and wonder she feels while slotting the hearing-aid anchor the contact-tracer premise in credible micro-choices. Interior contradiction (protocol vs. empathy) plays out in real time, and her final collapsed slump against the fountain shows a visible cost that closes her arc. The child-spirit remains off-page, so relationship pressure is one-sided, preventing the top band; still, her flaw-driven persistence fits the 600-word scope.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: the photograph’s anomaly → hearing-aid conduit → child-signal detection → shield of recognition each trigger concrete next steps. Orientation is swift (who/where/when inside first 60 words). Closure lands as a Decisive Change: the bench photo gains a blurred child-figure, proving rescue and charging Elara with aftermath fatigue—felt cost on-page. A micro-turn (Arthur ≠ haunt but anchor) tightens stakes cleanly; no teleport props or soft resets.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mist-clad atrium is rendered through motion (swirling, coalescing, recoiling) that directly mirrors conflict beats; glass-ceiling location cues the decisive antenna-turn. The velvet box, fountain rim, and yellowed plastic hearing-aid provide micro-settings that constrain tactics. Sensory selection stays inside Elara’s tracer bias (ozone scent, static roar). The final image (blurred child on photo) reuses the visual motif with re-weighted meaning, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—salvage a child-spirit bureaucratic afterlife ignores—signals early and tightens when shadows lunge. Escalation proceeds because/therefore as each amplification (static roar, flutter in earpiece, shield of recognition) narrows options and raises visceral cost. Agency is continuous: Elara turns herself into an antenna, projects intent, spends stamina. Price is visible on-page: cold sweat, shaky hands, post-adrenal gasp; no reliance on coincidence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges inductively: empathy as civil disobedience against an impersonal spectral bureaucracy; no final sermon. Subtext carries in the hearing-aid feedback—technology meant to amplify life now amplifies fear—an irony never stated aloud. The empty bench → occupied blur image answers the implicit “who gets remembered?” question without moral tagline. Complexity lingers: Elara is heroic yet exhausted, change proved only by a photographic ghost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited clings to Elara’s perceptual filter; tracer jargon (“arterial lines of affection”) feels profession-specific. Syntax lengthens under tension, contracts in shock (“Static roared…”). No dialogue, so voice distinctness rests on diction and rhythm, both consistent. Free indirect thought (“She should have left too…”) blends cleanly with narrator idiom.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Lines carry double duty: “mist-clad atrium at twilight” fuses setting and tone; “jagged rhythm radiated” compresses concept and sensation. Metaphors stay coherent (ozone, hummingbird flutter) and peak-beat clarity remains intact. Minor scaffold—three sentences open with “She…” in close succession—barely audible. Read-aloud cadence escalates then hushes to match reeling hush payoff; zero mixed metaphors.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>“Contact tracer for hearts” plus vintage hearing-aid as ectoplasmic stethoscope feels fresh yet inevitable. Incidental heroism trope is upended: bureaucratic clerk, no spells, just stubborn pattern recognition. The bench-photo payoff grows from early emptiness whisper, avoiding late gimmick. Specific occupational detail grounds speculative frame without exposition dump. Synthesis trumps surface novelty; risk (quiet, child off-stage) pays off in final image.</comment>
