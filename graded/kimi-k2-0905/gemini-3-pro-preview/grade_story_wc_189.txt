<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses—grief over Kael’s departure and her scientific detachment—coexist in the same tactile beats (thumb on cicada, gaze on pool). The renunciation is earned: her letting-go is foreshadowed by the starfish detachment and paid for in the “fibrous” future she tastes. Only the “warmly observant” trait stays label-level; no bodily contradiction shows its cost. Still, the final smile carries visible price under starlight.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the tide-pool image re-weights the relationship with undeniable cost (“mornings…alone”). Accumulative lens holds: each micro-observation thickens until the silence ruptures. Orientation is clean by line 5; no teleporting props. The cicada’s warmth transferred from pocket to speech is the persistent constraint that shapes the final permission.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Grotto, tide pool, and jade cicada function as micro-settings that constrain choice: the starfish drift literally mirrors Kael’s exit Elara must accept. Limestone eye, Milky Way reflection, and seaweed tangle are filtered through her chronicler gaze, never touristic. Spatial choreography is flawless: thumb in pocket, eyes on water, voice finally released upward. The cave’s acoustic echo literally amplifies the final line, charging the closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—whether she will cling or release—tightens once via the incoming ripple that lets her “foresee” solitary years. No reversals needed under Accumulative lens; density of pool images escalates cost until the starfish detachment crystallizes stance. Price is legible: solitary catalogue mornings paid on-page. Could use one earlier micro-choice (closing notebook? turning away?) to push past 8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of necessary molting emerges from starfish, cicada, and tide itself—never sermonized. Final image reweights prior solitude as “sweet sustenance of memory,” a Conceptual Repricing that avoids moral. Subtext of mentorship-love lives in withheld eye-contact and transferred warmth of jade. Only minor drift: “texture of time” verges on thesis-statement mid-piece.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays inside Elara’s perceptual filter: every noticed detail is professional (mollusk, anemone, urchin) and emotionally charged. Syntax lengthens under pressure then snaps short at “Go where the current pulls you,” mirroring release. No head-hopping; Kael’s guilt is read through shoulder tension, not mind-read. Distinct marine diction (“fronds,” “ephemeral ecosystems”) roots voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies: long accumulative sentences build pool imagery, then single-line permission releases. No synonym loops; “tide brings new things…” is first plain sentence after rich texture, making it land. One mixed metaphor—“fractured eye to reveal…constellations”—barely grazes closure. Information density high: one sentence often does description, metaphor, and interior shift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Freshest synthesis: marine field-notes as emotional processing. Starfish detachment re-invents the familiar “let lover go” trope without cliché. Risk taken in quiet Accumulative structure pays off in final image. Could push further if cicada had one earlier causal beat (e.g., she almost hands it to him then withholds).</comment>
