<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elias’s interior contradiction—risking death to plant beauty—drives every micro-choice; the final bite’s cost is felt. The “taste memories” gift is shown, not told, and shapes pruning tactics. One flaw: the trait never complicates or backfires; he’s perfectly calibrated. Still, the arc from bitter to sweet is earned through embodied action.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: plant seed → synaptic pruning → edible wisdom, each beat tightening risk. Closure lands as Earned Stasis—he sits with the plate, path foreclosed, cost visible. Orientation is clean within 120 words; lens stays causal throughout. Only nit: the “laws like tough meat” line is early throat-clearing that slightly delays the inciting beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rusted greenhouse, composted books, twin-moonlight—details are selective, sensuous, and filter through a chef’s priorities. The greenhouse tools constrain every pruning cut; the cracked roof lets the violet beam charge the final image. Some spatial vagueness: exact layout of vine, crate, and door remains sketchy. Meets 9+ gate: the setting materially shapes tactics and final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“plant or perish”—is signaled early and escalates with each snip that risks killing the vine. The celestial alignment gives a live clock, narrowing options to the twin-moon window. One meaningful tightening occurs when the vine’s bitterness forces the decision to prune; options shrink to “poison fruit or lose everything.” Cost is legible: sap-blood on the floor and the solo vigil at the end.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme of cultivated forgiveness emerges organically from pruning trauma into taste; no sermonizing. The final line reweights the premise: beauty can be taught, but only after paying the sap-price. Ambiguity lingers—will anyone else ever eat it? Subtext in the love-letter compost quietly reframes “ruins” as personal, not just societal. Avoids tidy moral; resonance stays sensorial.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Voice is chef-specific: synaptic terroir, tasting iron in sap, stewing laws. Syntax tightens under pressure—“Snip. He cut away…”—mirroring pruning rhythm. No head-hopping; psychic distance stays tight. One near-slip: “minds and vines are the same” drifts toward aphorism, but cadence saves it.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, high-density; every sentence advances image or choice. Figurative control holds—no mixed metaphors in peak beats. Minor scaffold: “the plant was absorbing…” tells what the prior tasting already showed. Final image line is crisp and propulsive.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>“Memory-tasting chef who prunes synaptic fruit” is fresh synthesis, not checklist. The trope of forbidden knowledge is inverted: the danger is too much history, not power. Specificity of composted love letters and iron-tasting sap makes the concept lived-in. Risk is moderate; a bolder move would have let the fruit fail or betray him.</comment>
