<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elian’s tactile echolocation practice, coral-trauma memory, and stubborn cartographic quest fuse into a coherent, idiosyncratic mind; the final stunned recognition that the road has been metabolized into reef feels inevitable because his obsessive attention to vanished paths was dramatized from the first beat. Interior contradiction is alive in every micro-choice—he both mourns and feeds the ocean he blames—and the cost of this discovery (his last map rendered obsolete) lands with visible heart-sting. Only the brief “periodically eternal” expository label keeps this from the 9-band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The causal chain is clean: because he refuses to accept the sensor void, therefore he manually assembles sonic data, therefore he confronts the reef that ate his childhood road—closure delivered as Conceptual Repricing with undeniable ecological cost. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are secure by line 4; the drive lens (Causal) holds without wobble. The reef-as-road reveal is both Decisive Change and felt price: his grandfather’s map is now a relic, his own life's mission inverted.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Compressed, tactile detail—“solitary metallic buoy,” “cold steel of the lower bulkhead,” “silt layers that confused the automated systems”—anchors reader inside a functioning oceanic instrument. The station’s swaying chains, drowned sky, and calcium-rich concrete are not backdrop but catalyst: they supply the exact substrate the super-coral hijacks, turning setting into antagonist. Final holo-image of the road-become-reef recharges every earlier sensory scrape; micro-setting (hologram projector, torn atlas) charges the closing reversal.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—why some paths vanish—tightens from mystery to ontological threat when the missing road is revealed as living fortress. One meaningful escalation: flat sensor void → impossible mountain range of coral, forcing Elian to recalibrate his entire archival quest. Cost is palpable: the map he caresses is now a fossil; his life’s work has literally been overwritten by the organisms he mourns. Agency resides in his decision to keep staring at the resurrected reef rather than look away.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges without pronouncement: human cartography vs. biological re-writing; grief for extinct beauty colliding with the unsettling vigor of adaptation. “Periodically eternal” shifts from abstract archive phrase to lived paradox in the final hologram, reweighting the premise. No moralizing—just the image of asphalt transformed into vibrant skeleton—invites reader to sit with complicity and awe. Subtextual tension between memory and metabolism lingers past the last line.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays welded to Elian’s sensory filter; diction (“drifting moored,” “syncopated code”) carries maritime rhythm without purple drift. Perceptual signature—sound as shape,地图 as wound—remains consistent; no head-hop or filter-verb fog. Compression (“He pulled away...moved to his workstation”) keeps psychic distance tight while maintaining read-aloud cadence. Voice modulates under pressure: shorter, percussive clauses as the hologram builds, mirroring his tapped echolocation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally; sentences open with noun, prepositional phrase, verb to avoid drumbeat. Figurative language is spare, selective—“rogue wave” of realization—never cluttering the high-pressure beat. Zero scaffold/loop; each sentence advances knowledge or image. Information density high: “torn atlas page bisecting a coastline that no longer existed physically” performs exposition, stakes, and nostalgia in one stroke.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fusing coral bleaching witness, manual echolocation, and post-ban seabed into a mutated reef devouring asphalt feels utterly specific and non-templated. The反转 that disappearance equals overgrowth grows organically from Elian’s method and memory; no late rule change. Risky conceptual payoff—civilization’s ruin digested into new life—lands with ecological and emotional cost. Holographic resurrection of the road-as-reef is an image unlikely to fade from reader memory.</comment>
