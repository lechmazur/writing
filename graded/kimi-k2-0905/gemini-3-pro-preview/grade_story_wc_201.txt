<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interiority is visceral and embodied; the proprioceptive curse is shown through micro-choices (clawing at the mask, knee buckling) rather than labels. The final crystallization of “component of the forest” is earned by prior somatic memory beats. Flaw: the mathematics-of-mercy drive is stated more than dramatized, so motivation feels slightly abstract until the final image.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the mask removal + ultraviolet overload reweights mercy from absence to symmetrical distribution, cost legible in seared lungs and expanded skeleton-forest map. Lens stays Accumulative/Textural—each trauma-flinch tightens the texture until the singularity. No orientation debt; who-where-when is anchored by word 30. Only hairline slip: “mathematics of mercy” is named early but not tested in middle beats.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Ultraviolet forest is not backdrop; its violet intensity literally strips skin and psyche, constraining the final choice to stand still. Body-as-setting functions likewise—floating ribs, axis rotation—charging the closing image. Micro-setting (pewter strap) bends under grip, soft-metal property paying off when Kaelen distorts it to remove the mask. Sensory hierarchy skews UV and proprioception, exactly what a torture-upgraded nervous system would prioritize.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake: solve mercy before nerves ignite. Escalation is density-of-pain rather than external reversals—each trauma-flinch raises the load until the singularity forces the stance crystallization. Agency is endurance/renunciation: keeping the mask off. Cost is immediate (lung-sear) and persistent (he becomes forest component). Could use one earlier micro-choice that actively tests the equation rather than awaiting the final crucible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete inversion: mercy = perfect distribution of pain, not its absence. No moralizing—wisdom is delivered via final image of skeletal-root overlay. Subtext operates through gesture: removing forbidden mask = accepting the calculus. Ambiguity remains—reader must decide if symmetry is transcendence or extinction. Slight deduction for “mathematics of mercy” echoing prompt language a touch openly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is relentless, synesthetic, compressed—exactly a hyper-wired torture survivor. “Air tasting of ozone and burnt sugar,” “leaves shimmering in frequencies that made his teeth ache” are POV-specific, not decorative. Rhythm accelerates into the singularity, then fractures into short clauses mimicking nerve fire. Pewter strap’s soft-metal symbolism is discovered, not declared. No head-hop; interiority stays strictly bounded to what enhanced nerves could know.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Information-dense yet musical: “the flora did not photosynthesize sunlight but absorbed the silent, screaming radiation” packs world-rule + horror in one stroke. No filter-verb stacks or paraphrase loops; each sentence advances map, body, or concept. Metaphors stay physically coherent within UV logic. Final paragraph modulates cadence—single long sentence of symmetrical pain distribution, then clipped stillness. Minor over-crank in opening (“jagged clarity that came only after…” is the only near-cliché).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fusion of torture-survivor body-map with alien UV forest feels inevitable yet unseen before. Proprioceptive enhancement as curse rather than super-power, and mercy as load-bearing equation, are fresh inflections. Risk: abstract concept could have tipped into gimmick, but grounding via nerve-fire and soft pewter keeps it visceral. If the mathematics had been tested in one earlier beat, originality would hit ceiling.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Setup: immediate. Development: every flinch dictates foot placement. Closure: survival equation solved by enduring overload. Cost: lungs & identity fused to forest. Irreplaceable—no other background yields identical map.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Early handled when clawed; soft-metal property exploited for removal; final image reweights it from restraint to instrument of revelation. Story fails without this specific material choice.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.7</question><comment>Shapes stakes: UV exposure is the punishment/trial. Tactics: must walk into brightest sector. Concept reweights at closure—penance becomes integration. Forest hunger is literalized through radiation.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>8.9</question><comment>Constrains every move—axis rotation, rib-distance, flinch-guidance. Enables final singularity expansion. Cost: constant agony. Label avoided; shown via bodily micro-choices throughout.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</question><comment>Phantom brace against non-existent batons recurs, dictates stance in singularity. Traces to final stillness—accepting the load. Story arc collapses without this embodied reflex.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Method signaled in second paragraph; mechanics drive every step. “Shins ache before drop-off” is explicit. Final stillness is ultimate trauma response repurposed as calculus solution.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.5</question><comment>UV intensity literally scorches lungs; root-snares hidden in glowing ferns change gait. Forest hunger felt via expanded skeleton-map—setting becomes protagonist’s new skeleton. Cannot swap for normal woods.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.3</question><comment>Anesthesia receding is early anchor, but no live clock or narrowing timebound decision. Time feels durational rather than urgent; hence mid-band despite setup.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</question><comment>Desire stated early; tested in final crucible where he endures symmetrical pain to “solve” mercy. Friction: could use one mid-forest trial of the equation to deepen dramatization.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>“Displaced rooted” perfectly captures proprioceptive paradox—hyper-present yet alien. Tone modulates from numb disorientation to crystalline acceptance, mirroring UV intensity climb. Final image charges the phrase with new meaning: rooted into forest skeleton. Removing the tone collapses thematic arc.</comment>
