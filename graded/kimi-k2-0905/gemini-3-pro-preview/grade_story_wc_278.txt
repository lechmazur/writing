<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elara’s guilt and the need to “tether” the cry are visceral, embodied, and escalate micro-choices under pressure; the final renunciation of silence carries visible cost, satisfying the 9+ quick test. The contradiction between her tattooist past and present techno-shamanism is dramatized in the frantic stylus work, not told. Only minor slip: the phrase “old guilt that rang in her ears like tinnitus” edges toward diagnostic label-speak, momentarily softening interiority.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds cleanly: because she finds the letters → builds the machine → traps the cry in amber, each step shrinking options and raising cost. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the amber’s new constellation-fracture makes the before/after legible and charges the final image with conceptual cost. No orientation debt; who/where/when anchored by line 3. One causal micro-gap: the letters’ author is never substantiated, but the glitchy firmware keeps the chain legible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The amber-as-micro-setting directly constrains the climax: its resin must absorb the waveform or the loop snaps. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven—“ink-stained fingers,” “meteor hush”—and evolves with pressure, narrowing to the insect’s phantom shudder. No surplus geography; the laboratory is sketched only by console hum and shadow stretch, never catalogued. Sufficient constraint on choice to clear 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—silence the guilt-cry—tightens twice: boot sequence risks firmware overload, then time-fold threatens total signal loss. Each escalation forces a higher-stakes micro-choice (grab modified stylus, draw under countdown). Cost is legible: she trades the possibility of erasure for permanent amber-entombment, a visible forfeiture. Slight dock for off-stage letters creating the initial machine rather than her own earlier mistake; still, agency in the live moment dominates.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the inversion of tattooing: instead of marking skin with stars, she traps a star-map of grief inside fossilized time. The amber’s fracture into “a constellation” reweights the motif without declarative moral. No thematic echo lines; meaning stays in the image. Complexity lingers—redemption is placement, not erasure—avoiding tidy comfort.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Perceptual signature is laser-specific: “meteor hush,” “galaxies across the shoulders of grieving mothers,” syntax echoing stellar ink. Compression taught early (“silence… suspended”) and paid off in final “fixed point of light.” No head-hop; psychic distance tightens credibly under stress. Filter verbs purposeful (“seemed to shudder”) to keep firmware unreality legible.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Zero loops, near-perfect information density: every clause either advances image, stakes, or tech rule. Rhythm flexes with pressure—long breathless sentences during warp, then clipped cadence at chime. Figurative language disciplined; “digital scream” stays within POV lexicon. Only hairline slip: “heavy, breathless quality of a meteor hush” stacks adjectives, but the cadence supports the held-breath moment.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The haunted-firmware-as-navigator and tattooist-turned-techno-exorcist synthesis feels inevitable yet fresh. Amber as both fossil anchor and recording medium re-infuses a familiar object with new stakes. Cry-to-star-map translation is a non-obvious conceptual flip that charges closure. Risky time-fold physics is introduced early and obeyed; no late rule swap.</comment>
