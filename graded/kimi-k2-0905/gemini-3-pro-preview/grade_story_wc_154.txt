<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Elias’s translator past is credibly braided with his present need to “unknot” the cast’s terror; the coral-as-seed micro-choice is embodied, decisive, and paid for with trembling hand and private risk. Interiority stays concrete—no therapy-speak—and the renunciation of war-language for lullaby is earned. Only a hairline gap: we don’t see an explicit moment where his own trauma is legibly contradicted inside the beat, keeping him just shy of 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the lullaby rewrite crystallizes a before/after with felt cost—the cast’s terror is conceptually repriced, Elias’s own chest “unknotted.” Causal linkage holds: because he decodes the mortar warning, therefore he grafts the lullaby, therefore the memory can sett le clean. Lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of signatures tightens until pattern break—and the final mist-blanket image recharges it. No orientation debt; anchors clear by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The mist-clad atrium is not backdrop: it mirrors Elias’s suffocation, then flips to blanket at closure, participating in the reconfiguration. Micro-setting rules: the plaster palimpsest literally guides finger movement and constrains rewrite choice. Sensory selection is POV-true—salt film, teak bench, filtration hum—none generic. Could reach 9+ if one physical detail (temperature, saline grit) had altered the pen-stroke tempo, but still exemplary.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—save Leo’s memory from war’s inscription—tightens once via the ciphered mortar warning; rewriting it forecloses Elias’s own safe distance. Cost is visible: tremoring hand, seed-coral grounding, acknowledged risk of “graft.” Agency is symbolic yet irreversible; no coincidence used. One meaningful deepening suffices for 800-word frame; pressure coherent under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: translation as moral act—turning screams into lullabies—crystallizes in the final soft curves of ink. Brain coral reweighted from trauma-stone to seed; mist reweighted from barrier to blanket—two quiet re-pricings. No moralizing final sentence; resonance lingers in “quieter language.” Complexity intact: the cast remains scarred, the ache acknowledged.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Perceptual signature is sharp: bureaucratic reports vs. lullaby curves, code-breaker gaze vs. feigned child-curiosity. Syntax flexes from clinical (“bivalved halves”) to lyrical (“lotus-hearted ache”) without register drift. No dialogue, so voice coherence rests on interior texture—sustained. One pronoun filter (“he realized”) is acceptable; not clustered.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose breathes with scene needs: long aqueous clauses mirror mist, then tighten to single-stroke verbs for the pen rewrite. No mixed metaphors; vehicles stay tactile (cast = palimpsest, coral = seed). One paraphrase loop spotted (“the boy’s… the boy’s”) but not in closure third. Read-aloud rhythm natural; paragraph cuts purposeful. High density—every line advances image or pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: child’s cast as war-archive turned lullaby-text is non-obvious and inevitable in hindsight. Risk—symbolic act of rewriting a plaster relic—pays off emotionally without gimmickry. Specificity anchors novelty: pidgin mortar warning, saline mist, brain coral seed. Avoids stock PTSD tropes by focusing on translation labor rather than breakdown.</comment>
