<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara’s quietly deliberate persona is embodied through precise micro-choices (kneeling, aligning tumblers, adjusting the governor valve) and her fear of the machine tearing itself apart momentarily threatens her composure—yet these flashes feel external, not internal contradiction. The interiority stays concrete, avoiding label-speak, but lacks a second, clashing impulse that would push her to a visible cost or renunciation; the ending’s knowledge-loss functions as an external reset rather than a character-driven sacrifice. Motivation remains clear and escalates with the stakes of rewriting the sky, yet the absence of a palpable trade-off on her person caps the arc below 8.8.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: “the shadows… were simply crushed by the weight of the light” reweights the premise and carries felt cost in the image of terrified darkness pooling beneath her boots. The causal lens holds: each gear-connection and loop-closing narrows options toward the brutal revelation. Orientation is anchored by ~120 words inside the observatory with Elara’s action cueing “who/where/when.” Only waver is the memory-washing isle rule introduced late; because it pays off by erasing her triumph, no cap applies.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Environment and tool constrain choices throughout: the nocturnal observatory’s silver circuitry in the floor dictates her sequence, the mosaic tiles hide the dormant heart, the brass key’s spiral teeth limit how it can be turned. Ozone-steam smell and violet sparks narrow perception to the immediate machinery under pressure. The final image—shadows clawing at the stone—reciprocally charges the setting rather than functioning as décor. The floating-isle rule is mentioned early enough to avoid orientation debt and later re-enters as cost, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—locate shadows at noon—signaled in paragraph 3 and escalates as each circuit-closure risks the automaton tearing itself apart, a visible price on the page. Protagonist agency drives every beat: she chooses the sequence, turns the key, adjusts the governor. The tightening occurs when the artificial sun hits zenith and forecloses the option of ever finding shadows elsewhere; instead they are crushed beneath her, narrowing possibility to horrific fact. Cost is legible under causal lens, though only one decisive intensification fits the short length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</question><comment>Theme emerges from the concrete conceit of manufactured noon crushing darkness rather than from authorial assertion. The final image reconfigures the central question—shadows don’t “go” anywhere, they are pulverized—inviting reflection on knowledge gained at the price of erasure. No tidy moral is offered; the memory-wipe device supplies an unsettling ambiguity that lingers. Subtext operates in gesture (quietly deliberate pace against terrified shadow-pool) without thematic echo lines.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</question><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elara’s perceptual signature: “hands stained with ink and stardust,” spiral key teeth that “hurt the eyes to follow.” Syntax lengthens and compresses with machine tension; short ratcheting clauses mimic gear clicks. No dialogue appears, so no voice convergence issue. Internal register remains consistent with a scholar who thinks in “conduits” and “logic gates,” never drifting into academic exposition.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</question><comment>Prose is lean, high-density, and largely free of loops; each sentence advances machinery, stakes, or sensory charge. Occasional lyrical uplift (“smelled of ozone and old copper”) is spaced, not stacked, preserving clarity. Mixed-metaphor risk in “silence so profound it felt like a physical weight” is earned by later payoff when light literally crushes shadows. Final line’s cadence shift—“the knowledge would fade by morning”—delivers resonant exhale without scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</question><comment>Premise fuses spoon-bent reality, floating isle, and lost noon into a fresh causal engine; shadow-crushing artificial sun feels inevitable only after revelation. Rune scholar activating a memory-wiping observatory is particular enough to resist generic swap. The memory-loss twist grows from established world rule rather than late gimmick. Specific detail (spiral-key teeth, violet spark jumping loop) grounds the invention in tactile risk.</comment>
