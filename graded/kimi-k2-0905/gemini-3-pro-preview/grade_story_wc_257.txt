<comment>Elias’s quiet, resurrective obsession drives every beat; the woman’s grief is shown through ash-clutching posture and the vacuum-gasp release, not labels. Interior contradiction burns low but steady—he courts death to rekindle life—yet we never see him question the ethics, so the flaw feels curated rather than costly. The micro-choice to trap purple ink beneath a manufactured diamond crystallizes his hierarchy of values: artifice > oblivion. Closure linkage is strong because the same gesture projects her un-tattooed lilies onto her skin, externalizing intent at visible price.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the hologram lily-ghost hovering over her heart reweights both their stances with undeniable conceptual cost—love is now light, loss is now lens. Causal lattice holds: because he folds a coordinate raven → she ascends → because he compresses ash → she can breathe again; each step forecloses retreat. The ending image is not explained away; it lingers in charged stillness, satisfying the “no tidy moral” clause. One hairline slip: orientation anchors (who/when for Elias’s back-story) arrive ~140 words, just past waiver zone, but the disorientation is mild and later repaid by closure, so −0.1 only.</comment>

<comment>The observatory’s golden twilight and static star-charts act as both metaphor and physical constraint—timeless altitude isolates, enabling his alchemical apostolate. Brass press, loupe, charcoal stains supply tactile micro-setting that literally compresses grief into gem; environment shapes the final projection surface (her skin-as-sky). Spatial choreography stays clean: raven spirals down, woman climbs up, ash enters press, light exits prism. Ozone scent and updraft are selective, never tourist-catalog, and echo the electrical charge of resurrection.</comment>

<question>8.8</question>
<comment>Dominant stake—can ephemeral intent be saved from oblivion?—is signaled in paragraph one and tightened when the stencil is placed under the diamond, locking intent into unbreakable carbon. Escalation is causally driven: each machine throb raises the cost of failure (ruin the ashes → erase the last trace). The hologram bloom is not mere beauty; it is the only remaining live option, foreclosing her old stasis of paralysis. Price is visible on-page—she gasps “air rushing back into a vacuum,” a felt physiological cost.</comment>

<question>9.2</question>
<comment>Theme emerges entirely through image: lilies meant for skin become light on skin—artifice as mercy. Subtext whispers that resurrection is itself a form of gentrified grief, but the story refuses to moralize; it simply enacts the paradox. Final image reweights “genuinely artificial” from boast to benediction, achieving Conceptual Repricing without exposition. Ambiguity lingers: is he savior or voyeur?—the cost is legible either way.</comment>

<question>8.9</question>
<comment>Third-person registers Elias’s artisan precision: verbs like “stain,” “magnify,” “compress,” nouns like “embrasure,” “hectograph,” create a metallic, lapidary rhythm. Perceptual signature is selective—he sees ash as carbon lattice, city as gray sprawl—never touristy. No dialogue, so voice purity stays intact; internal diction keeps to his plausible lexicon. Compression in climax—“light caught the purple lines… projecting a holographic phantom”—accelerates without register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<question>8.8</question>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm is controlled: longer sentences for ascent/set-up, staccato for machine press, lyrical elongation for projection moment. No filter-verb stacks; verbs stay strong (“tucked,” “spiral,” “extracted”). Metaphor density peaks only at the hologram beat where it pays off, avoiding purple overload. One micro-loop spotted: “never darkened into night” / “never applied” — repetition of “never” construction, but serves thematic echo, so −0.1.</comment>

<question>9.1</question>
<comment>The “genuinely artificial diamond grown from biological chaos” is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis that fuses grief, tech, and jewelry craft into one image. Coordinates-inside-origami is a clever summoning mechanic never seen in standard grief-fiction templates. Risk is high—magic realism in a single scene—but compression & causality keep it from gimmick. Transformation test fails if you swap diamond for any generic gem; the artificial perfection concept is irreplaceable.</comment>
