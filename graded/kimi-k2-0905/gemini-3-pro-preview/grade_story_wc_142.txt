<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—salary from the enemy yet sabotaging it—stays live, but her emotional calibration is almost eerily perfect: no tremor, misremembering, or fatigue under extreme multi-task pressure. The embodied cost is displaced onto the city’s groaning pontoons rather than her body, so the renunciation feels conceptually rather than viscerally earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: every graffiti coordinate narrows options until the stone’s relocation forces a legal reframing, a clear Decisive Change with conceptual cost. The orientation anchors by word 30, so no penalty; only the mild emotional smoothing keeps this from the 9-band.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The carnival-flotilla is not backdrop but tool: drift, drag, winch-access and anchor-points dictate Elara’s graffiti syntax and final stone placement, charging the closure. Sensory triage—diesel, rust, lacquer—tracks her engineer’s gaze, keeping description tethered to tactical priorities.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—save the settlement—tightens once: each sprayed angle forecloses a navigational option until the stone’s move widens the legal perimeter. The cost is intellectual-displacement rather than corporeal, but still legible on the last line as the new landlords confront an unreadable map.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of re-coding space through folk knowledge emerges via the graffiti-as-blueprint device and the stone’s maritime rule-bend, never sermonized. The final image reframes the clown mural from festive décor to legal weapon, achieving Conceptual Repricing without explicit moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Third-person hovers close enough to capture Elara’s engineer-perception of torque and vector, yet keeps psychic distance modest; free-indirect bursts (“her mind worked…”) are clean. Syntax stays spare, metallic, matching the industrial-float milieu; no register drift or filter-verb clutter.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Rhythm flexes with task tempo—staccato spray-can clauses under midnight calliope blare—then widens for the final constellation image. No synonym loops or scaffold; only minor simultaneity slips (“She shook the can… began to spray…”) which barely dent clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Privatization resistance via maritime loophole and graffiti cartography feels fresh, not trope recycling; the city-ballet orchestrated by aerosol vectors is a specific, irreproducible set-piece. Risk—embedding legal stakes in a clown’s eyebrow—pays off when the grin reconfigures at closure.</comment>
