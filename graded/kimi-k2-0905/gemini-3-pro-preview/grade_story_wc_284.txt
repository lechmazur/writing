<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias’s shame-to-courage arc is cleanly signaled and embodied through the trembling hand, the pillbox’s weight, and the decision to stomp rather than swallow. Interiority stays concrete (“burned spy whose very existence had been disavowed”) without lapsing into label-speak. Micro-choice hierarchy is visible: message-in-snow > exposure risk > basket surrender. Cost is felt in the erased footprints and hovering helicopter refusal to land, though the moment of cowardice in Prague is summarized not dramatized, blunting contradiction under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Causal spine holds: framed → pillbox proof → snow cipher → basket exchange → erasure. Each beat tightens because/therefore linkage; the microdot inside the pillbox is a smart causal pivot that retroactively justifies survival. Closure lands as Earned Stasis: he is left alive but un-reinstated, footprints gone, cost legible. Orientation is anchored by word 75 (“Elias stood at the precipice…”), well inside the 120-word window.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The bluff’s jagged-wound metaphor, silver hush, and thaw-weeping ground filter every action; the mist both enables the cipher veil and later erases it. The pillbox micro-setting serves as tactile extension of setting, constraining the hand and choice. Spatial choreography is clean: stomp angles tracked, downdraft erases code, basket rises. Weather directly alters tactics—fog for concealment, rotor-wind for erasure—qualifying for 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reclaiming identity by proving loyalty—signals early and tightens through each beat: cipher risks exposure, microdot risks capture, basket surrender risks death. One visible price: the footprints he carved are literally blown away, foreclosing reinstatement. Escalation is coherent under causal lens; no coincidence resolves the tension. Could reach 8.8 if a secondary cost (physical injury, time lapse) had altered tactics on page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of “repair” emerges through the pillbox hinge, the spy network breach, and the self; no final-paragraph sermon. Subtext is carried by gesture—handing over the lethal box now holding life-saving proof. The thawing earth image reweights the opening frost without overt statement. Minor abstraction in “unused courage” phrase keeps it just below 8.0.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person intimate maintains consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature is specific to a trained observer (“sharp, deliberate angles” cipher). Syntax flexes from lyrical opening to clipped radio exchange, mirroring tension. No head-hopping; helicopter voice stays encrypted, external. Filter verbs are minimal; only two “felt” usages are voice-motivated.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong read-aloud rhythm with varied sentence openings; no template cadence runs. Figurative density is high at opening but taught early and paid off in erasure image. One paraphrase loop: “fixing what’s broken” twice in 50 words (−0.2). No mixed metaphors; “jagged wound in the sky” is singular and sustained. Closure image is crisp and uncluttered.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Snow-cipher call-sign is a fresh espionage maneuver; pillbox-as-proof inversion lifts familiar trope. The erasure of the message by the same agency that might save him is a resonant twist. Still relies on genre furniture—helicopter extraction, microdot—without fully subverting them. Specific meteorological detail keeps it from feeling template.</comment>
