<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Arthur’s interiority is vivid—his terror at “becoming accidentally prophetic” is shown through concrete emblems (flooded safe-house, fatal heart-attack) and a final, embodied gamble with the lens. The micro-choices (donning specs, disengaging governor, wrestling brass) externalize the shift from passive scribe to active composer. Still, the arc leans on retrospective summary for the prophetic failures rather than in-scene mistakes under live pressure, muting the felt cost that would push this into the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: prophetic glitch → moral crisis → sabotage-as-resignation, each “therefore” legible under a causal lens. The lighthouse-as-transmitter is set up early; the manual override pays off in a luminous CR that rewrites the night sky. Closure lands with undeniable cost—Arthur exiles himself from the network in real time—though the leap from fear to action could use one intermediate beat to show the final threshold crossing.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lantern room, mercury float, Fresnel lens, and ocean granite are filtered through Arthur’s tactile profession—dust motes igniting like “microscopic stars” is a POV-specific marvel. The lighthouse setting actively constrains the climax: only here can one man hijack a coastal beacon to broadcast analog code. One slip: “after last orders” is named but never exploited as a ticking clock; the hour stays atmospheric rather than tactical.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—freedom from complicity—escalates when the prophecy glitch turns fiction lethal, tightening moral cost. The manual override is the decisive trade-off: it severs his utility to the network and risks physical danger (crushing gears, exposure to boats). Pressure is coherent but largely internal; an external sniff of pursuit or a missed radio check could have sharpened the vise in the final third.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme—authorship vs. authorship weaponized—emerges through the fortune-cookie conceit and the final act of writing with light. Subtext glows in the image of open secrets: phrases millions read, one man decodes, now inverted so the world reads his exit flare without knowing. No moral is declared; the story invites the reader to weigh unintended consequence against individual agency.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is sinewy, idiosyncratic, and stable: “silence was loudest,” “minor scale of paranoia to a major chord” belong to a man who thinks in musical code. Perceptual signature—dust as stars, punctuation as runway—never slips into committee prose. Minor register drift (“conceptual repricing,” “resonant reconfiguration”) appears only in meta-narration of the prompt, not the story proper, so no deduction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sentences braid information with image: “velvet-lined case” + “marvel of optical engineering” = character, world, tool in one breath. Rhythm accelerates into the physical sabotage, then lengthens for the cosmic final image, mirroring emotional lift. Zero scaffold loops; no mixed metaphors. A lone template cadence (“He…, then he…”) is forgiven under duress of manual labor.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The microdot-fortune-cookie-lighthouse fusion feels inevitable yet freshly imagined; the spy-thriller trope is retooled through analog nostalgia and metaphysical bleed. Conceptual risk—prophecies that accidentally kill—pays off in a final image that reconfigures the灯塔 from surveillance node to declaration of self. Only the absence of an external human witness keeps this shy of the 9.5 band.</comment>
