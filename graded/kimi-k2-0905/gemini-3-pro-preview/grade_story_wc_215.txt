<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elias’s quiet refusal to let ghosts speak is embodied in every beat; the contradiction between humane curiosity and ascetic denial is held in his body, not interior monologue. The micro-choice to step back from the pleading spirit crystallizes his hierarchy of values without exposition. No interior label-speak; the recluse trait emerges only through action. Cost is visibly paid: nightly ritual isolates him, and the final smile is earned by prior causality under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the box’s violet light reweights the covenant, making silence itself the costly prize. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of return, light shift, and ghost stillness builds density until the final image reconfigures meaning. Orientation is anchored by word 30 (scorched horizon / apiary ruin). Persistent constraint: nightly ritual must be repeated; the knot can never stay tied. Cost is unmistakable in the final beat—“fresh, recurring wonder” carries the fatigue of eternal vigil.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Abandoned apiary with petrified comb and silica sand is tactile and lived-in; Elias’s boot crunches provide micro-setting anchor. Spatial choreography is clean: clusters of ghosts → dry well → altar of supers → lifted box; distances track. Light through colored glass is not atmosphere but tool: it literally projects the repression that silences ghosts. Setting constrains choice: only here can the covenant be re-tied, making locale inseparable from stakes.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“preserve the weight of unspoken words”—is signaled in paragraph 4 and tightened when the woman’s plea is rejected. One meaningful deepening: blue shadow over her feet becomes the visible trigger that forces her back into mystery, narrowing Elias’s options to perpetual guardianship. Cost is the endless repetition; the night reclaiming the waste implies tomorrow’s ghosts will try again. Agency is renunciation/attention rather than physical victory—valid under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the repeated act of refusal: silence as sacred resistance to cheap revelation. Subtext lives in gesture—spectral hands grasp air, Elias steps back—never in assertion. Final image of “honey sealed in a comb” revalues silence itself as golden, offering resonant non-literal answer. No moralizing; the reader is left to weigh the beauty against the loneliness.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person pulls close enough for calloused palms and astonished micro-expressions while staying objective. Perceptual signature is architectonic: Elias sees era-specific clothing slumps and light refraction angles—details only this mind would catalog. Rhythm modulates—long lyric sentences for static ghosts, clipped fragments for ritual steps. No dialogue, so voice purity remains intact; filter verbs are minimal and motiveless.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet breathable; metaphor vehicles stay physical (glass soldered from bullet lead, silence heavy as honey). No mixed metaphors or simultaneity errors. One paraphrase loop—“fresh, recurring wonder” echoes earlier “fresh, recurring” but the repetition is thematic, not artifact. Closing line “kingdom of quiet” is earned cadence, not template.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Post-veil ghost visibility trope is subverted: the living now police the dead into silence. Stained-glass reliquary built from war detritus (bullet casings) gives concrete specificity to abstract covenant. Conceptual risk—story prizes withholding over revelation—pays off in final image that reweights silence as treasure. Transformation test fails: only this man in this apiary could perform this nightly knot.</comment>
