<question>1</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Elara’s skeptical-scientist lens is vivid and embodied (“cataloging the thermal drop while her heart ached”), and her pivot from data scribe to memory-keeper is earned through micro-choices under pressure. Interior contradiction is alive: she doubts “supernatural properties” yet handles the tile with “a gentle reverence,” and the moment she decides to “sculpt space for reflection” carries visible cost to her academic identity. The only slack is a slight therapeutic gloss in “fierce desire to protect this sanctuary,” but it is brief and does not deflate the felt price. Overall, a single, coherent arc with irreplaceable motive force.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</question><comment>Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the tower’s silence is re-priced from empty to “full… resonant quiet,” a conceptual cost that re-weights every prior beat. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of memory → tile → whale song accretes until the stillness lands. Causality is intact; the act of transcribing literally binds memories, and the final image crystallizes her irreversible stance. No orientation debt; anchors set by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</question><comment>The tower, tile, whales, and star charts form a single micro-setting that physically constrains her choices: the stone floor vibrates with whale song, the tile’s grooves dictate transcription motion, and the open arches expose her to both wind and public mockery. Sensory hierarchy is character-specific—scientist first notes temperature, then grief. Spatial choreography is flawless; no floating props. The final image of violet-gold water is not decorative; it is the mirror of the newly “full” silence, charging closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</question><comment>Dominant stake—preserve the town’s drowned memory—surfaces early and tightens when demolition clock looms. Transcribing the square is the single meaningful deepening that narrows her options: once begun, stopping would erase memories she now hosts. Cost is visible: she forfeits academic reputation (“risk to her standing”). Escalation is textural rather than causal, fitting the Accumulative lens; one intensification suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</question>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: grief as data that can be ordered, not erased. The magic square migrates from math puzzle to emotional checksum, re-weighting the concept of “sum.” Final image answers the unstated question—how to honor absence—by making silence audible. No moralizing, only resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</question>
<comment>Third-person limited stays strictly inside Elara’s scientific perceptual signature: numbers, charts, thermal drops. Syntax is precise yet melodic, mirroring her dual frame of logic and grief. No head-hopping; whales remain external, felt not interpreted. Filter verbs are minimal and voice-driven.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</question>
<comment>Zero loops, zero scaffold; every sentence advances knowledge or atmosphere. Figurative language is spare and coherent: “grey giants,” “resonant quiet.” Opening line anchors stakes and voice; final line resolves by image. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with scene tempo—longer clauses under whale-thrum, clipped notes during transcription.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</question>
<comment>Fusing a 3×3 magic square with coastal grief-archive feels inevitable yet never seen before. Whales as data-carriers and tile as emotional RAID array is a fresh synthesis. Risk is taken by making transcription—the dullest act—the climax; it pays off. If swapped to any other object, the logic collapses.</comment>
