<comment>Elias’s interior contradiction—maintenance vs. rebellion—stays alive in every micro-choice; the moment he lifts the bone button to the jar mouth, his quiet inspiration is embodied, not declared. His final inversion of the master hourglass is earned by the prior sonic filtration and carries visible cost: the cliff prophecy literally blanks. The only minor slack is the slight diagnostic tinge of “his motivation burned cold and clear,” immediately redeemed by tactile action.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a crystallized Decisive Change: the prophecy erases and the sand re-flows in chaotic spirals, reweighting the valley’s time-rule with undeniable conceptual cost. Causal chain holds: because he unscrambles the echo with buttons, therefore the inscription fades and the glass turns. Lens is Causal throughout; no teleporting props or retro-patches. Cost is legible in the blank cliff and the swirling sand that “defied gravity,” a persistent constraint now shaping history.</comment>

<comment>The amber warehouse, petrified-resin air, and solidified-sap walls are not backdrop; they deaden sound and force Elias to use buttons as tuning filters, so environment directly shapes tactic. Spatial choreography is clean: shelf → workbench → master hourglass → cliff outside. Micro-setting qualifies: the jar, buttons, and master glass function as extensions of the warehouse, each constraining the sonic experiment. Final image of blank stone recharges the amber enclosure, closing the sensory loop.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—fate vs. choice—is signaled early and tightens when each button filters a new tonal layer, foreclosing the old reading of prophecy. Escalation is causal: every button placement narrows sonic chaos → reveals chorus → erases doom, with visible price (fading inscription). No coincidence; agency drives each increment. The final sand swirl is the earned reversal that makes “endings” unwritten, paying the conceptual cost on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: prophecy is collective static, wisdom is plural, mutable. No explicit sermon; the blank cliff is the non-literal answer. Subtext hums in the buttons’ biographies—each a silent vote against fatalism. Resonant reconfiguration lands when the same “unearthed silence” that opened the warehouse now fills the valley, re-priced as possibility rather than doom.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person POV stays tight to Elias’s perceptual filter—sound is “bouncing erratically,” sand “defied gravity,” aligning with his tuned attention. Diction is concrete, resin-scented, never academic. Rhythm accelerates with the spiral of buttons, then breathes at the final inversion. No head-hop, no filter-verb stacks; patterned elision of connector words is taught early and paid off in the chaotic sand cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or causality. Information density high: “discarded punctuation marks of the valley’s people” compresses history and metaphor. Metaphors stay physically coherent—echo as “tangled knot,” sand “swirling, chaotic patterns.” Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image that recharges “unearthed silence.” No artifact touches closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: hourglass maintenance + button phonetics + mistranslated cliff graffiti = non-obvious alchemy. Risk of lyric abstraction is embraced yet grounded via tactile buttons and fading inscription. Transformation test fails if relocated—buttons as sonic keys are irreplaceable. The stunt feels inevitable in hindsight yet unforeseeable at entry, satisfying the 9+ risk bonus.</comment>
