<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Kaelen’s “operative gentleness” is more label than lived; the clipboard micro-choice is sharp, but we never feel his interior contradiction under pressure. The warlords’ grief is sketched in one exquisite beat each—Elara, Jory—yet their sudden pliability feels outline-like, not earned by prior flaw or hunger. Still, the endurance he carries away is a palpable cost, satisfying the Earned Stasis closure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: celestial silence → ritual demand → name-offering → signature, each step shrinking options. The silver sheet turn is a perfect micro-reversal that makes the debt visible. Closure lands with conceptual cost—“peace was…a burden”—and the clipboard’s weight forecloses further negotiation, satisfying Charged Poise.</comment>

<comment>The terrace is economically anchored in smoke-heat-jasmine-cordite; the twin-moon light literally disables weapons, constraining every tactic. The cracked mosaic tiles underfoot mirror the fractured factions, and the violet convergence recharges the final image. Micro-setting (clipboard as mirror) also constrains the signing beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“price of redemption”—tightens from abstract to two children’s names etched in silver. The meaningful turn is the ritual demand itself: refuse and the moons will part, guns reignite; accept and the war ends on their own grief. Agency is Kaelen’s calm ultimatum; cost is the sorrow he must carry forever.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the inversion of tribute: future-for-future swapped for past-for-past. No moralizing—just the final image of Kaelen vanishing with the list of sins. The flaw—war consumes its own justification—is implicit in the children’s names, not asserted.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays welded to Kaelen’s perception; diction (“operatively gentle,” “wounded beasts”) is precise and metallic-lyric without purple drift. Rhythm accelerates into the violet flash, then exhales into the final sentence cadence. Dialogue is minimal but Hark’s gravel-spit and Vena’s ceramic tear are vocally distinct.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Lines are dense yet breathable; metaphors (“dragging shadows like wounded beasts”) serve dual sensory + character work. Zero paraphrase loops, no filter-verb stacks. Final sentence delivers a conceptual re-pricing in eight rhythmic beats. Copy-clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The “forever-war peace negotiator” trope is refreshed by the celestial gun-silencer mechanic and the ritual of naming lost children rather than troops. Risky choice to keep warlords off-stage until now pays off because their grief is shown as weaponized currency. Specificity of the silver sheet mirror lifts the concept above generic armistice scenes.</comment>
