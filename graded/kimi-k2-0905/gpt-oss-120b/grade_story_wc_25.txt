<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Milo’s stubborn curiosity and methodical ritualism are vivid; his interiority is filtered through sensory particulars (“electric tang on his skin”). The final pocketing of the coin is a credible micro-choice that completes his arc, though the absence of any visible cost prevents a higher band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the parchment’s line re-weights the premise with conceptual cost (“Whispers are the true currents”). Causality is accumulative/textural—each storm pulse thickens the map’s vein—so the lens holds. The key’s first appearance as a useless object that later opens the box is a satisfying, foreshadowed turn.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Container stacks function as micro-setting: the seam-split wall and tunnel are tactile resources that change Milo’s options. Storm static narrows auditory perception to “faint as a moth’s wing,” guiding his next move. Geography remains coherent; no impossible positions.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can a whisper outrun a shout?—tightens once when the radio repeats the phrase, foreclosing doubt. Cost is present but conceptual rather than visceral; the story opts for quiet confirmation over tangible loss, capping intensity just below the 8-band gate.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: the final parchment re-prices the city’s communicative economy from noise to whisper. No character lectures; the insight is earned through the storm-driven test. The refrain “whispers travel farther” is never stated outright, avoiding thematic echo penalty.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person narration keeps a tight psychic distance, filtering diction through Milo’s technician mindset (“power conduits humming in sync”). Rhythm accelerates into shorter clauses during the seam-split beat, mirroring tension. No POV leakage or filter-verb bloat.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and image-dense; sentences advance at least two jobs (e.g., “storm’s electric tang” delivers sensory data plus stakes). One minor paraphrase loop—“glowing line… twisted… like a living vein” followed by “vein” again in next paragraph—costs a tick. No mixed metaphors or overwriting in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The port-container-as-labyrinth is fresh scaffolding for the whisper experiment; the zodiac coin’s acoustic amplification during geomagnetic disturbance is a novel, earned rule. Transformation test passes: swap coin/map/key and the entire causal chain collapses. Risk adds +0.3.</comment>
