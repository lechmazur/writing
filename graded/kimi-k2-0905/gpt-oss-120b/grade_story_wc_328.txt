<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The researcher’s undercover motive is stated, not embodied; we witness no moment where the mask almost slips. Interiority floats in atmospheric summary (“I remembered my orders”) rather than conflicting impulses acted out under the garden’s pressure. The emotional turn—bitterness loosening into laughter—is announced, not dramatized through micro-choice; the arrowhead’s shattering is external spectacle rather than character-driven sacrifice. Cost is present but generic; the mission succeeds without visible personal price, keeping the arc tidy rather than crucible-forged.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: static laughter layers until the moss silver-shift charges the final image. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—the garden seals, the pocket feels absence—undeniable conceptual cost. Causality is lyric rather than tight; arrowhead gravity and phone confession feel associative, not sequential, yet pattern is taught early and paid off. Orientation crystal-clear by word 50; no teleporting props; one scaffold loop (“gravitationally playful echo”) lightly dulls final beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Underground garden is vividly sensory, selective, lived-in: phosphorescent moss humming low notes, frost that clings like frozen hope. Micro-setting (arrowhead) constrains the air itself, charging the final silver moss image. Spatial choreography clean—phone lifted by vine-scaffold, arrowhead centered, light snowfalls—no floating bodies. Detail economy high; every descriptor bends toward tonal joke-metamorphosis rather than tourist catalog.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“coax creature’s sorrow into laughter”—is signaled early. One meaningful tightening: phone laughter shifts from mournful to mischievous, reweighting stakes. Agency is receptive (listening, placing arrowhead) rather than active, but aligns with accumulative design. Cost is atmospheric, not tactical; options narrow toward communion rather than confrontation, satisfying the lyric mode.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges concretely: cosmic darkness answered not by conquest but by shared laughter. Subtext carried in the static’s tonal shift and silver moss smile—no explicit moral. Bitterness-to-joke transformation is shown via moss color change and body-felt ripple, not stated. Final image reweights mythic sorrow as playful gravity, inviting ambiguous reflection without tidy maxim.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>First-person perceptual signature is distinct: scientific detachment (“I was not a simple botanist”) colliding with mythic diction (“harmony untamed,” “gravitationally playful”). Rhythm tightens under pressure—sentence fragments mirror static crackle. No dialogue, so voice remains pure, consistent, lyric. Filter verbs minimal; metaphors (“frost that clung…a kind of hope”) are POV-anchored, not decorative.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; paragraph cuts propel descent then ascent. Information density high—single sentences do setting, object, mood. One paraphrase loop: “gravitationally playful” echoed twice without new charge; minor. No mixed metaphors; syntax stays within lyric narrator’s lexicon. Final line cadence mirrors garden sealing, earning momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Fusion of cryptid research with underground herbalist garden feels fresh; arrowhead-as-musical-node particular to this world. Bitterness-to-cosmic-joke twist grows organically from accumulative static laughter. Risk-taking in lyric causality pays off. Could swap “echoing beast” for any lost myth without structural crack, slightly lowering uniqueness.</comment>
