<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mira’s interior contradiction—yearning to unlock the watchers while fearing the city’s fossil-fate—remains embodied (ink-slick fingers, hunched spine) and drives every micro-choice. The reed-whistle beats act as visible micro-decisions that tighten her resolve; her final vow to “keep listening” costs her the safety of ignorance, sealing Earned Stasis with felt price. No secondary character applies pressure, so relationship bullets are waived; her competence is balanced by the genuine risk of pattern-misreading. The only minor slip is a touch of diagnostic self-labelling (“quietly driven”) early on, but the embodied action soon overrides it.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: Mira’s realization that the lost expedition became the pattern itself reweights the premise and forecloses her old cartographer stance with undeniable conceptual cost (“she vowed to keep listening”). Causal linkage holds throughout—each whistle note tightens turtle response → mosaic crack → passage opens → watchers answer—so the lens is Causal. Orientation is anchored by word 80 (“sunlit harbor… Shellhaven”), well within the 120-word allowance. Persistent constraint (gate rusted shut, mosaic sealed again) shapes her tactics and the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is no postcard: the shell-terraces constrain movement (she must trace ridges to read), the cracked mosaic literally funnels her to the tunnel, and the watchers’ cliff-top perch supplies the final visual cost. Sensory hierarchy follows cartographer bias—line, curve, resonance—so detail is filtered, not touristic. Weather (sun at zenith) is the causal trigger that opens the tunnel, integrating atmosphere into plot. Micro-setting (reed whistle, ink vial) likewise constrains tactics and charges the final image when she tucks the whistle away, accepting perpetual risk.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prevent Shellhaven’s fossilization—faces concrete test when the mosaic glow reveals the out-tunnel; choosing to leave the city’s shell is a tightening with visible price (exposure to watchers). Escalation is causal: whistle → turtle stir → watchers’ light-pattern answer; each step narrows her options until endurance becomes the only stance. No coincidence resolves; the watchers’ answer is earned by her pattern-calls. Cost is legible in the final image: she seals the mosaic, accepting eternal vigilance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: mapping as listening, not control—expedition lost by becoming the map itself. Subtext lives in gesture (whistle wail = question) and image (spiral shells = eternal migration). Final image reweights “lost expedition” from tragedy to transcendence, achieving CR. No moralizing; the dread/sunwash dialectic modulates but never resolves into comfort, preserving ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tightly lashed to Mira’s perceptual bias: curves, fracture-lines, wind resonance. Syntax grows sinuous under stress (“spiraled outward… fractal echoes”) then shortens at crest (“She tucked… ready to redraw”), mirroring emotional cadence. No dialogue, so those bullets are waived; prose itself carries idiom. Filter verbs are minimal; when used (“seemed to stir”) they flag epistemic modesty, not dilution.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Information-dense lines (“the city… perched on the backs of gargantuan turtles that trudged eternally…”) world-build without stall. Mixed-metaphor vigil is avoided; vehicles (molten ribbon, ancient scarps) stay sea-tectonic. No scaffold loops; each sentence advances discovery or pressure. Rhythm breathes with discovery beats, then compresses at tunnel emergence. Reed whistle’s thin tone skittering is tactile and fresh. Closure line is crisp image, no overwrite.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Turtle-city + cartographer who maps by shell growth is a fresh synthesis; lost expedition revealed as living pattern feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Risk-taking in concept (sentient geology, language of fracture) pays off without losing clarity. No borrowed scenes; imagery is particular to this world. Transformation test fails if names swapped—turtles & shells are integral, not ornament.</comment>
