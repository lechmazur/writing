<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Lira’s interior contradiction—war-weary yet still believing in gentleness—surfaces in her tear at the end, but the story tells us “operative gentleness” rather than letting us feel its cost in breath or body earlier. The single micro-choice of placing the clipboard is clean, yet prior beats summarize her aura instead of staging a visible trade-off that would foreclose an alternative path. The chieftains’ softening is externally narrated, so Lira’s agency feels more emblematic than crucible-tested. Still, the endurance of carrying the inked pages supplies credible Earned Stasis.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: swords atop the altar reconfigure the stalemate into fragile covenant, the ebony sheet glowing under starlight makes the conceptual cost undeniable, and the lens is Accumulative—the slow layering of offerings, clauses, and blades tightens until the terrace itself becomes treaty. Causality is lyric rather than plot-engine; each beat adds density rather than reversals, and the final image rewards that pattern. One minor causality wobble: the hymn is introduced only in the last sentence, so its emotional freight feels appended rather than seeded. Nevertheless, the reader traces a legible before/after in the same spatial frame.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fire-scent, marble grain, and jasmine arrive through Lira’s selective attention, anchoring body and tool; the terrace’s white stone and circulating stars constrain the ritual timing and tether the treaty to cosmic order. Spatial choreography keeps swords, altar, and clipboard cleanly tracked. The ebony clipboard operates as micro-setting: its dark surface refracts firelight and later hosts the blades, recharging the reconciliation image. A single overripe phrase—“flawed beauty” repeated twice—slips toward symbolic announcement rather than sensory earnedness.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can ink and ritual outbid blood spite—signals early and tightens once: the sword-placing beat physically forecloses return to war, cost paid in the leaders’ public vulnerability. Agency is accumulative rather than reversal-driven; Lira’s steady inscription increases social density until refusal becomes more awkward than compliance. The price is conceptual but visible—bronze laid against wood under star-witness. No secondary escalation, yet the single deepening suffices under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges without thesis: redemption priced not in coin but in communal listening, enacted when cricket song and clank of armor coexist. The ebony sheet’s transformation from bureaucratic prop to covenant mirror reweights “flawed beauty” from decorative phrase to lived paradox. Final image of broken-yet-whole dawn avoids moralizing; resonance arises from particular swords touching particular stone. Only lacks a sharper earlier irony to complicate the gentleness ideal.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Third-person lyric hovers at consistent psychic distance; diction—“slow dance of celestial bodies,” “operatively gentle”—maintains elevated ritual register without drifting into corporate filler. Perceptual signature roots in Lira’s tactile focus on cool clipboard grain and sea-born jasmine. Rhythm modulates: longer cadence for celestial exposition, tighter clauses during sword-placing. No dialogue to test subtext, so voice distinctness rests on idiom control which remains intact.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm is mostly varied; a few “the” openers cluster yet do not drum. Metaphors—sky as choreography, swords as storm—cohere within lyric treaty motif. One scaffold pair: “its darkness now a canvas for the silver light of reconciliation” restates the prior clipboard glow without fresh pressure. Information density strong; each sentence layers symbol atop sensory motion. Closure line free of clutter.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Familiar trope—peace forged at solstice ritual—is refreshed by treating the clipboard as micro-altar and forcing generals to sing, not sign. Celestial “slow dance” literalized as timing device rather than decorative skybox. Specificity of cricket chorus against bronze clang gives sensory fingerprint. Risk is moderate; success lies in compressing epic stakes into a single stone circle without telescopic inflation.</comment>
