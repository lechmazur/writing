<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Grief as fuel is credible; the visor adjustment and palm-thrust are concrete micro-choices. Missing antagonist or second character keeps relational pressure off-page; interiority leans lyric rather than contradictory under fire. The earned shift from loss to clarity lands, but the cost is more conceptual than embodied—no lingering wound or forfeited tool. Still, the voice-specific perceptual tilt (“tasted of rust and ozone”) keeps him individuated.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: density of crystal resonance images tightens stakes toward the final Charged Poise. Orientation anchors (who/where) arrive by line 3; no penalty. The seam-fissure reveal is a pattern break that reweights the unused-potential stake; closure image—“shards hovering like a constellation”—makes the conceptual cost undeniable. One hairline slip: “he realized” twice in closing beats; tiny, but keeps it sub-9.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Floating observatory rotors, magnetic cradle, and bruised-violet sky are selective, POV-filtered, and guide access to the crack. The geode itself acts as micro-setting that constrains the final hand-thrust. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible moves. Weather color shifts from mourning violet to indifferent canvas, mirroring internal arc without overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—tap the unused potential pool—signaled early and deepened by each resonance reading. Escalation is textural: each amplification of geode hum increases the intangible cost of merger. The final palm-thrust forecloses retreat; the price is the permanent fracture of the crystal and the implied surrender to a state of being. No external antagonist, but internal pressure suffices under accumulative lens.</question>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges: awakened minds can transmute unspent systemic energy into new being. No moralizing; final constellation image reweights earlier “map” motif. Subtext of personal vs. systemic loss is hinted but not fully braided. Ambiguity lingers—will he distribute shards or hoard them?—inviting reflection without confusion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person lyric remains close to sensorium; diction (“intangibly tangible,” “perturbation theory”) stays within his technical grief vocabulary. Rhythm accelerates into fragments at climax—“He caught one shard…”—then widens for final canvas, mirroring pulse of event. No dialogue, so no voice-convergence risk. One filter-verb cluster (“he realized”) nicks perfection.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>High information density: one sentence often layers sensorium, tool-action, and conceptual map. Metaphors are coherent—geode as suns, deck as patient heart—and do not stack in crisis beats. Minor scaffold: “hum” repeated four times; justified by resonance motif so penalty waived. Final line cadence lands cleanly without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</question>
<comment>Synthesis of geode-crystal trope with grief-tech survivalist is fresh; drone-strike wedding survivor as POV is non-obvious. Risk-taking in lyric accumulative structure pays off: reader traces before/after without set-piece fight. If ported to another venue, the geode’s “intangibly tangible” property would collapse—high specificity. One tiny echo of Jeff Vandermeer-style biotech mysticism, but sufficiently re-angled.</comment>
