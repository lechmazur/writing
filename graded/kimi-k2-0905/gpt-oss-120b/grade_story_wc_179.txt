<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Mara’s pacifist scheming is clear and consistent, but her interiority stays at a meditative distance; we see her plan and watch it work, yet feel no contradictory impulse or visible cost to her. The monks’ conversions are sketched as a chain of identical beats without individuated friction, so the “change” reads as smooth miracle rather than earned struggle. Closure satisfies the lens (accumulative/lyric) but the absence of a personal price for Mara caps credibility at high-band edge.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the music box’s vanishing pin leaves the monks (and later the wanderer) carrying cellular peace—an earned stasis with conceptual cost—under an accumulative lens. Causality is present yet light: the box reappears because a needy hand touches it, not because Mara’s tactics tighten; this coincidence-complication is acceptable under the lyric pattern taught early. Orientation is swift and the two-shard structure (monks → wanderer) is legible; no mechanics break.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The obsidian sanctuary’s sound-absorption and porous-night rule are established quickly and return to charge the final image; environment literally exhales, reweighting the stake. Selective sensory focus (cool lid, pulsing fingertips) keeps the micro-setting tactile without clutter. Spatial tracking is clean across the meditation circle and the wanderer’s entrance; no white-room lapses.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“can resentment be dissolved without violence?”—is signaled early and deepens as each monk touches the box; the tightening is lyrical repetition rather than rising risk, fitting the accumulative lens. Cost is present but diffused: the monks’ bitterness is traded for empathy, yet the price is felt more communally than personally. A single meaningful intensification suffices; no reversals required.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the repeating image of the reappearing pin: memory as physical, peace as infection. No moral is stated; the final image of the wanderer’s anger dissolving into stone reconfigures the premise with quiet conceptual cost. Subtext resides in touch and silence rather than exposition; ambiguity lingers about whether the change is permanent, inviting reflection.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person lyric voice maintains a hushed, incantatory rhythm that mirrors the sanctuary’s muffled air; sentence length modulates with the cadence of breath. Perceptual signature is consistent—attention to vibration, shimmer, and cellular memory—and pays off in the final lullaby echo. No head-hopping; distance stays wide but purposeful, suiting the parable mode.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose is lean and image-rich; high density without loops. Metaphors (“muted mural of shifting grace”) stay coherent and restrained, avoiding purple drift. Occasional elevated diction (“vaulted heart,” “cellular memory”) is justified by the mythic register; no mixed vehicles or paraphrase loops detected. Final line breathes cleanly, recharging the motif.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Cellular memory as literal mechanic is a fresh twist on pacifist fantasy; the broken music box that only repairs for the needy converts a familiar trope into bodily miracle. Sanctuary that becomes permeable at night supplies a subtle world-rule rather than late gimmick. While the plot arc is gentle and recognizable, the synthesis of tactile memory + silent space feels specific to this piece; not interchangeable.</comment>
