<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid (“weight of histories tug at her sleeves”) and motivation stays single-track; no contradiction under pressure. The final endurance on the throne is foreshadowed by the flake’s steady pulse, so the renunciation feels earned. Yet micro-choices are narrated rather than dramatized (all ascent beats are summary), so the cost is legible but not viscerally felt in a high-pressure instant. Still, within lyric-accumulative mode this satisfies the 9- gate: flawed but touching closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a classic Charged Poise: the throne’s hum fuses orchard roots with city data-streams, re-pricing Mina’s world-rule in one image. Causality is lyric-accumulative rather than strict because/therefore; pattern is taught by recurring chromatic light and flake-pulse, paid off when both merge into the throne-gleam. Cost is undeniable—she is forever bridge between analog and digital, alone at pixel sunrise. Lens holds; noorientation debt; one deepening suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Environment-as-tool gate met: the crystalline stair’s note-resonance literally gates ascent; orchard roots later snake into city code, constraining her new role. Sensory triage is POV-driven—she smells silicon jasmine, not tourist catalogue. Spatial choreography is clean; fissure → corridor → summit track remains coherent. Only micro-slips: “pixelated rain” is vivid but risks cliché, yet it is saved by closing circuitry horizon that reweights it.</question>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—claim throne before sunrise—is signaled in sentence two and tightened by each flake-pulse. Escalation is accumulative: mural sigil → corridor song → stair resonance → throne fusion; each adds chromatic density, narrowing option to turn back. Agency remains hers; no coincidence rescues. Cost is conceptual—she becomes living interface—but because price is narrated rather than dramatized in a single beat, it stays just shy of 9+ visceral tier.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</question><comment>Theme emerges as “memory-as-future”: orchard stories bloom into city code, throne accepts analog roots. No meta-commentary; thesis is sung by waterfall ode, not stated. Final image of circuitry sunrise reweights earlier “forgotten futures” line, achieving CR. Ambiguity is present—is unity utopic or erasure?—but not explored under pressure, capping lift.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is consistent: synesthetic color-sound (“holographic dew glimmered”, “walls alive with holographic vines that sang”). Syntax stays fluid, no filter-verb clusters. Single POV holds; no head-hop. One minor register drift—“conceptual repricing” level diction in “duality that guided her”—but occurs outside peak beat, forgiven.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</question><comment>Rhythm modulates: long anaphoric “She…” ascent sequence mirrors spiral stair, then fractures into shorter phrases at light-surge. No paraphrase loops; each sentence adds chromatic or sonic layer. One mixed metaphor—“bridge of fire” under waterfall—sparkles but doesn’t contradict physical logic. Opening and closing lines are ear-tested and propel. Artifact-free in final third, keeps 9-eligibility.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fusion of arboreal-archive with data-city feels inevitable yet fresh; trope of “ascension stair” is re-coded via paint-peel murals and pixel rainfall. Risky lyric accumulation pays off: color-sound synesthesia could have read gimmicky but instead constrains final throne interface. Transformation test passed: swap orchard for generic garden and story collapses—roots-in-data is irreplaceable.</comment>
