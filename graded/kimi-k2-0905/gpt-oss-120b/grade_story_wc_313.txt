<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Caitlyn’s vigilance is embodied in the quiet gait and the label pressed to her palm, but her interior contradiction—duty versus communal memory—stays summary-level; the “precisely humane” trait alters no visible micro-choice under pressure. Closure is credible yet the cost is communal, not personal, so her private stake feels slightly unscathed.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the town’s shared silence reframes the reservoir from threat to mirror, cost felt in the collective breath. The photograph trail supplies causal linkage, each image tightening knowledge; only the midnight-to-sunrise sweep is compressed into lyric montage, not fully dramatized, keeping the lens Accumulative/Textural rather than Causal.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The ridgeway, lantern glow on black water, and sapphire label create a micro-setting that charges the final image; pine scent and chime timbre compress into mood without stall. Spatial choreography stays clean across the embankment walk; weather and water level remain static, limiting environmental pressure on choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Single dominant stake—replace myth with truth—tightens once when the bottle photo fuses label to sabotage story, forcing Caitlyn to speak. Cost is communal catharsis, not personal loss; escalation is poetic deepening rather than option foreclosure, fitting Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of collective memory reclaimed from myth emerges through image chain, never stated; the reservoir’s shift from scar to watching eye reweights meaning. Subtext lives in lantern reflections and shared silence—no moralizing line.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Caitlyn’s perceptual filter: sapphire swirl echoes water memory, wind chime timbre narrows to her childhood lesson. Syntax glides into lyrical compression without register drift; no dialogue, so voice coherence rests on metaphor control that holds.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is rhythmically varied, high density: “lantern a promise,” “hush settle like mirrored glass.” No loops or mixed metaphors; only a single template cadence in “the town… began to stir” is minor. Opening and final lines frame with image payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Flood-resurfacing trope is refreshed through photograph archaeology and communal rather than heroic arc; sapphire label as memory shard feels idiosyncratic. Risk lies in lyric montage over dramatized beats, but coherence holds.</comment>
