<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Aric’s interiority is vivid—equations scratched onto stone, the dice’s chipped face as “wounded star”—and his obsession tightens across beats. The final smile shows earned contradiction: cage/key at once. Yet we never see an explicit micro-choice under momentary duress; the tilt is mechanical, not visceral, softening the cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The causal spine holds: dice rolls → step-tilt → staircase quiver → perceptual rupture. Orientation is swift; closure lands as Charged Poise on the 20th landing with the chipped face finally up, reweighting prior failure. Cost is conceptual yet undeniable—the stairs now sing an anthem of endless flawed motion.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The staircase is no backdrop; its breathing marble and shifting incline physically constrain every tactic. Micro-setting rule met: the bronze frame / glass disc act as tools that alter probability and thereby motion. Sensory economy is tight—dim light, stone sigh—filtered through Aric’s mathematic-poetic gaze.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>One dominant stake—prove perpetual motion or remain bound—is signaled early and tightens when the stairs first quiver. Escalation is purely causal: each roll tilts reality, narrowing option toward the final “quiet rupture.” The price is visible in the scar that never lands—then finally does—reconfiguring obsession into acceptance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through iterated concrete acts: scar-as-flaw becomes the engine of infinity. No moralizing; the ending image of the scarred die facing up re-prices imperfection as the true driver. Ambiguity lingers: is endless ascent freedom or deeper cage? Resonant without tidy answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Voice is lyric-mathematical, syntax loops like steps (“each step a…”) mimicking staircase recursion. Diction stays inside Aric’s dual poet-geek lexicon; no head-hop. Rhythmic control peaks in the final clause-song: “a perpetual promise whispered through stone”—pressure crystallized.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density, no filler; each sentence pilots image and concept simultaneously. Metaphors stay consistent (wounded star, breathing marble) without purple drift. Minor scaffold echo (“each step a…”) is pattern-taught and paid off—acceptable. No loops obscure the final image; read-aloud cadence breathes with escalation.</question>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Infinite staircase + perpetual motion dice is fresh synthesis; trope of flawed randomness driving infinity feels inevitable in hindsight. The chipped die as constant offset that stabilizes motion is a non-obvious engineering twist. Risk of abstraction is high, but specificity of bronze frame / glass disc grounds it.</comment>
