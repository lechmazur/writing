<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Designer’s interiority stays lyric-lyrical (“serious playfulness” repeated) rather than concrete under pressure; no contradictory impulse is staged in scene. His sole micro-choice—lifting the rag knot—repeats without escalating cost. The vow at the end is closure-adjacent but feels additive, not paid for by prior causality. Flaw is label-speak, not embodied contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative-textural lens holds: each chant/spark layers density until the mosaic tile glows. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—night sky re-priced as canvas—but emotional cost is only asserted (“gravity of hopelessness lift”). Orientation clean by 120 words; spatial logic survives lyric drift. Final vow is redundant denouement after the image has already closed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Blooming fortress walls actively constrain movement and filter breath; vines curl tighter after each spark, a living aperture that charges the final fresco. Micro-setting (rag knot in pocket, kerosene scent on breeze) doubles as tool and sensory anchor. Selection favors olfactory and tactile over visual, matching fireworks craft. Setting evolution is causal, not backdrop.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—replace star-less void with handmade light—signaled early; tightening occurs when each spark lands on an unseen tile, narrowing possibility to one completed mosaic note. Agency is accumulative (each chant/spark is a tile laid) rather than a single decisive trade-off. Cost is conceptual (oil, breath, time) but not viscerally felt on page. Escalation is density, not risk.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges via image pattern: fire as movable mosaic tile reweights the ancient belief that color can speak. No moralizing—final image is silent glow on stone. Ambiguity lingers: is the light hopeful or merely decorative? Serious playfulness stays intact, resisting tidy uplift. Subtext carried by scent and echo, not exposition.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person lyric camera maintains consistent distance; perceptual signature fused with pyrotechnic craft—air tasted for combustibility, petals read as witnesses. Syntax swells and contracts like fuse wire, no template cadence. No dialogue to corrupt voice. Diction stays within artisanal lexicon; compression is purposeful, not elided clarity. Rhythm mirrors slow burn then burst.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Lyric density occasionally tips into purple (“velvet blank that swallowed hope and sound alike”) but pattern is taught early and paid off at burst. No loops; each sentence adds tile or spark. One mixed metaphor (“note in mosaic” as both acoustic and visual) but does not obscure causality. Final line earns echo without scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Fusion of fireworks craft with mosaic mythology feels fresh; “moving tile” conceit transforms sky into portable gallery. Risk is lyric diffuseness, but coherence holds. Conceptual repricing of starless night as intentional canvas is non-obvious. Would break if relocated; specificity is the invention. Avoids twee via kerosene stink and oily rag.</comment>
