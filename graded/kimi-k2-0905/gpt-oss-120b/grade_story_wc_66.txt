<comment>Mara’s calm precision and “thistled” steadiness are shown through her meticulous copying and the way her presence soothes literal dust—an embodied, character-specific quirk. The interior contradiction between her quiet exterior and the covert piracy she embraces is dramatized when she “cloaks herself in the song,” a micro-choice that visibly costs her neutrality. Her final quiet pride lands as credible endurance rather than epiphany, foreclosing silence without sentimental uplift, though the copyist profession remains more atmospheric than tactical.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the crowd’s applause crystallizes a new social contract—dust now speaks—while Mara tightens the shawl, signalling the price of perpetual vigilance. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout: every broadcast fragment thickens the atmospheric stakes until the final cadence reweights the city’s silence into story. Causality is intact—pirate signal → transcription → public playback—though the radio’s physics stays lightly magical. Orientation is anchored by word 50; no caps triggered.</comment>

<comment>The ember alcove, mist, and radio dial function as micro-setting: the dial’s glow literally enables Mara’s night work and finally beams a public signal from the window, charging the last image. Dust particles evolve from inert to sonic storytellers, a lived-in tactile shift that alters environmental possibility. Sensory economy favors amber light, crackling static, and thistled texture—each returned at closure to echo the new audible dust. Spatial choreography is flawless: rooftop windows catch the broadcast, proving scale without white-room drift.</comment>

<comment>The dominant stake—can silence be broken without personal exposure—tightens when Mara decides to transmit the pirate song publicly; the shawl amplifies both sound and risk, a visible price. One meaningful deepening occurs as luminous ink accumulates: each copied bar heightens the chance of detection, narrowing her options to either hoard or broadcast. No reversals are needed; the accumulative pattern itself escalates atmospheric cost until the crowd’s listening crystallizes the stakes. Agency remains hers—she presses “play,” enduring the consequence of openness.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges obliquely: archival labor + pirate broadcast = forgotten voices resurrected through communal listening. No character moralizes; the eventual cheering is the argument. The dust-as-medium motif shifts from passive archive to active voice, reweighting the premise at closure without overt statement. Subtext operates in the shawl’s hum and the ledger’s glow—objects that carry suppressed history into public air.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Mara’s perceptual filter—she “senses hunger in the air,” not an abstract city. Syntax lengthens under misty description, then clips into verbs—“She pressed play”—at the climax, mirroring her transition from patience to action. No dialogue appears; absence is apt for a story about silence. Filter verbs (“she felt”) are minimal and warranted by meditative tempo.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Figurative language is dense but patterned—radio glow as “fireflies trapped in amber” teaches the luminous motif that recurs in ink and dust, paying off at climax. Mixed-metaphor risk is avoided by keeping vehicles within the organic/electronic palette. No loops or synonym churn; each sentence either advances transcription action or thickens atmospheric texture. Occasional adjectival stacks (“shortwave radio dial glow”) read as voice rather than padding.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Fusing orchestral archiving with pirate radio is a fresh angle on post-censorship recovery; the dust-as-speaker concept literalizes archival theory without didacticism. The “thistled calm” coinage feels idiosyncratic yet apt, not quirky ornament. Structural risk—lyric accumulation instead of causal reversals—heightens resonance and stays coherent. While echoes of “story famine” and “pirate broadcast” touch familiar tropes, the specific synthesis of score-copying + clandestine signal + sentient dust is non-obvious.</comment>
