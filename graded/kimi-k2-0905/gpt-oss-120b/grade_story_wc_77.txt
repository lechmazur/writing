<question>1</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is largely atmospheric (“swallowed the clasp…cold weight seep into her veins”) rather than contradictory impulse; the single micro-choice (placing the clasp) is under-motivated because her want/fear matrix is never given concrete stakes beyond generic dread. Advisor functions as expository chorus, not secondary pressure, so relationship crucible is absent. Earned change is asserted by images rather than dramatized cost; the refusal bargain lands as external label, not internal reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Closure is present—Mara’s “vanish” repels the fear-figure and she accepts the perpetual beacon burden—so Decisive Change with conceptual cost (carry the luminance) is legible. Causality, however, is lyrical-accumulative, not because/therefore: dream-dictionary rule is introduced post-hoc at climax, breaking earlier agency linkage. Orientation cues (who, when) are delayed behind ornate scenery; spatial logic inside mirror-maze is impressionistic, not trackable. Lens holds as Accumulative/Textural, but pattern is taught too late to shape tactics.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Carnival funhouse is vividly textured—copper air, viscous syrup light, ink-spray dissolution—each sensory layer filtered through Mara’s diseased perception. Mirrors and carousel horse act as micro-setting that literally constrain movement and charge the final image. Selective detail (silver clasp on cracked bridle) is economical and purposeful. No credibility breaks; world rules stay consistent even as they tilt into nightmare logic.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“trick fear into revealing its weakness”—is signaled early but remains abstract; no concrete personal loss is risked. Escalation is imagistic (luminance thickens, horse dissolves) rather than option-narrowing; Mara never faces a fork where failure costs her anything identifiable. Single tightening is the clasp placement, but its mechanical consequence is revealed rather than chosen. Cost is conceptual (eternal beacon) but not felt on-page because no prior ordinary life is established to lose.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of fear feeding on its own reflection emerges implicitly through mirrored visuals and the advisor’s confession, avoiding overt thesis. Subtext resides in sensory degradation (sweet rot, copper taste) rather than articulated insight. Final bargain complicates the victory—beacon function serves others while cursing bearer—supplying plausible ambiguity. Resonance is dampened because “fear” remains a universal placeholder instead of a specific memory or guilt unique to Mara.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited clings tightly to Mara’s perceptual skew: “eyes flickered with…phosphorescence,” “air taste of copper and rot,” creating a distinct gothic texture. Syntax is lush but patterned—repetition of “lingering luminance,” “repulsive allure”—teaching its incantatory cadence early and holding it to the final line. No dialogue, so voice distinction test is waived; narrative diction stays within nightmare register without register drift. Psychic distance compresses under pressure, climax rendered in fragments that match sensory overload.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.5</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm is hypnotic, but metaphor density is high in every sentence of the climax beat (“ribbons of black smoke,” “nauseating aurora,” “spray of ink”) creating slight purple fog that dulls causal clarity. Several near-repeats: “repulsive allure” appears three times with identical phrasing; “lingering luminance” cycles six times—template cadence rather than escalating image. No paraphrase loops, but stacked modifiers strain (“photographically cursed rose” used as noun pile). Grammar is clean; paragraph cuts are purposeful.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Fusion of funhouse horror with dream-dictionary paradox is fresh, avoiding stock slasher tropes; cursed carousel horse feels specific rather than random quirk. Conceptual twist—fear must drink its own reflection—reweights mirror trope into philosophical trap. Risky lyric density sometimes obscures but commits fully to its nightmare logic. Not a near-echo of famous scene; voice synthesis is singular.</comment>
