<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>The archivist’s interiority is concrete—salt-stained wool, brass valve against ribs—yet never spills into self-diagnosis; his contradictory impulse to hoard silence while broadcasting memory is dramatized in the gesture of blowing a soft note that invites others to complete the chord. Micro-choices (lifting the valve, accepting the midnight summons) visibly cost him rest and solitude, earning the communal chorus that ends his exile. The arc is a credible renunciation of isolation, but because no second character shares the pier, status dynamics and relationship crucible remain theoretical; the score peaks just below the 9-band for that absent pressure-test.</comment>

<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each dock’s fragment layers density until the brass chamber’s reprise reweights the stake from private archive to communal map. Orientation lands by word 30 (“ivory harbor after rain”), causality is wave-by-wave accumulation, not because/therefore chains. Closure is a Charged Poise: the sunrise chord releases a communal meaning whose conceptual cost—no single author, no final draft—is legible in “a map of the night’s journey that no single voice could have sketched alone.” No artifact obscures the final image; the lens holds without wobble.</comment>

<comment>The harbor’s salt-glass glare, lantern flicker, and gull-clink rigging are filtered through the archivist’s librarian gaze—he notices dates etched on shells, ignores bait barrels. Brass valve as micro-setting constrains every tactic: its hollow absorbs, hums, and finally releases the collective chord that reconfigures meaning. Weather’s after-rain sheen evolves from shattered glass to amber sunrise, mirroring the shift from private grief to shared chorus. One notch down from 9 only because spatial choreography of multiple docks piles fragments without distinct body-to-body distances.</comment>

<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—can exile end if memory stays private?—tightens as each dock’s fragment forecloses the option of solitary authorship. The meaningful deepening occurs when the archivist accepts the midnight summons to retrieve a legend lost in trench darkness; this visible price (leaving the harbor’s safety) crystallizes the shift from collector to connector. Agency remains accumulative rather than decisive; the valve’s chord is invitation, not confrontation, so cost is conceptual, not visceral—sufficient for 8-band, not the 8.8+ that demands a sharper tactical loss.</comment>

<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as the impossibility of single-authored history; the sea’s silence is granted equal page-space with shanties and logs. Subtext lives in gesture—placing a child’s sun-drawing inside a military herald’s valve reweights glory as innocence without commentary. Final image’s “map that no single voice could have sketched” offers resonant, non-literal answer: meaning is collaborative or it drowns. Ambiguity lingers—who keeps the valve tomorrow?—yet avoids sermon, landing just under the 9-band where a fiercer moral risk would live.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Perceptual signature is archivist-librarian: synesthetic cataloguing—brass “smells of distant tides,” echoes settle “like a librarian turning pages.” Rhythm matches wave intervals: long sentences inhale, short fragments exhale. No dialogue, so no convergence risk; internal diction stays thrifted, never drifts into academic overkill. Under stress (“distant shout broke the quiet”) compression arrives—“he answered without hesitation”—proving rhythmic control heightens pressure without clarity loss.</comment>

<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud ear: cadence mirrors staggered dock echoes without template churn; metaphors stay maritime-consistent (glass → sponge → chord). Information density high—“lanterns flickered like fireflies, but the archivist kept his work” does three jobs in twelve words. Minor scaffold: “each new piece could shift the narrative of the whole” abstracts what we already see. No mixed metaphor, no artifact within final third; closure image remains pristine.</comment>

<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: memory-as-tide turns archival labor into a literal weather event; the brass trumpet becomes passive archive, active baton, then communal tuning fork. Risk—lyric accumulative structure rather than plot—pays off because closure chord reconfigures stakes. Specificity anchors universals: ivory harbor, salt-stained wool, child’s sun-crayon could belong to no other tale. One tick from 9 only because the trench-legend summons teases a sequel, slightly diffusing conceptual finality.</comment>
