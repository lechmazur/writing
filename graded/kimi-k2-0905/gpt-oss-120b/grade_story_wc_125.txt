<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The poet’s interiority pulses with concrete contradictions: the urge to release the fireflies vs to hoard the lantern, reverence vs playful daring. Embodied emotion shows in “shiver of rope on stone” and frayed fingers tracing murals, not diagnostic labels. Each micro-choice—knotting the rope to the jagged stone—locks to both his quest and the escaped-prisoner ghost inside the fiber, making renunciation legible and costly. Character remains individual, flawed, morally ambiguous; no tidy emotional arithmetic.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: rope bound to stone in the final breath, sealing past and future with visible luminescent cost. Accumulative/Textural lens—pattern of light/shadow and rope spirals—holds from first sentence to last, reweighting meaning without causal reversal. Orientation anchored by word 40 (“terra-cotta grotto under starlight”); no lens ambiguity. Persistent constraint: once knotted, the rope can’t be retrieved, foreclosing both poet and beings from rewriting memory.</comment>

<comment>Micro-setting—the frayed coil itself—functions as compass rose and tether, constraining the final choice; setting also charges the ending image. Terra-cotta walls, mineral glaze, amber veins are selected, tactile, integrated into tracing fingers and rope placement. Spatial choreography clear: bicycle dropped at mouth, spiral descent, final stone core. No static museum tour; sensory hierarchy obeys poet’s “listening to stones,” narrowing to touch during knotting.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: seize or surrender the rope-memory of an escaped soul; signaled early (“trade his rope for a lantern”). Escalation is accretive: each forked tunnel offers a new song, densifies stakes, re-weights rope. Final deepening at stone heart forces renunciation—binding rope relinquishes future agency. Cost legible: rope luminesces, sealing poet’s verses inside wall-grooves; no coincidence resolves tension.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from pattern-grooves: time is grainy filament that can be woven or surrendered, never possessed. Subtext in rope’s glow—history’s afterimage not owned but donated. Final image reweights premise without moralizing; reader left to feel the cost of preserved vs released memory. No thematic echo line; complexity maintained.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>Lyric, textured voice sustains throughout: “humming silhouettes,” “ethically playful grin,” “soft, grainy, humming” time. Syntax mirrors poet’s spiralling motion—long breathless clauses that tighten into final knot. Perceptual signature selective (ink-stained notebooks, electric scent) without head-hop. No filter-verb clusters; patterned repetition of “rope,” “pattern,” “echo” pays off in luminescent ripple.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Rhythm modulates—long cadence for descent, staccato at forks, hush at final knot. Sentences carry dual duty (atmosphere + causality) e.g., “frayed coil…echoing the sighs.” One minor paraphrase loop: “texture of time” repeated without new charge at very end (−0.3). Otherwise zero redundancy; no mixed metaphor; spatial tracking flawless. Opening and closing lines anchor and re-charge motif.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fusion of prison-escape rope with cosmic time-weaving feels fresh; trope of wandering poet transformed through sensory archaeology of mineral murals. Specificity—terra-cotta glaze, amber veins, electric scent—grounds abstraction. Risk in lyric accumulative structure paid off by legible closure. Inevitable in hindsight: rope must stay to let future wanderers read the map.</comment>
