<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The clock-maker’s lone-wolf interiority is vivid—his palms hum against the hunger-stone, his pulse syncs to the yoyo’s counter-spin—but we never see a contradictory impulse that could cost him the mission. The “bleak exhilaration” is declared repeatedly rather than dramatized as a value conflict (e.g., fear of erasing islanders’ fate vs. lust for authorship). Because no micro-choice visibly risks failure, the final triumph feels pre-ordained, not earned renunciation. Still, his perceptual signature is sharp enough to keep the score just below the 9+ gate that demands visible cost tied to flaw.</comment>

<comment>Causal chain is lean and legible: yoyo cipher → gear translation → stone-amplified motion → engine ignition → beacon blaze; each step because/therefore links. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the lighthouse’s new pulse rewrites coastal fate, and the price—maker’s erasure into myth, stone gone dim—is legible in the final image. Orientation anchored by word 70 (“rocky island… soaked coat”). No lens ambiguity; the story ends under the same Causal lens it opens with. The only bar to 9.0 is that the cost is more implied than viscerally felt on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Environment is never backdrop: tide exhale dictates arrival window, cliff teeth shape shadow that swallows the lantern floor, salt spray corrodes the yoyo’s copper string. The lighthouse itself is handled—floor cracked, iron teeth grinding, beam cut—so the setting directly enables/constrains each engineering beat. Micro-setting (yoyo, stone, rope-brass key) doubles as tool and tactile geography. Final image of “pulling clouds apart” recharges the rocky-cliff opening with reversed light, satisfying the 9+ gate that setting charge the closure.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—“step beyond fate’s design”—is signaled early and tightens once: when the engine coughs, the maker could still retreat, but committing the key irreversibly fuses his life story to the island’s chronicle. Visible price paid: the stone dies, the maker vanishes, islanders inherit an unasked dawn. No antagonist needed; the conflict is causal—man vs. deterministic time—escalating through each gear ratio he decodes. The tightening is single but meaningful; only the absence of a mid-course reversal keeps it from 8.8+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: the right to author others’ time is both triumph and trespass. Beacon-as-sunrise reconfigures the “low tide” fatalism into perpetual day, yet the maker’s erasure shows the cost of god-play. No moral is stated; the sailor’s whispered rumor carries the ambivalence. The yoyo’s return from toy to cosmic key is the particular that universalizes the question. Complexity is honored—hope and dread share the same pulse—earning the high band.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person voice maintains tight psychic distance, filtering every detail through the maker’s clock-work mind: tides become breaths, yoyo arcs become escapements, salt grit becomes gear grease. Syntax lengthens and contracts with the yoyo’s spin, creating rhythmic propulsion. Diction stays within a coastal tinker’s lexicon; no academic register drift. No dialogue, so voice carries all subtext. The only minor slip is the repeated noun-phrase “bleak exhilaration,” which borders on self-diagnosis, but it occurs early enough to be absorbed into the pattern.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet breathable: “latent radiance spilled onto the cracked floor like a dying star” compresses light, mortality, and spatial grounding in one image. No filter-verb clusters, no scaffold loops; each sentence either advances mechanism or sharpens atmosphere. Metaphors stay coherent—yoyo as prayer-wheel, stone as stellar conduit—without mixed collisions. Opening and closing lines act as dovetail joints, locking tide and light into circular time. A single 9+ gate requires zero artifacts; this clears, but one near-purple “mournful rhythm” keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Fusing a counter-clockwork artisan with a cipher-yoyo that programs a lighthouse is a fresh, risk-heavy synthesis of steampunk and coastal myth. The reversal of tide-as-breath into light-as-sunrise feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Specificity—rope-and-brass key, copper-tangled string—grounds the concept so it cannot be swapped into generic fantasy. The final image of mariners reading the new pulse as both salvation and omen demonstrates conceptual follow-through. Bold risk (mechanical causality told lyrically) heightens rather than obscures meaning, earning the +0.3 risk bonus.</comment>
