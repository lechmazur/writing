<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elian’s interiority is atmospheric but generic; the “lingering promise” is told rather than embodied, and his moment of choice—placing the chip—lacks micro-cost or visible hesitation. No contradictory impulses in scene; the arc is acceptance rather than struggle, so the change feels pre-ordained.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: cadence of creek-rising and ant-trails thickens texture until the corridor reconfigures meaning. Closure is a Charged Poise—Elian sees infinite paths—but the cost is conceptual, not felt; the “promise tightens like a rope” is the only on-page price and it’s abstract. Tightening is present but gentle; no option is foreclosed for Elian, only expanded.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Moss-clad village, parchment scent, amber-fissure, star-inked maps—details are selective, sensory, and filtered through Elian’s dealer gaze. The cavern and ants ground spatial choreography; creek-rise provides live metronome. Environment does not constrain tactical choice, so 9-band gate fails, but atmosphere is integral to the lyric escalation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is epistemic—will Elian locate the doorway?—but pressure plateaus once the corridor appears; no new obstacle or trade-off emerges. Escalation is poetic, not causal; the creek’s rising is metaphorical clock, not threat. Agency is observational; following ants is passive discovery rather than decision under duress.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme—maps as choosing, not chosen—emerges through the final image of endless horizons. Subtext whispers in the ants’ discipline and the chip’s brass teeth, but the story over-articulates in closing paragraphs (“the true map was not on paper”). Still, the concept reweights earlier motifs cleanly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Third-person lyric voice sustains a hushed, antiquarian cadence; diction (“moss-clad,” “starlight inked”) feels map-dealer specific. No dialogue to test, but perceptual signature is consistent. Occasional elevated register (“conceptual repricing” zone) but stays within elegaic folktale idiom.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose is lush but leans on cumulative modifiers; several sentences perform the same atmospheric job, creating micro-loop drift (“creek rises / rising creek / rising louder”). No artifact touches closure, but density slows mid-story. Metaphors stay coherent; rhythm breathes with scene beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Fusion of antiquarian cartography, ant-colony algorithm, and brass matrix chip feels fresh; the ants-as-guide trope is redeemed by micro-detail and the foundry chip’s typographic teeth. Conceptual risk—choice as map—pays off in final image without gimmickry. Specificity keeps it from lapsing into generic portal fantasy.</comment>
