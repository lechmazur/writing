<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The ex-roadie interiority is textured through sound-stage memory and tactile object handling; the “applause” ghost rings with visible cost. Flaws surface only in the late, over-articulated ledger lesson that summarizes rather than dramatizes the final shift.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as conceptual repricing: the ledger entry reweights “stage” from public lights to private conviction, cost felt in the amber dust settling. Drive lens is accumulative/textural; cadence tightens once through the compass→cloth→ledger pattern, deepening meaning without causal reversals.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Quarry trailer, amber dust, and speaker cloth form a micro-setting triad that constrains the final image; the cloth’s navy fiber reframes the quarry’s amber glow, charging the quiet encore. Spatial choreography stays clean across van→trailer→cliff line.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</question>
<comment>Dominant stake—reclaiming self-worth after televised shaming—tightens once when the cloth/ledger swap reframes “stage.” The cost is conceptual but legible: public applause is foreclosed, private appraisal embraced. No visible resource loss, so 8.0 cap applies.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</question>
<comment>Theme emerges from the cloth→ledger motif: value is re-appraised inward, not outward. The valley echo reweights applause into self-echo, avoiding moralizing. Minor deduction for the explicit “true stage” sentence that briefly states the thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</question>
<comment>First-person voice carries roadie diction—“sling speaker boxes,” “snare drums”—with rhythmic compression. No head-hop; perceptual signature stays sonic-tactile. One register drift: “conceptual repricing” lexicon exceeds narrator’s idiom, but it occupies a single beat.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</question>
<comment>Varied sentence rhythm, high density, zero paraphrase loops. Figurative control holds; mixed metaphor risk in “cymbal of possibility” but pays off acoustically. Filter-verb count low; amber/cloth color pairing is purposeful, not decorative.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</question>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: quarry + antiques + roadie nostalgia. Risk taken in lyric accumulative structure rather than plot reversal; pays off in reweighted final image. Slight proximity to “echo valley” trope keeps it below 8.0.</question>
