<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The dresser’s motives—prove the garden rewards caretakers—stay consistent, but interiority stays ornamental (“the paradox of blooming withering settle in his bones”) rather than dramatized. No contradictory impulse is forced into live choice; he simply keeps polishing. The micro-choice hierarchy is asserted, not shown under threat. Closure earns mild poignancy yet no new self-knowledge is wrested at cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens chosen; the piece teaches its lyric-repetitive cadence early and lands a Charged Poise: garden acknowledges keeper, dew-like recognition felt on skin. Orientation is clear within 120 words; no penalty. Causal linkage is loose—“garden responds” by magic rather than because/therefore—but permissible under the lyric-accumulative mode. Cost is atmospheric, not specific, keeping score below 7.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Sensory triage is selective: cracked marbles, breathing hedge, moss voice—each filtered through gardener’s tactile priority. Garden maze functions as body-scale tool; its walls shift proximity and guide next polish, satisfying 9+ gate. Spatial choreography stays clean; no impossible positions. A few metaphor piles (“marbles shone like a tiny sun”) momentarily over-decorate without constraining choice, preventing 8-band entry.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—garden recognition—is declared early; pressure deepens through iterative polishing that unveils new paths. Escalation is poetic accretion, not option-narrowing; no concrete resource lost or deadline imposed. Cost remains diffuse (acceptance of decay) rather than viscerally felt on page. Sufficient for sub-7 lyric piece but lacks the visible price that would push higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of reciprocity between caretaker and living system emerges imagistically, never sermonized. Marbles evolve from broken promises to solar path-finders, re-weighting “mended deception” without explicit label. Final fountain-naming offers quiet conceptual repricing of humble labor. Ambiguity lingers: garden may still wilt despite pact, giving complexity beyond moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Third-person lyric voice sustains rhythmic litany (“polished…whispered…twined”) that feels gardener-appropriate; no head-hop. Perceptual signature relies on garden-as-body metaphor, slightly over-familiar yet consistent. Sentence cadence varies through participial openers and breath-unit fragments that mirror maze pulse. Dialogue absent; no penalty.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm is hypnotic but template cadence repeats (“He… He… Each…” runs) without pattern-payoff, docking −0.4. Mixed metaphors (“blooming withering symphony”) coexist with precise moss-voice image. Density remains high; no scaffolding sentences. One paraphrase loop (“each polished marble would carry… each shine a salute”) noted. Closure line avoids artifact, keeping cap at bay.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Fusion of luck-metrics and sentient garden is fresh, yet “maze that breathes with keeper” nods to longstanding eco-fantasy trope. Ritual polishing of cracked orbs becomes specific through gardener’s patient choreography, avoiding mere quirk. Conceptual repricing of humility over trickery lands gently but distinctly. Risk level moderate; no structural gamble beyond lyric repetition.</comment>
