<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The “dirty-ledger” past is vivid, but the promised internal contradiction (dirty vs. clean) never collides in a single pressured micro-choice; the mirror moment shows a teary alt-self yet the narrator’s embodied reaction is summary, not a visible renunciation that costs him something on the spot. Empathy remains an abstract want; no beat forces him to choose between self-interest and another being’s immediate pain, so the motivational engine idles rather than revs.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—ball sunk, lake brightens, empathy seeded—visible cost is the act of relinquishing the talisman, reweighting the premise. Causal chain is thin: newspaper clues arrive as lyrical floaters, not because/therefore triggers; the mirror choice is purely receptive, not a fork that forecloses an alternate path. Still, the final image cleanly reconfigures meaning under an Accumulative lens, satisfying the 9- gate for Q2.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Bioluminescent cathedral, kelp-cluster, brass-framed mirror—selective sensory triad that constrains movement and stages the final image. Spatial choreography holds across the dive, crate, tunnel, pedestal sequence; no floating rooms. Lake’s glow pulses in rhythm with heartbeat at exit, charging the closure beat; meets 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—spark empathy—signaled early; pressure deepens only once, at mirror, but that moment is observational, not a tightening that narrows live options. Cost is conceptual (own reflection) rather than felt on-page; escalation is lyric accumulation, not causal squeeze. Sufficient for this length, but not the sharper 8.8 band that demands a visceral trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through mirror-refracted alt-self and bioluminescent response to tossed relic—empathy as seed, not sermon. Avoids final-paragraph moralizing; last line is image-driven resonance. Slight abstraction keeps it from 8.5+ territory, but complexity and ambiguity hold.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lush, rhythm-controlled lyricism—“phosphorescent cathedral,” “jagged fragments of dirty past”—sustains a consistent jaded-wonder idiom without purple overload. Perceptual signature filters every detail through post-procedure, memory-wiped eyes; no head-hop. Compression taught early and paid off in final heartbeat-glow cadence; meets 9- quick test.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Sentence variety and sonic layering propel the read-aloud ear; only minor filter-verb clusters (“felt oddly comforting”) dull immediacy. No paraphrase loops or mixed metaphors; figurative language stays coherent. Density high—most lines do double duty. Artifacts minor, do not touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Time-traveler souvenir baseball + bioluminescent empathy cavern offers a fresh synthesis; tropes are inverted (souvenir discarded to seed feeling). Conceptual commitment is full, no late rule changes. Specificity of “newspaper lines floating like ghostly headlines” gives memorable texture. Risk is moderate; not radically avant-garde but sufficiently non-obvious.</comment>
