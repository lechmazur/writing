<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>Amelia’s interiority is lyrical but stays safely in reflective summary; the “broken-hearted” label is repeated rather than dramatized through contradictory on-page choices. The micro-choice of placing the button on the ledger is the only moment where motive visibly alters action; no later choice is similarly tested. Emotional cost is asserted (“heart still broken”) rather than embodied in a visible trade-off at closure. Earned stasis is hinted but not dramatized with a price on the page.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the button’s glow reweights the archive’s meaning and forecloses Amelia’s detachment. Causality, however, is soft: sunlight angle and dust choreography arrive as lucky external choreography rather than because/therefore chains she triggers. Orientation is clear by line 3; no lens ambiguity. The non-closure flaw is the lack of a visible cost paid by Amelia inside the final beat—her stance crystallizes but we do not feel what she forfeits or risks.</comment>

<comment>The file room is evoked through dust motes, ledger spines, and the button’s metallic glint—tactile, biased to Amelia’s archivist gaze. Spatial choreography remains stable; bodies and objects track cleanly across the single scene. The button qualifies as micro-setting that constrains choice (it must be placed to catch light) and charges the final image. One minor lapse: “oak desk” and “high windows” are stock placeholders that could be sharper.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—recovering silenced children’s stories—signals early and tightens once when the button’s silhouette reveals blanked records. Amelia’s agency is gentle attention rather than risk; no concrete price (job security, emotional safety) is tested. Escalation is textural: dust patterns accumulate, silhouettes deepen, but the lens is situational pressure without narrowing options. The final image reconfigures meaning but is not preceded by a trade-off that could be lost.</comment>

<comment>Theme of archival resurrection emerges organically from dust, light, and silhouettes—never sermonized. Subtext operates through visual metaphor: the button’s polished center literalizes “small kindness” persisting inside tarnish. Final image reframes prior neglect as future beacon without moralizing. One soft spot: “Acts of Compassion” file label edges toward thesis-statement; slight dip for that.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited sustains a hushed, elegiac register consistent with an archivist who listens to paper. Perceptual signature is strong: Amelia notices catalog numbers, dust vectors, metallic sheen—never touristic filler. Syntax lengthens in calmer beats, contracts under discovery, mirroring attention. No dialogue, so voice distinction and status dynamics bullets are N/A; internal voice stays coherent and specific.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is lyrical but disciplined: no paraphrase loops, no template cadence. Metaphors are spare and coherent (“dust unfurling like a silent flag”). One mixed image: “weight…press the unseen narratives into sharper relief” is abstract without physical corollary. Density remains high; each sentence advances either atmosphere or discovery—no scaffolding.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Premise—an archive that breathes lost stories through button-projection—is fresh yet inevitable in hindsight. Button-as-lens repurposes a mundane relic into epistemic tool without exotic tech. Risk is taken with quiet accumulation rather than plot twists; coherence never falters. Could edge higher if the button’s transformative rule were signaled earlier as a constraint rather than discovered as grace.</comment>
