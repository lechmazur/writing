<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Motivation is present but abstract: “to seed innovation within a constraint” is stated, never dramatized as a craving or fear. Interiority drifts into thematic labels (“true mastery lay in embracing what one does not know”) rather than moment-by-moment contradiction. Only one micro-choice—traced arrows on the lattice—earns causal weight; the rest is summary. No cost or flaw complicates his victory; he ends unchanged.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the kingdom’s future is “already inscribed” because modeling rewrote reality, a cleanly legible before/after. Causal chain survives: lattice → crystal contraption → forecast → blueprint → harvest; each step is present on the page. Orientation is established by 120 words; no lens ambiguity. Cost is conceptual, not felt—no personal price for the cartographer—so the high-band 9+ gate stays locked.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Obsidian spire, frozen lake, aurora, copper plates—details are sensory, selective, and tied to action. The lake surface as “mirror for the unknown” and the barley “reflecting the spire’s obsidian sheen” charge the final image. Micro-setting (kingfisher quill, copper mirrors) constrains tactics directly. A single anachronistic phrase—“solar collector”—lightly jars but is cued early enough.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prevent famine—is declared early; pressure tightens when the model forecasts three threats, forcing the invention of frost-barley and aurora mirrors. Escalation is intellectual, not visceral; the cartographer’s personal risk never appears, so cost is social, not felt. Agency is continuous—each diagram stroke feeds the crystal—meeting causal-lens demand. Closure resolves the kingdom’s stake, not the protagonist’s, capping high-band entry.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: ignorance as navigable terrain, futures writable by disciplined imagination. Subtext resides in the kingfisher quill’s iridescence—beauty weaponized into data—and in the barley’s golden echo of obsidian. No explicit moral; final image of “bright horizon of a transformed people” reweights the opening void. Prompt-echo phrase “groundedly imaginative” is used once without sermonizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Third-person lyric distance is stable; diction favors precise nouns (“obsidian spire,” “silverfish surge”) and rhythmic parallelism that mimics cartographic layering. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk zero. Perceptual signature—mapping mind that sees gaps everywhere—persists to last line. Filter-free immediacy; metaphors stay inside POV’s plausible lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and musical; most sentences carry double duty (image + causality). Occasional template cadence (“its surface a mirror… its frozen lake reflecting”) keeps it from 9-band. No mixed metaphors or synonym loops. Opening and closing lines anchor and recharge motif cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Fusion of mythic cartography with predictive modeling feels fresh; barley rows as “silent promise” and aurora-as-power-source are specific, irreplaceable images. Premise flips standard prophecy trope into data-driven world-building. Risk stays integrated; no gimmickry. Could edge higher if personal cost had bitten the cartographer.</comment>
