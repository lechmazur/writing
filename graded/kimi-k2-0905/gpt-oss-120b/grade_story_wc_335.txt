<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The archivist’s “mentor resilience quietly” motive is vivid and embodied—her backward walk, the combative tenderness—but the interior contradiction between retreat and guardianship is asserted more than dramatized in a single beat; the final stance crystallizes with felt cost, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the dissolved shadow heals the walls, reversing exile with visible conceptual cost; the Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each tea-leaf annotation adds density until the cadence shift at noon fractures the glass—no因果 breaks, no orientation debt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dust as “ancient whispers,” the cracked window swing, the pentagon of tea leaves—selective sensory triangulation anchors every beat; the afternoon-shadow-in-glass object directly constrains the final healing, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“will the library stay exiled?”—tightens via each decoded leaf pattern; the pentagon’s appearance forecloses retreat and forces the final alignment; cost is legible as the shadow’s destruction, though pressure escalates only once, sufficient for this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of “quiet mentorship as resistance” emerges through the mosaic of shards and the lullaby geometry; no overt thesis, but the final whispered vow reweights earlier exile into pilgrimage, offering resonant ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Lyric, hushed diction mirrors the archivist’s cataloguing mind; patterned elision (“reversible exile,” “combative tenderness”) is taught early and paid off in the final image; no head-hopping, stable psychic distance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and rhythm; figurative language is dense but purposeful, never clogging the high-stakes noon beat; only minor scaffold—“the combative tenderness of the moment” is repeated within four lines—stopping short of 9+.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The tea-leaf geometry decoding reversible exile feels fresh; risk-taking in lyric accumulation heightens meaning without obscuring clarity; the shard-mirror archivist is particular, not archetypal.</comment>
