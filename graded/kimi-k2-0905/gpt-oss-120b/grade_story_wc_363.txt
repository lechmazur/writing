<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is lyrical but general—“latent sacrifice settle in her bones” tells rather than embodies. No contradictory impulse is staged in scene; the quiet acceptance is declared, not dramatized. The final renunciation is credible because the story’s lyric spell prepares us, yet the cost is more asserted than felt on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each puzzle-click and light-filament adds density rather than causal turn. Closure is a Charged Poise—the silver thread’s arrival reconfigures meaning with undeniable conceptual cost (her spent glow). Orientation anchors arrive late (~130 w) but serve the dream-logic, so waiver applies. No meaningful escalation under this lens is required; the deepening pattern suffices.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Bamboo, dew-slick soil, and amber reflections are vividly selective and POV-filtered. The orchard’s micro-pathways constrain movement and charge the final filament launch. Spatial choreography is clean; bodies and puzzle pieces track. Environment directly shapes the climactic act, satisfying the 9+ gate for constraining choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—send the bead’s message—is clear early. Tightening occurs when the filament’s stretch spends her glow, but the price is more lyrical than tactical; options were never visibly wide. Escalation is textural (density of light and sound) rather than causal narrowing; acceptable under Accumulative lens yet keeps score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of sacrifice-as-loom emerges through recurring weave/silk imagery rather than statement. Final image of orchard glowing with “memory of the amber bead” offers resonant non-literal answer. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers. The motif of weaving gains weight, but amber bead itself could have reprised to deepen reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person lyric maintains consistent psychic distance; diction stays within plausible folkloric register. Syntax elongates and contracts with breath of description—no drumbeat patterns. Perceptual signature is biased toward textile and light imagery, giving a distinct texture. No dialogue to test voice divergence; internal cadence is secure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythm modulates from long botanical sentences to short filament clauses, supporting momentum. Figurative language is dense but patterned early (“loom of absence”) so reads as taught texture, not overwrite. One paraphrase loop—“stoically sparkling” repeated twice within four lines—triggers −0.2. Otherwise high density without scaffold; closure image clear.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Combining jigsaw puzzle edges as map, loom metaphysics, and sap-amber compass creates a fresh synthesis. Silence-as-unweaving is not new, but its instrumentalization through tactile puzzle-click is. Specificity of orchard-bamboo micro-path keeps concept grounded. Risk taken with lyric accretive structure holds without clarity loss.</comment>
