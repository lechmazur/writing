<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lira’s interiority is sensorially rich and profession-specific; her micro-choices (spreading maps, whispering commands, raising the shard) are concrete and consequential. The final renunciation—shattering the shard to awaken the crew—pays the emotional cost promised by her quest for truth. Flaw: the “weight of withheld truth” is stated more than it is felt in her body; still, embodied cues (maps pulsing like bridges) keep the score in high band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Decisive Change: the shard fractures, realities merge, crew awakens, truth is released—felt cost is the shard’s loss and Lira’s acceptance of a changed universe. Causal linkage holds: shard redirect ➔ slit opens ➔ parallel bay found ➔ log revealed ➔ cycle broken. Minor waver: the log’s catastrophic-engine-failure reveal is delivered in one summarized sentence; still, the final image reconfigures meaning with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The repair bay is never a postcard: rusted hulls whisper, flickering fluorescents bleed, cracked floor embeds the shard—details are filtered through Lira’s cartographer gaze and constrain her movements. Spatial choreography is flawless across the two-reality shift; bodies hover in coherent suspension. The shard itself functions as micro-setting that charges the final image when it dissolves into star-specks.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—freeing the frozen crew by uncovering the evacuation lie—is signaled early and tightened when Lira realizes only the elite were saved. One meaningful deepening: the sealed log flickers into view only after she uses the shard to redirect sensory flow—this narrows her moral options to “break cycle or leave them frozen.” Cost is legible: shard’s destruction and the bay’s dissolution are the price of truth. Agency is continuous; coincidence plays no role.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges without sermon: truth as a lattice one must weave between worlds to release, not a jewel to own. The green shard’s refracted light and the final star-drift reweight the idea that knowledge becomes bearable only when shared. No character articulates a moral; the image of awakening bodies against dissolving glass carries the resonance. Minor abstraction in “promise rather than task” line is forgiven because it crystallizes rather than summarizes.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is lyric-scientific, compressed yet sensorial: “cartographic ribbons,” “glass-bottle breath.” Syntax stays within a sensory-map-maker’s lexicon; no register drift. Rhythmic control peaks at closure—short clauses mimic shard fracture. Repetition of “cyclically spontaneous” is the only near-template, but the phrase is pattern-taught early and paid off in the final pulse, so it reads as motif, not artifact.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>High information density: one sentence often does three jobs—world, body, metaphor—without clogging. No scaffold loops; each sentence advances map, shard, or crew. Metaphors stay internally consistent (light, weaving, lattice). Proofreading clean. Only micro-tick: two adjacent “whisper” uses 23 words apart; not enough to dull momentum or touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The sensory-cartographer/protave premise is fresh, and the shard-as-needle pointing to moral knots avoids standard portal tropes. Synthesis feels inevitable: mapping perception ➔ mapping truths ➔ mapping universes. Risk in second-person-address-like murmur is purposeful and paid off in final “promise” line. Specificity of “rusted hulls whispering under flickering fluorescents” keeps the abandoned-port trope from generic echo.</comment>
