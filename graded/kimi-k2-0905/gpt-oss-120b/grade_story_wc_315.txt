<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Interiority is lush and embodied; the seeker’s grief-guilt around the buckle is visceral. Yet the contradictory impulse (stay vs descend) is summarized rather than enacted in-scene, softening the final choice. Micro-choices (knot sequence, harness test) are vivid but isolated; no secondary character pressure tests his values live. Still, the arc of bearing responsibility lands with felt cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Earned Stasis: the revised harness becomes a tactile promise that forecloses retreat, cost visible in the metal bite. Causal chain holds—storm loss → climb → revise → static answer—tightened by the “hold fast” pulse. One soft spot: the radio phrase arrives as lucky grace, not earned reversal, slightly diluting agency. Orientation anchors by ~100 words; lens (Situational pressure → crystallized stance) holds throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>“Nocturnal arbor above clouds” is atmospherically rich yet never drifts into postcard; every leaf-fall or wind-shift guides his knot-tying rhythm. The moss-dulled buckle functions as micro-setting that constrains the final choice—failure would snap trust. Spatial choreography is pristine: branch to ground tracked without drift. Environmental detail mirrors internal weight without overt symbolism, charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“preserve trust under pressure”—is signaled early and tightens when the rope must hold lives. Revision sequence is the single meaningful deepening that narrows option from abstract duty to concrete knot. Pressure is coherent but plateau-locked; no secondary reversal raises cost after the storm cue. Cost is legible in the buckle bite, satisfying the 8-band gate.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of custodial trust emerges through tactile particulars (buckle, vine, static) rather than statement. Final image of silhouette against dawn reweights prior silence into covenant without moralizing. Some risk of thematic echo in “watcher’s burden” phrasing, yet it remains character-bound. Subtext in the crew’s silent gratitude deepens resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person lyric maintains perceptual signature: wind as metronome, leaves as confetti—choices feel organic to the seeker’s pattern-seeking mind. Syntax modulates with altitude: longer coils aloft, clipped staccato on descent. No head-hop; psychic distance stays tight. Register never drifts above the character’s lived lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Figurative density is high but patterned early (“cathedral of leaves”) and paid off in the closing confetti, avoiding clutter. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image, muscle motion, or stakes. Occasional elevated flourish (“soundless echo”) risks purple yet stays in-character. Rhythm breathes with climb-descent trajectory, propelling to buckle-bite close.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Sky-forest above clouds is fresh terrain; harness revision via muscle memory as covenant ritual feels non-obvious. Tropes (lone watcher, storm isolation) are re-bodied through arboreal vertigo and tactile metal. Could push further—radio static as cosmic Morse is familiar. Still, synthesis of botany, aviation relic, and trust ethic is memorable.</comment>
