<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The gardener’s interiority is poetic but thin; intentions are declared (“to discover the shape of intentions”) yet never tested by opposition. His single micro-choice—slipping the map into the case—reads as fait accompli rather than pressured decision. No contradictory impulse or visible cost forecloses a path; the blithe affect stays static.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the circle traced on the map reweights memory into seed, with felt cost in the dust-applause. Causality is lyric-associative (Accumulative/Textural lens); pattern taught early via tapestry threads. One hitch: the chess-clock image is dropped but never ticks or tightens options; it’s decorative, not causal.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Cobalt silo, sovereign case, and tapestry function as micro-settings that constrain handling (compartments reshape for parchment). Velveteen gloom is sustained through tactile diction (“soft darkness that wrapped each stone”). Starlight-to-drumbeat transmutation charges the final image. Spatial choreography clean; no white-room syndrome.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“shape of intentions”—is announced early but remains abstract; no visible price is paid or path foreclosed. Pressure accumulates imagistically rather than through narrowing options; escalation is atmospheric, not tactical. Because lens is Accumulative, this suffices, yet the lack of a trade-off keeps tension muted.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: intention as circular seed, not weapon. Final image reconfigures premise without moralizing. Recurrent motifs (circle, seed, case) reweight at closure; ambiguity lingers credibly. Avoids explicit thesis; insight is earned through concrete ritual.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person lyric voice maintains perceptual signature: selective attention to brass hinges, filament tug, dust applause. Syntax modulates with cadence—long breathless sentences for nocturnal hush, clipped final line for dawn. No head-hopping; distance stable. Diction stays within poetic gardener lexicon; no register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High figurative density risks purple overload (“velveteen gloom,” “cobalt silo under stars”) but pattern is taught early and pays off at finale. No mixed metaphors; each image reappears to reweight meaning. Minor template cadence in “he… then he…” sequence (−0.2). Final line ear-tests strong; closure image unblurred.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: cemetery noir meets cartographic ghost-story. Sovereign case as portable memory-archive feels specific, not gimmick. Circle-as-seed reconfiguration avoids trope repetition. Risky lyric escalation works under Accumulative lens; novelty resides in imagistic system rather than plot twist.</comment>
