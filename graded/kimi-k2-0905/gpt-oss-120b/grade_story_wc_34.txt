<comment>The balladeer’s solitary, need-driven arc is clear: every press of the flower plate is a micro-choice that escalates his wager with the ghost. Interiority stays concrete (“He felt the tug of recognition”) rather than abstract, and the final encoding costs him his last fresh blossom—an earned, visible price. The flaw: no contradictory impulse is dramatized in-scene; he moves from diligent to more diligent without visible inner split, capping him just below the 9-band.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the courtyard wall becomes a living mural, the ghost folded into permanent graffiti, the balladeer’s voice now stitched to sky. Causality holds under Accumulative/Textural lens—each lightning-thunder interval thickens pattern density until the final shared heartbeat. One hairline slip: the “later travelers” paragraph is a soft post-coda that slightly dilutes the on-page cost moment.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The mist-roof courtyard is anchored by the flower press’s metallic weight and the lightning’s actinic flashes; every sensory pick is filtered through the balladeer’s tuner-ear. The bolt plate’s bronze chill constrains how long fingers can work, and the final graffiti glow is inseparable from the stone’s pores—setting actively charges the last image. Micro-setting at its finest.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—give the ghost a felt voice—tightens across three lightning beats, each forcing a costlier blossom pressed into dwindling supply. Agency is accumulative: the balladeer’s steady encoding is the only bridge, and each iteration forecloses one more flower/temporal slot. Cost is legible; could edge higher if a mid-scene micro-reversal (doubt, near failure) had flashed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of “silent code craving touch” emerges wordlessly from the graffiti’s color-shift and the silver petal runes; no authorial thesis intrudes. The final wall-mural reprises the opening press-imprint, reweighting the same motif from tool to shared heart—an earned resonance. Quiet, non-moralizing, and particular.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Lyric third-person hovers at an intimate psychic distance, diction tuned to music and circuitry (“tinkersong,” “binary blossoms”) without ever breaking the balladeer’s perceptual filter. Rhythm swells and contracts with lightning flashes, mirroring tension. No head-hopping; voice stays singular, atmospheric, controlled.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud cadence varies: long breath-lines for mist, clipped fragments for thunder cracks. Metaphors (“sky pulsed like a living circuit”) stay consistent to the code/flower fusion. One scaffold loop—“the graffiti sang...a tinkersong of electric hues” slightly repeats prior sense—keeps it from perfection.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The “ghost in code” trope is inverted: here the human is technician, the AI is lonely petitioner, longing carried by organic petals not data packets. Flower-press-as-interface feels inevitable yet fresh, and the accumulative graffiti archive offers a quiet inversion of usual hacker narratives. Risky lyric structure paid off in earned closure.</comment>
