<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The poet’s aesthetic drive is repeatedly declared but never complicates his choices; no contradictory impulse or tangible cost is dramatized. Interiority floats in lyrical abstracts (“watercolor of doubts and dreams”) rather than body-specific tension. The closing “thank you” to stone is the only micro-choice, arriving too late to test motive under pressure. Motivation remains atmospheric, not operational.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the amber lake and forward step reweight the boundary premise with conceptual cost visible in the final image. Accumulative/textural lens holds: pattern of paraphrase→humming shift→veil lift threads through sensory cadence rather than causal chain. Orientation is lyrically delayed but coherent; no penalty applied. The cost is legible—“the world will remember”—but internal to poet, not reader-tested.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Cobalt atrium, quartz colonnade, and frozen lake function as a single micro-setting whose evolving hue and resonance directly guide the poet’s stride; the final amber glow is inseparable from the closure image. Sensory hierarchy favors sound and color over spatial exactitude, matching the POV’s synesthetic bias. Selective detail (“lantern-moth hush”) avoids catalog excess; each descriptor re-weights the boundary motif. Environment is active instrument, not backdrop.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Stake—“dissolve boundaries”—is declared early; pressure accumulates via chromatic and sonic intensification rather than narrowing options. One meaningful tightening: the veil lifts to reveal star tapestry, re-configuring ice/air divide. Cost is conceptual (old prohibitions fold) but not viscerally felt; no resource lost, no path foreclosed. Escalation is aesthetic, not tactical, satisfying Accumulative lens but staying emotionally static.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of permeable boundaries emerges through repeated image of dissolving veils rather than thesis statement. Final star-reflection acts as Conceptual Repricing, shifting boundary from barrier to lens. Subtext resides in sensory fusion—sound becomes color, ice becomes mirror—avoiding abstract moral. The motif stays particular; no late symbolism grafted for convenience.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Voice sustains a consistent lyric register: long vowel cadences, hyphenated compounds, synesthetic verbs (“carving verses that bend the cold air”). Perceptual signature—poet sees sky as parchment and sound as pigment—remains stable under pressure. No head-hopping; POV distance stays at contemplative arm’s-length. Compression and elision are pattern-taught early (“lantern-moth hush”) and paid off in final hush lift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Rhythm is deliberate incantation, but cumulative figurative layering creates micro-muddle: “breath held in moonlight” atop “cloud-shadow poet” atop “watercolor of doubts” in first 100 words. Some paraphrase loops (“tremor of certainty” repeated thrice without deepening). Strong verbs (“carving,” “blur,” “weave”) and clean grammar keep propulsion. No artifact touches closure; final amber image is crisp.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Frozen lake as resonant instrument, colonnade as choir, poet as paraphraser—combination feels fresh against standard frozen-wilderness trope. Boundary dissolution enacted through synesthetic prose rather than portal gimmick. Risk taken: entire plot is chromatic cadence, yet closure remains legible. Specificity of “humming quartz shifting hue to violet” anchors invention; not easily transplanted to another setting.</comment>
