<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Mara’s “forgiving skeptic” duality is shown in her tactile, reverent handling of the tooth, but interiority drifts into lyrical paraphrase (“constellations of redemption”) rather than moment-to-moment contradiction under pressure. The bone-setting motif is embodied in the spine-alignment sequence, yet the emotional cost is stated (“cold certainty”) rather than felt through bodily contradiction or risk. A credible micro-choice—placing the tooth—earns a modest shift, but the arc leans on summary rather than compounding mistakes that narrow options.</comment>

<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: the single scene’s lyric repetitions (“shrewdly innocent” ×3, “cleft” ×3) build a cadence that peaks when the glowing tooth seeds the garden’s “embryonic galaxy.” Closure—Charged Poise—lands as Mara exits with the re-energized tooth; conceptual cost (she now carries a live fragment of the scholar’s erased life) is legible. Orientation is clear by line 5; no causal reversals, yet the density shift reweights belief. Minor scaffold loop keeps it below 7.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Garden-as-body micro-setting succeeds: the “hollow where ribs should be” fuses setting and anatomy, constraining the literal repair. Midnight perfume, moss cradle, and hedge exhale are filtered through Mara’s bone-setter gaze, each detail pacing her tactile sequence. Spatial choreography stays clean across kneel-lift-exit moves. The tooth’s glassy curve and galaxy pulse satisfy the 9+ gate by charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—restoring a displaced soul—signaled early. Pressure tightens once: vertebra click → galaxy bloom narrows certainty into belief. The cost is conceptual (she shoulders an unasked-for cosmic burden) rather than tactile loss, keeping intensity lyrical but still felt. No antagonist or reversal beyond the single alignment moment; sufficient for 600-word lyric mode.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the reversal of bone-setting: instead of fixing a living patient, Mara implants alien life into a dead shell, turning her redemptive craft into star-mapping. Subtext lingers in the tooth’s borrowed pulse—salvation may itself be an act of appropriation. Final marginal note is a touch explanatory but brief enough to retain resonance. Complexity survives: skeptic and believer coexist without moral ledger.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Compressed lyric voice sustains a consistent perceptual signature—bone-click as “note in a forgotten symphony,” galaxy spreading through roots. Repetition of “shrewdly innocent” functions as patterned litany rather than tic, taught by second use. No dialogue; free-indirect diction stays within Mara’s plausible lexicon. Rhythm accelerates across vertebra clicks, matching escalation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.1</question>
<comment>High metaphor density in every sentence risks purple overload, but images stay coherent (garden-galaxy-body) and propel rather than stall. One paraphrase loop: “shrewdly innocent eyes” / “hands, still shrewdly innocent” within 30 words (−0.2). Otherwise clean grammar, strong verbs, varied paragraph shapes. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with the garden’s inhale/exhale framing.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</question>
<comment>Familiar trope—secret garden, changeling tooth—is re-angled through orthopedic cosmology: a bone-setter realigns a spine with alien dentition to map guilt into stars. Nostalgic innovation tone fuses with lyric repetitions to create a fresh cadence rather than mere quirk. Conceptual commitment never wavers; ending image re-weights “mistakes as dark matter” without retreat. Risk distinction +0.2 for turning a dental relic into an astral vertebra.</comment>
