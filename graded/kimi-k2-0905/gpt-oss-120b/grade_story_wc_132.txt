<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Interiority is lush and botanically precise; the “circuitously sincere” smile is a smart, specificizing hook. The single contradiction—curiosity vs. humility—runs throughout and pays off in the final whispered promise. Micro-choices (coil placement, later greenhouse bowl) are visible, but the middle beat of simply “watching” lets agency wobble. Closure cost is present yet diffuse; a sharper bodily or relational forfeiture would have nailed 9-band.</comment>

<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of release/nudge repeats until chlorophyll unfurls, reweighting meaning. Orientation clean by line 3; transitions are single-scene dissolves, not shards. Closure is a Charged Poise: “promise to keep watching” crystallizes stance with conceptual cost—his science will stay humble. Minor slack: middle beats (storm as metronome, “documented”) feel additive rather than intensifying.</comment>

<comment>The mossy trellis and copper coil function as micro-setting that literally conducts the fungal bridge; environment is tool. Dew-beaded glass greenhouse returns to recharge the same image-set, constraining the final expansion of saplings. Sensory triangulation (cool copper, ozone air, refracted droplets) is botanist-specific and never catalogues. Spatial choreography stays tight: coil → ferns → leaf underside → mycelial filament.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: will the leaf surrender its amber resistance? Pressure escalates via fungal contact and storm-season cadence; options narrow to wait-or-interfere, then crystallize into pure watchfulness. Cost is legible as forfeiture of control and time, but remains conceptual; a tangible resource loss (tools, data, nursery stock) would deepen 8-band. Still, the final image of new saplings under bowls reweights the stake cleanly.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as “sustainable growth demands relinquished control,” enacted through coil, storms, and leaf instead of lecturing. Copper coil and reluctant greening recur with shifting valence—first intervention, then conduit, finally relic of learned humility. Final image of greenhouse mist reprises rain-on-trellis but reconfigures scale (nursery → world), supplying non-literal answer. Avoids sermon; only the mentor line flirts with articulation yet stays inside dramatized memory.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person close maintains botanist’s perceptual signature: light refracts like “tiny prisms,” rain leaves a “cool sheen.” Syntax lengthens during observation, then tightens into heartbeat-metronome staccato, mirroring storm rhythm. No dialogue, so cadence and diction carry the load; voice never drifts into textbook tone. Filter verbs appear (“seemed to breathe”) but read as warranted humility, not leakage.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm alternates between luxuriant clause-strings for drizzle and clipped fragments for thunder. Metaphors stay botanic-electric (ozone, filament, conduit) without cross-contamination. Two paraphrase loops (“circuitously sincere” x2, “reluctant metamorphosis” x2) nudge toward template cadence but fall outside final third; no clarity lost. Opening and closing lines are image-anchored, propulsive, loop-free.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses plant electro-culture with humility ethics—fresh synthesis rather than eco-memoir trope. Copper coil as gentle surrender-tool re-casts familiar “nature heals” into specific, low-tech science. Risk lies in quiet ending, but Charged Poise legitimizes stance-crystallization over spectacle. Could tip into 9+ with sharper personal stakes (mentor’s death, nursery solvency) to intensify cost beyond conceptual.</comment>
