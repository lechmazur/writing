<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Immortal’s boredom is vivid, but interiority drifts into lyric abstraction (“centuries of ennui”) rather than embodied contradiction. The final shift from apathy to purpose is declared, not dramatized through micro-choices; the amulet acts on him more than he acts on it. No visible cost or flaw complicates the epiphany, so the arc feels gifted rather than earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: goodbye reframed as spatial pivot, dust motes carrying felt cost. Causal chain is thin—amulet magnetically “tugs” and he simply follows—yet the accumulative pattern of corridors and mirrored self supplies enough textural linkage to satisfy the lens. Orientation is swift; spatial rules remain consistent. Still, the decisive change is 90% realization, 10% agency, capping the score.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Escondite cavern, magnetic seams, and prismatic light are tactile, selective, and filter through the POV’s mineral-obsessed gaze. The shifting corridor lattice physically constrains his path, integrating setting with stakes. Storm and ozone serve as temporal clock without overwhelming. A hairline slip: “vista of swirling corridors” is visual shorthand after richer earlier detail.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will he confront finality?—is signaled early. Pressure escalates texturally: each corridor adds density of farewell echoes, narrowing emotional options. However, no active trade-off or irreversible choice is dramatized; the climax is passive reception of insight. Cost is conceptual (loss of emptiness) rather than tangible, limiting escalation bandwidth.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: goodbye as dimensional fold, not termination. Subtext resides in magnetic dust and mirrored older self, avoiding explicit moral. Final reweighting is elegant, but the lyric overlay (“something persisted beyond it”) flirts with abstraction. Still, ambiguity feels earned, not asserted.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is crystalline, mineral, and consistent: “prismatic escondite,” “spatial mutiny,” “chilled promise” all belong to an immortal who thinks in facets and fields. Syntax lengthens and contracts with magnetic pulses, creating rhythmic propulsion. No head-hopping; perceptual signature remains singular. One template cadence cluster—“the… the… the…” in corridor list—drops it from 9.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet read-aloud musical; metaphors stay geologic and coherent. No synonym loops or scaffold. A single mixed vehicle—“heart of misplaced destiny” (organic/abstract)—slips through. Information load is high but justified by accumulative design. Final dust image is precise, not overwritten.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Folding goodbye into Euclidean-defying corridors feels fresh; the immortal confronting his own spectral curator is a lovely inversion. Tropes of cursed artifact and eternal boredom are transmuted through mineral poetics. Conceptual risk is moderate; execution keeps it from gimmick. Could push further if the spatial rule-set had sharper limits.</comment>
