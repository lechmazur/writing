<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interiority is textured—stone warmth, sky-mapping, “hopeful melancholy” layering—but contradictions stay abstract; no micro-choice visibly costs him anything until the final rook placement, which is still more symbol than stakes. Motive remains steady rather than intensifying; exile is background, not crucible. Earned, but only just.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sky-pattern echo tightens the thematic coil rather than causal chain. Orientation is swift; the eclipse covenant’s paused-conversation reconfiguration lands with felt cost—he forfeits the certainty of brokenness. Closure is clean, lyrical, and reweights prior motifs without exposition dump.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Rust dunes, magnetic pulses, and stone dent are filtered through chess-perceptual bias; every descriptor doubles as board metaphor. Micro-setting (stone in palm) constrains the final rook placement, charging the image. Spatial choreography is ghost-clean—no drift. Meets 9- gate: object charges final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“discover beauty in the difficult”—is declared early; pressure escalates via pattern-recognition beats, not reversals. No live option is foreclosed until the rook seals the covenant’s rebirth; cost is conceptual, not visceral. Sufficient tightening for 600-word window, but barely touches 8.8 gate.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through chess-eclipse fusion rather than statement; final sliver of light reweights prior sacrifices without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers—covenant could still fail—inviting reflection. No thematic echo penalty; insight stays imagistic. Loses top sliver because conceptual cost is less emotionally urgent.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person lyric maintains tight psychic distance; diction (“wan flag,” “aching beauty”) is consistent, rhythmic, and POV-bound. No head-hop; compression taught early (“translate silence into a language of moves”) pays off at closure. Distinct perceptual signature under pressure—qualifies for 9- band.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is lush yet propulsive; figurative layering serves pattern-building, not ornament. One scaffold loop (“hopeful melancholy” repeated thrice) and two near-paraphrase lines dull momentum slightly. No mixed metaphors; syntax breathes with scene tempo. Artifacts stay clear of closure—holds high band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Chess-as-astral-cartography feels fresh; exile trope is refreshed via magnetic nexus and eclipse covenant. Risk is conceptual, not plot-audacious, keeping score sub-8.8. Specificity of stone dent and sky-board pattern prevents swap-test failure. Synthesis is memorable yet safe.</comment>
