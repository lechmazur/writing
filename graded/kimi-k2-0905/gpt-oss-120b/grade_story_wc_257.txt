<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Grief and craft fuse convincingly in her fingertips, but the “genuinely artificial” paradox is asserted rather than dramatized as an inner contradiction. Interiority is lush yet occasionally drifts into self-diagnosis (“she understood that…”) instead of raw split-second impulse. The final oath is earned, but the rose-transformation is more symbolic than an action that visibly costs or changes her craft. Still, her embodied copper-stained grief and the micro-choice to trace the stencil onto living stem keep her from sliding into allegorical cipher.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: each crane and thread layers density until the final balcony bloom reweights the stake. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—the rose’s phosphorescence makes the “genuinely artificial” rule-set undeniable and re-prices the concept of mourning. Cost is felt: her prior “sparkle and purpose” remain foregone; the observatory now maps intention, not time. However, the vellum stencil itself never visibly constrains later tactics; its pattern is invoked but never materially complicates the final move, so the conceptual charge is slightly abstract.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Dome, brass lenses, and furnace breathe with selective sensory hierarchy; jeweler’s eye for metal and patina grounds every detail. The origami cranes function as micro-setting-objects that constrain placement and sight-lines; their paper-skin evolves from artifact to constellation. Spatial choreography stays clean: slotting a crane into a telescope, silver thread spooling to the balcony, moonlight as solvent for the rose. Only the city’s “forgotten gardens” remain off-page abstraction; inside the dome, environment is tactile and choice-shaping.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—remapping grief into再生—is signaled early; escalation is gradual pattern-accumulation rather than narrowing options. Each crane deposits a filament that lengthens the pilgrimage, a visible metric of deepening commitment. The rose’s revival is the single tightening beat, but it is staged as revelation rather than a trade-off that forecloses an alternative path. Cost is present (she forfeits old identity, stains fingers), yet luck (rose waiting) partly dilutes agency-driven pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges as the alchemy of fake → alive, artifice → life, without moralizing. The “genuinely artificial” paradox recurs in lantern-glow, paper cranes, and finally the phosphorescent bloom, each iteration gaining luminous ethical weight. Subtext resides in silent folds and thread-paths rather than exposition. The ending image refuses tidy comfort: bloom is real, but its light is still borrowed from death-metal grief, leaving honest ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person lyric voice sustains jeweler’s materialist diction: brass, copper, vellum, phosphorescence. Syntax lengthens and breathes under dome-height silence, then contracts into folds and filaments. No head-hopping; perceptual signature stays anchored to her haptic, metal-stained gaze. Occasional elevated Latinate diction (“phosphorescent,” “constellations”) risks slight register drift from craftsman idiom, but the rhythm remains controlled and pattern-taught.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty—information + atmosphere—without scaffold bloat. Metaphors stay coherent within light/astronomy register: lanterns as conjured stars, cranes as constellations. A few soft filters (“felt the faint promise,” “seemed to weep”) could be compressed to stronger verbs. No loops or synonym churn; final image lands clean, but earlier density of “genuinely artificial” refrains edges toward thesis-statement repetition rather than texture.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Fusing mourning-jewelry craft with astronomical mapping yields fresh metaphorical chemistry; the cranes-as-star-charts convert private grief into public constellation. “Genuinely artificial” as emotional axiom risks concept-story territory, yet the specificity of origami-with-coordinates rescues it from abstraction. Rose revival is familiar, but its stem inscribed with tattoo stencil lines offers tactile twist. Overall, synthesis feels personal rather than prompt-spliced, though the paradoxical catchphrase could anchor future variations.</comment>
