<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>The oracle’s obsession with mapping darkness is a vivid, character-specific trait that drives every beat; his micro-choice to “seal the map within his own breath” crystallizes an earned renunciation with bodily cost. Interiority is atmospheric rather than concrete—more mood than muscle or breath—but the contradiction between endless night and the need to chart it is continuously active. No second character appears, so status/relationship tests are N/A; the solitary POV is coherent, though emotional embodiment drifts toward abstraction under peak pressure. The final stance—map dissolving into air—reads as credibly endured obsession rather than tidy growth, satisfying the Earned Stasis clause.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the map dissolves into “the very air,” reweighting the premise that the void can be known; the cost is the oracle’s surrender of the artifact he trusted, paid in the final breath-image. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: because each retelling thickens the parchment’s “veins of shadow,” the final cadence shift (star winks out → map disperses) reconfigures meaning without causal reversals. Orientation is anchored early by “storm-tossed ridge fort” and continuous storm cues; no disorientation serves closure, so no penalty applied. No causality gaps; the booklet’s frayed last question is the visible constraint that shapes the final act.</comment>

<comment>The fort, storm, and solitary star function as micro-setting: the gale “rattling the battlements” and the final turret perch directly constrain when and how the oracle releases the map. Sensory economy favors salt, iron, amber—selective and POV-filtered rather than catalogic. Spatial choreography stays clean; the booklet is handled, lifted, and finally placed atop the turret in a trackable chain. The star’s disappearance serves as the environmental trigger for the closure beat, passing the 9+ gate test for setting-charged image.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—can the night be mapped?—is signaled in paragraph 1 and tightens when the last page poses its unanswerable question, forcing the oracle to choose between containment and surrender. Escalation is textural: each retelling adds “veins of shadow” to the parchment, reweighting the cost of continued mapping; the star’s extinction is the visible price. No external antagonist is needed; the void itself supplies coherent pressure. The final act—dissolving the map into breath—narrows options to acceptance, satisfying the lens-driven tightening.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: the futility of pinning down ineffability. The map’s dissolution reprices the concept of knowledge itself—what can be “known” is only what can be exhaled and surrendered. No explicit thesis is stated; resonance is carried by the final image of “marbled hush” inhering the air. The story avoids sentimental uplift, leaving the oracle in quiet, unmapped stoicism that invites reflection without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric-accumulative, taught early by the repeated “ambered hush” and “marbled hush” pattern; closure pays it off when the hush becomes the medium into which the map disperses. Syntax is controlled, with purposeful cadence shifts—long breath-like sentences that mirror the act of “summarizing silence.” No dialogue appears, so dialogue tests are N/A. Diction stays within the oracle’s plausible arcane register; no filter-verb clutter or register drift under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Line-level craft is dense and loop-free; each sentence advances atmosphere or stakes without synonym churn. Metaphors (“phantom serpent,” “river of stars”) stay coherent within the storm/sea logic; no mixed vehicles collide. Rhythm modulates—long sweeps for calm, staccato clauses for gusts—supporting momentum. Only minor scaffold: two adjacent “hush” phrases could be merged, but the repetition is pattern-taught and pays off at closure, so penalty is minimal.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The conceit—“cartography of silence”—is fresh and non-obvious, synthesized through the gold-leaf booklet and breath-sealing act rather than abstract assertion. Storm-battered fort as a spine is a sharp, specific image that roots the lyric mode in bodily architecture. The map that becomes air is an inevitable yet unforeseeable reconfiguration, satisfying the transformation test. Risk is present but moderate; the lyric density flirts with abstraction yet stays legible under the Accumulative lens.</comment>
