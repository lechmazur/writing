<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Mort’s quietly analytic nature is nicely embodied in the filament-untangling and wax-sealed note, but the interiority drifts into thematic commentary (“physics of letting go”) that feels more authorial than character-bound. The “tension minus attachment equals release” equation is overtly diagnostic, blunting the embodied contradiction we need for 9-band. Still, his micro-choices (turning the globe, sealing the cylinder) track a credible arc of quiet renunciation with visible cost, satisfying the earned-stasis closure under the accumulative lens.</comment>

<comment>The accumulative pattern is taught early: every loop of wire mirrors a loop of memory; each filament snap prunes the maze. Closure lands cleanly—wax seals the cylinder and the globe shatters—delivering a resonant reconfiguration with undeniable conceptual cost. Orientation is swift, causality is lyrical but intact, and the final image reweights the premise. Minor deduction for the late-arriving “equation” that spells the concept rather than letting the image reprice it.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The sunken library is more than postcard scenery: algae-choked consoles, sand-sealed windows, and corroded microphone constrain what Mort can touch and hear. Micro-setting—the snow globe—literally charges the final image when it shatters into ascending “stars.” Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: Mort notices copper tang, stale water, the hush of pressurized dark. Spatial choreography stays clean as he drifts from shelf to console to ascent.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—recover the last transmission—tightens as each filament surrender releases a literal voice from the past. Pressure escalates by pattern intensification rather than causal reversals, fitting the accumulative lens; each snapped wire = one clearer word of the captain’s love. Cost is felt: the globe must shatter to complete the release, paying the price of preservation. One notch below 8.8 only because the tightening is poetic rather than tactical.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the recurring image of tangled/untangled threads and the globe’s frozen storm that must dissolve to release light. The final shatter reweights the motif: letting go is not loss but the only path by which memory becomes constellation. No moralizing—wisdom stays in the image. The Amelia echo keeps the theme oceanic and aerial at once, resisting tidy binaries.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Mort’s perceptual signature: breath-bubble, cracked glass, wax hiss. Syntax lengthens and contracts with the untangling rhythm, avoiding drumbeat monotony. Filter verbs (“he thought”) are minimal and voice-motivated. The elevated diction—“luminous path of release”—fits the melancholic register without slipping into corporate abstraction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and musical, doing triple duty: atmosphere, physics, emotion. Only hairline slippage: two adjacent “he thought / he realized” sentences could be fused, and “physics of letting go” edges toward template phrase. Otherwise no mixed metaphors, loops, or scaffold. Read-aloud rhythm breathes naturally with the filament releases.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Merging Earhart lore with a drowned wireless library feels non-obvious; the last transmission becomes both love letter and cosmic equation. The snow globe’s transformation from souvenir to star-shatter is a fresh intensification rather than gimmick. Risky lyric structure pays off: closure legible, stakes reweighted. Only reason it stops short of 9.5 is that the conceptual equation is stated as well as shown.</comment>
