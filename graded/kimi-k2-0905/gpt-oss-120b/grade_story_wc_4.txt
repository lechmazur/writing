<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Mara’s calm perceptiveness is repeatedly labelled but never embodied in a risky micro-choice; the single action—lifting the feather—carries no visible cost or contradiction, so interiority remains ornamental rather than crucible-tested. The “collective healing” motive is declared, not dramatized through her body or a forfeiture, leaving motivation static across the arc. The villagers appear as a chorus without individual status pressure, so Mara’s isolation never collides with another will; absence of relational crucible flattens characterization. The promised flaw of obsessive archival control is never allowed to complicate the outcome, so no earned mistake drives the climax.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The lens is Accumulative/Textural: pressure accrues through layered photographs and lavender scent rather than causal chains. Orientation is clear by word 60, satisfying the 120-word gate. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—the feather’s dust reweights the past—but the cost is societal, not personal; Mara pays nothing visible, so the reconfiguration feels philanthropic rather than earned. No persistent constraint or price shapes her future tactics, capping resonance at “nice moment” instead of irrevocable change.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The lavender-field-behind-ruins micro-setting is specific, sensory, and thematically apt; smell and color saturate the air, anchoring emotional texture. The dove-gray map case functions as portable setting-in-a-prop, handled twice and charging the final reveal. Spatial choreography stays clean despite crowd entrance; bodies and objects track. For 9+ gate, the environment does not constrain a tactical choice—Mara could have performed the ritual anywhere—so ceiling holds at 8.8.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Stakes are announced—“transmute pain into a masterpiece”—but no tangible resistance materializes: no skeptic, no rainstorm, no shortage of pins or wall-space, no risk to Mara’s calm. Escalation is atmospheric (more villagers, more tears) rather than a narrowing of options; the photograph arcs brighten, yet this is spectacle, not jeopardy. The single micro-turn is the crowd’s arrival, which complicates nothing—it completes the plan. Without a forced trade-off or visible price, pressure plateaus at tender ambiance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme of communal memory-as-salve emerges through imagistic repetition—lavender, arcs, feather—rather than exposition, satisfying emergence rule. Subtext relies on silhouettes and scent, avoiding explicit thesis until the final “quiet promise kept,” which still nudges toward moral summary (−0.3). The reconfiguration is felt collectively, yet Mara’s private stakes evaporate, leaving thematic center slightly hollow. Ambiguity is present but safe; no counter-reading challenges the healing premise, reducing complexity.</comment>

<comment>Third-person lyric voice maintains stable distance and a gently elevated register consistent with archivist temperament. Sensory diction—“purple perfume,” “luminous constellation”—is patterned early and pays off in final silvered tableau, teaching its rhythm. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk is zero; however, the crowd’s uniform “rippling laughter” flattens aural texture. Syntax varies; no filter-verb clusters or head-hopping; modest compression in peak beat aligns with calm persona.</comment>

<comment>Read-aloud rhythm is fluid, with paragraph breaths matching emotional swells; no template cadence runs. Figurative density is high—almost every sentence carries metaphor—but the pattern is set in paragraph 1 and sustains cohesion, so −0.3 instead of heavier penalty. Mixed metaphor count is low; “vines climb… feeding the story” is the single physical-logic stretch, forgiven as animism. Occasional scaffolding: “the assembled arcs formed” repeats the prior sentence’s content, one paraphrase loop (−0.2).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Memory-curator using vintage photographs in lavender-choked ruins is fresh; post-industrial pastoral meets archive-as-ritual. The arcs-of-silhouettes constellating into communal pulse is a non-obvious synthesis that feels inevitable after the setup. Risk is aesthetic rather than narrative; no ideological or formal daring pushes the piece into higher band. Could be transplanted to any decaying town with minor noun swaps, so transformation test lingers at borderline.</comment>
