<comment>Arlen’s “boldly sympathetic” trait is repeatedly named but never complicates her choices; she moves through the orchard like a tour guide, not a woman whose empathy costs her anything. No interior contradiction surfaces under pressure—her promise to the unseen artist is pure benevolence, never tested by counter-urge or fatigue. The villagers remain an anonymous chorus, so no relationship crucible can force her stance to shift. The final image of the expanding reed sculpture is lovely, but it feels ordained rather than earned by prior causality.</comment>

<comment>The closure lands as a Charged Poise: the tag is revealed as living, the orchard’s ache steadies into glow, and every heart feels bound. Causality is lyric-accumulative rather than tight because/therefore; the lens holds because the final reweighting of the glyph from static mark to growing symbol is legible and cost is felt (the community now carries perpetual responsibility). Orientation is clear by word 60. No teleporting props or plot amnesia, but the off-stage street artist remains a convenient oracle.</comment>

<comment>“Crystalline orchard,” “shimmering crater,” “black glass bark” are vivid, selective, and immediately teach the lyric pattern. The obsidian arbor functions as micro-setting that constrains choice: people must gather beneath it, touch it, weave reeds around it; its reflective surface literally refracts their yearning onto the ground. Spatial choreography stays clean across the night walk. The environment’s phosphorescent moss and dew-kissed stems evolve with the pageant of villagers, never repeated statically.</comment>

<comment>The dominant stake—binding the community—signaled in paragraph two. Pressure escalates accumulatively: each reed laid, each face turned to the arbor, thickens the invisible web; the glyph’s pulse is the single micro-turn that reweights meaning. No visible price is paid by Arlen (she neither bleeds nor relinquishes a private dream), so the cost is collective and diffuse. Sufficient for lyric mode but keeps the score below 7.0 because no one’s tactical options are foreclosed.</comment>

<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of communal belonging emerges through the arbor’s refracted light and the weaving ritual, never sermonized. The interlocking-circles glyph migrates from graffiti to living leaf, a quiet conceptual repricing that invites reflection on how symbols grow with care. No tidy moral is stated; the final glow is an image, not a lesson. Ambiguity lingers: the unseen artist may still be watching, the ache may return, so the reader is left to tend the web.</comment>

<grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>The omniscient lyric voice sustains a consistent luminous diction (“luminescent ache,” “ribbons of violet”) that feels purposeful rather than decorative. No head-hopping; focalization stays wide but anchored to Arlen’s perceptual filter. Syntax modulates: longer rolling sentences for orchard description, clipped fragments at the glyph reveal. No dialogue to test naturalism, but the narrative ear is musical without drumbeat monotony.</comment>

<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Strong information density: “each step cracking the dew-kissed stems as if the ground itself whispered” does three jobs in twelve words. A few soft spots: “webs of kinship” is repeated thrice in identical phrasing; “luminescent ache” risks coined-phrase fatigue. No mixed metaphors or simultaneity errors. Final paragraph contains three sentences beginning “Together they” – minor template cadence but does not obscure closure.</comment>

<comment>The marsh-reed sculptor who builds belonging by guiding a collective search for an ever-growing glyph is a fresh synthesis. The obsidian arbor as community mirror and the tag that lives like a leaf are specific inflections rather than stock magical objects. The crater-orchard feels particular, not generic fairyland. Risk is lyric-structural rather than plot-shock, but coherence stays high; no close echoes of famous scenes.</comment>
