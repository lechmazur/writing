<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is evocative—her eyes “carrying the paradox of feigned terror and felt teeth” lands—but her contradictory impulses are described rather than dramatized in scene; she never faces a live moment where rehearsed reflex collides with real crisis. The benevolently-ruthless trait is asserted twice but produces no visible trade-off or micro-choice under pressure. The mission to chronicle “small gestures” is declared, not tested; she never rejects an easier path or pays an on-page cost for it, so the final stance feels pre-ordained. Closure earns quiet gravitas, yet the emotional arc is more stated than struggled.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: the story layers image and motif until the final pattern reweights meaning. Anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 3; the gallery and interregnum are legible. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the scroll’s exposure + penumbra’s curl make the cost of remembrance legible without overt sacrifice. However, the chessboard’s click-to-compartment mechanism is an unmotivated magical turn not seeded earlier; it slightly dilutes the accruing logic.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Whispering gallery is sketched with selective sensory strokes—ribbons of light, dust that clings to stone—each filtered through Mira’s quest for erased gestures. The missing-pawn board functions as micro-setting that constrains her method: she must walk its squares to spell words, so the emptiness literally shapes her choreography. Echo and penumbra are used as active environmental agents, inhaling/exhaling, curling protectively; space responds to her inscription. The final image—scroll on dark square beneath traveling shadow—recharges the luminous-absence motif with undeniable specificity.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake is preserving vanished small acts before new power erases them; signaled early (“she vowed to become the historian”). Pressure is atmospheric, not antagonistic: the risk is forgetting, tightened by the gallery’s inhale/exhale and the penumbra’s pruning. The meaningful turn is the click-reveal of the scroll; it changes her option from searcher to custodian, visible on page. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral—she shoulders “quiet charge” but no tangible loss or foreclosed path is felt, keeping escalation muted.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</theme><comment>Theme emerges obliquely: history is made survivable by micro-mercies, not monuments. Subtext lives in gesture—footfall syllables, blanket gifts—never articulated as thesis until the penultimate paragraph (“she had become the historian…”), which is borderline echo but spared the final line. The luminous-absence motif reweights at closure: the board empty of pawns yet full of meaning reframes absence as repository. Complexity is honored; no moral is preached, only enacted.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person lyric remains close to Mira’s perceptual filter: “echoes lingered like half-remembered prayers” is writerly yet consistent with her crisis-actor ear for staged resonance. Syntax flexes with pressure—long breathless clauses for flood memory, staccato “remember what fell” for inscription. No dialogue, so voice distinction is internal; diction stays within her plausible lexicon. The nomadic penumbra’s personification is sustained without POV wobble, giving the traveller-shadow its own idiom.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose is textured but disciplined: “thin ribbons,” “benevolently ruthless,” “nomadic penumbra” offer fresh vehicles without stacking. One mixed metaphor—“luminous absence, a space where possibilities glow rather than darkened”—reads self-correcting and purposeful. Rhythm modulates: opening spondaic weight gives way to lighter footfall cadence during word-walks. Only minor scaffold: “small gestures” is repeated three times in closing paragraph; the echo is thematic but slightly redundant.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The crisis-actor-turned-real-survivor angle freshens standard flood memory tale; chessboard as absent-archive is an unexpected physicalization of erased history. Walking to spell words converts space into text, a risk that could feel gimmick yet here feels earned by pacing and echo logic. Penumbra-as-traveler literalizes shadow history without allegorical sprawl. While the interregnum frame is familiar, the synthesis of actorly artifice with micro-historiography produces a specific, memorable inflection.</comment>
