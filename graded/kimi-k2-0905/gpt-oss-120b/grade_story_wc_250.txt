<question>1</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The guardian’s interiority is purely ornamental—“silent empathy” is asserted, never embodied. No contradictory impulses, micro-choices, or visible cost emerge; the figure remains a static allegory. The ending “smile within its mirrored gaze” is summary label-speak, unmotivated by any prior dramatized tension. Consequently the required renunciation/endurance feels un-earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens: imagery accretes around mirror-flashes and shutter-ripples, culminating in Charged Poise (night “aware of its own glitter”). Closure lands with conceptual cost (night re-weighted), but setup is late—orientation of scene, body, and rule-set drifts past 120 wds without clear anchor. Micro-turn is present but soft; no persistent constraint shapes later tactics. Causality remains atmospheric rather than because/therefore.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Cobalt dock, rain-slick planks, mirrored glare, and dental mirror form a tight micro-setting that actively constrains the choreography of light. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (“hush that stretched like fog”). The mirror-as-tool evolves from prop to loom to lens, charging the final image. Spatial choreography is immaculate—no impossible positions or prop drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—teaching darkness to value stars—is declared early but remains abstract; no visible price or forfeiture is risked. Escalation is textural (slower ripples, fading glints) rather than a tightening that forecloses options; the guardian never meets resistance or faces failure. Agency is entirely one-directional and calm, so pressure feels ambient, not urgent. Cost is conceptual only, insufficiently dramatized on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the accumulative weave of light; no explicit moral is stated. The re-weighting of night as self-luminous is resonant and non-literal. Motifs (mirror, shutters, stars) recur with shifting significance, culminating in the final lattice. Some lines flirt with soft aphorism (“language of listening without words”) but theme never collapses into overt thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Consistent lyric third-person that hovers at poetic distance; diction is compressed, pattern-taught (“spiralingly calm”, “shutters of water”). Rhythm modulates with image density, accelerating then easing into slower shutter-pauses. No head-hopping or register drift; perceptual signature remains otherworldly yet coherent. Minor syntactic echoes (“spiralingly calm” repeated) are purposeful, not monotonous.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>High metaphor density in nearly every sentence; while pattern is taught early, it flirts with overwriting in peak beats (“cathedral” flash). Several near-paraphrase pairs (“silent empathy” / “hush that stretched like fog”) create synonym churn. Read-aloud rhythm is strong, but sentence openings cluster around “The guardian / It / The water”. No mixed metaphors or tense slips; clarity stays intact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Freshens the familiar “guardian teaches night” trope through the concrete mechanic of ripple-shutters and dental-mirror loom. Specificity of cobalt dock, dental mirror, and shutter-pattern feels idiosyncratic rather than checklist. Risk-taking in lyric density pays off; final image is memorable. Slight softness in causal pressure prevents top band.</comment>
