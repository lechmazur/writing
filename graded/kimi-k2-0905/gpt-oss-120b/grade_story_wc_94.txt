<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The poet’s interior contradiction—needing to speak yet accepting censorship—drives every beat; the 23-minute choice is a visible micro-choice that costs him silence. Emotion is embodied in the climb, the envelope trembling, the timer ticking against his pulse. No second character appears, so relationship/status bullets are waived. The final descent carries earned stasis: he foregoes immediate publication, carrying the storm-kissed map instead, cost legible in the empty envelope left behind.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the empty envelope and glowing ink map reweight the premise—scars become breathable terrain, not wounds to heal. Causality is lyric-accumulative: each sensory beat (ozone, lightning, drizzle) thickens the cartography metaphor until the timer’s ring crystallizes the shift. The 120-word orientation test is passed—who/where/when anchored by “spiral stair…observatory…restless clouds.” Persistent constraint: the sealed envelope mechanism recurs, its hollow twelve-o-clock column now a future mouthpiece, cost felt as continued silence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The stormlit observatory is no backdrop; the narrowing dome-eye and ozone scent pressure the poet’s breathing and timing. The copper dome, brass console, and timetable hollow are tactile tools that constrain how the vigil can be performed. Spatial choreography is clean: climb → set timer → slot envelope → collect fragments → descend. Weather evolves from hammering rain to blessing drizzle, mirroring internal rarefaction without overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</question><grade><comment>Dominant stake: can 23 minutes of rarefied attention turn collective scars into navigable terrain? Escalation is accumulative: each lightning stanza thickens the invisible map until the timer’s ring forces the crystallizing image. No antagonist; pressure is situational—storm + silence vs. need to speak. Cost is conceptual but legible: the poet gains a map yet remains censored, the empty envelope a visible forfeiture of immediate voice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the concrete ritual: scars are not pathologies but geography to be walked with reverence. Subtext operates in the envelope’s hollow, the timer’s tick, the ink that glows only after surrender to storm. No late echoic statement; the final image of travelers finding the timer beneath floorboards extends the map without moralizing. The emotional aftereffect is quiet awe—readers feel invited to traverse their own scars rather than erase them.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is lyric-cosmic yet body-anchored: “furiously tranquil” is not asserted but enacted in the climb and whisper. Syntax lengthens and contracts with breath: cumulative clauses mimic storm swell, then cut to “timer clicked.” No dialogue; perceptual signature is poet-as-astronomer of wounds, noticing silver veins in clouds and ink. Compression taught early (“vigil in pause”) and paid off in final drizzle blessing.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies: thunder-long sentences vs. single-beat “timer clicked.” No scaffold loops; each sentence advances image or stakes. Metaphors stay coherent—storm as parchment, scars as cities—without mixed vehicles. Information density high: timetable hollow, 23-minute exactitude, glowing ink all serve closure. Minor template cadence in “He…He…” ascent sentences (−0.2), but does not touch final image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Premise is familiar—artist vs. censorship—yet transformed through tactile ritual: bus-timetable dead-drop, darkroom timer as spiritual stopwatch, storm as darkroom door. Specific synthesis feels inevitable; remove any element and the rarefaction fails. Risk in lyric accumulation pays off: storm-kissed wonder becomes method, not mood. No derivative echoes; the cartography of scars is rendered, not declared.</comment>
