<comment>Mira’s “culture-shock absorber” premise stays ornamental; we are told she “filters chaos” but never see her fail, flinch, or pay a price while doing it. Dual-allegiance tension is announced (“tightrope”) yet never forces a visible sacrifice or micro-choice that costs her standing with either side. Interiority drifts into abstract labels (“hopeful desperation”) instead of embodied contradiction under pressure. Closure choice—postponement—feels council-level, not hers; her stance crystallizes off-stage.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the phoenix mural visibly reweights the privatization stakes and the city’s self-image, with the chip enshrined as communal anchor—cost is legible. Causality, however, is loose: graffiti cartography turns tides without on-page resistance failure or council vote mechanics; the postponement reads like civic benevolence rather than Mira’s earned lever. Accum/Textural lens holds—density of coded murals patterns toward the final image—but the single “because” hinge (investors arrive → layout already shifted) is asserted, not dramatized. Orientation clear by 50 words; no penalty.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Raft-city carnival is evoked in motion—“hulls creaked in rhythm with the tide”—and constrains logistics: riverbank tourism vs. artisan quarter drives the stall shuffle. Micro-setting object, the foundation stone chip, is handled twice (discovery, then glass-case enshrinement) and charges the closing image. Sensory economy favors lanterns, mist, river steam; no static catalogue. Spatial track clean: banners, walls, pier, waterline remain oriented across beats.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—prevent privatization—signaled early; escalation is reputational rather than tactical: graffiti rearranges stalls, investors merely “unaware,” council politely delays. No credible resource lost or avenue closed for Mira; postponement is windfall, not forced trade-off. Tightening comes via symbolic display (phoenix mural) that reweights public perception—valid Accumulative turn—but price is communal pride, not personal cost. Agency diffuse: illustrators, council, investors share the causal load.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Theme—community self-mapping versus corporate seizure—emerges through cartographic imagery rather than slogan. Phoenix mural reprises fish/gear graffiti vocabulary, giving closure a visual rather than moral answer. Subtextual silence on Mira’s future loyalties invites reader projection, avoiding thesis sentence. Dock-worker whisper heritage stays abstract; specificity of artisan quarter recovery keeps theme grounded.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays anchored to Mira with perceptual signature—“orderly intuitive mind” filters carnival chaos into pattern recognition. No head-hopping; psychic distance stable. Prose rhythm swells toward lyrical cadence at lantern-lit reveals, matching carnival aura. Occasional elevated register (“kaleidoscope of music, scent”) momentarily drifts from Mira’s pragmatic lens but remains consistent across text.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm varies; no template cadence detected. Information density high—“foundation stone chip, barely the size of a fingernail, embedded… resolved into a map”—three jobs in one clause. Metaphors stay coherent: “floating circus,” “tide of change.” Minor loop: “hopeful desperation” phrase echoed three times; doesn’t obscure closure but dulls nuance. No typographical errors or pronoun drift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Raft-city carnival as commons-versus-privatization arena feels fresh; graffiti-as-living-map offers a non-obvious resistance instrument. Conceptual synthesis—cartography embedded in pier splinter—turns literal fragment into ideological blueprint. Stakes stay local, avoiding telescopic world-ending rhetoric. Transformation test fails: swap “raft city” for “barrio” and story still functions, keeping score shy of 8.5.</comment>
