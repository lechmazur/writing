<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The guardian’s shift from solitary predator to curator-of-uncertainty is dramatized through embodied beats—breathing frost into memory, feeling amber warm sinews—rather than diagnostic labels; contradictory impulses wait/claim are held in scene. Cost is visible: the feral body accepts domestication of purpose in the final image, pendant fused to chest. Interiority stays concrete (“rusted syllables,” “lattice of interiorized exteriors”), never therapy-speak. No orientation or lens penalties apply; the earned stasis of endless guardianship is credible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the guardian’s stance crystallizes—still waiting, but now inside a newly opened mist-wing of the library—cost legible in perpetual vigil and fused pendant. Accumulative/Textural lens dominates: each frosted petal, breath, pendant pulse accretes until the final cadence shift reweights uncertainty as companion. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are signaled in first 120 words via “frozen garden,” “midnight,” “feral library guardian.” No causality breaks; pendant removal awakens breach is implicit threat, not coincidence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Frozen roses, skeletal birches, mist-woven verses are selective, sensory, and filter through guardian perception; environment constrains—frost limits mobility, mist hides boundaries—charging the final image where walls are literally mist-verses. Spatial choreography is lyric but coherent: pendant half-buried → guardian approaches → fused to chest. Weather (frost, dawn thinning) causally affects blossom tremor and guardian timing. No occupational detail required; micro-setting (pendant, guardian sinews) functions as setting and charges closure. Idiom stays consistent with lyric-fantasy register.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake: guardian’s loneliness vs. embracing uncertainty; pendant arrival tightens this by offering friendship-with-risk. One meaningful escalation: absorbing garden desolation into memory (interiorizing exteriors) reweights uncertainty from threat to ally, narrowing future choices to perpetual curatorship. Cost is visible—pendant warmth fused into flesh, eternal vigil. No antagonist needed; pressure is situational/timeless. Agency is renunciation/acceptance rather than combat, fitting Accumulative lens. No off-stage resolutions; dawn arrival is environmental coincidence that complicates, not solves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges without moralizing: uncertainty as companion rather than enemy, crystallized in final mist-wing where stories breathe unfiled. Subtext carried by recurring frost/petal imagery shifts from desolation to invitation. Final image of guardian heart “beating in time with the garden’s sighs” offers non-literal answer—acceptance of endless ambiguity. No thematic echo or final-paragraph thesis statement; resonance arises from specific particulars (pendant pulse, unfurling roses). Complexity retained: cult threat lingers, breach still possible.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person lyric voice sustains perceptual signature—guardian noticing “spines of ancient, frost-bitten volumes,” “rusted syllables”—never slip into omniscient exposition. Psychic distance stable; compression (“interiorizing exteriors”) is pattern-taught early and paid off at closure. No dialogue to judge; free indirect texture coherent. Tense consistent; diction stays within guardian’s poetic-animal register (“sinews,” “lattice”). Rhythm modulates: long breathy sentences mirror waiting, shorter pulses (“wait,” “key rather than curse”) mark micro-turns.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>High density without scaffold: every sentence layers image + action + interior (“pendant seemed to hum a promise, a pact of uncertainty”). No paraphrase loops; metaphors consistent (frost, light, pages). Rhythm varies—fronted participles, em-dashes, paragraph breaths. Peak beat (“uncertainty it had long avoided now shimmering as a possible companion”) is clear, uncluttered. Minor elevated diction (“dimensionally homesick,” “conceptual repricing”) fits lyric mode; no clarity break. Proofing clean; no typos or tense drift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Feral librarian + frozen story-garden + uncertainty-as-companion is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis; trope inversion feels inevitable in hindsight. Pendant-as-key而非curse transforms familiar macguffin into thematic engine. Risky lyric accumulation pattern taught early and held to final mist-wing; no gimmickry. Specific detail (“mist-woven verses,” “rusted syllables”) prevents generic transferability. Emotional truth—lonely sentinel choosing perpetual ambiguity—grounds conceptual freshness. No derivative premise penalty; high-band bonus justified.</comment>
