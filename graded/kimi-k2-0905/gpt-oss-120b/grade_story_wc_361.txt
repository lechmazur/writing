<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The courier’s shaky curiosity and mentor-haunted interiority are vivid; his micro-choice to hand the pendant to the girl crystallizes values. Flaws: no interior contradiction under pressure, and the “extend encounters” power works too smoothly—no visible cost or risk to him, so the arc feels lightly earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mosaic chain of encounters is legible under Accumulative/Textural lens and lands a soft CR: the ridge becomes a myth-pipeline. Weakness: no persistent constraint or price paid by the courier; the mentor echo acts as free wisdom rather than a limit, so closure feels more glow than cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Aurora-lit ridge and pendant-as-lantern create micro-setting that literally guides steps and charges the final image; spatial choreography across the shepherd/fire/girl sequence is clean. Environment never backfires or imposes hardship—beauty without bite—so stakes stay scenic.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“turn routine into wonder”—is declared early and each vignette delivers a micro-proof, producing a cumulative lift. Yet escalation is flat: no tighter squeeze, no forfeiture; the courier’s tactics never adapt and the pendant never falters, so pressure plateaus rather than tightens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme of transmuting memory into myth emerges through recurrence of “germinate” and aurora-as-tapestry, avoiding overt thesis. Final image of pilgrims arriving re-weights the ridge as legend factory, but remains gentle—more invitation than indictment—leaving ambiguity slightly under-charged.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Lyrical third-person stays close to courier’s synesthetic perception; diction (“shimmered like a captured sunrise,” “tunnel of shifting greens”) is consistent, rhythmic, and POV-plausible. No head-hop; patterned metaphor is taught early and paid off in the final auroral pulse.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Strong read-aloud cadence, high density, few filters. Minor loop: “germinate” is over-leveraged (×5) and becomes incantatory rather than evolving; a single metaphor mix (“river of colors” vs “tunnel of shifting greens”) blurs spatial logic but not closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fairy-tale courier + aurora + empathy-pendant is familiar, yet the “extend brief encounters” mechanic feels fresh and the ridge-as-myth-pipeline angle gives it regional specificity. Risk is moderate; execution lifts the concept above trope collage, though not radically transformed.</comment>
