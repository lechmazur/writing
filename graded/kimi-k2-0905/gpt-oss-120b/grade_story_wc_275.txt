<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira’s pacifist resolve is embodied early (“she chose to sheathe it”) and repeatedly tested in concrete micro-choices (handing the petal, gathering scraps). The interior contradiction between inherited violence-aptitude and chosen gentleness stays live; the final rose-offering to the boy crystallizes her hierarchy of values with visible cost. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion is muscle-level (“calm fire ignite within”). One hairline slip: “senselessly perceptive” is used as authorial label twice before it constrains action; still, the trait immediately guides her noticing the canvas prayer, earning its keep.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each repetition of “quiet”/“tranquil blaze” thickens the pattern until the final lantern-glow reweights the stake. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—community vows crystallized in rose-petal distribution—charged by the weight of the anchored sandbag scrap; conceptual cost is the collective shouldering of memory. No orientation drift; anchors (who/where/when) land by line 3. Persistent constraint: the scrap’s ballast gravity literally steadies the fountain pulse and symbolically steadies futures. Cost is legible in the elder’s “weight of history settle like sand” and the boy’s inhalation that forecloses prior panic.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Glass dome, amber lantern glow, thorn-guard roses, and half-buried canvas scrap are tactile, lived-in, and POV-filtered (“rough fibers”). Micro-setting rule met: the scrap beside the fountain alters the water’s pulse and is handled in multiple beats. Sensory hierarchy obeys crisis—wind tremor, curled thorns—then widens to moon-pattern. No white-room gaps; spatial choreography clean as Lira and boy circle perimeter laying scraps. Slight overripe phrase “sunrise of amber fire” is the only moment that edges purple; still, it mirrors prior “tranquil blaze,” maintaining pattern coherence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake: can quiet gentleness anchor a fractured settlement? Pressure escalates through iterative reinforcement acts: whisper→rose thorns outward→scrap ballast→petal compass. Each act is protagonist-originated and narrows the future toward communal vow. Cost is felt but not catastrophic—appropriate to lyric mode—yet could be sharper (no one loses a tangible resource). The final tightening lands when the elder accepts the scrap’s story burden, foreclosing amnesia.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from iterated images: quiet engraving → sheathed blade → tranquil blaze → rose petal compass. No explicit thesis; final image of villagers holding petals is the non-literal answer. Subtext operates in silence: the scrap’s “prayer” is never decoded aloud, letting reader complete meaning. Moral complexity preserved: pacifism is not preached but enacted at physical cost (weight carried, past remembered). Avoids sermonizing even in Lira’s final whisper.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person lyric close to Lira; perceptual signature vivid (“eyes senselessly perceptive to the smallest tremor of wind”). Syntax lengthens under calm, fragments slightly under pressure (“She understood: silence can hold strength”). No head-hopping; distance stable. Register stays within desert-farm lexicon; no corporate drift. Dialogue absent by design—choice fits pacifist focus—so dialogue bullets waived. Final sentence cadence mirrors opening “breath,” teaching circular pattern.</question>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Rhythmic control: long breathy sentences for dome heat, staccato “She knelt, sheathing any notion of blame” for action. Metaphors are coherent (quiet as blaze) and reweighted at closure. No synonym loops; “tranquil blaze” repeated thrice with escalating charge. One micro-scaffold: “the dome’s glass shimmered under moonlight, casting patterns that resembled…” could compress, but it links setting to theme. No mixed metaphors or purple clog in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Familiar post-collapse oasis trope is refreshed by pacifist botanist who weaponizes roses with stories. Engraved quiet as renewable resource feels non-obvious. Transformation test: swap farm for orchard or scrap for broken wheel and emotional arc collapses—scrap’s ballast history is specific. Risk taken in eschewing dialogue and overt violence; coherence maintained. Slight deduction for rose-thorn guardian image, edging fantasy without prior rule cue, but within lyric allowance.</comment>
