<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete—body off medication, coat patched with accordion tape—but the “truth-seeking river chronicler” tag is declarative, never tested; no contradictory impulse in scene. The final promise to the stones is earned, yet we never see him lie or conceal, so self-forgiveness lacks a prior on-page transgression to complicate the ache.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory layer (ivy, rust, chalk, water) deepens the stake of self-forgiveness until the river’s reflection reweights the past. Closure is a Charged Poise—“the map I follow is drawn by my own hand”—with conceptual cost legible. Orientation is anchored by word 50; no因果 breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Micro-setting triumph: the taped bellows and chalked wall function as topological maps that constrain every step. Ivy, rust, and river mud are filtered through a chronicler’s professional eye—every crack is a reference number. The final image of ivy parting like curtains charges the acceptance beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</question><grade><comment>Single stake—self-forgiveness—tightens via graffiti arrows that foreclose escape routes; each chalk line is a narrowing option. No external antagonist, but the river’s “dark and truthful” water exacts a visible price: the protagonist kneels, offers his confession, and accepts the map he must redraw. Escalation is accumulative, not causal, and sufficient for length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the inversion of map-making: cartography of the soul must be drawn on mutable mud, not paper. Graffiti wisdom—“forgiveness is not a destination but a river”—avoids sermon by being etched, finger-traced, and finally embodied in the river’s reflection. No tidy moral; ambiguity lingers in the low hymn of the patched bellows.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lyric first-person sustains a rhythmic, breath-accordion cadence that mirrors inhalation/exhalation. Diction stays within a chronicler’s lexicon; perceptual signature is biased toward flow, currents, and tidal imagery. No dialogue, so voice convergence risk is waived. Compression (“daringly methodical” repeated) is pattern-taught and pays off in final line.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies between long tidal sentences and staccato map references. No scaffold loops; information density high—one sentence often layers sensory, metaphoric, and cartographic work. One strained metaphor: “sky bruised with dusk” is minor. No artifacts in closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Premise—self-forgiveness via bathroom graffiti—is fresh, yet “river as mirror of younger self” nods to familiar trope. Risk lies in lyric accumulative structure; it succeeds. Fresh inflection: accordion bellows patched with tape becomes both lung and map legend. Specificity of coal tunnel turned confession booth rescues from abstraction.</comment>
