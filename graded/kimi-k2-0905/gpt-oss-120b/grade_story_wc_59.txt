<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The prince’s yearning for “something softer” is declared, not dramatized; his only embodied contradiction is tattered robes vs. crown. Micro-choices (salvaging gears, whispering theories) are vivid but never complicate or foreclose a path—no moment where he risks or loses anything tangible. Interiority drifts into lyric abstraction (“quaking reverie”) that blurs specific stakes. Closure feels gifted by the bird’s eruption, not paid for by a visible, character-driven cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the palace’s gears synchronize with living song, reweighting the rule-set. Causality is loose—lyric/accumulative lens—but the final image crystallizes a before/after. Orientation is clear by line 4; no penalty. The “flawed genesis” backstory is anchored to present action (salvaging shards) and tilts the cradle choice, satisfying BRR. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral, keeping the score below 8.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>“Glassy fingers” stalactites and gear-cradle beneath a silver water thread are tactile, specific, and directly enable the egg’s incubation. Palace-stalactite geometry guides lighting and reverberation, charging the phoenix eruption. Spatial choreography stays clean; no impossible positions. Setting passes the 9+ gate by constraining the cradle placement and final image, but description occasionally overdrives into lyric surplus (“living sunrise”) that nicks clarity.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—rekindle beauty—signals early but remains abstract until the bird appears; no intermediate tightening that forecloses a live option. Escalation is atmospheric, not tactical: pressure accumulates through sensory density rather than because/therefore causality. The prince’s agency is assembling, yet no beat shows that failure would cost him anything concrete. Closure reweights the world conceptually, satisfying the lens, but the missing on-page price caps the score.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: mechanical conquest vs. fragile life, encoded in the cradle’s gear-and-crystal hybrid. Subtext resides in the phoenix’s lament—an implicit critique of the palace’s original sin—never spelled out in moral tags. Final image of “suspended garden of gears and feathers” offers resonant reconfiguration without thesis statement. Complexity is present but leans romantic rather than thorny; ambiguity is sentimental, not unsettling.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Voice is lush, rhythmic, and consistent: “bedraggled prince drifted…dust of centuries” teaches elevated cadence early and sustains it. Perceptual signature is poetic, filtering world through iridescence, violin-string tremor, silver tears—distinctive without head-hopping. Diction stays within prince’s plausible lexicon (no corporate register). Occasional template shimmer (“bitterly sweet” twice, “quaking reverie” echo) slightly dulls edge under pressure, holding below 9.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm is musical, but stacked metaphors in peak beats (“bitterly sweet aria…quaking reverie…suspended garden”) create paraphrase loops that dilute propulsion. Filter-verb clusters (“seemed to mock…seemed to listen”) soften immediacy. Line density is high—many sentences carry dual duty—yet figurative excess obscures causal clarity at closure. One mixed metaphor: “stone could be pulled into the sky” momentarily breaks physics logic.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Fusion of steampunk palace with inverted stalactite anchors feels fresh; phoenix rebirth via gear-cradle is a specific, non-obvious synthesis. Tropes (lost prince, phoenix) are transformed through tactile engineering detail and geological inversion. Conceptual commitment is total—no retreat into safe metaphor. Risk is moderate; payoff legible. Slight freshness deduction for romanticized “mechanical world learns to sing” template that echoes existing eco-steampunk narratives.</comment>
