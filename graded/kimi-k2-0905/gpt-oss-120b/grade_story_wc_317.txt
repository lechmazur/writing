<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is atmospheric but generic—no contradictory impulses in scene, only lyrical resolve. The “quiet triumph” is declared, not embodied; we see no micro-choice that costs her anything. Her motivation stays flat; innovation desire is asserted, never tested against risk or flaw.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise—the bloom reconfigures wonder for participants, but Mara’s personal stake remains static; no cost is felt by her on the page. Causal chain is thin: seed → riddles → airflow → bloom; orthogonal vents are a gimmick, not a constraint that shapes tactics. Orientation is fine; skylight & brook anchor early.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Sensory selection is tight and POV-filtered: rain “in sheets,” amber windows “breathing light,” brook ticking like a clock. Micro-setting inside the shed—moving panels, moss tray, skylight—constrains the final bloom moment, passing the 9+ gate. Exterior town remains a watercolor, but the lived-in shed carries the load.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake is “can the seed bloom inside the game?”—pressure is situational, not personal for Mara. Escalation is accumulative: each solved cipher releases a puff of air; no option is foreclosed for Mara herself. Cost is borne by the flower, not the protagonist, so tension stays ornamental.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme—stories as soil for imagination—emerges via the garden legend, but the final image reweights only the players’ awe, not Mara’s worldview. Subtext is thin; no silence or gesture complicates her victory. Insight is safe, complexity avoided.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Third-person lyric voice is steady, with rhythmic clause variation and controlled metaphor (“windows breathing light”). Perceptual signature skews poetic rather than proprietor-practical, but diction stays consistent; no head-hopping. Dialogue absent; voice carries atmosphere without momentum drag.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Strong opening cadence; mid-section thins into template cadence—“each puzzle a promise,” “each tale a river,” etc.—slight loop penalty. No mixed metaphors at climax; final bloom image is clean. Density high; scaffolding minimal except for repeated anaphora.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Premise remixes escape-room + corpse-flower into living puzzle; orthogonal airflow vents supply fresh mechanical angle. Yet Mara’s passive spectatorship keeps risk low; novelty is botanical, not human. Fresh enough to linger, but stakes hedged.</comment>
