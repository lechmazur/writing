<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The collector’s “infinite patience” is stated repeatedly but never tested by a concrete moment where impatience would cost him; interiority drifts into lyric cipher (“felt the weight of centuries”) rather than embodied contradiction. No micro-choice shows him tempted to hurry, so the promised flaw never complicates action. The fishermen’s silent offering is a nice status echo, yet he remains solitary and untested, reducing arc to atmosphere.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the spiral constellation recognition reweights prior knots, fulfilling the Accumulative lens. However, the story exceeds 800 words (~860), violating the hard ceiling; the knot-to-constellation payoff is legible but the cost is atmospheric rather than felt, keeping it below 8.8.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The golden dock, snow, and fog function as micro-setting that constrains visibility and pacing; the rope acts as tactile map, charging the final image when the spiral mirrors the seed constellation. Sensory selection stays biased to the collector’s tide-ear, no white-room syndrome. Fulgurite and kelp-chest are handled with consistent physical logic, anchoring the lyric flights.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve ancient methods—is declared early but never materially threatened; no ticking clock or resource drain raises cost. The “tightening” is purely pattern-deepening (knot → constellation), not an option foreclosed. Atmospheric pressure thickens, yet the collector’s agency remains observation-only; escalation is lyrical, not tactical.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of listening-as-preservation emerges through image rather than statement, capped by the seed-constellation echo. The refusal to rush is implicit, but the lack of on-page risk keeps it from higher resonance. Subtext in fishermen’s silent ropes is elegant; final image avoids moralizing, offering quiet reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric maintains tidal rhythm, filter verbs (“felt,” “seemed”) are voice-motivated and patterned early. Diction stays within collector’s tidal lexicon; no head-hopping. Final spiral recognition is rendered in compressed, image-driven syntax that crystallizes without exposition.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Metaphor density is high but coherent—fulgurite, tide, serpent—taught as collector’s perceptual code. Occasional template cadence (“He… then he…”) appears twice but does not stall closure. No mixed metaphors; spatial choreography clean across dock, rope, chest. Minor paraphrase loops (“oceanic hush” variants) deduct.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Knot-as-text conceit is fresh, seed-constellation synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in lyric accumulative structure heightens mood without gimmickry; premise could not transplant unchanged. Fulgurite glass refunctions as both lightning-anchor and memory-vessel, a specific inflection rather than token symbol.</comment>
