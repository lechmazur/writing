<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The keeper’s interiority is lyrically rendered—his loose grip on memory is shown through synesthetic silence rather than exposition—but no contradictory impulse ever collides with the mission, so the arc is static observation rather than charged renunciation; the final line records silence rather than paying a new cost. The “witness without judgment” motive remains descriptive wallpaper; it never forces a micro-choice that forecloses a path.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as an Earned Stasis: the keeper records “silence births renewal,” accepting perpetual witness and relinquishing the chance to intervene, while the regenerative silence is felt as a conceptual cost inside the obsidian refuge. The accumulative/textural lens holds: each chamber thickens sensory density until the river reweights the premise; the origami swan pattern is taught early and paid off as the final reprise. Orientation is clean by line 6; no causal contradiction mars the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Library-as-body is tactile—vine-shelves breathing, phosphorescent thread pulsing—yet spatial choreography stays liminal; exact distances never constrain tactics. The obsidian refuge functions as micro-setting that crystallizes the final stance; its moonlit eye recharges every prior silence. Selective sensory hierarchy (scent of damp parchment, cold river fingers) mirrors the POV’s fading memory without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will the keeper enter the refuge and be altered?—is signaled early; the only tightening is the narrowing fissure that funnels him to the river, but the cost is conceptual (dissolving thought) rather than a live option foreclosed. Escalation is textural: silence thickens, moss retracts, the hymn accumulates; agency remains observant traversal rather than decisive trade-off. Pressure coheres under the accumulative lens yet never reaches a visible price that alters later tactics.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: silence as renewable memory-medium, not moral. The final line “silence births renewal” is the唯一的抽象语句，但其代价已由“thoughts dissolve like ink in water”在前文具身化，故未落入说教。母题未用象征打卡，而是通过感官层递的静强度重新赋义，留下可与之争辩的暧昧：见证是否为另一种介入？</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is distinct: vellum-draped body, loose memory as water slipping fingers, synesthetic silence “healed even broken thoughts.” Syntax elongates then compresses to mimic breath of cathedral-like library; no filter-verb clutter. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk is sidestepped; rhythmic control heightens pressure without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is lush yet information-dense: “regenerative silence that healed even broken thoughts” layers metaphor and stakes in one stroke. No synonym loops; metaphor vehicles stay internally consistent (swan folds = chant syllables). Occasional elevated diction—“conceptual repricing” territory—slightly overshoots POV lexicon but never snags closure. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with sentence-length variation; paragraph cuts are purposeful.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The obsidian silence-refuge reverses the typical “knowledge = power” archive trope; memory is surrendered, not hoarded. Origami swan as verbal GPS is fresh, though “moonlit eye” glints close to genre cliché. Risk is lyric stasis—little causal jeopardy—but the piece commits fully to its meditative premise without gimmick. Specificity of moss-thickened shelves and phosphorescent thread keeps the world from drifting into generic nowhere.</comment>
