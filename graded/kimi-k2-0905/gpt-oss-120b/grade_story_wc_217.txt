<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Interiority is lyrical but diffuse; the “warmly attentive heart” is declarative, not dramatized. No contradictory impulse undercuts the poet’s single-minded reverence, so pressure stays flat. The final vow is earnest but cost-free, keeping the arc in stasis rather than earned renunciation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds: feather-lily-verse pattern tightens into the burnished-hush tableau. Closure is a Charged Poise that reweights “incomplete” from flaw to hymn, with conceptual cost legible in the final star-image. Transitions are seamless; no Orientation Test penalty.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lagoon, reeds, mud, feather, amber light are filtered through the poet’s synesthetic bias; every visual note refracts back to “woven dawns.” Micro-setting (feather on lily) literally steadies the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography is immaculate; no white-room lapses.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—beauty in incompleteness—is signaled early and deepens via each ripple that “knits” rather than erases imperfection. Agency is contemplative, not tactical; the only cost is abstract (acceptance of perpetual incompletion), which softens visceral pressure. One meaningful tightening: gust snaps tension, forcing the poet to re-see flaw as hymn—this is sufficient under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges from recursive image-chain: shattered mirror → stitched tapestry → woven dawn → solitary star; no moralizing sentence distills it. The incomplete as luminous rebellion is reconfigured in the final floating feather-star, delivering CR without abstraction. Subtext lives in silence: the lagoon’s hush is the world assenting to imperfection.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person lyric attains a singular cadence: spondaic clusters (“burnished hush,” “woven dawns”) and internal rhyme that mimics tide-pulse. Perceptual signature is consistent—poet notices color as sound, surface as melody—without ever slipping into tourist catalog. Syntax grows incrementally more incantatory, mirroring the water’s knitting; no filter-verb bloat under peak pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Metaphors are dense yet coherent: “salt air settle like a gentle sigh” keeps physical logic; no mixed vehicles. Clause-length modulates from long tidal sweep to abrupt kite-snap fragments, propelling beats. Minor scaffold: “woven dawns” is repeated 7×; the pattern is taught early and pays off in closure image, so loop penalty waived.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Familiar trope—solitary artist healing nature via art—is reanimated through synesthetic physics and micro-ritual (spiral pebbles, feather-lily altar). Risk lies in near-pure lyric stasis; the piece bets everything on image-refrain and wins because the final star-feather reweights the premise. Would collapse if relocated from salt-lagoon specificity; that irreplaceability lifts the score.</comment>
