<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The lucid-dream chronicler’s ambition to “distill chaos into narrative” gives us a concrete motive and produces two visible micro-choices—unrolling the scroll, then writing “furiously” after the dream. Interiority is evocative (“the letters rearrange themselves as if jealous”) but still drifts toward performed nostalgia-speak (“feral nostalgia… jaded wonder”) rather than embodied contradiction. No enduring flaw or status shift is dramatized; the grave vision evaporates without forcing a tactic change, so the final stance feels more asserted than earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the grave dissolves into “a marker for the stories I have yet to tell,” reweighting the premise with conceptual cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each return to the scroll thickens the texture of memory-envy until the closing lift outside. Orientation is swift and the dream-to-wake transition is cleanly signaled. Causality is minor (no irreversible external change), but the ending image cleanly pays off the established pattern.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Pine scent, cracked window, fire-flicker on birch grain: sensory selects serve the POV’s archivist mindset and tighten the cabin into a lived-in tool rather than postcard. The scroll’s fibrous warmth in the final palm-charge literally carries the reconfiguration, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial anchors remain steady; only the snow-grave briefly ghost-loose, but that disorientation is taught early and reclaimed at closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—“trap the wild gusts of memory”—is declared early; pressure mounts by density, not external threat. The mid-story dream delivers the promised tightening (fox of mist dissolves on approach), reweighting the stake with felt loss. No visible resource is forfeited, so cost stays conceptual; still, the final image forecloses the earlier dread of being buried, turning the grave into generative space.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the scroll’s mutations rather than editorial comment: inscription turns to wing, archive turns to flight, burying turns to birthing. The nostalgic ache stays credibly ambivalent—smile and heart-ache simultaneous—so the piece avoids moralizing. Final reprise of “jaded wonder” crystallizes the tonal paradox without spelling a thesis, inviting reflective after-effect.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Voice is lyrically compressed (“timbered valleys… etched in frozen ground”) yet tethered to ranger-idiom perception. Rhythm modulates: long anaphoric swells for dream lift, staccato gasp at wake-up. No dialogue to test, but internal monologue stays consistent in diction and metaphor palette; no head-hop or filter-verb clutter. Patterned repetition (“I soar… I soar again”) is taught early and pays off in cadence at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Most sentences carry double duty (image + interior shift); occasional poetic overload (“feral nostalgia… jaded wonder”) slides toward template cadence but stops short of muddling causality. No paraphrase loops or mixed metaphors in peak beats. Minor scaffolding: “the letters rearrange themselves as if jealous…” could trim one qualifier, yet the figurative logic stays intact and the closure line stays clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The lucid-dream-archivist angle is fresh, and tying envy of past selves to a birch scroll that literally becomes flight gives a tangible twist to familiar nostalgia terrain. Risk lies in the lyric ellipsis, but coherence holds. Some phrasing edges toward workshop lyric (“stories burned into skin”) yet accumulates enough particular detail (fox of mist, sap-scented fibers) to feel individuated rather than borrowed.</comment>
