<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The star-watcher’s interiority is lyrical but thin; contradictory impulses (“distant suns” vs “earthbound calm”) are asserted, never dramatized under pressure. Her final “quiet keeper” identity is declared, not earned—no visible cost for the refusal to leave the grotto. Micro-choices are limited to lifting glass; the pearl of stillness never collides with a counter-desire, so the arc remains static.</question>

<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: spiral of glass + pearl = escalating density of calm that reweights the stake from personal longing to communal gift. Closure is a Charged Poise—“a miniature sun that could breathe without flame”—with undeniable social cost: she anchors herself forever as silent lantern-keeper. No orientation debt; who/where/when are legible by line 3. One minor scaffold: “reflectively vibrant” recycles four times without pattern payoff.</question>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Grotto-as-body is vivid and specific: emerald serpent walls, mist breath, water-heart pool; each echoes the glass spiral so environment constrains placement and charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible positions. Sensory economy favors tactile coolness of glass over visual catalog, matching the hushed mandate. Micro-setting qualifies: the altar-stone and spiral footprint literally hold the closure image.</question>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</question><comment>Dominant stake—“share light without fire”—is signaled early and tightens only once when the spiral is completed; cost is conceptual (perpetual silence) rather than visceral, keeping pressure in mid-band. Agency is accumulative: each polished facet adds density until the grotto itself exhales; no external antagonist or reversal needed under lyric lens. The tightening forecloses roaming the skies again, but the price is soft—no tangible loss on the page.</question>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</question><comment>Theme of wordless transmission emerges through iterated glass/light/pearl images rather than statement; final image reconfigures prior rooftop stargazing into grounded constellation. Subtext operates in hush and scent: zephyr bloom = intangible messenger. Avoids explicit moral; however, the “she taught the world” clause edges toward sermon, slightly dulling resonance. Still, complexity lingers: silence > flame, a counter-intuitive ethic earned by particulars.</question>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</question><comment>Third-person lyric voice sustains a hypnotic, oceanic rhythm with controlled anaphora (“She…”) that mirrors tidal return. Diction stays within star-watcher’s lexicon—no academic drift. No dialogue, so voice distinctiveness rests on perceptual signature: sky mirrored in glass, wind as scent. Filter verbs (“She felt”) are minimal; immediacy dominates. The prose itself becomes the pearl—smooth, cool, circular—fully integrated with concept.</question>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</question>
<comment>Synonym loop on “reflectively vibrant” (×4) and two “spiral” repeats near closing create minor scaffold, but artifacts never touch the final beat. Metaphors stay coherent: glass = tide-smooth sky shards; no mixed vehicles. Sentence rhythm breathes with action—short lifts, longer polishing strokes—propelling without pad. Opening and final lines anchor and resolve via image, not exposition. Overall clean with hairline repetition.</question>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Familiar trope—lonely mystic crafts lanterns—gains freshness via accumulative quiet: light without combustion as逆向 engineering of astronomy. Gem-polishing mechanics and zephyr-bloom scent are tactile twists that feel inevitable in hindsight. Risk taken in eschewing conflict or dialogue for lyric pattern; coherence sustained, so bonus applies. Could swap grotto for any cave, but glass-spiral + pearl synthesis is specific enough to resist full abstraction.</question>
