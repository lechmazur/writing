<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The tuner’s “infinitely patient” trait is asserted repeatedly but never tested by a contradictory impulse; he never hesitates, doubts, or pays a visible cost. His interiority is limited to lyrical paraphrases of the same calm resolve, so the promised internal conflict stays abstract. Because no flaw or tension surface, the arc is flat—an endurance performance rather than a change—so the closure feels more tableau than earned stasis.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a lyrical Resonant Reconfiguration: the “balance” is declared restored in the final image of fluttering awnings humming with the fork’s memory, giving a conceptual cost (the tuner walks away, his job done). Causality is poetic-accumulative rather than strict: imagined footsteps → stones reseat, repeated across paragraphs until the town breathes again. While this lens is internally consistent, the missing orientation (who is the tuner, where exactly, when is “before the collapse”?) blurs the stakes until mid-story; the waiver applies because the lyric pattern does pay off, but the early drift still weakens immediacy.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The archway, dust, pine-iron scent, and silver lattice of shadow supply tactile, selective detail that constrains the tuner’s ritual: he must wait for the first sunrise to strike the arch “in gold” before the fork can sound. Spatial choreography is clean—the fork touches dust, stones slide toward it, workers later arrive along the same cobblestone line. The setting evolves from ruin to resonate market, mirroring internal renewal without overt symbolism. Micro-setting (the fork as ground-level tuning point) functions as the pivot object, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake: restore shared balance between people and architecture. Pressure escalates only texturally—each imagined footfall thickens the texture of renewal—rather than narrowing real options; the tuner never faces an opposing force or risk of failure. Because no live option is foreclosed, the cost remains conceptual (he leaves, his music done) rather than viscerally felt. The lyric accumulation satisfies the lens but keeps tension gentle; a single meaningful tightening is present yet low-impact.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: balance as audible covenant between human rhythm and stone. Subtext lives in gesture—the fork’s hum replaces spoken contract—and final image of shoppers unconsciously guarding that balance avoids moralizing. The concept stays implicit; no character articulates a thesis, so the reader completes the metaphor. Return of the fork’s resonance in market breeze reweights earlier material, achieving quiet resonance without tidy moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person lyric voice maintains consistent distance and liturgical cadence, mirroring the tuner’s ritual patience. Syntax lengthens and contracts with the swell of imagined footsteps, creating perceptual signature. Diction stays within plausible arcane-philosopher lexicon; no POV leakage. No dialogue to test, so voice contamination risk is nil.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Prose is lush but disciplined: metaphor chains (“wild hush,” “lattice of silver”) recur purposefully, forming an accumulative pattern that pays off in the final hush. No mixed metaphors or synonym loops; each image advances atmosphere or stakes. Occasional elevated register (“consented to be rebuilt”) fits the mythic tone without jarring. Paragraph breaks mirror footfall beats, sustaining momentum; only minor scaffolding (“each imagined footfall” repeated) keeps this from the 9-tier.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>The “bell tuner resurrects ghost town via footfall rhythm” premise feels fresh, marrying sound-magic to urban revenant lore without conventional fantasy apparatus. Risk lies in the purely lyrical escalation, but commitment to the sonic metaphor carries through. Specific detail—ebony fork vibrating with every chime ever cast—prevents abstract generics. While the tuner himself is archetypal, the synthesis of setting, method, and theme is memorable.</comment>
