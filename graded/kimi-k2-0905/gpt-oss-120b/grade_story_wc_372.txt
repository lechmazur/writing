<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The chief’s “gently meticulous” trait is dramatized through the calibrated ritual of frequency-sampling and ledger-tracing, grounding her interiority in tactile choices. A contradictory impulse—her need for private meaning versus archival duty—surfaces only late, softening the cost of her final vow. The childhood backstory is floated but not activated as a micro-choice, so the internal conflict never compounds. Still, her embodied patience and the visible shoulder-weight of vows keep characterization above the mid-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the hovering lantern constellation reconfigures the silence into a map she can now carry out. Causality holds—each frequency shift tightens the possible temperature until only one pulse remains, forging the corridor of meaning. The Orientation Test is satisfied within the first 80 words via ice-pillar anchoring. Cost is legible in the final ledger-hum that now “resonates louder than any storm,” a persistent constraint she must physically bear away.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The library’s frost exhales actively: cloud-shards pierce the ceiling, spines hum data, marble pedestal drinks light—every surface pressures or enables her measurement ritual. Micro-setting (the quartz-veiled silence) doubles as both atmosphere and instrument, directly constraining the calibration tactic and charging the final image. Spatial choreography is immaculate; no floating books or impossible balconies. Because the environment literally transduces frequency into glow, it passes the 9+ gate by shaping the closing constellation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“conjure meaning from oblivion”—is signaled early and tightens once: the sky dissolving outside mirrors the risk that silence may never yield legible data. The protagonist’s agency is cerebral—each micro-adjustment of the device forecloses alternative frequencies—so the cost is conceptual rather than physical. A visible price is paid: the ledger pages now hum, a transformed artifact she must carry into a world whose illusions have already faded. Escalation is single-curve, but the final reweighting of silence into map is unmistakable.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the inversion of silence: archival detachment becomes intimate rescue, demonstrating that meticulous measurement can outlast cosmic erosion. No character verbalizes the thesis; the argument is borne by the transduction of vibration into light. The final whispered vow re-prices oblivion itself, turning it from threat into corridor. Ambiguity lingers—will anyone else read her map?—but the moral calculus remains legible and complex.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The narrator’s perceptual signature—“quartz hush,” “needles of revelation”—is sustained without synonym churn; syntax lengthens under calm, then compresses at the pulse beat. Distance stays shallow-third, never slipping into omniscient editorial. Rhythmic control is purposeful; e.g., the triple appositive in “clouded until…surrounding silence” mirrors the slow stacking of data. Voice is distinctive yet transparent enough to let the concept shine.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose carries high density: each sentence layers sensory data, metaphor, and causal nugget—e.g., “each measured degree whispered a promise back” simultaneously advances plot, theme, and temperature reading. Figurative language is patterned (ice, light, resonance) and pays off in the lantern constellation, avoiding mixed-metaphor penalties. Minor scaffold: two adjacent “each” anaphora beats could compress, but they occur early and do not ghost the closure. Rhythm modulates from hush to single pulse without drumbeat monotony.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Frozen cloud-library + frequency-based temperature measurement fuses archival sci-fi with lyric elegy, a synthesis that feels specific and inevitable. The luminous-vow concept is not merely ornamental; it re-weights the meaning of silence itself, offering a fresh angle on memory versus oblivion. Risk in structure—quiet ending, no antagonist—elevates stakes by forcing conceptual cost to carry the climax. While echoes of Borges-style infinite libraries exist, the acoustic metrology twist and personal childhood stake transform the trope sufficiently.</comment>
