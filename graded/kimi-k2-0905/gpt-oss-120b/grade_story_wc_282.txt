<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interiority is lyrical and consistent; the “voice of the unknown” motive is reiterated rather than tested under pressure, so the final crystallization feels foretold, not earned through visible contradiction or micro-choice. No embodied emotion contradicts the serene competence—she never doubts, missteps, or pays a price that changes her stance. The arc is a smooth accumulation, not a crucible; competent serenity dominates, so the closure lacks the bite of cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each droplet adds density until the amber pulse reweights meaning. Closure is a Charged Poise—the caves “sang” and the leaf becomes beacon—cost is conceptual (she remains solitary, voice now externalized), but the price is abstract rather than viscerally felt. Orientation is swift; no causal reversals are required by design, yet the final reconfiguration lands cleanly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sensory selection is POV-driven and purposeful: scent, pressure, breath recorded by tool; droplets as lanterns; elm veins aligning with mineral filaments—every detail feeds the mapping act. The cave’s breathing gusts and amber shimmer constrain droplet flight and timing, integrating setting into action. Micro-setting (leaf, basin, tool) directly shapes the final beacon image, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—becoming the voice of the unknown—is signaled early; pressure escalates by accretion of sensory data, not narrowing options. No reversal or trade-off is dramatized; the leaf’s ascent is culmination, not sacrifice. Cost is conceptual (perpetual solitude as amplifier), but because the map maker never hesitates or risks loss, the tightening is gentle, not urgent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme—listening as authorship—emerges through mapping metaphors and the final inversion: she hears herself reflected in stone. Subtext resides in the silence she amplifies, not in stated thesis. The ending reweights the leaf from relic to oracle without moralizing, achieving resonant ambiguity. No tidy maxim is offered; the caves’ song is invitation, not answer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person lyric voice maintains consistent distance and perceptual signature: light as traceable current, sorrow as heat hue. Syntax elongates then compresses with droplet rise, mirroring breath. No head-hop; diction stays within map-maker’s lexicon. The final “she smiled” is earned tonal release, not tacked on.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Rhythm modulates from cavernous clauses to short pulse beats at lantern merger. Figurative layering is dense yet coherent—no mixed metaphors. Occasional loftiness (“factually mystical”) is the lone register drift, but it is early, flagged, and absorbed. No loops, scaffold, or filler; every sentence advances image or pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Premise fuses paleobotany, data art, and post-human quiet into a fresh lyric cartography. The heat-map emotion method and fossil-oracle transition feel inevitable yet non-obvious. Risk—entire plot is quiet inscription—heightens stakes without gimmickry. No derivative echo; the synthesis is singular.</comment>
