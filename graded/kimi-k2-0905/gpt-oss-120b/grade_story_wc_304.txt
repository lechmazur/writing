<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Interiority is lyrical but generic; “lucidly watchful” is asserted, never tested by contradiction or sensory overload. No micro-choice after the brush-stroke climax—she simply “whispered a promise” without visible cost or altered stance. The beautician-mortician duality is never dramatized; only the mortician half appears. Earned stasis is hinted but not paid for on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the emerald holds the last spark and is placed as beacon—cost is the aurora’s dimming, legible in the image. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern-building in static → lattice → capture → placement, each beat adding density. Orientation clear by 80 words; no teleporting props. However, no causal tightening mid-scene; escalation is one gentle slope, not a meaningful narrowing.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Skyborne grotto, moonstone slab, and aurora ribbons are tactile and POV-filtered; cold gusts echo the woven rhythm, charging the final image. Selective sensory hierarchy—visual and haptic dominate, appropriate to a beautician’s gaze. Setting constrains only atmospherically; no spatial hazard or resource limit alters her tactics. Still, the environment is inseparable from the closure glow—without the aurora’s last tremble the beacon could not exist.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—save final spark—signaled early; pressure is existential but static. No reversal or trade-off: she succeeds on first attempt, aurora obligingly dims. Escalation is aesthetic (brighter flare) rather than tactical; options never narrow. Cost is cosmic, not personal—felt but not re-weighted to her immediate choices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme of preservation-as-covenant emerges through imagery, not statement: static patterns = forgotten stories, emerald = archived light. Final image reweights prior material—beacon promises future witness, answering the oblivion threat. Avoids moralizing; resonance is atmospheric, not didactic. Yet theme remains monolithic; no counter-readings or character-specific irony complicate the covenant.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person lyric voice maintains consistent distance; diction (“radiant hush,” “threshold of stillness”) is patterned and purposeful. Perceptual signature is cosmological-beautician: skin, pulse, lattice, aurora—details only this narrator would couple. Rhythm swells and ebbs with brush-stroke cadence, no head-hopping. No dialogue to test voice distinction; internal cadence sustains the hush without monotony.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies; no template cadence runs. Figurative language is dense but coherent—vehicles (flower seeking dawn, silent lake) stay within auroral lexicon. One paraphrase loop: “radiant hush” echoed as “luminous hush” in adjacent clauses. No mixed metaphors or register drift. Information density high; each sentence advances atmosphere or action.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Fusion of mortician precision with cosmic salvage feels fresh; “patterns in static” as weave-able light-lattice is lovely conceptual leap. Risk is lyric stasis—plot barely moves—but the gamble serves the accumulative design. Not a near-echo of famous scene; voice is singular. Could push further by complicating the beautician-mortician tension instead of sublimating it into ritual.</comment>
