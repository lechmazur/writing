<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is vivid—her pulse against the pane, the warmth of the shard—but the “death-certificate error survivor” label is asserted, not dramatized; we never see her fight bureaucracy, only absorb a summary. The porcelain shard’s vibration and final warmth give embodied micro-choices, yet the ghost’s confession feels handed to her rather than wrested through a visible flaw or mistake. Motive coherence slides: she moves from fixing records to cosmic wisdom without a beat that shows the shift cost her anything on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly with resonant reconfiguration: the shard warm in her coat, heartbeat synchronized, aurora above—felt cost is legible. Causality under Accumulative/Textural lens holds; ink-patterns and shard resonance tighten rather than twist plot. Orientation is anchored by word 80. The bureaucratic error revelation is delivered by ghost-whisper, not probed by Mara’s agency, so the decisive change is more receipt than earned turn, keeping it sub-9.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>“Opal observatory beneath snowfall” is tactile and specific; glass domes, humming server, ink on cold metal—each detail filters through Mara’s technician eye and guides her ritual. The porcelain shard operates as micro-setting, constraining the ink algorithm and later warming against her skin, charging the final image. Spatial choreography is clean; no geography drift. Environment never blocks or resources never fail, so constraint is atmospheric not tactical, capping short of 9.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reclaim her living status from digital death—is signaled early. Pressure escalates via pattern-deepening: ink sigils, shard resonance, ghost whispers—each adds density rather than new external obstacles. The tightening is perceptual, not option-narrowing; she never risks real failure or forfeiture. Cost is conceptual (awareness of systemic flaw) not visceral, keeping it under 8.8 band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly: systemic quantification of life vs. lived embodiment. The ghost’s cold tally and the shard’s eventual warmth reweight the premise without moralizing. Subtext stays in gesture—ink fleeting, porcelain enduring—avoiding abstract statement. Final aurora image invites reflection on fallible archives; complexity acknowledged, not resolved into tidy lesson.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Voice is dense, lyrical, scientist-poet hybrid: “frozen lantern,” “indifferent sky,” “shimmering cascade of code”—diction stays within Mara’s observatory lexicon. Syntax lengthens in calmer beats, fractures during ink ritual, mirroring pulse. No dialogue, so no convergence risk. Occasional elevated phrases (“conceptual repricing”) flirt with register drift but remain coherent to her reflective stance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Rhythm varies without algorithmic pattern; sentence length and paragraphing breathe with scene temperature. Metaphors are sustained—ink as star-field, shard as tuning fork—no mixed vehicles. One scaffold pair: “ink…ink” in adjacent clauses, but it advances image. No loops, synonym churn, or filter-verb stacks; clarity preserved under pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Fusion of quantum ghost & bureaucratic death-glitch feels fresh; not a trope template. Porcelain shard as algorithmic stylus is specific invention, not quirky ornament. Risk in lyric density pays off—closure image recharges earlier motifs. Premise could transfer to another setting, but observatory-in-snow and ink-sigil method are irreplicable particulars anchoring the vision.</comment>
