<question>1</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Mara’s “cautious exuberance” is named repeatedly but never shown through contradictory in-scene choices; her ledger of silent-contributor stories is declared, not dramatized, so the promised internal conflict stays abstract. The single high-stakes micro-choice—placing the locket on the balcony—feels generous yet costs her nothing we can see; no foreclosed path, no visible trade-off. Interiority drifts into thematic label-speak (“cycles of compassion,” “shared narrative”) rather than embodied tension. Relationships remain off-stage; the lighthouse keeper is a courteous helper, not a crucible, so status and emotional risk are muted.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a soft Conceptual Repricing: the locket glows on the balcony while townspeople read fishermen’s stories, implying a new communal valence. Causal linkage is loose—Mara’s walk and speech act accomplish the symbolic return, but the story never tests her shrewdness or risks her profit ledger, so cost is conceptual rather than felt. Mosaic structure (library → pier → lighthouse → library) is legible and pattern-taught early; transitions are anchored by sensory callbacks (brine, starlight, paper scent). Orientation holds throughout; no lens ambiguity at the end.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Micro-settings (library crates, pier planks, balcony rail) are tactile and bias-filtered through Mara’s cargo-eye; atlases-as-cargo neatly fuses vocation with moment. Sensory hierarchy skews visual, but salt-and-ink scent threads the shards, preventing white-room syndrome. Starlight and wind are used as active agents (scattering light, carrying shine) that charge the final image rather than decorate it. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible object positions across the four quick moves.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—returning the locket to complete a compassion cycle—is signaled early but never tightens; Mara’s options do not narrow, nor does she sacrifice anything tangible. Escalation is accumulative/textural: each shard adds a new contributor story, deepening texture rather than pressing choice. The single reversal (mother died at sea) is revealed, not tested; it deepens sentiment without altering tactics. Cost is symbolic (locket released), not felt by Mara, so pressure plateaus rather than peaks.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through motif accretion—misdelivered envelope, silent fishermen, locket photo—rather than overt thesis, avoiding final-paragraph moralizing. The reweighting is quiet: anonymous sailors’ stories move from unheard to publicly read, a conceptual repricing of communal memory. Ambiguity is present but thin; no counter-reading challenges the nobility of the gesture. Emotional after-effect is gentle rather than piercing because the protagonist’s personal stake remains abstract.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Third-person narration keeps a consistent lyric distance, with perceptual signature filtered through Mara’s cargo-broker eye (“crates of atlases,” “cargo of kindness”). Syntax is fluid, rhythms vary, and no filter-verb clusters stall immediacy. Dialogue is minimal; when the keeper speaks, his diction is indistinct from Mara’s narrative voice, but the brevity limits contamination. No head-hopping; POV remains anchored to Mara throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose is lush but controlled; figurative language clusters in descriptive beats rather than high-pressure turns, so density does not obscure causality. Occasional hyphenated coinages (“secret tide,” “quiet shine”) read as intentional lyricism rather than thesaurus drift. No paraphrase loops or template cadence; sentence openings vary. Opening and closing lines are image-driven and ear-tested, providing resonant bookends without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The premise—misdelivered envelope sparks communal reclamation of lost maritime voices—is fresh, avoiding sentimentality by keeping grief collective rather than individual. Transformation is present: silent contributors become audible through Mara’s ledger, though the mechanism is declared off-stage. Risk-taking stays moderate; mosaic form is conventional at this length, and no structural or perspectival gamble heightens stakes. Specific coastal details (sardines, salt-stung atlases) prevent generic anywhere-port setting.</comment>
