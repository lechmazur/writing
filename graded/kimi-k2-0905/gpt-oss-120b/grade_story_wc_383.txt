<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Lira’s interior contradiction—skeptic vs. believer in her own resonance archive—is declared repeatedly but never dramatized in a choice that costs her anything. The “charmed skeptic” label floats untested; no moment forces her to wager belief against proof. Embodied emotion is lush but generic (“ghostly resolve settles within her”) rather than specific to her body or risk. Micro-choices are absent; the seashell is lifted, ledger filled, but these actions neither narrow nor foreclose options, so the arc feels observational, not earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Closure reaches for Charged Poise—shell and sunrise merge, solitude reframed as lighthouse—but the cost is only asserted, not shown (“tragically radiant reminder”). Causality is lyric-accumulative: each dusk listen adds a fragment, but the final sunrise does not tighten or foreclose; it merely decorates the prior accumulation. Orientation is clear by line 3; no penalty. The lens holds as Accumulative/Textural, yet the ending image lacks a visible price or constraint that reshapes future action, so the reconfiguration feels conceptual, not lived.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The velvet garden is rendered with synesthetic richness (color as fabric, scent as sound) and stays consistently filtered through Lira’s attention. Micro-setting is the cracked seashell, whose broken glow is revisited at closure; however, it never physically constrains her movements or choices—she could still leave without it—so it charges the image symbolically, not tactically. Spatial choreography is clear in a single continuous scene. Weather/light shift from violet dusk to amber dawn is tracked cleanly and mirrors internal shift, satisfying the 9+ gate for environment charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Stakes are declared—translate isolation into independence—but isolation is never threatened or tested on-page; no external force tries to stop her archiving, so pressure is purely atmospheric. One micro-turn: seashell’s silence at sunrise signals completion, yet this is signaled, not driven by her agency. No credible loss (time, tool, social credit) is risked or paid. Escalation is poetic density increase, not option narrowing; under Acculative lens this is acceptable, but the absence of visible cost keeps the score mid-band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through recurrent images—shell, ledger, garden light—shifting from quarantine to self-archive. Subtext relies on lyrical echo rather than dramatized contradiction, so insight feels asserted (“solitude became a source of strength”) rather than wrested. The final sentence’s “new archive waiting to be filled” offers quiet conceptual repricing, resisting moral statement, hence no final-paragraph penalty. Ambiguity is present but thin because no prior scene work complicates the equation; solitude→independence reads as single-note triumph, not tensioned duality.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Voice is lushly cadenced, ornamented, and consistent—“velvet garden,” “tragically radiant glow,” “ghostly resolve”—creating a perfumed lyrical signature that sustains reader immersion. Perceptual signature is biased toward synesthetic abstraction rather than concrete body, but it is distinctive and controlled. No dialogue, so no convergence risk. Experimental compression (“archive of silenced sighs”) is taught early and paid off in final ledger image; pattern remains legible under Accumulative lens. Register stays elevated throughout, matching the spell-lit atmosphere without drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade>
<comment>Rhythmic control is strong—long breathy sentences for dusk, shorter clauses at sunrise—but figurative density is saturated; nearly every sentence carries a metaphor, risking purple haze. No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected. Mixed metaphors occasionally clash: “roses unfurling like pale hands” beside “garden breathed” within two lines, yet garden as organism sustains, so logic holds. Information density is moderate; some lines repeat emotional gist in new imagery. Closure beat is clear despite ornament, so penalty stays minor.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Premise—using resonance structures to archive quarantined memory via broken singing shell—is fresh, avoiding standard pandemic tropes. Lyrical archive-as-science feels novel and specific to this narrator. Risk is taken in elevated continuous lyric mode; coherence is maintained, so +0.3 bonus applies. However, the emotional arc (loneliness→self-reliance) remains generic at core; swap names and setting and the beat map holds, limiting peak originality.</comment>
