<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara’s vocation and grief-exhuming mission are vivid, but interiority drifts into lyrical abstraction (“lucid unrest,” “interlaced hush”) that tells emotional state rather than embodying contradiction under pressure; the mask/net/needle triad externalizes stakes yet no micro-choice after the first knot visibly risks or costs her anything, so the renunciation feels pre-decided rather than earned in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the final winding of the single thread into the mask reweights the premise—grief is not erased but re-housed—and the starlight dimming supplies visible cost; Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout, each knot-release thickening the ambient hush; orientation is swift and spatial logic remains clean; causality is internal and ritual, not external plot, satisfying the lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prism sanctuary, starlight, and water echoes create a tactile micro-setting; the net’s dark river and the needle’s silver pulse anchor every beat; environment actively refracts light quieter as ritual proceeds, so setting constrains outcome; only the “velvet case” finale slips into generic prop, preventing 9.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—quiet the drowned spirits—signals early; pressure escalates through sensory dimming and starlight fade, a textural deepening that reweights cost; no external opposition or reversal, but ritual fidelity supplies sufficient tension; cost is atmospheric rather than personal, keeping it below 8.5.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of silence as restorative vessel emerges imagistically without moralizing; the secret’s final whisper crystallizes the concept that grief must be housed, not silenced; ambiguity lingers—spirits settled yet still present—inviting reflection; slight over-reliance on abstract noun pairs (“lucid unrest,” “interlaced hush”) keeps it from full resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays tightly filtered through Elara’s perceptual bias—she feels the needle “pulse like a heartbeat” and notices light “settle like dust”; diction remains consistent, elevated yet ritual-appropriate; no dialogue to test voice distinction, but internal cadence modulates with ritual breath; minor template cadence in “each knot… each memory…” lines prevents 9.0.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is lush yet information-dense; metaphoric layering (“dark river,” “muted hymn”) advances atmosphere without clutter; occasional adjectival stacks (“cascade of muted colors”) slightly dilute peak beats; no loops, no scaffold, grammar clean; final sentence achieves earned hush.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Ritual of net-unraveling to mend broken masks is fresh myth-making; starlit prism sanctuary feels specific, not borrowed; concept of silence accumulated by needle is non-obvious and drives closure; risk lies in high lyric mode itself—successfully executed, so +0.3 risk bonus applied.</comment>
