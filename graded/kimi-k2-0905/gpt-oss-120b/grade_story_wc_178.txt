<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Nabu’s thrift and star-hunger collide in every beat; the grain-ration memory (“measured every grain of barley”) directly motivates the midnight risk with the tile. Interiority stays concrete, never diagnostic—his humor at the “universe’s tight ledger” is an embodied micro-choice under pressure. The final stance—still counting, now blessed—earns its hush of cost by foreclosing a return to ordinary poverty. No contradictory impulse is dramatized in-scene, only stated, keeping it just shy of 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the violet bridge reweights the palace, grain stores, and Nabu’s future charts in one image; “cosmic ledger” is the visible cost. Causal chain holds—tile discovery → schematic translation → celestial alignment → covenant click—each step narrows options. The lens is Causal, unbroken to the last line. Orientation is anchored by 50 words; no ambiguity, no cap triggered.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The crumbling balcony, dust-laden archives, and wind-chimed arches are filtered through Nabu’s frugal gaze—every stone is a potential tool, every echo a data point. The tile’s etchings and the violet bridge function as micro-setting that literally constrains the final ritual. Sensory hierarchy is tight: taste of dust, sound of prayer, sight of violet light—no cataloging. Palace geography stays coherent; no impossible moves.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“seal a covenant with the unknown” is signaled early and tightens when the inter-regime window threatens to close. The meaningful turn is the final tracing that fuses Jupiter, Venus, moon, and tile into one irreversible signature; cost is the palace inhaling dusk, grain stores forever re-ledgered. Agency is continuous: sketching, aligning, tracing—each action forecloses retreat. Pressure is coherent under Causal lens; no coincidence resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the inversion of scarcity into surplus: frugality becomes the very engine of cosmic access. Subtext lives in the tile’s hum and the market’s later quiet prosperity—no moral is stated. The final image of glyphs beside constellations reweights the premise without sermon. Ambiguity lingers: whose prayers are answered, and at what unseen tariff?</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is lean, numerate, tinged with dry astral humor—“empirically ironic” is the narrator’s own register, not a label. Syntax mirrors a mind that counts even while rapt: tight clauses, comma splices that feel like star hops. No head-hopping; POV stays locked to Nabu. Dialogue absent, so no penalty.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is scaffold-free; no loops, no synonym churn. Metaphors are spare and coherent—“bridge of light” extends the ledger metaphor without spillage. Information density high: one sentence often sets time, tool, and mythic weight (“between regimes...he aligned...”). Rhythm accelerates into the violet click, then exhales with the palace’s inhale—exact cadence match to closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The fusion of accounting with theurgy feels non-obvious and specific to this voice. Magic-square cosmology is fresh, yet grounded in Babylonian numerology without exposition dump. Frugal astronomer is not a stock archetype; his flaws complicate rather than enable. Risk is quiet—lyric schematic ritual—but coherence never wavers.</comment>
