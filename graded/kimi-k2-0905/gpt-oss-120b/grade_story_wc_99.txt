<question>1</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Tutor’s vow is stated, not dramatized; no contradictory impulse surfaces in-scene. Micro-choices (placing compass, reciting) are ceremonial, not pressured. Closure cost is diffuse, not personal—apology exhaled into wind leaves tutor unchanged. Interiority stays abstract (“sensed the tides…turning”) rather than embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of lace-knots + compass hue deepens toward cerulean glow. Closure achieves Charged Poise—compass points east, island inhales, sorrow diffused; cost is communal, not individual, but legible. Causality soft: why spoken lace affects compass is occult, not taught, so beat-by-beat traction thin. Orientation clear by ~100 words; no meaningful tightening inside 800-word span—mood accretes, options never narrow.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Petrichor-scented wind, brass compass glints, bonsai leaves rustle—selective sensory triad anchors micro-setting. Knoll, stone, moss form coherent spatial triangle; choreography minimal but clean. Weather (post-rain breeze) directly enables “diffusion” action. Environment does not constrain tutor’s choices; compass hue could arise anywhere, so setting never charges final image—caps entry below 8.8.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—release island’s regret—declared early, but no external or internal force opposes tutor; pressure flatlines. Mid-text “needle quivered” promises test, yet no trade-off, risk, or irreversible choice follows; escalation plateaus. Agency limited to ritual speech; absence of resistance makes victory foregone. Felt cost is atmospheric (cerulean sky) not personal, so tension stays ambient.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme of unspoken apology emerges through recurring compass hue rather than lecture. Final image—sky mirroring regret yet promising forgiveness—offers resonant reconfiguration without moral. Lace pattern as pedagogy hints at repair-through-attention, but remains symbol rather than dramatized insight. Subtext would sharpen if tutor’s own unspoken apology were jeopardized.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays fixed; perceptual signature slow, tidal, consonant with tutor. Syntax elongates via subordinate clauses, mirroring measured tide; diction (“cerulean regret,” “petrichor”) borders precious but stays consistent. No dialogue, so voice judged on narrative texture alone—rhythm controlled, no head-hopping. Near-purple moments (“voice a measured tide”) risk overwriting yet pattern-taught early.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>Figurative density high but patterned; mixed metaphors (“lace instructions,” “tide of remembrance”) coexist without collision. Loops appear: “rhythmically placid” repeated conceptually; “diffuse/diffusing” 3× in closing paragraph. Scaffold evident in stacked participial phrases that slow momentum. Clarity intact, but cadence grows hypnotic rather than propulsive—acceptable for accumulative design yet caps excellence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Fusion of bonsai praxis, ghost-compass, and apology-as-hue feels idiosyncratic, not catalog-fresh. Ritual speech-as-lace is lovely but abstract, reducing surprise. Still, synthesis of horticultural patience with maritime loss creates memorable tonal signature. Risk level moderate: concept leans on lyric accretion rather than causal twist.</comment>
