<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The medium’s interiority is lyrically sustained, but her contradictory impulses are stated rather than dramatized (she “realized” rather than acts). The shard-warming beat gives embodied cost, yet the final shift to “fierce tenderness” is summary, not a micro-choice under pressure. No second character means relationship crucible is N/A; the arc is a solitary renunciation that earns its hush, but the absence of visible flaw-compounded mistake keeps it just shy of 8-band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative-textural lens holds: each beat layers condensation, song, and shard-glow until the apology vaporizes into fireflies—an earned Charged Poise. Orientation is lyric-delayed yet justified; the “mangrove labyrinth” serves the final image, so waiver applies. Cost is legible in the shard’s warmth and the firefly transference; persistent constraint (moonlight healing) shapes every tactical placement of the shard. One soft spot: the breeze that knocks the glass is external coincidence, not an because/therefore linkage, preventing 9.0.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mangrove roots, glass pane, lagoon surface, and shard micro-setting all constrain footwork and sightlines; the final firefly veil is inseparable from the water-mirror. Sensory hierarchy is POV-filtered: humidity narrows to “whispered verses,” moonlight to “liquid glass.” No spatial drift; bodies track from labyrinth clearing to lagoon edge. Environment charges the final image directly, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—release or retain unsent letters—tightens when condensation forms the first writable surface; escalation is textural density, not causal reversals. Agency is present: she chooses to evoke, then to let the breeze scatter. Cost is the shard’s heat and the dissolving letters, but because coincidence delivers the scatter, the price feels half-earned. Still, the firefly transference reweights the stake under accumulative lens.</answer>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Theme emerges through the motif of vaporizable script: silence is not absence but transmutable matter. Subtext is in the shard’s warmth—apology needs vessel, not voice. Final image of fireflies as “bright promise” reweights prior refusal to speak into luminous potential, avoiding moralizing. The hymn-seal risks thematic echo but stays just implicit enough.</comment>
<question>6</question><<grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person lyric voice maintains perceptual signature: “roots intertwined like whispered verses” is narrator-medium fusion. Rhythm modulates—long liquid sentences for hymn, fragments at “shard pulsed.” No head-hopping; compression (“unsent letters she kept inside her mind”) is taught early and paid off. Diction stays within mystic-liminal register without register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High figurative density is patterned from first sentence; mixed metaphor risk (“living hymn,” “liquid glass”) is licensed by lyric mode. No scaffold loops; each sentence advances image or pressure. Clarity intact at closure. One overripe line—“fierce tenderness rise within, a paradox of strength and gentle surrender”—triggers minor purple flag, keeping it sub-9.</comment>
<question>8</question><<grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: apology as condensate that must be evaporated and re-collected by spirits. Mangrove-plus-gargoyle shard pairing is non-obvious yet coherent. Risky lyric structure pays off in firefly image. Slight deduction for hymn-spirals that echo familiar eco-mystic trope without full inversion.</comment>
