<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Lone "otherworldly sentimentalist" remains a poetic cipher; no interior contradiction or embodied emotion complicates her vow. The gear-handling beats are ritual, not choice, so cost feels aesthetic rather than personal. The final smile is graceful but not earned by prior micro-choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure is a lyric Conceptual Repricing: the glowing soil re-weights light-from-math as love's viable transit, with ancestral cost implied by "every generation’s sigh." Accumulative lens holds: each sonar return deepens density rather than causal plot. Orientation clear by line 4; one soft transition inside garden; no meaningful tightening inside 800 words, so escalation is cadence-growth, not option-loss.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Setting is the story: nebula-garden, petals-as-lanterns, crystalline walls, pulsar axis. Sensory triage favors hush, slow drift, ribbon-light—all braided into action (gear placed, sonar released). The gear itself functions as micro-setting, constraining alignment and payoff; garden mist answers sonar, charging the final glow. Spatial choreography stays dream-coherent; no props teleport.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—share light without fire—stays legible; pressure is atmospheric, not tactical, so escalation = resonance amplification rather than option foreclosure. The only narrowing is aesthetic: "garden mourned the loss of fire," but no live alternative path is sacrificed. Cost accrues as ancestral sorrow, felt conceptually; visible price would raise score higher.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges as light = memory + math + love, never sloganized. The gear’s infinite approximation becomes a bridge, re-figured in the closing filament; no character moralizes. Troubling serenity complicates the glow with "shadows of forgotten wars," keeping ambiguity alive. After-effect is quiet wonder rather than message.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lyric-accumulative voice owns consistent poetic diction, rhythmic anaphora, and synesthetic perception ("violet hush," "star-woven vines"). Filter verbs are minimal; metaphor density is high yet pattern-taught from first sentence, paid off in final ribbon image. No dialogue, so no voice convergence; single POV maintains dreamy distance without head-hop. Compression sacrifices immediacy but serves textural aim.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Line-level craft is lush yet controlled: assonant cadences, varied sentence lengths, no scaffold loops. Occasional stacked modifiers ("slow, mournful tides") flirt with purple but stay in voice. Information per sentence high; each image advances atmosphere or symbolic layering. No mis-tagged pronouns or tense drift; opening and closing lines anchor and recharge motif cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Premise fuses cosmic botany with steampunk math-gear into sonar love-beacon—fresh synthesis. Recurrent falling petals and infinite-gear create inevitability in hindsight. Risk lies in lyric stasis, but cadence escalation rescues momentum. Feels like no other story; emotional core is tenderness without fire, avoiding genre clichés.</comment>
