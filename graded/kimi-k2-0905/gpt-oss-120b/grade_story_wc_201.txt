<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Lira’s survivor status and embodied trauma responses feel authentic; the mask strap as tactile anchor keeps memory present in muscle. Interiority stays concrete—“lattice of bruised memories” is shown via flinch reactions and foot-fall math. The final renunciation of the strap lands as earned stasis because every violet flash has visibly tightened the choice. The healing equation is stated once, but it grows from prior sensory data, so the epiphany avoids label-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: each violet pulse deepens pattern rather than forcing causal turns. Orientation is swift—UV forest, post-anesthesia body, mask strap all appear by line 4. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the strap’s shift from shackle to beacon reweights the entire pattern, cost is the lingering burn on skin. No teleporting props; strap and light states track cleanly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Forest is built from interactive detail—humming crystal roots supply digits for the equation, bark pulse times her breath. UV light acts as both atmosphere and antagonist, searing skin to earn the next memory-bite. Pewter strap serves as micro-setting that constrains stance and finally reconfigures meaning. Spatial logic holds: every glow and footfall is tethered to Lira’s enhanced proprioception.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—derive mercy formula—declared early and tightened by each cost-flash. One meaningful deepening: when violet light softens to amber after she whispers the equation, the forest’s acceptance forecloses retreat; remaining option is to carry the formula outward. Price is legible on skin and in strap warmth. Escalation is accumulative rather than reversing, sufficient for 750-word arc.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from iterative equation-building rather than thesis: mercy = suffered / remembered. Subtext lives in strap’s metallurgical change—pewter → almost golden—implying transmutation without moralizing. Final image answers the thematic question by showing the cost of remembering rather than declaring it. Ambiguity remains: formula is personal, not universal, inviting reader algebra.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person intimate stays locked to Lira’s damaged proprioceptive filter: sentences lengthen under UV glare, compress during brace. Diction—“lattice of bruised memories,” “ultraviolet penance”—is character-bound, not authorial flourish. No head-hopping; forest perception is always routed through her enhanced kinesthetic sense. Rhythm mirrors heartbeat cadence noted in text, reinforcing voice-as-body.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies: stacked modifiers in glow descriptions accelerate toward brace moments, then short sentences mirror recovery breath. No synonym loops; “violet” recurs but each time reweighted by new sensory data. Metaphors stay coherent—light as scalpel, equation as heartbeat—without mixed vehicles. Final line’s color shift lands clean, no scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: torture-survivor turned cartographer of mercy via hallucinated UV math forest. Proprioceptive navigation and crystalline root-music feel specific to this world. Risk—equating mercy to arithmetic—could flatten, but embodied burns keep abstraction visceral. Transformation test fails if relocated to ordinary woods; UV-for-memory exchange is non-portable.</comment>
