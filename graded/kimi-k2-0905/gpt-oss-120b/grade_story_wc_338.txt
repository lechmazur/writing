<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The map framer’s “methodically curious” trait is shown through tactile micro-choices—aligning projector, tracing glyphs—rather than label-speak, giving her a perceptual signature. Interiority stays concrete (“feeling the ragged paper like a wound”) and contradictory impulses (awe vs fear) coexist in-scene. The final renunciation—accepting the tear as portal—carries visible cost in the “soft glow” that leaves her recording alone, an earned stasis. Yet the absence of any second on-page character keeps social-status crucible and relationship pressure off the table, capping depth at this length.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the projected overlay reweights the tear from flaw to portal, charging the final image with undeniable conceptual cost. The causal chain holds—curiosity → footage alignment → glyph revelation → chapel re-opening—each step narrowing options under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“rain-scoured fresco vault”) and the pattern of rainfall as clock keeps time legible. One minor causality bump: the projector repositioning is narrated as sure success rather than tested, but it occurs before the final image so the cost remains felt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>The vault’s wet-plaster smell and thunder echo are filtered through a cartographer’s bias—she notices cracks, fissures, alignment—so setting constrains her tool-use and final stance. The henge exists off-page as environmental pressure, its “pulse” mirrored in the fresco’s glisten, integrating macro and micro setting. Spatial choreography is clean: projector, map, stone archway stay tracked across small moves. Weather operates as both clock and tonal mirror, shifting from purple bruise to pallid drizzle, a pattern break that reweights the stakes.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—can empathy re-open the sealed boundary—tightens once: the moment map and footage bleed together, foreclosing the option to leave the tear unexplored. Agency is intellectual (attention, alignment) yet carries felt cost: she is “trembling,” speaks to emptiness, ends alone recording. No external antagonist is needed; pressure accrues through pattern density—rain, cracked stone, glyphs—until silence itself becomes the adversary. Cost is visible but not irrevocably priced; hence entry to 8.8+ remains just shy.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from concrete returns: rain, stone crack, map tear—each re-weighted from damage to doorway, making the final glow an unspoken answer to “can silence be read?” No character sermonizes; the thesis is imaged, not stated. Ambiguity lingers—future framers will retest—so complexity survives. The only soft trace of “shielded openness” appears verbatim once, a micro-echo that barely grazes the 0.4 deduction line, keeping score high.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person tight stays inside the framer’s perceptual filter—“notebook tucked under trembling arm,” “she believed”—with no head-hop. Syntax grows clipped under pressure: “She paused. She repositioned.” Filter verbs (“seemed to pulse”) are minimal and voice-motivated, keeping immediacy. Diction—“vellum,” “pallid drizzle,” “stone echo”—remains within a mapmaker’s lexicon. Rhythmic control peaks in the final breath-like vault glow, a charged poise earned by prior pattern.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening, creating rain-like cadence without algorithmic repetition. Metaphors (“stone echo,” “bruised purple sky”) stay coherent and local to the henge/vault world. No loops or synonym churn; each clause adds new sensory or causal information. Minor scaffold: “the rain outside drummed…each tap a reminder” could trim, but it occurs early and does not dull the final image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The synthesis—cartographer + ancient henge + dual-silent-video overlay—feels fresh yet inevitable, transforming familiar “restore the sacred site” into a quiet epistemological heist. Risk is taken with accumulative structure rather than showdown, and it pays off in the final glow. Details (1970s reel, vellum tear) are specific to this voice, not interchangeable fantasy furniture. A hair’s-breadth off the 8.5 line only because the external world’s rules (how projection re-activates stone energy) stay lightly sketched.</comment>
