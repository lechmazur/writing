<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Eli’s lantern-tending ritual gives him a tactile signature, but his “luminous vow” stays abstract; we never glimpse a private memory or contradiction that makes the color-of-sound obsession urgent. Once inside the library, he becomes a passive witness: books open themselves, colors spill, ribbon wraps—no micro-choice risks failure or cost. The beat where he pockets the sigil is summary, not stance; the closing promise feels like restart, not earned stasis. Interiority is atmospheric, not crucible; we’re told he’s “steadied,” never shown him wrestle doubt.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The narrative engine is Accumulative/Textural: each image (meteor hush, sea-glass cracks, page-light) layers chromatic density until the teal chord arrives as Conceptual Repricing—sound now visibly costs color. The key tag → lock → ribbon chain is taught early and pays off in final sigil; causality is lyrical, not mechanical, but coherent. The 120-word orientation anchor is cleanly met: “Eli, pier, lantern night” locked by line 3; no penalty. Closure lands on-page (“the promise…fulfilled…next journey”), and the persistent sigil foreshadows future price; cost is conceptual but legible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Sea-glass windows “cracked into sunrise,” ink-and-tide air, floating coral shelves—details are sensory, selective, and filtered through Eli’s chromatic obsession. The micro-setting (lantern flame, key teeth, ribbon spiral) repeatedly constrains action: light must hit glass to cue next color, key must align to unlock staircase, ribbon must coil to form map. Spatial choreography holds across submerged descent; no floating rooms. Atmosphere is the story’s battleground; environment literally supplies the language Eli seeks. Meets 9+ gate: recurring lantern-light and sigil charge the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—translate sound to color—never faces external opposition or real risk of failure; pressure is aesthetic, not tactical. Escalation is achieved through intensifying visual density (single teal chord revelation) rather than narrowed options; no live choice forecloses a path. Cost is conceptual (he now carries the sigil-map) but not viscerally felt; stakes remain abstract. Agency is observational: he inserts key, opens book, receives ribbon—no trade-off, no visible price. Enough for mid-7 band under Accumulative lens, but not the 8.8+ that demands a felt price on tactics.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme—perception can be synesthetic language—emerges through concrete imagery rather than thesis: every object leaks hue when struck by sound. The teal chord’s arrival reweights earlier “meteor hush” motif, turning silence into visible heartbeat. No moral is stated; final whisper invites continuation, not closure, maintaining ambiguity. Subtext resides in the paradox of “hiding behind truth” to find revelation—Eli’s solitude becomes conduit for communal sky-lantern glow. Resists tidy profundity; resonance lingers as after-image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Eli’s chromatic ear: “meteor hush,” “soundless glow,” verbs of vibration and shimmer. Syntax lengthens and contracts with subaquatic rhythm; comma-splice glow mirrors color-ribbon flow. No dialogue, so no voice-convergence risk. Diction remains within lamplighter lexicon: “weather-worn,” “tarnished,” “salt-filled gloom.” Free-indirect “he understood” is minimal and justified. Perceptual signature is consistent: every noticed detail is potential pigment. No head-hop; lyric compression taught by first paragraph and paid off in final teal pulse. Satisfies 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud cadence is deliberate and oceanic, but metaphor density approaches purple in places (“river of stars,” “sleeping leviathan”) without pattern-teaching justification. Two near-paraphrases: “promise that rose with the wind” + “lanterns drifted higher” within 30 words (−0.2). Filter verbs minimal; strong verbs (“slipped,” “sang,” “wrapped”) drive propulsion. No scaffolding, no synonym loops in peak beats. Opening and closing lines anchor and recharge motif cleanly. Minor figurative muddle keeps out of 8.8+ zone.</comment>

<grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Synesthetic archive inside a sunken ship-library is a fresh, risk-laden synthesis of maritime gothic and chromatic concept-SF. Trope inversion: librarian is lamplighter, knowledge is color, access is rusted skeleton key. Specificity makes the frame inseparable from Eli’s obsession—remove color-sound premise and entire narrative dissolves. Final sigil-map reconfigures quest rather than ending it, avoiding symmetric satisfaction. Risk distinction +0.4: lyric structure embraces non-causal, accumulative logic and still lands legible closure. Feels inevitable yet uncited.</comment>
