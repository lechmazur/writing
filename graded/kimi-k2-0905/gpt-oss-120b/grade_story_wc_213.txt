<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Interiority is poetic but generic; “humble,” “credibly curious” are asserted, not embodied. The micro-choice to wait for glue to dry is concrete, yet no contradictory impulse or visible flaw complicates him. The renunciation of noise for listening is declared rather than dramatized with cost. Voice remains atmospheric, not individual.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: sensor data, drying glue, bell’s first new note layer density until the cadence shift lands. Closure is a Charged Poise: the bell’s low tone reweights the premise, cost felt in the gathered silence. Causality intact; no orientation debt. Glue-drying timer and microclimate threshold provide concrete constraints that shape the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>“Driftwood ribs and glass panes” plus wind pressure on skin anchor the aerial sanctuary; the bell tower’s spine as sensor bridge is tactile and specific. Weather readings and adhesive cure time tether abstract atmosphere to bodily stakes. Final image—bell answering only when exact humidity/temperature met—lets environment dictate choice. Micro-setting (silver filament rope) charges closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—replace clangor with measured listening—signals early; escalation is the incremental sensor sync culminating in the first tuned bell tone. No reversal, just tightening; cost is symbolic (loss of old certainty) rather than tangible. Agency is cerebral (patience, calibration) yet visible. Pressure plateaus rather than spikes, limiting upper band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—listening over noise—emerges through bell timbre shift and solstice hush, never sermonized. Microclimate data and glue timer embody the concept in concrete particulars. Final image reweights earlier “clamor” without moralizing. Avoids explicit thesis, lets sensory payoff speak.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person lyric distance stays stable; diction (“thin silver strand interwoven with conductive filaments”) is precise yet musical. Rhythm breathes with glue-drying countdown, then tightens at bell trigger. No dialogue, so voice contamination absent. Perceptual signature—storm siren tester’s metric attention to wind breath—remains consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is clean, lyrical, economical; no scaffold loops or synonym churn. Metaphors (“retired hymn”) are sparse and coherent. Information density high—each sensor datum advances stakes. Clause variety supports hush-to-crescendo arc. Minor elevated register (“solstice hush,” “conceptual repricing”) fits ceremonial tone without obscuring causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Premise—microclimate-triggered cathedral bell—feels fresh yet inevitable; merges tech and sacred ritual. Transformation test passes: bell rope’s re-wiring is inseparable from this sanctuary. Solstice timing adds mythic inflection without cliché. Risk is quiet, but specificity of wind-pressure threshold prevents generic swap.</comment>
