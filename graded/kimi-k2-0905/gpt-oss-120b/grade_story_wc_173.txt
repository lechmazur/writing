<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The courtesan’s interiority flickers between embodied lyricism and grand abstraction; her “bodily poetic rhythm” is asserted more than dramatized, so the contradiction that should power her final renunciation is only partially felt. She does make concrete micro-choices—hand on prism, silver thread pulled—and these physical acts earn the ending’s conceptual cost. Still, the absence of any visible flaw or hesitation at the climax keeps the arc just shy of the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: because she loathes the lullaby, she enters the courtyard; because she untangles threads, the sanctuary yields its chorus; because that chorus spills outward, the city wakes. The final beat—“rebellion, once a hush, now a hymn”—delivers a crisp Conceptual Repricing that makes the before/after legible. One hairline slip: the golden thread appears only at the instant it is released, so its cost is more declared than dramatized.</comment>

<comment>The silver courtyard, prism, and falling snow are rendered with selective sensory strokes that constrain movement—sound is muffled, distance collapsed, light refracted—so the setting literally shapes how she can approach the sanctuary. Spatial choreography stays clean: she steps, kneels, traces, releases, and the prism’s facets track her progress. The micro-setting of her own pulse-thread body also re-weights the final image, satisfying the 9-band gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—breaking conformity’s lullaby—is signaled early and tightens through each untangled thread; every filament loosened increases audible dissent in the city, a visible price. One meaningful escalation beat: the moment the courtyard stones tremble, her private act becomes public consequence, foreclosing retreat. Cost is legible on-page in the final image of dawn-lit snowflakes that “whisper a promise,” a conceptual price she must now live inside.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from concrete sensory oppositions: chastity vs. courtesan, silence vs. chorus, snow vs. light—never abstractly sermonized. The alarming serenity motif modulates from eerie calm to insurgent hymn without losing coherence, re-weighted in the last line. No tidy moral is imposed; the reader is left holding the prism of possible readings, satisfying complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric voice maintains a consistent register of incantatory compression—“between sigh and smile” refrain, participle openings, liquid sibilance—mirroring the courtesan’s bodily cadence. Rhythm swells and hushes in step with her untangling, then shortens as light erupts, demonstrating purposeful modulation. No head-hopping or register drift; the elevated diction is motivated by mythic mode and stays legible.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Most sentences carry double duty—image plus motion, metaphor plus stakes—keeping density high without purple overload. A few metaphor stacks (“thousand tiny suns trapped within glass,” “sunrise trapped in ice”) skirt overwriting but arrive at high-pressure beats where extravagance is earned. No paraphrase loops or template cadence; pronoun and spatial references stay clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The prism-echo device fuses city-wide anthem and intimate thread-work into a single fresh conceit; the chaste-courtesan paradox grounds the myth in bodily specificity. Each symbolic layer (snowflake punctuation, ink-scent winter) is synthesized through sensory rather than allegorical means, making the fusion feel inevitable in hindsight. The risk of lyric overload is embraced and paid off in the final hymn-image, yielding a memorable, non-obvious angle on rebellion.</comment>
