<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The odd historian is a vivid archetype—dusty coat, moth-like movement—but his interiority stays generic; “sensitively perceptive” is asserted, never embodied in a contradiction or cost. His probing never risks failure or trades one desire off against another, so agency feels curatorial, not crucible-level. The notebook entries are ritual rather than micro-choices that foreclose options; no moment where gathering stories might cost him silence or exile. Closure is a quiet confirmation, not an earned renunciation, so the character plateaus rather than transforms.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of humming, dragons, axis-echo builds density until the final Charged Poise (“the world whose axis has been gently shifted”). Causality is lyric, not consequential—each find (diary, tapestry, glyph) adds resonance rather than narrows tactical options. Orientation is clear by word 60; no teleporting props. Closure lands with conceptual cost—axis realignment as irreversible perceptual shift—so lens holds, but the lack of a tangible forfeit keeps it shy of 8+.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Reclaimed silo library is tactile: rusted skin, oak cradle, metallic dust, stone sighing. Micro-setting (tapestry fragment, central stone) constrains the final gesture—axis pivots only when fabric touches glyph—so environment directly charges closure. Sensory hierarchy matches lone historian: smell of soot, vibration “low tide,” bronze quiet glow. Spatial choreography flawless; no postcard tourism. Achieves 9+ gate: setting object (fragment) reconfigures meaning in last beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</question><comment>Dominant stake is epistemic: can the historian sense/repair the displaced axis? Pressure escalates by accretion—each artifact layers hum, vibration, glyph pulse—but lacks a tightening choice that forecloses an alternative path; he never risks destroying the tapestry or losing the diaries. Cost is conceptual, not tactical; no credible loss alters later moves. Escalation is atmospheric, not option-narrowing, so stays mid-band. Still, the final hum feels inevitable under Accumulative lens, satisfying minimal requirement.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</question><comment>Theme emerges obliquely: memory as tectonic force, archives as planetary gyroscope. Dragons, axis, humming cohere into motif of hidden geometry without explicit thesis. Final image—historian sitting inside breathing silo—reweights earlier cataloguing as caretaking a new rotational era. Avoids moralizing; resonance is imagistic. Could edge higher if a personal memory of his own were jeopardized by the realignment, adding moral cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</question><comment>Third-person POV stays tight to historian’s perceptions: selective attention to grain, gilt thread, low tide vibration. Diction—“bronze quiet cadence,” “ash of centuries”—is textured, not antique pastiche. No head-hopping; psychic distance stable. Free indirect slips once (“He believes…”) but serves immediacy. Rhythm modulates: longer clauses for awe, fragments for tactile discoveries. Distinctive perceptual signature achieved, though syntax occasionally over-adores its own liturgy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</question>
<comment>Line-level craft is supple: varied sentence openings, muscular verbs (“looms,” “curled,” “shivers”). Information density high—each sentence advances image or pattern. Metaphors disciplined: dragons’ scales “catching the lone lamp light” never mixed. No loops or scaffold; only micro-repeat is intentional (“bronze quiet” refrains like hum). Register stays within historian’s antiquarian lexicon. Final paragraph’s cadence mirrors low hum, paying off pattern. Minor tic: two “as if” in close succession, not enough to scar closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</question>
<comment>Premise—post-human silo as memory-gyroscope—is fresh synthesis of cli-fi and archive fantasy. Dragons+axis linkage feels inevitable once glyphs echo scales. Risk: lyric accumulation could have slid into abstraction, but specificity of burnt diaries, cradle of oak, and conduit beneath floor grounds it. Transforms trope of lone archivist into planetary axis-tuner. No close pop-culture echoes. Bold enough for 9-band; half-point shy because axis solution is affirmational rather than wrenching.</comment>
