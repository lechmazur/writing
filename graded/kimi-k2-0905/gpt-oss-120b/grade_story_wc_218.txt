<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Mara’s interiority is evocative—her “brazen calm” and ritualized wire-wrapping embody a believable, contradiction-rich stance under death sentence. Yet the diary never becomes a tool that forces a micro-choice or reveals a limit; it stays observational, so the final survival beat feels like grace rather than earned botanic-copper causality. Still, her embodied rhythms and the visible cost of dawn-to-dusk labor let her pivot from doomed caretaker to mythic bridge; the council’s reversal is credible because her calm has infected the islanders on page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the decree lifts because Mara’s “willingness of all beings to bind together” has revalued time itself. Causality is soft—no clear link between copper resonance and revoked sentence—but the accumulative pattern (each coil tightens communal belief) holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is swift; only two shards (dawn wiring → council gathering) with a seamless half-year ellipses. Cost is felt: her six-month death clock evaporates yet she stands “tall,” implying life bought by orchard symbiosis.</comment>

<comment>Setting is the antagonist: chlorophyll-bleeding stone pillars that literally breathe and pulse with copper. “Petrified trees” and “conductive tendrices” compress architecture into organism, forcing Mara’s tool choices. Spatial choreography stays clean—wire coil → mica shimmer → chest pressure—so environment steers physiology. The temple orchard functions as micro-setting that charges the final image; remove it and the stakes collapse.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—six-month death decree—tightens every dawn wiring beat; calendar pages shorten but orchard resonance lengthens, creating a meaningful cadence shift. Escalation is textural rather than causal: each copper wrap increases communal pilgrimage density until council’s stance becomes untenable. No visible resource lost except time, but that absence is repriced when time limit is abolished. Agency is attention and endurance rather than overt confrontation; fits Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as “respect is reciprocal circuitry”; no overt thesis stated. The copper/wood/stone binding reconfigures human temporality, implying ecology can rewrite social law. Subtext lives in gesture—visitors’ palms pressed to oak—rather than exposition. Final whispered secret is image-driven, leaving aftertaste of sacred abiotic covenant rather than moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is lush yet tethered to Mara’s scientific attention: “marginal calculations of growth cycles” beside “bruised amber.” Syntax lengthens during calm observation, contracts into noun clusters under task: “measured twist, gently systematic ritual.” No head-hopping; perceptual signature remains her notebook-eye. Register escalates slightly at climax but stays within a caretaker-botanist lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud cadence varies: long anaphoric “each…” sentences mimic coil rhythm, then fracture into shorter pulses as islanders feel pressure. Mixed metaphors are intentional—“petrified trees,” “conductive tendons”—and cohere within biomineralogic logic. No loops; every clause adds texture or knowledge. Density peaks when copper “humming” translates to “tree sighs,” marrying material science with animist lyric.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses eco-engineering with death-sentence countdown—fresh angle on familiar “last gift” arc. Copper-as-bio-conductor is specific, not technobabble; it grows from real photosynthetic micro-currents. Risk is quiet: no villain, no explosion, just wiring and wonder. Final reversal of civic law via arboreal signal is an inevitability that feels surprising in hindsight.</comment>
