<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Lira’s motive—“to teach silence how to comfort”—is declared early but never tested by a contradictory impulse; she glides through the beats unruffled. No interior contradiction surfaces when the vial’s silver cascades, so the moment reads as serene performance rather than costly choice. Because her stance never collides with an alternative, the promised “earned stasis” feels more label than lived.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The accumulative/textural lens holds: each sensory layer (prism song, brass ear, storm-glass hues) thickens the hush rather than forcing causal turns. Closure arrives as a Charged Poise—silver droplets become soundless bells—reconfiguring the stake from “transit” to “peace carried within.” The cost is conceptual, not visceral, but still legible on the page. Minor loop: “vaulting hush” is reused three times without pattern-taught escalation, dulling the final cadence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The drifting prism terrace functions as micro-setting: its singing stones literally cue Lira’s counter-tones, so environment shapes tactics. Sensory selection is POV-driven—she attends to creaks, amber pulses, star-hum—never tourist catalog. Spatial choreography stays clean across the single continuous drift. One slip: “the quiet that follows a train whistle’s echo” is summoned three separate times without evolving referent, flattening atmosphere near climax.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake is the creation of a teachable silence; pressure escalates texturally—each added sensory layer raises the bar for the final hush. A single meaningful tightening occurs when the vial bursts into silver, turning abstract calm into visible medium. No option is foreclosed for Lira, so the cost is borne by the reader’s attention rather than the protagonist’s choice—sufficient for lyric mode yet short of visceral stake.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges obliquely: silence as learnable solace, not moral lesson. Recurrent “vaulting hush” reweights from ambience to inner cargo at closure, avoiding sermon. No character articulates thesis in prompt language; final line invites, not declares. Ambiguity lingers—peace is portable yet unmeasured—yielding honest after-effect.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays tight to Lira’s perceptual filter: wind-notes, color shifts, rope creaks. Syntax lengthens and softens during drift, then compresses at silver burst—rhythm mirrors emotional arc. No head-hopping; pronoun clarity clean. Filter verbs (“she felt,” “she watched”) are sparse and voice-motivated, not scaffold. Distinctive diction—“fractured lullabies,” “fluidly logical”—anchors texture without purple drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence runs. Figurative language is dense but patterned—each metaphor extends the glass/wind/sound mesh—so coherence holds. One paraphrase loop: “silence grew” echoed by “vaulting hush” twice within forty words; minor, but it blunts climax. Otherwise high-density lines advance either image or beat; no scaffold redundancy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fusing gondola pilgrimage with singing glass terrace feels fresh; storm-glass-as-mood-instrument deepens the conceit. The transit-to-inner-peace arc could swap settings with minor edits, so synthesis is moderate, not inevitable. Risk-taking lies in lyric accumulation rather than plot surprise. Voice specificity and sensory braid rescue the concept from quaintness.</comment>
