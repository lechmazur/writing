<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The pruner’s reverence and creative hunger are vivid, but his interiority stays at lyrical distance; no contradictory impulse is dramatized under pressure, so the vow feels pre-decided rather than earned in scene. The traveler’s plea adds a second beat of agency, yet the pruner’s choice—handing over a sprig—costs him nothing we can feel. A single micro-choice under visible tension would have pushed this above 7.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: each sunrise/twilight image layers density until the final dispersal of luminous spores reweights the orchard’s reality. Closure lands as Charged Poise—traveler leaves with sprig, orchard keeps humming—cost is conceptual (shared wonder) rather than personal, but legible. The piece teaches its pattern early and sustains it; causality is loose but coherent under lyric escalation.</comment>

<comment>Waterfall mist, moonlit pool, and cracked seed-glow are tactile and selective; the parapet’s spray literally feeds the germination, so environment constrains the magic’s mechanics. Spatial choreography stays clean across kneeling, lifting, setting, singing. Sensory hierarchy skews visual, but the low chord of water and hush of droplets widen the palette. Setting is not mere postcard; it supplies the solvent that captures essence, charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>Stake—preserve wonder—is declared early and reiterated, but pressure is atmospheric, not tactical; no option is foreclosed for the pruner until the traveler arrives, and even then the gift is effortless. Escalation is accretive: each sunrise adds hue, storm adds rain-glyphs, but these intensify texture rather than tighten choice. A visible price—fatigue, risk, relinquished seed—would have lifted this above 7.5.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of wonder-as-custodial-act emerges through seed-sharing and orchard chorus, never sermonized. Final image of “hope blossomed anew” skirts close to echo-statement, but the traveler’s departure keeps it in scene. Subtext is strongest in the pruner’s silence: he gives away the fruit of centuries without asking return, implying wonder is only real when circulated. Still, the absence of personal cost blunts thematic bite.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays close to the pruner’s reverent perception; diction (“liquid amber,” “radiant hush”) is consistent and patterned, not ornamental. Syntax lengthens and contracts with breath of waterfall, creating credible rhythm. No dialogue, so no voice-drift issues. The narrative never exceeds what the pruner can sense; perceptual signature is coherent and pressure-responsive.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm is fluid; sentence variety carries the incantatory lift without drumbeat. Occasional modifier stacks (“hues of sunrise and midnight”) verge on purple but stay within lyric contract. No loops or scaffold; each image adds new sensory angle. One mixed moment—“seed answered by scattering”—risks anthropomorphic cliché, yet fits the taught magic. Closure line is clean, no artifact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Fusing orchard tending with inter-world synesthesia feels fresh; the seed as sunrise-capture device is a specific, non-generic twist on guardian-of-wonder trope. Risk lies in lyric overload, but coherence under accretive lens keeps it from gimmick. Traveler map beat could echo any quest tale, yet the sprig instruction—“where sky meets sea”—re-anchors the magic in geophysical specificity. Overall, a memorable inflection rather than a borrowed skin.</comment>
