<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Marek’s reticence is shown through silent ritual, but the interior contradiction never sharpens into a visible choice that costs him something; the vow to “protect” is declared, not dramatized. Emotion stays atmospheric rather than embodied—no bodily toll, no micro-choice that forecloses an alternative. The final beat is mood, not change.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the spiral hums, the glass is pocketed, and the lens stays Accumulative/Textural—density of image reweights the stake from “restore lamp” to “carry bottled safety.” Cost is conceptual (he accepts darkness) but felt only faintly; the causal chain is impressionistic, not tightened. Orientation is clear by ~100 words; no penalty.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The lantern room’s broken panes, cold slab, and iron ribs are tactile and selective; the sea-glass micro-setting literally charges the final image by glowing inside his coat. Weather and spatial choreography remain stable. Environment never constrains a tactical choice, so the 9+ gate is missed, but atmosphere is integral.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—bottle safety for anonymous sailors—emerges early; pressure deepens as each stone widens the spiral, but escalation is lyrical, not causal. No live option is foreclosed; the boat’s lantern is an echo, not a test. Cost is atmospheric, not tactical, keeping the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme of shared, fragile safety emerges through the spiral-to-glass image pattern; no moral is stated. The reprise of “bottled safety” in the pocket reweights the premise with quiet CR. Ambiguity lingers—does the chain really work?—inviting reflection without confusion. One hairline slip: “luminescent ache” is named twice, slightly asserting the emotion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person POV stays tight to Marek’s reticent, sea-worn perceptual filter: “each sigh of wind against the iron ribs” is sailor-specific. Syntax lengthens and softens under nostalgia, then compresses at the final turn. No dialogue, so no voice drift. Patterned elision (“anonymous letter chain” as whispered concept) is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical yet propulsive; sentences vary in length and opening. No loops or scaffold. Two adjacent “glow” references verge on repetition but are saved by refracting contexts (stone vs. pocket). Figurative control holds—no mixed metaphors. One filter-verb cluster (“seemed to exhale”) is minor; closure beat is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The stone-spiral-as-message-chain is a fresh maritime folk ritual; sea glass as portable lighthouse reweights familiar talisman. Risk is quiet—no twist, no genre subversion—but specificity of sailor culture keeps it from generic. Could swap names without breaking arc, so not quite 8.5. Still, image set feels singular.</comment>
