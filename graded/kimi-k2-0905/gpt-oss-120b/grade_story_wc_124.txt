<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority is rich—scent-maps of grief, lantern-flame synapses—but the “crystal vial” beats feel performed rather than resisted; no micro-choice risks failure. The arc arrives at renunciation (sealing the vial) yet the cost is lyrically declared, not dramatized on the body or purse. Still, the hierarchy of values is legible: lantern-trade pragmatism < scent-archive obsession < filial grief. Just shy of 8.8 because the decisive act is off-stage to the emotion.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory stratum layers density until the final ultraviolet flare reweights meaning. Closure is a Charged Poise—lantern in twilight, crystal shadows clinging—visible cost legible as perpetual custodianship of sorrow. No orientation drift; greenhouse, vial, Arlen anchored by word 80. Transitions absent, satisfying single-scene default. The soft cap at 8.8 is owed to absence of persistent external constraint beyond self-appointed archivist duty.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Greenhouse glass, vault ribs, phosphorescent vines, petrified leaves—each tactile detail doubles as emotional prism. Micro-setting (vial-as-moon in palm) constrains the final promise to return. Amber panes catch light like “mute witnesses,” objectifying memory itself; no setting dump stalls momentum. Only 8.7 because iron-roof rain mention floats without prior city scaffolding, a hairline specificity gap.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</question><comment>Dominant stake—decode scent-triggers of grief—tightens once when UV bloom exposes hidden strata and narrows options to lifelong guardianship. Agency is attention/renunciation rather than external opposition; cost is future time pledged, felt on page. No antagonist needed; pressure is epistemic and accumulative. Misses 8.2 because no concrete resource (money, health, relationship) is visibly forfeited—only ontological burden.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</question><comment>Theme emerges as “grief is a living perfume archive” without moral statement; final image of lantern casting crystal shadows reprises and reweights greenhouse halo. Subtext operates through scent-filaments—each molecule a proxy tear—avoiding abstract thesis. No late echo; “lantern of understanding” stays metaphorical, not didactic. Complexity lingers: sorrow both wounds and illuminates.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</question><comment>Voice is consistent, lyrical yet precise—“aromatically cautious,” “crystal perfume vial…echo of a summer evening”—syntax breathes with emotional rise. No dialogue, so no convergence risk; perceptual signature (oil-lamp odor clinging to coat) is unique. POV distance stays tight third; no filter-verb clusters. Register never drifts into textbook tone; metaphor layered but coherent. At 8.9 for near-flawless sonic control.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</question><comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentence length contracts under ultraviolet climax, elongates during memory collage. Metaphors (“dying light like mute witnesses”) do not overpopulate high-pressure beat—kept for two strategic drops. Near-duplicate scent imagery (“perfume…perfume”) appears but spaced, forgiven by lyrical pattern. Only minor scaffold: “He remembered…he remembered” could tighten. No artifact obscures causality or closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</question><comment>Fusion of extinct-botany conservatory + scent-archivist broker + UV reveal of mnemonic molecules feels fresh synthesis, not trope checklist. Risk in lyric accumulative structure pays off: reader maps grief geography through olfactory prisms. Could swap names but not lantern-scent nexus without collapsing concept. Specificity of “lantern broker” profession and “crystal vial with copper seal” anchors originality. +0.3 risk bonus for UV perfume reveal that reconfigures mourning into archival stewardship.</comment>
