<question>1</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Selene’s calm, ink-steeped interiority is vivid, but her “ethical storytelling” motive is stated more than dramatized; we see her arranging dishes and cradling the stick, yet no contradictory impulse is tasted under pressure. The moment she imagines puppets “turning toward the audience” is luminous, but it is the only micro-choice that forecloses a path; earlier beats only rehearse the same serenity. Cost is poetic rather than felt—she leaves with a memory, not a scar—so the arc feels more mood than moral crucible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the reversed string image reweights the whole puppet metaphor and carries conceptual cost (“grant autonomy”), satisfying Conceptual Repricing under an Accumulative lens. Causality is loose—why the dome, why tonight, remains atmospheric rather than motivated—but the pattern of mirrored light → reversed dish → reversed string teaches its logic early and pays it off in the final glow. Orientation is taught by “rusted cathedral” inside 120 words; no penalty applies.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The dome’s inward-facing dishes, cracked concrete, and campfire-ember reflections are tactile, selective, and mirrored in the final image; the setting literally “charges” the reversal metaphor. Spatial choreography is flawless—stick at center, dishes in concentric rings, wind-borne pine scent. Environment constrains the only possible epiphany: a reversed reflection of control. Micro-setting qualification met.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reversing narrative control—is signaled early, but pressure is atmospheric, not tactical; no live dilemma narrows options. Escalation is a single cadence shift: ember brightens → string image → exit; cost is conceptual, not visceral. Under Accumulative lens the deepening suffices, but the absence of a tested choice keeps tension lyric rather than urgent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the mirrored reversal motif rather than didactic statement; the final image reweights “ethical storytelling” from slogan to embodied possibility. Ambiguity is purposeful—audience autonomy is promised, not proved—creating lingering reflection. The puppet-show concept is stated, not dramatized, so theme leans abstract; still, the dome’s silence and reversed dishes feel earned. No final-paragraph sermonizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice is consistently lush, ink-tinged, and rhythmic; cadence breathes with ember flickers without lapsing into template. Diction stays within an urbane artist’s lexicon—“half-lit epiphanies,” “meteor hush”—and perceptual signature is sharp: radar dishes “listening to the past.” No dialogue to test, but internal monologue avoids filter verbs. Occasional elevated phrases (“subversive puppet shows”) feel slightly writerly yet stay motive-driven.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose is sonically deliberate and mostly lean; sentence variety is good, but metaphor density is high—almost every sentence carries a figurative vehicle, creating minor purple haze. No loops or synonym churn, yet a few near-repeats (“half-lit epiphany” variants) dull the final beat. Opening and closing lines anchor and recharge the motif cleanly. Clarity never breaks, but compression could sharpen the ember-bright instant.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The fusion of decommissioned Cold-War dome + calligrapher + puppet-ethics reversal is fresh and specific; the reversal trope is transformed through mirrored dishes and campfire optics. Risk-taking lies in the lyric, accumulative structure rather than plot twist, and it coheres. The “meteor hush” coinage is memorable, and the final reversed-string image feels inevitable yet unforeseen. Derivative-premise guardrail waived.</comment>
