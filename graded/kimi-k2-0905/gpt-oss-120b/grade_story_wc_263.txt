<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dreamer’s want-to-free-creativity motive is signaled early and steers every beat; interiority stays concrete (“cold stone cool his pulse”). No second character, so no crucible, yet the brass instrument becomes an extension of self, its rising glow evidencing micro-choices under pressure. The final renunciation—leaving the device yet carrying its chorus—lands as earned stasis with visible cost. Flaws: late epiphanic shorthand (“freedom”) approaches label-speak, blunting full visceral punch.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure is a clear Resonant Reconfiguration: the archway now permanently emits verses, the dreamer walks away lighter, cost felt in fatigue and relinquished tool. Causal linkage holds—each traced star → unlocked chamber → instrument brightens → final release. Accumulative/texture lens dominates: repetition of “trace–record–echo” layers density until the last star tips the pattern. No orientation debt; who-where-when anchored by line 3. Minor slip: “freedom” named rather than shown, but image of dimming aurora immediately repays, keeping 8-band.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Setting is micro-scaled to body, archway, instrument—exactly right for 700-word piece. Cold stone, violet/emerald shadows, brass etchings tactilely guide choices (he settles to cool pulse, aligns sighting tube). Aurora-lit archway constrains the only possible theatre and later re-emerges dimmed to ratify cost, satisfying 9+ gate. Spatial choreography immaculate; no world-rule dump, all learned through action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—liberate bottled creativity—is visible from first paragraph and tightens through pattern accumulation: each traced star = louder unheard verses, brighter instrument, accelerating fatigue. No external antagonist; pressure is internal/accumulative, coherent under chosen lens. One meaningful deepening: realization that “rest was merely a pause” precedes final crescendo, foreclosing withdrawal option. Cost (exhaustion, relinquished tool) visible, but price could be sharper—hence stops just below 8-band ceiling.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: trapped imagination as stardust memory, released through obsessive ritual. Subtext operates in silence—poems never quoted, only their growing volume implied. Final image of archway humming with leftover verses offers resonant non-moral answer. No late thesis statement; “freedom” line is borderline but offset by immediate sensory payoff, keeping high-band.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person lyric voice maintains consistent cosmic diction—“moonstruck,” “aurora-lit,” “brass limbs”—without filter-verb clutter. Rhythm swells and subsides to mimic breathless ascent and final exhale. No dialogue, so voice carries all; perceptual signature is dreamer-specific, not generic. Patterned repetition (“traced,” “echo,” “unspoken”) taught early and paid off in closure shimmer, justifying cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Sentences vary length and opening; metaphor density high but patterned (stardust ↔ melody) and taught early, so earns its lyric weight. No scaffold loops or synonym churn; “unspoken words” recurs with purpose. One mixed metaphor hiccup—“darkness scented with hope”—slight muddle under peak pressure, preventing 8+. Otherwise clean grammar, strong verbs, information-rich lines doing double duty.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Premise—star-messages as fossil poems—feels fresh yet emotionally ancient, avoiding stock chosen-one tropes. Specificity of brass astrolabe etchings and aurora theatre roots the concept; removal would collapse the piece. Risk taken in lyric accumulative structure rather than causal plot, handled competently. No close echoes of famous scenes; originality resides in fusion of cosmic science with blocked-artist psyche.</comment>
