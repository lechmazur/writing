<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Interiority is rich—“firefighter born to an arsonist father” tension pulses, embodied in boots on black sand and pulse-heat. The contradiction (flame vs. healing) is dramatized, not declared. Micro-choice (kneel, thread-touch) reprises lineage but still feels slightly tidy; cost is felt more as legacy weight than immediate risk. Voice is distinct; no head-count chaos.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of migrating cloud/shadow, coin-song and sand-memory intensify toward dawn chord. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—the coin’s hum reweights prior scars and migrates outward with clouds—felt, visible, no exposition. Orientation anchored by 50 words. Persistent constraint: red thread binds her to pier, literal/figurative cost legible. No lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>“Obsidian lagoon”/“black sand harvested from a volcanic beach” is specific, tactile, governs footing and memory. Tool/object-as-setting: coin-pier-sand junction constrains ritual and final sound propagation. Spatial choreography clean across shallow water walk, kneel, thread-pull. Sensory hierarchy favors heat/cold, shimmer/pulse—mirrors internal burn-to-calm without overt symbolism. Weather/cloud migration is causal, not backdrop.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: prove scars can sing (transform generational fire-guilt into communal peace). Pressure deepens via sensory layering—sand warms, coin sings—rather than external opposition. One meaningful intensification at sunset when tone emerges; option space doesn’t narrow, but meaning reweights. Cost is symbolic (heritage exposure) more than practical; still legible under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of transmuting ruin into nurture emerges through image pattern—firefighter, volcanic sand, coin-song—never preached. Final dawn image offers non-literal answer: black sand turned molten amber promises regeneration. Ambiguity persists—villagers’ gratitude is whispered, not staged; complexity intact. Avoids moralizing, though “compassion is a tide” drifts toward Echo; saved by imagistic payoff.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person close stays locked to Mira; perceptual signature sharp—fire-trained noticing of heat, texture, pulse. Lyric compression taught early (“liquid midnight,” “kelp-drift peace”) and paid off in final coin resonance. Rhythm modulates—long clauses for calm, staccato for surfacing memory; no filter-verb bloat. Register holds within poetic but internally consistent; no head-hop, no dialogue to break voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm varied; read-aloud flows without template cadence. Figurative layering is dense (>60% of sentences metaphoric) but patterned—sand=ember, clouds=migrating chorus—so allowed under taught-pattern rule. One scaffold: repeated “she whispered a vow / black sand whispered stories” could tighten. No mixed metaphors, no synonym loops. Opening and final lines anchor and resolve cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh fusion: arsonist’s child firefighter + volcanic-sand ritual + sonic graft is non-generic. Risk of lyric overload is embraced and coheres. Embedded metaphor engine (fire→water→song) feels inevitable post-ending. Transformation test fails only in abstract (villagers’ shift off-page), but enough concrete novelty sustains memorability. Small proximity to cli-fi restoration trope, offset by lineage twist.</comment>
