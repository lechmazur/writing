<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Mira’s centuries-old fatigue is asserted, not embodied; her single micro-choice—raising the lantern—arrives only at the end and feels pre-scripted by prophecy rather than driven by visible internal contradiction. The storm herald’s laughter is texture without want or fear; neither character reveals a hierarchy of values under pressure. Cost is declared (“world’s end”) but not felt on their bodies or tactics. Interiority leans on stock phrases—“weight of centuries,” “heartbeat against the night”—that flatten individuality.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the sunrise will be “reborn in shadowed brilliance,” a legible before/after shift. Causality under Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each photon-bend adds density until the final image reweights the premise. Yet the newspaper trigger is a late graft (appears ~ word 500) and the prism’s rule set is never taught early; the reader must retrofit logic. Orientation is clear by line 40, satisfying the 120-word anchor, so no penalty applied.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Emerald lighthouse, basalt steps, phosphorescent algae—details are vivid, selective, and filtered through Mira’s sea-attuned gaze. The green stone “humming with forgotten tides” marries setting to theme without overt symbolism. Spatial choreography stays clean across lantern-lift and beam-redirect. The lighthouse itself does not constrain a late tactical choice, so 9+ gate unmet, but the reef-hidden darkness functions as micro-setting that the beam must steer toward, satisfying the lower-bar test.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—’shape a new dawn using ancient shadows’—is declared early but remains abstract; the tightening beat is the lantern-redirect, yet options were never visibly narrowed beforehand. Pressure accumulates imagistically rather than tactically; the newspaper’s fall is symbolic, not a resource loss that alters moves. Protagonist agency is present but reactive—she follows prophecy instead of forcing a trade-off. Cost is cosmic, not personal; the emotional price is gestured at, not dramatized.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges cleanly: renewal through embracing darkness, not conquering it. The motif of green light refracted into shadow recurs and reweights at the end without overt statement. Subtext stays in image—“luminous ships” steering darkness away—avoiding moralizing. The concept resists tidy optimism yet avoids nihilism, achieving plausible ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Third-person POV stays tight on Mira with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is atmospheric—“stars…hummed with forgotten tides”—rather than character-particular diction, but rhythm remains controlled under lyric pressure. Purposeful elision (no exposition dump on prism physics) is taught by context and paid off at closure. Register slips once into cosmic abstraction (“constellations…sang with the storm’s laughter”) yet reads as intentional heightening, not voice leak.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>Metaphor density is high but patterned early (“green stone walls humming,” “serpent of light”) and coherent under Accumulative lens. No synonym loops or template cadence detected. Some sentences lean purple—“a chorus of silver syllables”—yet they serve imagistic crescendo rather than obscure causality. One paraphrase loop: “the wick’s glow intensified, feeding the prism…causing the beam to split” restates the same cause twice; minor drag.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Freshest synthesis: lighthouse optics as ritual magic, prophecy keyed to the death of print. The prism’s total-internal-reflection physics is literal and metaphoric, binding science to myth without explanation dump. Risk taken in lyric accumulative structure pays off in closure image. Could edge higher if the newspaper rule had been seeded earlier; still, the particulars feel inseparable from this place and voice.</comment>
