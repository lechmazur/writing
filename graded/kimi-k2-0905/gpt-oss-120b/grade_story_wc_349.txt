<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Vendor’s interiority is lyrically vivid (“eyes reflecting a pattern of broken sentences”) but remains abstract; no contradictory impulse is dramatized under pressure, only serene certainty. The child enters too late to test or alter him, so the claimed fulfillment feels unearned. Interior voice is lovely yet externally static; we witness no micro-choice that costs him anything. Motive is declared, not pressure-tested, so the arc lands as mood rather than change.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each measured silence literally brightens the bottle, a tangible metric of absence becoming light. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—moonlight threads now stitch every unwritten book, reweighting “origin” from place to quantified void; cost is the irreversible dispersal of the vendor’s sole power. Orientation anchors (who/where) arrive by line 4; no penalty. One soft edge: the child’s arrival is coincidence, but it complicates rather than resolves, so allowed under Situational logic.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Glass orchard, translucent bark shelves, vapor aisles—details are sensory, specific, and immediately tethered to action (shelves rearrange by silence-count). Cloud-sea and moonlight droplets evolve across beats, finishing as silver-inked floor script that brands ‘origin’, charging the final image. Micro-setting objects—bottle, light-knife—constrain tactics and reappear with reweighted meaning. No external realism required; floating library obeys its own physics consistently.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stake is legible: transform unquantified absence into generative light. Pressure escalates by iterative tightening—each counted void brightens the bottle, intensifying stakes until the final incision releases all stored light, foreclosing the vendor’s original quest. Cost is conceptual but felt: the bottle empties, his purpose atomized into perpetual library chorus. Agency is present yet cerebral; physical risk or loss would sharpen the 8+ band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme—stories are born from measured silence—emerges through enacted metaphor rather than assertion. Final silver word “origin” is a quiet conceptual repricing that invites rereading without moralizing. Recurring image of bottled moonlight shifts from private hope to communal seed, reweighting prior beats. Could edge higher if theme probed a counter-reading (what stories die when silence is filled?).</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person lyric voice sustains glass-fragile diction—“shy sunrise,” “vapor-woven aisles”—without strain. Perceptual signature is consistent: vendor notices translucence, quantifiable absence, refracted constellations, never generic props. Rhythm modulates: long breathy clauses for floating calm, staccato shards for incision moment. No dialogue, so no convergence risk; register stays inside plausible mythic cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet transparent; sentences carry dual duty (description + metric advance: “each leaf-book aligning by quantifying the absence”). Mixed metaphors are rare and functional (“liquid glow fracturing into shards” keeps within light logic). One minor scaffold: “the vendor smiled, feeling the weight of his quest dissolve” recaps what the image already shows. Otherwise clean, read-aloud rhythm, no loops or filter-verb stacks.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise fuses floating library + orchard + metric of narrative absence—unexpected synthesis that feels inevitable once launched. Quantified void as creative source offers fresh angle on “where stories begin” trope. Risky lyric compression is embraced and paid off at closure. Specificity of glass bark, moonlight droplets, and silence-counting method resists generic substitution, passing transformation test.</comment>
