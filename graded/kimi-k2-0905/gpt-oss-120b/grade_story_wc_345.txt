<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Liora’s translucent benevolence is consistent yet too frictionless; she seeds events but suffers no visible risk or limitation, blunting cost. Villagers’ turn from “strangers” to “family” is asserted rather than dramatized in micro-choices. Still, her quiet sidewalk whispers and the children’s mirrored trust give a ghost-specific interiority that lifts the score above the midpoint.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: communal bell-ringing under the brightening nebula crystallizes a Resonant Reconfiguration—hope is now shared infrastructure. Causal chain holds: chalk call → gathered tools → water → bell tone → light surge, each because/there therefore. Cost is communal labor and the implicit promise to keep sharing; felt in the final breath of vapor. Orientation is anchored within 30 words; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>“Twin suns,” “floating rock arches that sing,” and “firefly nebula” are vivid, selective, and tied to action (arches bend, guiding footsteps). The butterfly bell is tactile, its rim song catalyzing the climax. Setting constrains the only possible ritual stage; remove any piece and the communal rite collapses—meets 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—shared survival of hope—peaks with the bell’s chime, narrowing future options to seasonal repetition. Tightening is single but meaningful: droplet → resonance → light bloom. Cost is visible fatigue and water spent; agency is collective yet present. Could edge higher if one villager faced a personal forfeit, but communal model is coherent under lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Theme of collective nurture emerges through bell, water, vapor, and shared breath, never sermonized. Final image reweights chalk from child’s game to covenant tool. Mythic tone avoids tidy moral by leaving next season uncertain. Echo of “brambled hope” risks slight thematic statement yet is saved by sensory context.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Lyric third-person hovers at consistent distance, compressing dawn ritual into incantatory cadence that mirrors orchard song. Diction—“patchwork,” “brambled,” “violet sky”—remains within storyteller register without overwriting. No dialogue to test voice distinction; narrative texture is uniform and purposeful. Rhythm accelerates into bell beat, then exhales—clean control.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is near-loop-free; only tiny echo “soft/softly” in adjacent clauses. Metaphors stay physical (vapor inhales sighs) and coherent. High density: one sentence often does description, mythic overtone, and causal push. Final line avoids scaffold, ending on listening arches—image carries reverb. Artifact-free in closure third: 9+ eligible.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Farming nebula-fireflies into an orchard sacrament feels fresh; synthesizes pastoral SF with communal ghost liturgy. Risk lies in soft sci-fi myth where physics is ornamental, but story commits fully. “Chalk Sidewalk Dawn” ritual is specific enough to resist name-swap test. Derivative risk of benevolent-guide ghost is offset by environmental integration and collective, not heroic, payoff.</comment>
