<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>A single, nameless “I” carries the piece; interiority is lyrically sustained but abstract (“confusion melt into quiet resolve” is told, not dramatized). The compass applique and sketching ritual act as concrete proxies for desire, yet no contradictory impulse or micro-choice is shown under pressure; the stance is static contemplation rather than tested character. Motivation is coherent—grief transmuted into cartographic pilgrimage—but the lack of embodied friction or visible flaw keeps the arc emotionally flat. Still, the voice-locked solitude and consistent idiom make the protagonist feel specific within the elegiac mode.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is cleanly achieved via Charged Poise: the final overlay of charcoal lines crystallizes a “map of possibilities,” reweighting the deck’s empty vista into an invitation with undeniable felt cost—continued exile as pilgrim. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern of stretched moments and returning sky-sketches builds density until the last image reconfigures meaning. Orientation is swift (“the last power flickered out” anchors who-when-where by line 3), and no causality breaks under the lyric repetitions. The piece meets the 9+ quick test for closure with cost, but the absence of a tightening beat that forecloses a live option keeps it just below the top band.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The deck, river of light residue, and violet-ash sky are sketched with economy; every sensory touch is filtered through the narrator’s cartographer gaze. The compass applique doubles as micro-setting—its warming metal and vibrating needle ground spatial/temporal disorientation in a tactile object that charges the final alignment. Environmental details evolve (flicker-out → silent towers → dilated breath), guiding the emotional cadence rather than pausing for backdrop. One minor slip: “glass cradle” and “river of light” risk mixing metaphors, but the imagery coheres under the lyric pattern.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—find a compass-bearing in a mapless world—is signaled early and tightens only once, through the glimpse of pre-shutdown vitality; that vision re-weights the cost of continued pilgrimage versus surrender. Pressure is textural: each anniversary sketch adds density rather than narrows options, sufficient for the accumulative design but never forces a decisive trade-off. No visible price (time, safety, resource) is paid on-page, so escalation stays conceptual. Still, the final overlay line pulses like a heartbeat, giving a credible micro-turn that satisfies the 600-word threshold.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges obliquely: navigation after cartographic erasure, the ethics of memory as constellation. Subtext resides in silence—grief unspoken, turbines now stilled—and the final map of “possibilities” offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Recurrence of sky-sketching and compass rose is organic, not symbolic graft; each return reframes loss as ongoing orientation. The piece avoids tidy profundity, leaving the reader with charged ambiguity: true north is internal, perpetual, and unreachable.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>First-person diction is consistently pitched to a lyrical antiquarian cadence (“temporally stretched into a lingering breath of possibility”) that feels earned for a lone cartographer-poet. Perceptual signature is sharp: stars are “a smear of violet and ash,” metal warms “in rhythm with my pulse.” No dialogue, so voice contamination risk is nil; syntax modulates between elongation and fragment, mirroring time dilation. The voice never explains itself to the reader, maintaining modesty and rhythmic control under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet textured; most sentences carry double duty (advance image + emotional valence). Figurative language is selective—no metaphor chains clog high-pressure beats. One scaffold trace: “stretched like taffy” borders cliché, but the confection image fits the sweet elongation motif and is isolated. Opening and closing lines anchor and resolve with image-driven economy; no loops, no filter-verb stacks.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The fusion of post-cataclysm city silence with time-dilated star-mapping feels fresh; the premise is familiar (lone survivor with relic) but transformed through the specific family ritual of anniversary charcoal sketches. Risk is taken in the lyric accumulative structure rather than plot reversal, and it pays off in a final reconfiguration. Detail is idiosyncratic enough that swapping compass for any other object would break the emotional circuitry. Moments of poetic phrasing edge toward extant sf-poetry templates yet accumulate into a singular elegiac stance.</comment>
