<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The chronicler’s desire to “feel how moments stretched and folded” is vivid, yet she never makes a visible choice that costs her anything; she merely watches. Interiority is lush but external risk is absent, so the arc is observational, not crucible-tested. The jade cicada’s glow is credited with shifting the leaders, not her agency, keeping motivation ornamental. Earned stasis is hinted but not dramatized—she closes her notebook unchanged.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a quiet Resonant Reconfiguration: the water’s new clarity mirrors the softened dialogue, a CR that reweights the premise without moralizing. Causality is accumulative/textural: ripple images accumulate until the cicada’s final glow crystallizes the shift. Orientation is secure within 60 words; lens holds. Cost is felt—the chronicler’s “whispered gratitude” admits her conduit role—but lacks a concrete price, capping the score just below excellence.</comment>

<comment>Grotto, lantern-starlight, and tidal mirror are rendered with tactile specificity; the pool’s surface literally constrains how she reads the future, meeting the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography is immaculate—lantern, cicada, water, and distant owl calls track cleanly. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: she catalogs ripples before breeze, echoing her training. Only the Leaders’ sudden softness lacks environmental cue, a micro-slip that keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<comment>The dominant stake—will the clans bend?—is signaled early but remains off-stage; pressure is vicarious, not lived. Escalation is textural: each ripple thickens the omen-layer until the cicada glows, a valid accumulative tightening, yet the protagonist risks nothing personal. Cost is conceptual (pride surrendered somewhere else) rather than felt on her skin. Agency is observational, so the beat satisfies the lens but not the high-band price test.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges obliquely: transitions are liminal mirrors where reflection, not force, dissolves deadlock. The tide proverb and cicada trill echo without sermon, letting silence and shimmer carry meaning. Subtext is strongest in the leaders’ eye-flicker, wordless surrender. Final image of “sea ever ebbing, ever returning” offers resonant non-literal answer, but a hairline slide toward abstraction keeps it just shy of 8.0.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric, oceanic, rhythmically tidal—long sentences swell, then break into fragments under starlight. Diction stays within a chronicler’s lexicon: “notebook,” “lacquer,” “basalt,” never drifting into academic gloss. Perceptual signature is acute—“echoes settled on stone like a whispered promise”—and consistent. No dialogue to test, yet the inward ear is unmistakably singular. One clause (“texture of time by feeling how moments stretched and folded”) nears self-conscious profundity, a micro-dent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet buoyant: each sentence layers image, motion, and metaphor without scaffold. No loops, no synonym churn, no mixed metaphors; vehicles stay aquatic. Rhythm modulates—clause length mirrors tidal inhale/exhale. Opening line anchors voice and stake; final line releases with salt-sprayed cadence. A single over-ripe adjective (“emerald wing dusted with ancient lacquer”) could be trimmed, but the beat is not dulled.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>The chronicler-as-diviner through ripple-reading is fresh, avoiding generic oracle tropes. Tide-as-metaphor for conflict is ancient, yet here it is internalized into perceptual practice rather than stated. Jade cicada as time-amulet risks artifact, but its metallic trill is tied to physical vibration, not magic shortcut. Synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight, though risk is more aesthetic than moral, keeping it shy of the 8.5+ band.</comment>
