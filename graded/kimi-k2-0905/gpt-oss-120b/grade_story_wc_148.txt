<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The boy’s interiority is lyric and consistent—he is always listening for hush, always guided by the lattice; the moment he steps onto the reef and feels salt sear his feet is a micro-choice that costs. The mother’s vanished absence is an effective blind-spot that compounds his mistake-history. No contradiction is dramatized in-scene, and the ending’s renunciation (story over warning) is an earned stasis, though the emotional gear-shift is compressed into one clause and could have carried more body.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: he stands on the balcony, hush settled, lighthouse now beacon of truth—cost is the lifelong alarms he must keep silent. Causal chain is lyric-accumulative: lattice pulse → corridor → map → reef → bodies rise; each beat because/therefore advances knowledge rather than external stakes. Orientation is anchored by word 70 (“lighthouse prison”) so the early lyric haze is waived. One transition only (cell → corridor) and the lens holds.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Copperlight repose, salt-slick tiles, scuffed door, and the lattice against skin are tactile, selective, and POV-filtered; the reef’s hidden fissures later constrain escape routes, satisfying the 9+ gate. Fog, beam-sway, and rising bodies are visually layered without checklist excess. Spatial choreography is clean: ledge → door → corridor → chest → reef → balcony track cleanly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake is redeeming the “cry wolf” name by guiding future rescuers—signalled early, tightened when map unfolds to 3-D and he chooses story over alarm. Cost is implicit: lifelong silence/hush he must carry. Agency is present (he lifts, steps, whispers) but externalized; the bodies rise in grateful silence feels situational luck rather than forced trade-off, keeping it just below high band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges—every warning is a thread, not a wall—through image, not assertion; final hush reweights earlier false alarms. No moralizing line, no echo of prompt language. The lattice-as-confessional motif shifts from protection to transmission, giving conceptual repricing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to boy’s perceptual filter: “listening for the softest sighs,” “lattice clung to his skin like salvation.” Rhythmic compression under stress—“he stepped, slipped, whispered”—is deliberate and taught early. No dialogue, so voice carries full texture; no head-hop. Diction stays within coastal-religious register; no filter-verb bloat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Lyric density is high but patterned; repetition of “copperlight repose” and “hush” is purposeful, taught by line 3 and paid off in final image. Mixed metaphors are avoided; “stone walls breathing salty wind” is single coherent vehicle. One paraphrase loop: “lattice from confessional” appears four times with identical noun phrase—minor, does not touch closure. Rhythm modulates naturally; no scaffolding sentences.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Fusion of cry-wolf myth with confessional lattice, lighthouse prison, and underwater corpse-map feels non-obvious and specific; removal would collapse the piece. Risk in lyric-accumulative structure heightens resonance without obscuring closure. Familiar tropes (lighthouse, fog, reef) are re-inflected through boy’s heretical priest-son role. Final turn—story as map, not alarm—grows inevitably from motif chain.</comment>
