<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Interiority is sensuous (“fingertips brushing the rusted iron rail”), but the narrator’s emotional engine stays abstract—“I had come to interrogate her about the seal’s origin” tells desire rather than showing contradiction. Liora’s patiently-nimble grace is embodied once; her deadness never complicates physiology or memory, so the promised contradiction is muted. The final choice—to listen to a window latch as word—is a credible micro-renunciation, yet the cost feels light because the building’s “heartbeat” is asserted, not dramatized through failure or loss.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the antique seal and the borrowed-sugar ritual crystallize a new pact whose cost is the indefinite deferral of scholarly proof. Causality is accumulative/textural—images layer (meteor, seal, tea) until the rooftop air turns conspiratorial; the lens is coherent. Orientation is swift: meteor shower, rosemary bush, and illicit tutor are anchored by line 3. One soft spot: the “forgotten sugar” beat is a micro-turn, not a tightening that forecloses an option, so escalation stays gentle.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Rooftop garden as micro-setting is tactile—rusted rail, mossy bench, hummingbird feeder—each object brushed or traded, so environment constrains the only allowable intimacy. Meteor shower is not postcard spectacle; its intermittent strobe dictates the rhythm of disclosure and literally lights the sigil. The seal functions as portable architecture: its wax imprint lets brick grammar travel, charging the final image when Liora presses it to the air. Spatial choreography is clean; bodies track around the rosemary bush and neighbor balcony without drift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake is legible early: decode stone murmurs without exposing the lie that scholarship is the real motive. Pressure escalates texturally—each meteor streak increases the sense that cosmic and masonry languages are converging, raising the social cost of being caught lying. No decisive reversal, but a deepening: when the seal is traced, the pact of agreed-upon lies becomes the only medium of truth, narrowing future options to continued complicity. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral; the protagonist forfeits empirical proof for lived, endless translation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges without label: language as living conspiracy between people and built time. The returned image—window latch as word—reweights every prior architectural detail into a dictionary. Subtext operates in gesture (sugar spoon = admission ticket to secrecy). No moral is stated; the ending’s resonance is the quiet recognition that fluency will be measured in creaks, not publications. Ambiguity is purposeful: we cannot tell whether the tutor is ghost, metaphor, or mortal eccentric, and the story gains rather than loses from that uncertainty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>First-person voice carries poet-scholar diction—”ghosts of stone,” “brick’s silent grammar”—yet stays within a plausible lexicon for someone obsessed with architectural semiotics. Rhythm modulates: long ecstatic clauses under meteors, then short cadences when sugar dissolves. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is consistent— narrator notices vibration, syntax, weathered iron, all filtered through epistemic hunger. Dialogue is minimal but distinct: Liora’s soft, instructive cadence contrasts with the neighbor’s smiling brevity, keeping voice sovereignty intact.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; most sentences twin image and motion (“the garden’s night air felt suddenly conspiratorial” advances both atmosphere and social pact). Mixed metaphors are rare—“meteor shower painted silver streaks” is acceptable synesthesia. One paraphrase loop: “agreed upon lies” is repeated three times in close succession; the echo is thematic but still stalls the ear slightly. No filter-verb stacks; verbs are strong (cracked, brushed, dissolved). Final line recharges “borrowed sugar” and “agreed upon lies” with earned cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Premise fuses ghost story, linguistics, and architecture into a fresh synthesis; the dead tutor who teaches walls to speak is not a trope catalog entry. Risk is taken in substituting empirical investigation for poetic apprenticeship; the story commits fully, never defaulting to horror or thriller beats. Specificity of seal sigil and meteor-lit tea ritual feels particular, not quirky ornament. Transformation test passes: plot collapses without the rooftop garden as language lab and the borrowed sugar as covenant token.</comment>
