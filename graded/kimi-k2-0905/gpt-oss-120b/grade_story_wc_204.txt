<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Mara’s desire to “compress eternity into a moment” is stated repeatedly but never dramatized as an interior contradiction; she moves from receiver to actor without visible cost or doubt. The moment she “decides” has no备选路径 foreclosed, so the change feels declared, not earned. Embodiment is strong—ink-stained fingers, frost tracing—but emotion stays performative (“she realized…”) rather than conflicted under pressure.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the lattice reconfigures the library and the page hums with bottled whisper, giving undeniable conceptual cost. Causal chain, however, is elliptical: the frost spiral method appears only at the final beat, so the “how” of compression feels retro-fitted. Orientation is crisp within 120 words; lens is Accumulative/Textural and holds, but the late arrival of the spiral technique keeps this from 8+ territory.</comment>

<comment>Glass orchard/cloud-sea is more than postcard: the shivering panes, refracting shards, and churning cloud-letters physically rewrite the world, constraining final image. Frost micro-setting doubles as tool and map, directly enabling the spiral press. Sensory economy favors glass/light/ink; no tourism catalogue. The library’s rule-set stays consistent—floating, fragile, refracting—throughout rupture.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—“compress eternity”—is clear early; pressure escalates via density of cracks, shards, humming pages rather than causally narrowing options. One meaningful deepening occurs when rupture turns frost curves into conduits, but the cost is conceptual (system revealed illusory) rather than a tactical trade-off paid by Mara. Agency is present but externalized: the world rewrites itself; she merely “places the page back,” so price feels gifted, not seized.</comment>

<comment>Theme emerges from mutability of perfection: fragile glass, negotiable reality, compressed time. No moral spoken; final lattice image reweights earlier “perfect system” as living illusion. Subtext operates through light refraction and ink shimmer rather than declaration. The Whisper’s song remains ambiguous—both lullaby and storm—inviting counter-readings without confusion.</comment>

<comment>Third-person lyric keeps distance steady; no head-hop. Perceptual signature is crystalline: Mara notices geometry, frost vectors, ink creep—never touristy filler. Rhythm escalates from hush (“swirling sea of clouds”) to cascade (“slam…cascade…churn”) mirroring rupture. Sentence variety is high; diction stays within poetic operator register. Minor filter verbs (“she realized”) survive but do not stall immediacy.</comment>

<comment>Read-aloud rhythm is musical; no template cadence. Metaphors (glass orchard, bottled whisper) stay internally coherent and mutually reinforcing. High information density: one sentence often layers frost, ink, sound, and concept. A single mixed vehicle—“liquid darkness humming”—is permissible at lyric pitch. Line-level artifacts absent; closure image (“sunlight fractured across the lattice”) lands clean.</comment>

<comment>Floating glass library as printing press for compressed eternity is non-obvious and fully committed; no retreat to allegory. Whisper bottled as ink catalyst transforms familiar “writer changes world” into material physics of light and fracture. The concept’s implications—time negotiable, perfection lethal—are followed through without soft reset. Specificity of frost spiral method feels inevitable in hindsight, not gimmick.</comment>
