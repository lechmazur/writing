<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The fractal weaver’s motive—“to collect the weights of different burdens” and unbind grotto sorrow—is declared repeatedly but never tested by counter-impulse or micro-choice; interiority is cosmic-lyric (“whispered to each weight”) rather than embodied contradiction. No visible cost or forfeiture attaches to her absorption of burdens; the lamp, not her body, pays the freight. Character remains a wind-chime voice, not a crucible of conflicting desire.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: the piece layers motif on motif (shingled hush, whalebone reverie, bronze dust) toward a Charged Poise closure where the grotto exhales into lullaby. However, each beat is additive description rather than causal tightening; “calcify” and “orient properly” function as magic verbs rather than rule-based constraints. The promised cost is atmospheric, not legible on a choice or irreversible change—no path is foreclosed for the weaver, only transmuted into prettier imagery.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Sensory detail is textured and selective (mineral smoke, amber flame, constellation of tiny whales) but the grotto’s spatial logic stays floating: entrance, walls, floor, and crystal are re-shuffled without trackable positions. The lamp and calcifying droplets serve as micro-setting that charges the final sunrise glow, satisfying the 9+ gate, yet choreography remains impressionistic rather than choice-constraining.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—“unbind the boundary-lessly trapped sorrow”—is announced, not dramatized; pressure is ambient, not narrowing. No reversal or trade-off is demanded of the weaver; the lamp absorbs burdens friction-free. Escalation is recursive prettification (each statue sings) rather than option-limiting cost. The “still as the sea’s depth” clause gestures at risk but enforces no on-page consequence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme of sorrow transmuted to art constellation emerges organically via the calcified statues and the closing promise that any visitor can crystallize heart-burdens. It avoids explicit moralizing, letting the final lullaby image carry reweighting. Yet the insight is decorative—beauty as release—rather than morally complex or risky. Subtext stays safely inside its own shimmering skin.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice owns a sustained whalebone reverie cadence—long, tidal clauses, mineral lexicon, starlit hush. This texture is consistent and taught early, so compression/elision is legible. However, cadence becomes an algorithmic swell (repeated “shingled hush,” “whalebone reverie”) that threatens monotony; micro-modulation under pressure is missing. Still, perceptual signature is distinct and unmuddied by POV drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Metaphor density borders on purple overload (“dreamlike fog of memory,” “kelp in a tide”) yet stays purposeful to the lyric-accumulative mode. No mixed vehicles or paraphrase loops, but several template cadence runs (“the… the… the…”) stall propulsion. Scaffolding is light; final image clarity survives. The prose sings itself into a lull but never accelerates breath under peak pressure because no true pressure exists.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The conceit—grief-calcifying lamp inside a bronze grotto that transmutes burdens into whale-constellation art—is refreshingly specific and non-obvious. Despite lyric drapery, the core image chain (lamp → calcified droplets → feather of balance → starlit whales) coheres without genre default. The transformation test is passed: swap any noun and the spell collapses. Risky compression and mythic miniaturization succeed without gimmickry.</comment>
