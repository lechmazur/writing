<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara’s “ethically diligent” label is repeated but never tested by a conflicting choice; the rake-handle ritual is shown three times yet never endangers her values, so the trait feels safely decorative rather than crucible-forged. Interiority drifts into cosmic sermon (“stitch the frayed tapestry of time”) that abstracts her body and blurs immediate stakes. Micro-choices—placing, aligning, whispering—are present but low-cost; no moment forces her to sacrifice comfort or reputation, so the arc is a gentle confirmation rather than an earned change.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens is clear: each inscription layers like barnacles until the final image of glowing constellations reweights meaning. However, the single meaningful tightening—the pendulum pause—repeats identically every sunrise; the pattern is taught early but never intensifies or forecloses an option, so closure feels circular rather than costly. Orientation holds: ridge, tower, Mara anchored within 50 words; no因果 breaks, yet the absence of a final price keeps the reconfiguration soft.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The tidal obsidian ridge is more than backdrop: its black waves supply the salt that splits the rake, the ink-light that makes the inscriptions visible, and the cymbal-crash that amplifies the final cadence. Micro-setting inside the tower is equally tactile: bronze skin of the bob, iron cradle, spiral stairs that force Mara's breath to sync with gears. Sensory selection stays POV-filtered—she notices polish of metal, not tourist vistas—so environment guides motion and later glows with molten rose payoff.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Stakes—“restore shared balance between humanity and tide”—remain conceptual; no concrete consequence is shown if Mara skips a sunrise, so pressure is ambient rather than acute. The only tightening is the pendulum pause, but it returns unchanged each day, producing iterative stasis, not escalation. Because no resource (time, tool, social credit) is risked or lost, cost is aesthetic rather than felt, keeping tension lyrical and low-grade.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme of incremental absolution emerges through the rake’s tiny prayers rather than authorial statement, but the cosmic phrasing (“chorus of countless souls”) edges toward overt echo. Subtext is strongest when the glowing carvings rewire the pendulum: a quiet image that lets reader feel repair without moralizing. Yet the absence of any counter-argument or failure keeps complexity polite; the tide never talks back, so the question resolves into uplift rather than friction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Voice achieves perceptual signature: Mara clocks the world in pendulum beats and metallic glows, compressing diction under stress—“pendulum paused, world breath-held.” Lyric elision (“searing reverie”) is taught early and paid off in molten horizon, so pattern stays legible. No dialogue, so no register drift; free-indirect texture stays consistent, and sentence rhythm flexes from tidal surge to gear-hum without drumbeat monotony.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose is lush but disciplined: each metaphor (ink-tide, molten rose, cymbal-waves) advances atmosphere without crowding a single beat. Minor loop—“inscriptions glowing” appears twice within five lines—dulls rather than charges, but the repetition is local and does not obscure closure. Opening and final lines frame and echo with cadence precision; paragraph cut test passes—every block advances breath, image, or stakes.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Premise—clock tower maintained by salt-scarred rake prayers—feels fresh, combining horology, tidal geology, and micro-ritual in one image. Risk lies in lyric repetition that could dip into gimmick, yet the rake’s transformation from trash to relic earns inevitability. The synthesis stays specific to Mara’s body and ridge; if relocated, the ritual would collapse, satisfying transformation test. Derivative echoes are avoided—no steampunk cosplay or seaside clichés—so ingenuity reads as earthy invention rather than novelty for its own sake.</comment>
