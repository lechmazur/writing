<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>The translator’s interiority is lyrically rendered—“shrewdly innocent gleam,” “lotus-hearted ache”—but the contradiction is asserted more than dramatized; we never see her innocence actually complicate her shrewdness in a visible choice. The final micro-choice—sealing the coral droplet—repeats the same tender gesture already shown, so the cost feels incremental rather than decisive. The child remains a symbol, not a second character exerting pressure, so the relationship crucible is absent. Earned stasis is hinted, yet the price is emotional haze rather than a foreclosed path.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the coral droplet reweights the child’s wound into living tissue, cost felt in the “lotus-hearted ache.” Causality is lyric-accumulative: each swirl deciphered adds density until the mist chorus crystallizes; no causal turn is required. Orientation is complete by line 5; no lens ambiguity. The final image cleanly reconfigures meaning, satisfying 9+ cost test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Marble atrium, violet twilight, and clinging mist are filtered through the translator’s exhausted compassion; sensory hierarchy favors tactile chill and visual blur, matching her need for calm. The brain-coral vial micro-setting constrains the closing choice—its porous lattice literally absorbs the child’s confession—so the object qualifies as environment that charges the final image. Spatial choreography remains stable on the bench; no geography drift. Detail is selective, never museum-tour.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—transform shared anxiety into living tissue—is signaled early; pressure tightens as each smudged phrase is absorbed by coral. Escalation is textural: density of deciphered swells until the coral vibrates, reweighting the stake. The translator’s agency is attention/unknotting rather than a reversible decision, yet the perpetual ache is a felt price. No reversal, but one meaningful deepening satisfies short-form requirement.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from repeated images—coral, mist, ink—shifting from fragility to porous strength without explicit statement. Subtext lives in gesture: the droplet sealed onto plaster is the non-literal answer that grafts memory onto resilience. No moralizing; the ache remains ambivalent. The final image reweights the premise, achieving Conceptual Repricing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric voice maintains consistent perceptual signature—soft consonants, tidal cadence—mirroring the translator’s refusal to harden. No dialogue, so evaluation centers on narrative texture: syntax breathes with child’s inhalations, compresses during deciphering. POV distance stays tight to translator; no head-hop. Register remains within translator’s plausible lexicon of metaphor.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Rhythm modulates from long mist-laden sentences to clipped “gentle click of her pen,” propelling attention. Figurative language is dense yet coherent—no mixed metaphors. Filter verbs are minimal; “she felt” appears once and is earned. One paraphrase loop: “shared anxieties...shared anxieties” within 30 words; minor, does not touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The coral-as-memory-graft is a fresh synthesis of trauma-healing trope, grounded in specific reef biology. The child’s plaster-cipher is particular, not generic war-story prop. Risk-taking in lyric accumulative structure pays off in crystallized final image. Could transplant to another war yet translator’s voice and coral mechanic keep it distinct.</comment>
