<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Milo’s “respectfully rebellious” gait and the storm-bottle as embodied emotion give him idiosyncratic texture; the final quiet renunciation of the empty bottle shows visible cost. Interiority stays concrete, but the single on-page choice—slipping the truce envelope—relies on a pre-loaded metaphor rather than a fresh micro-choice under pressure, muting the sense of flaw-driven mistake.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: bottle → flash → retreat → truce envelope → shared ascent. Closure is a Charged Poise: the crossed drone paths reconfigure the border with felt conceptual cost—“even a storm confined can still rain hope.” The lens stays causal throughout; no orientation debt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The cobalt arcade’s neon and cracked tiles constrain movement and mirror the truce’s fragility; the bottle acts as micro-setting that charges the final image. Selective sensory detail (clinking token, static sigh) is filtered through Milo’s courier reflexes, never cataloguing. Spatial choreography is clean—no impossible drone positions.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—fragile peace across a drone-patrolled border—tightens once when the storm flash blinds the sentry, forcing Milo to act. The price is legible: the bottle’s emptied storm equals spent leverage, foreclosing repeat performance. No reversal, but one meaningful escalation satisfies the causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme of mending absences emerges from the envelope’s mantra and the mirrored drone ascent rather than exposition. Final image reweights the bottle from weapon to “calm sky,” achieving Conceptual Repricing without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers: peace is a crossing pattern, not a treaty.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Milo’s courier-eye perception; diction—“banner of surrender,” “electric sigh”—is rhythmically specific and voice-motivated. No dialogue to judge; free indirect style is clean. Perceptual signature consistent: he notices hatches, rotors, badge-glint, never arcade trivia.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentences open with motion or object, avoiding template cadence. High density: “the roiling clouds sealed by glass and a whispered promise” does triple duty. One filter-verb cluster (“seemed to listen”) is minor; no mixed metaphors or scaffold loops. Final line lands with imagistic punch.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The “thunderstorm in a bottle” as both mail and metaphor feels inevitable yet fresh; drone-border diplomacy via arcade mail drop is a non-obvious synthesis. Risk—lyric escalation over overt action—pays off in the charged crossing pattern. No template echo; specificity anchors the surreal premise.</comment>
