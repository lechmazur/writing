<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mira’s motive—“to find the thread that connects all things”—is stated early and re-activated at the climax when she seals the letters, giving her a visible renunciation. Interiority stays lyric rather than concrete; we get no contradictory impulse in scene, only ambient wonder. Emotion is performed (“soft veil,” “gentle sigh”) rather than embodied contradiction. The keeper-of-secrets role is label-deep; it never complicates her tactics or exposes a blind spot that costs her on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: each sensuous layer (rain, spiral, mosaic, constellations) thickens the texture until the final image reweights meaning. Closure is a clean Charged Poise: Mira places the petal, the ceiling blooms with ink-stars, and the cost is the unrecoverable letters now sealed outside her control. Orientation is anchored by 120 words; no causality break. One soft redundancy: “prismatic quiet” is repeated without intensification, but this is minor and does not touch the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The lotus-temple/pond complex is not backdrop; its reflection, scent, and tactile steps guide Mira onto the spiral and later catch the released light. The spiral’s twigs and the mosaic tiles act as micro-setting that literally reconfigure underfoot, constraining her final step. Sensory hierarchy favors the visual but rain-scent and warm petal add haptic specificity. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from steps to spiral to pond surface—no impossible positions.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</question><comment>Dominant stake: can Mira externalize the letters without losing her identity as keeper? Pressure escalates texturally: each artifact (rain, perfume, silver light) layers the cost of exposure. The tightening is singular but felt—once the petal is placed, the letters are no longer hers. No visible resource loss (time, tool) but the emotional forfeiture is legible; the spiral’s hum answers her heartbeat, signalling the transfer.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the accumulation of sealed confessions: secrecy is not hoarded but released into a public cosmos that will re-circulate love. The final star-map offers a non-literal answer—secrets become constellations, visible yet untouchable. No moral is stated; the image reweights the premise that connection requires surrender. Subtext operates in gesture (placing the petal) rather than exposition.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</question><comment>Third-person lyric floats close to Mira’s sensorium without head-hop. Perceptual signature is color- and sound-oriented: “sequined ribbons,” “low note that resonated,” distinguishing her from tourist gaze. Syntax stays rhythmic and lightly inverted (“the movement coaxed…”) matching temple hush. No dialogue, so voice coherence rests on narrative texture, which holds.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is thickly figurative but patterned early (“prismatic quiet” repeated) so density reads as deliberate texture, not clutter. No mixed metaphors; water-to-star continuity is coherent. Information density high: one sentence often layers sensory, symbolic, and plot work (“The light traced the invisible thread…”). Minor scaffold: “gentle” occurs three times in 100 words, but rhythm never stalls closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The love-letter-ghostwriter-as-cosmic-weaver is fresh, and the public-art spiral as confessional conduit flips the usual trope of secret-as-burden. Conceptual risk—entire plot is metaphoric activation—pays off because the final image reweights the premise. Specificity of ink-constellations is memorable; without it the piece would slide into generic spiritual vignette. Slight hedge: “prismatic quiet” flirtation feels safe; a sharper tonal edge could heighten risk.</comment>
