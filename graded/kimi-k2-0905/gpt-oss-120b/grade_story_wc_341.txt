<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Aria’s interiority is vivid—cloud-emotion ledger, brass inscriptions, telescope-weight—but her choices stay observational; no micro-choice alters the scene’s physics or her stake. Motive (“prove emptiness remembers”) is declared, not pressure-tested; no contradiction or forfeiture visible on the page. Earned stasis is implied; cost is lyrical, not embodied in a beat she triggers.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: each cloud entry thickens the emotional lattice until the comet reweights the premise. Closure is a Charged Poise—telescope lowered into cradle, “spooled wholeness” reconfigured with conceptual cost. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 3; no drift. Single soft causality: string-break is past, present action is memorial, not consequential.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sky-gondola micro-setting is tactile—sway, broken strings, dust-ash starlight—and constrains her only possible stance: suspended witness. Brass telescope functions as portable setting-chunk; its inscribed rim literally carries the emotional map into the final image. Sensory hierarchy matches meteorologist gaze: visual > haptic > auroral waning. No white-room syndrome; spatial choreography stable in a one-square-meter cage.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prove emptiness remembers—signaled early; escalation is accretive, not causal. Pressure widens lyrically (nimbus weeps silver) but never narrows live options; no tactic is foreclosed, no resource lost. Cost is tonal, not tactical; closure reweights meaning without altering possibility space. Sufficient for 600-word lyric mode but barely audible as tangible stake-test.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges via cloud-emotion ledger turned sky-elegy; no overt thesis. Final comet-image reprices the void from absence to palimpsest—conceptual cost felt without exposition. Subtext lives in brass inscriptions and broken-string lullaby, avoiding moralizing. Ambiguity lingers: emptiness both records and erases, a resonant irresolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: scientific cloud taxonomy fused with elegiac diction, e.g., “spooled wholeness,” “dust-laden starlight.” Rhythm modulates between long breathy clauses and clipped ledger entries, mirroring sway-motion. No head-hopping; telescope acts as silent interlocutor. Compression taught early (“rope sang and fell”) and paid off in final hush.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High figurative density but patterned: starlight=ash, telescope=ledger, void=fabric—each recurrence re-weights meaning, earns its place. Zero loops, no filler; sentences carry double duty (image + emotional notation). Occasional elevated diction (“reverence on the foot”) fits ceremonial stance. Closure line clean, cadence slows to lullaby, no artifact interference.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Fresh angle: grief-cartography performed on clouds via heirloom telescope—hybrid of science and séance. “Spooled wholeness” coinage feels inevitable in hindsight, not gimmick. Risk lies in lyric stasis, but accretive pattern justifies stillness. Could swap gondola for balloon basket, hence not indispensable, yet cloud-emotion method is memorable.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Meteorologist identity frames cloud-taxonomy method, but no aviation-specific choice changes outcome; observation alone, no forecast gamble or safety call.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Brass telescope handled in ≥4 beats: heirloom reveal, lens inscription, comet sighting, cradle lowering—each reweights emotional ledger; final clink seals closure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>“Spooled wholeness” appears early and final, reconfigures void from absence to coiled memory; conceptual cost legible, though not causal driver.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>“Quietly explosive” governs snap-moment and comet-flash; governs cadence shifts from hush to silent burst—stylistic constraint more than tactical.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Memorialize action drives every cloud entry and inscription; without it no narrative motion—yet it remains observational, not interventions, hence not maximal.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Cloud-emotion ledger mechanics taught early, executed beat-by-beat; final nimbus “weeping silver” shows method repaid with new emotional data.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Gondola’s broken strings and sway create literal suspension—only place she can perform vigil; physical gaps echo memory gaps, shaping stance not tactic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Night-after-snap timeframe gives urgency to finish ledger before dawn; dawn’s first rays close window, but no ticking resource alters micro-choices.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Motive declared repeatedly; friction arises from doubt whether void truly records, but no scene tests or refutes belief—remains interior conviction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dusty starlight saturates every paragraph, modulates from amber hush to silver weep to quiet fireworks—tone carries thematic tonal cost into final hush.</comment>
