<comment>Lira’s “patchwork of distant lives” is evocative but never crystallizes into a specific, contradiction-ridden impulse that drives a visible choice; her final whispered verse is a gentle promise rather than a renunciation or costly stance. No micro-choice under pressure shows a hierarchy of values with on-page cost, so the arc feels like a steady diffusion rather than a crucible. The memory-keeper premise remains intriguing, yet the interiority stays at souvenir-level rather than exposing a dramatic blind spot that compounds.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as a lyric Charged Poise: the night softens and the orchard “breathes,” reweighting the realm’s rule-set with undeniable conceptual cost (perpetual sunrise). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each song layer thickens density until a cadence-shift releases the kingdom into color. Orientation is clear early; causality is loose but permissible under the lyric mosaic design. The price is felt, yet the final beat is slightly diffuse because the “bound release” is sung rather than dramatized through a decision that forecloses a path for Lira herself.</comment>

<comment>Glass-and-vine cathedral, metallic roots, copper-jasmine bark: sensory specificity is vivid and selective, filtered through Lira’s gardener ear. The greenhouse functions as a micro-setting that both supplies the mica loom and is transformed by it, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography is clean; the only minor drift is the unnamed crowd gathering “beneath the mica window” whose distance and number blur. Overall the atmosphere breathes with tactile detail that charges the final image of twilight-and-gold tapestry.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—rekindle the dying realm—is signaled early. Pressure escalates texturally: each forgotten song adds luminous density, tightening the realm’s reliance on Lira’s voice. Yet the escalation is driven by communal accumulation rather than a narrowing trade-off for Lira; the cost is global (eternal dawn) not personal. One visible price (her centuries of restraint “bound release”) is named but not dramatized as a lost option for her, keeping the tension poetic rather than viscerally traded.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: memory as compost for communal dawn. The motif of woven dawns shifts from decorative hope to social binding agent, reweighting the premise at closure without overt statement. No final moral is preached; the resonance arises from the orchard’s exhalation of color. A slight abstraction keeps it shy of the 9-band—readers feel uplifted but not personally interrogated.</comment>

<comment>Lyric third-person hovers at intimate distance, stable and apt for an accumulative spell. Syntax mirrors breathing cadence—“each note brushed...the glass responded...the orchard inhaled”—creating perceptual signature without head-hop. No dialogue to misstep; diction stays within Lira’s gardener lexicon. The patterned elision of transitions is taught early and paid off in the final sunrise swell, satisfying experimental tolerance.</comment>

<comment>Prose is lush but disciplined: metaphor chains serve the orchard’s transformation without overwriting. Occasional paraphrase loops (“woven dawns that knit communities together...binding strangers into families”) repeat across two adjacent sentences, a minor scaffold −0.2. Rhythm modulates with scene breath; no mixed metaphors or register drift. Closure line “the bound release become a permanent sunrise” lands clean, propelling the ear outward.</comment>

<comment>The mirror-world alchemical greenhouse reframes apocalypse as horticulture; metallic-root trees and dawn-loom glass feel particular, not checklist quirky. Forgotten songs as catalyst and community loom are a fresh synthesis, executed at high lyric level. The concept commits fully—no late rule changes, no retreat into metaphor safety. Risk is moderate (lyric mosaic) and coherence holds, meriting the upper-mid originality band.</comment>
