<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is lyrically specific—“weighty lightness” governs her gestures—but contradiction stays atmospheric rather than dramatized; no single micro-choice visibly forecloses a path or pays a price. The glass vessels function as proxy action, keeping her passive on the page; the final whisper never risks refusal or loss. Bookmark calendar marking is the only trace of escalating cost, too slight to earn a 7+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the glowing sphere miniaturizes planetary thaw, reweighting the premise with conceptual cost—“the room seemed to breathe.” Yet the causal chain is weak; the consoles flicker alive without prior ignition beat, undercutting earned change. Orientation is clear by line 6; no penalty, but lens stays Accumulative/Textural, not Causal, limiting escalation tightness.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Abandoned control room functions as micro-setting: meltwater pools guide foot placement, console glow refracts through glass, constraining Mara’s slow choreography. Ice-ceiling drip supplies steady auditory clock; furnace flicker and silica scent thicken immediacy. Spatial anchors hold without drift; only the consoles’ sudden re-light lacks causal seed, a minor glitch.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Stakes— craft safe zones for inquiry— stay abstract; no concrete scientist or jeopardy appears. Pressure accumulates via imagery (thaw, glass) rather than narrowing options; the “illusion of control” is abandoned narratively, not dramatized through a lost tool or forfeited plan. One visible cost (bookmark marking days) is too mild to tighten above mid-band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme of reciprocal fragility—planet, glass, heart—emerges through iterated thaw/glass imagery; moral is never stated. Final sphere reconfigures scale, letting micro echo macro without sermon. Ambiguity lingers: safety may itself be fragile vessel—an aftertaste that satisfies complexity requirement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Mara’s perceptual filter—“silica into life,” “weighty lightness”—with rhythmic cadence that mimics torch rotation. No head-hop; furnace hiss and melt-drip supply sensory idiom. Compression such as “tapestry of purpose and possibility” risks loftiness but remains consistent with her poetic self-narration.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm modulates; nominalizations controlled. Metaphors stay coherent (ice as glass) but occasional stacked abstractions—“kaleidoscope of colors that seemed to laugh”—dampen immediacy. No loops or scaffold; information density is high. Final third free of artifact; closing image crisp.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Fusing climate-thaw with glassblower’s liturgical process is fresh; interior monologue-as-epic device personalizes science without didacticism. Risk is moderate—lyric stillness over plot—but payoff justifies choice. Could swap “abandoned control room” for any cold ruin without altering arc, limiting upper band.</comment>
