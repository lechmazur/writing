<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Lira’s monthly personality molt is stated repeatedly (“each month she molted a new personality”) yet never alters a single on-page choice; the trait is ornamental rather than causal. Interiority drifts into lyric commentary (“wore the world’s wandering scars like a coat”) that tells emotion instead of showing contradiction under pressure. Rook is sketched as calm scholar but exerts no counter-pressure; their friendship is declared, not dramatized through conflicting micro-choices. No visible cost is attached to Lira’s final stance; the ending assertion “the world will hear its song” lacks a foreclosed path or earned price.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the library-lantern image reweights the premise, asserting that rebuilt shelves = sanctuary, with implicit social cost of perpetual vigilance. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: lyric repetitions (“as the moon cleared the skyline”) tighten the cadence toward the final glowing stanza. Orientation is lyric-delayed; who/where/when are legible by line 5, so no penalty. However, causality is loose: the coffee-tin seeds appear and sprout without any obstacle chain; the rebellion’s spread is summarized rather than tested, muting the tightening required for 8-band.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Rusted library under stars is evoked with vivid sensory triangulation: “rusted iron into veins of light,” “broken panes like whispered applause,” “cracks between the stone floor” hosting wildflowers. Micro-setting (the coffee tin’s false bottom, the lantern-salvaged metal) constrains tactics by hiding then revealing seed packets that literally sprout the rebellion. Spatial choreography stays clean across the single annex; no impossible body shifts. The environment’s transformation from ruin to glowing garden mirrors the thematic repricing; final image is inseparable from setting.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—beauty-from-anarchy via rebuilt shelves—is signaled early and re-asserted nightly; pressure accumulates texturally rather than through reversals. One meaningful tightening: coffee-tin seeds → sprouting floor cracks → lantern finale reweights the stake from secret to public sanctuary. Agency is mostly collective and lyrical; no single beat forces a trade-off or loss. Cost is conceptual (perpetual outsider vigilance) rather than viscerally felt on-page, capping escalation below 8-band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: rebuilding as resistance, books as bricks, wildflowers as ideology—no moralizing lines state the thesis. Subtext resides in the recurring “false bottom” motif: every life hides fertile space. Final image of lantern-verses offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the implied question “can anarchy birth beauty?” The choir-of-voices stanza flirts with abstract grandiosity but stops short of sermon; ambiguity lingers about survival outside the prison.</comment>

<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Lyric-accumulative voice is stable, taught by line 1 (“rusted library under stars cradled a thin line of light”) and paid off in the lantern finale. Perceptual signature is poet-visionary: light = applause, rust = veins, pennies = universes—consistent diction without filter-verb bloat. Sentence rhythm modulates from long breathless clauses to staccato fragments that mimic candle flicker. No dialogue to corrupt voice; interiority stays within vagrant-poet lexicon, avoiding academic drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm is musical; sentence openings vary, paragraph lengths create visual breath. Figurative density is high but patterned early, so forgiven. No scaffold loops or synonym churn; “rusted,” “blooming,” “luminous fracture” recur with semantic escalation, not padding. One mixed metaphor risk—“veins of light” beside “mosaic of green light”—but both serve the same body/garden conceit, so coherence holds. Closure line is uncluttered, letting the image carry weight.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Transforms familiar “prison uprising” trope into lyric bibliogardening—books as bricks, seeds as manifesto, pennies as cosmos. Monthly personality molt is fresh but under-deployed; still, the notion of perpetual self-reinvention fuels the communal mosaic. Risky accumulative structure pays off in a final lantern-lit stanza that re-weights all prior rust into light. Specificity of “vagrant penny poet” and “coffee tin false bottom” prevents interchangeability; story would collapse if elements swapped.</comment>
