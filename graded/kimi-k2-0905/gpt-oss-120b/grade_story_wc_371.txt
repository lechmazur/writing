<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The “creeping normality noticer” is sketched through evocative, idiosyncratic perception—reading weeds as confessions, slicing bread as whispered ritual—but interior contradiction and embodied emotion stay lyrical rather than acute; no visible cost or irreversible choice charges the ending, so the arc feels contemplative, not crucible-tested.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory layer deepens the same stake—recovering sacrality from ruins—until the final bread-sharing crystallizes an earned hush; the closure is a Charged Poise that reweights ordinary crumbs into relics, with felt cost (the loaf consumed, the night indifferent) legible on-page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Micro-settings—shattered throne, cracked porcelain, tea steam—are filtered through the noticer’s biased attention and constrain his tactile choices; jasmine-and-oolong scent lingers to charge the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate for setting-as-tool.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—rescuing meaning from slow erasure—remains stable; pressure accumulates via sensory density rather than option-narrowing, producing a soft tightening (night falling, loaf diminishing) rather than a trade-off with visible price; sufficient for length but not acute enough for 8.0+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of sacred ordinariness emerges through concrete particulars—warm crust memory, vines reclaiming marble—avoiding direct thesis; final image of crumbs in amber tea glow offers resonant, unsentimental reconfiguration, though slight poetic overwrite tempers top band.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person lyric voice sustains a distinctive perceptual signature—“heuristically gentle,” confessional weeds, “tenuous absolution”—with rhythmic control and no head-hop; patterned elision (no tags, minimal grammar variation) is taught early and paid off in the hush of the last line.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Sensitive ear-varied rhythm and high information density; occasional purple layering (“world tilt toward the ordinary,” “uncloak its hidden purpose”) and two paraphrase loops (“quiet protest that unmasked…”) prevent 8.0+, but prose never stalls momentum or blurs closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: post-collapse forager-monk who gardens ruins into liturgy; guerrilla gardening + bread relic + tea-house altar feels inevitable yet non-obvious; slight risk in lyric stasis keeps it shy of 8.5.</comment>
