<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Selene’s linguist-scholar identity is declared but never tested; we never see her parse a single syllable under pressure. Her “carefully resourceful” label is repeated but not embodied—no trade-off, risk, or visible mistake. The diary hand-off is the only micro-choice, and it feels pre-arranged rather than wrestled with. Interior contradiction and embodied emotion are absent; competence is asserted, not dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: the store’s unheard symphony thickens via each discovered gap, but the causal glue is weak. The floor collapses because “the third gap” is reached, not because Selene’s agency triggers it. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—the scrolls teaching silence—but the cost is only lyrical, not lived. Orientation is quick; however, the teleporting props (portal, diary page) and off-stage lock-picking keep the chain of consequence thin.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The hollowed mountain-bookstore is the star: ivy-locked doors, phosphorescent fungi, mezzanine shadows all constrain movement and supply tools. Sensory triangulation is spare but POV-filtered (“humming an unheard symphony” heard only by scholar’s ear). Spatial choreography is clean; the collapsed floor reveals the next vertical level. Environment directly shapes tactics—vines barter for names—so the 9+ gate is met.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“find the library of unlearned lessons”—is declared early but remains abstract; we never feel what is personally lost if she fails. Escalation is atmospheric, not tactical: each gap sings louder, yet Selene’s options never narrow and no price is exacted. The vines’ bargain is smooth, not costly. Agency is largely observational; the portal finale simply appears, implying infinite sequels rather than a foreclosed path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges cleanly: knowledge is completed only when silence is heard. Subtext stays implicit—no character spells out the moral. The unheard symphony motif accrues meaning, ending as the score the scrolls teach. However, the concept’s weight is more cerebral than emotional; the reader appreciates rather than aches.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person lyric voice sustains cathedral cadence without monotony; syntax swells and contracts like breath. Diction is elevated yet consistent (“labyrinthine,” “phosphorescent”). Perceptual signature feels scholar-poet: Selene notices indexes, dialects, fern-husks. No dialogue to test speech differentiation, but internal voice never leaks into exposition. Filter verbs are scant; immediacy holds.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong read-aloud rhythm, only one paraphrase loop (“unheard symphony” thrice in 60 words). Metaphors stay coherent (store as cathedral, fungi as chorus). No scaffold sentences or synonym churn. Density is high: each sentence layers image, action, concept. Minor register drift—“conceptual repricing,” “micro-setting”—is genre-apt, not jarring. Closing image is crisp; earlier clauses never cloud it.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The hollowed-mountain-bookstore is a fresh synthesis of library-as-organism, and the blank scrolls that teach listening-to-silence reframe epistemology. Risk is taken with accumulative structure; payoff lands. Botanical diary as index-cum-currency is specific to this world. While “rescue the unlearned” edges toward thesis, the concept is embodied in the scrolls’ blankness. Overall, a memorable, non-derivative vision.</comment>
