<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara’s curator-eye, her quiet cataloguing of letters, the gentle way she hands the locket to the boy—all feel specific to a woman who believes listening can mend. Interiority stays tactile (“the metal’s cool memory press against her palm”) rather than diagnostic, and her micro-choice to build the listening-bench alters the neighborhood’s circuit of grief. No contradictory impulse is staged in scene, so the arc is a smooth accumulation rather than a crucible, but motive stays legible and consistent.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The piece teaches its Accumulative/Textural lens early—postcards, letters, whispers layering into a choral cadence—and closure lands as Charged Poise: the bench becomes a communal ear, cost felt in the hush that replaces traffic noise. Causality is lyric rather than tight “because/therefore,” but the pattern is coherent; the final image reweights the premise without explanatory glide. Orientation is clean within 120 words and anchors hold throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Courtyard dawn is more than postcard: the wet-stone incense air, lantern flicker, and puddle-reflected sky filter Mara’s selective attention and set the pitch for communal quiet. The locket’s “pulse” and the mailbox’s rust act as micro-settings that constrain her choices—she must listen, not pry. Spatial choreography stays clean; no floating bodies or impossible props.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prove listening heals—surfaces early and tightens through each letter read; the option of silence is foreclosed as more whispers arrive. Escalation is density-driven rather than causal-turn, but the accumulation of names (librarian, baker, runaway) raises communal cost; the final bench exhibit crystallizes the trade-off. No external antagonist, yet internal pressure against city noise suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the parade of specifics rather than an articulated thesis: the locket, the boy’s photograph, the grandfather’s sea-echo all argue that stories survive when someone leans in. Final image reconfigures meaning—quiet becomes currency—without sermon. Subtext stays in gesture (handing over the locket) and silence after the sea-echo; no moralizing paragraph caps the piece.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Third-person stays close to Mara’s perceptual filter: “discerning” curator eye, synesthetic scent of incense-wet stone, rhythmic accretion of whispers. Syntax swells and subsides with the cadence of letters slipping out, mirroring the listening act. No dialogue on page, so voice contamination risk is zero; diction remains within curator-poet lexicon without register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Slight template cadence in “each note she heard…each paragraph she heard” and a touch of synonym churn (“sandstorm calm” thrice), but rhythm supports the accumulative design. Mixed metaphors are avoided; images stay coherent. Density is high—every sentence layers postcard, scent, or sound—without purple overload. Closure image is crisp and uncluttered.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Premise—locked mailbox as community confession booth—is fresh, but the locket-as-audiograph device edges familiar magical-heirloom turf. Specificity of neighborhood cast (baker, librarian, runaway) rescues the concept from generic. Final sea-echo twist is small but effective, reweighting the locket’s role. Risk is modest; execution competent rather than daring.</comment>
