<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The claustrophobic explorer’s contradictory impulses—adventurous drive vs. suffocation panic—are dramatized in every tactile beat; the compass micro-choices tighten under pressure. The final renunciation (sharing the song rather than hoarding power) is forecast by his embodied dread and the prudently adventurous tilt that keeps him alive. Cost is felt: the cavern’s sighing architecture literalizes his chest’s release. Voice stays singular, no status dynamics needed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the key becomes “a compass point that could guide future explorers,” reweighting the entire spatial mutiny premise with social cost—stories vs. forgetting. Lens is Accumulative/Textural: each organ echo and wall rotation thickens texture until the final cadence reconfigures meaning. Causality holds: compass → organ note → passage opens → key retrieved → vow to share. No orientation debt; who/where/when anchored by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Body-as-setting (claustrophobic lungs) and compass-as-micro-setting constrain every tactical move; the luminescent-fungi garden recharges the organ’s earlier resonance in the final image. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven: narrowing corridors squeeze visual field to touch and sound. Starlit nexus and fallow-period quiet are signaled early and evolve with causal events. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible positions.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—retrieve the key to fight forgetting—tightens when each spatial betrayal narrows exit options; the organ’s chord escalation forces the final mutiny. One meaningful deepening: the corridor’s sigh shifts claustrophobia into wistful rebellion. Cost is visible: the explorer’s vow to map and share forecloses personal secrecy. Agency remains his throughout; coincidence complicates (organ awakens) but does not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges inductively: spatial mutiny = memory’s refusal to stay buried. The crystalline key etched with constellations reweights the concept from treasure to communal compass. No overt thesis; final garden image offers ambiguous afterglow—knowledge glows but must be tended. Subtext of “music shapes space” is enacted, not stated.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lyric, compressed diction mirrors claustrophobic breath control; patterned elision (“walls close like a familiar wound”) is taught early and paid off when walls literally yield. Perceptual signature is explorer-specific: geometry obsession, star-fixation, organ timbre felt as bone vibration. No dialogue, hence no voice convergence issue. Rhythm accelerates with corridor rotation, then exhales into dawn—an intentional cadence shift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High information density: one sentence often fuses metaphor, kinesthetic motion, and world rule (“the architecture staging its own quiet rebellion”). Figurative logic stays coherent—compass/constellation/organ form one celestial-mechanical lexicon. No filter-verb stacks or loops; sentence openings vary. Minor scaffold: two adjacent “the explorer” openings in paragraph 6; does not touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: claustrophobia as engine of spatial rebellion; organ memory as literal tectonic force. Crystalline key that is constellation-etched compass point fuses tropes into singular artifact. Risky lyric compression holds clarity. Final garden of humming fungi feels inevitable yet unanticipated. Transformation test fails if names changed—mutiny concept is inseparable from explorer’s breath-barrier.</comment>
