<comment>Mara’s interiority is evocative (“folded like origami”), yet her stakes remain abstract; she never makes a visible micro-choice that risks loss. The ledger and lens are handled, but the decision to “illuminate” is reported, not dramatized with cost. The shift from observer to facilitator is announced rather than embodied, so the change feels mild. Still, her quiet registrar persona is distinct and consistent.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the forecourt stones glow with communal honesty, a visible social cost that reweights the town’s rule-set. The lens-path (ticket-doodle → backstage → microphone → projected confessions) is causal and coherent. Orientation is secure by line 3; transitions are smooth. The mayor’s fresh ticket in the final beat nicely tightens the loop, proving the pattern persists, though the cost to Mara personally is only implied.</comment>

<comment>Rain-slick crystal, humming lens-glass, and “dust and old velvet” are tactile and POV-filtered. The forecourt returns as the charged final canvas, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography stays clean through the single tracking move to backstage. Weather is not backdrop but medium, mirroring the “thaw” of mistrust.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—thawing communal mistrust—is signaled early and escalates via each projection beat. The tightening occurs when the mayor’s new ticket proves the cycle must be maintained, narrowing Mara’s role from investigator to perpetual guardian. Cost is societal (transparency forever), but personal stakes for Mara stay oblique, keeping pressure slightly abstract. Agency is present yet gentle, fitting the lyric mode.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Theme—“honesty as communal light”—emerges through recurrent images of reflection and projection, never sermonized. The final image of the glowing forecourt offers a non-literal answer that reweights earlier doodles. Ambiguity is purposeful, resisting tidy moral. Echoes of “ambiguously clear” crystallize the idea that transparency need not be loud, earning resonance without assertion.</question>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Voice is hushed, crystalline, rhythmically controlled—“resonant hush” becomes cadence motif. Perceptual signature is consistent: Mara notices surfaces, light, ledger entries. Lexicon stays within registrar sensibility; no head-hop. Minor lyric abstractions (“universe whispered reassurance”) flirt with excess but are earned by atmospheric contract established early.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet fluid; sentences multitask (“Through that lens she could read the faint phosphorescence…”). No loops or synonym churn; metaphors stay coherent. One mixed moment—“chorus of murmurs that felt like words after words become unnecessary”—is self-conscious but doesn’t obscure causality. Rhythm modulates with discovery beats, accelerating as projections bloom.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>The “projector lens that amplifies walls’ honesty” is a fresh, specific tech-magical device; its logic is taught early and followed through. Doodles-as-map and puddles-as-screen transform mundane items into narrative engines. Town-as-canvas is not new, yet the coupling with registrar bookkeeping and quiet eavesdropping feels intimate and particular. Risk is moderate but coherent; no gimmicks, just reframed familiar elements.</comment>
