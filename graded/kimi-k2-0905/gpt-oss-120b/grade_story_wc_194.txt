<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lian’s curiosity is clear, but the text tells us he “hopes” and “realizes” rather than dramatizing contradictory impulses in scene; the final insight feels arrived at rather than earned through visible micro-choice. The cost—ancestral shame—is present yet abstract, so the emotional price is felt only lightly on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the scroll reweights dynasty myth into moral failure, producing Conceptual Repricing with social cost. Causality under Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each standing-wave beat thickens pattern until the floorboard reveal—but the middle relies on repeated “listening” beats that slightly stall escalation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Sepia room, brass gramophone, and oak slab are tactile, selective, and filtered through Lian’s antiquarian gaze; the “golden shadows” motif recurs to mark pattern shifts. The micro-setting (carved panel) literally channels the sound that unlocks the boards, satisfying the 9+ gate by constraining the final discovery.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recover lost truth—tightens once: the confession revalues lineage from glory to betrayal. Pressure is textural (density of sound imagery) rather than causal, appropriate to the lens, but the cost is intellectual, not visceral; no option is foreclosed for Lian personally.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme—silence as truer eloquence—emerges through the gramophone’s paradoxical quiet and the council’s “silent betrayal,” avoiding explicit moralizing. The final image of the quiet crank beside the open scroll reconfigures meaning without statement, though the insight is more cerebral than emotionally searing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Lian’s antiquarian perception; diction (“dust-kissed tomes,” “ember lantern”) is consistent, rhythmic, and filtered. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is stable, with syntax lengthening during the trance-like listening beats, then tightening at the reveal.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is lush yet controlled; figurative layering serves the accumulative design. Minor loop: “eloquently silent” is repeated four times—pattern taught but risks mannerism; no mixed metaphors or scaffold sentences; momentum holds until the final hush.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Sound-as-map and the “dynasty ender” label offer fresh angles on the archive mystery trope; the empire undone by curated ignorance rather than war is a thoughtful inversion. Risk is moderate—lyric stillness over plot—but particulars remain idiosyncratic to this voice and room.</comment>
