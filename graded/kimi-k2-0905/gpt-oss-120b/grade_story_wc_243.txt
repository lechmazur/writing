<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The archivist’s motive—preserve small moments—remains abstract; no concrete contradiction or micro-choice raises the stakes. He observes, writes, and feels, but the locket never forces a costly decision; interiority is lyrically voiced yet static. The ending’s “promise to the night” re-states, rather than tests, his goal.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: ledger closed, covenant renewed, sea-echo answers, cost felt in the chill metal pulse. Causality is light: the act of writing and locket placement is ritual, not reversible choice; lens is Accumulative/Textural—density and cadence reweight meaning. Orientation is swift; no sequence breaks. One paraphrase loop mid-text keeps it from the 8-band.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Jetty, tide, salt-air, and starlight are filtered through archivist perception; each sensory note is selective and stakes the mood. The locket serves as micro-setting that charges the final image—its glass moon-glow anchors the covenant. Spatial track is clean; no environmental detail floats unmoored.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“preserve small moments”—is declared early and reiterated, but pressure is atmospheric, not tactical; no option is foreclosed. Escalation is a thickening of lyric texture rather than a narrowing of choices. Cost is aesthetic (melancholy, chill) rather than actionable, keeping tension at the threshold of the high band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges: memory’s ink can outlive erasure; particulars of lighthouse/fisher pact and child-image give it flesh. Subtext whispers through sea-echo and ledger-sigh, avoiding thesis statements. Final starlit image reweights prior motifs without moralizing, though the abstraction “weight of small moments” edges toward echo.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays tight to archivist perception; perceptual signature is consistent—salt, jasmine, walnut ink, hinge-cold. Syntax ripples like tide, rhythm modulates with dusk-to-starlight shift. No head-hop or register drift; every clause serves mood or image. High-band control with microscopic hairline repetition.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is lush yet information-dense; metaphor vehicles stay coherent within maritime nocturne. One scaffold loop (“haunted euphoria” twice in four lines) and a single filter-verb cluster are minor artifacts. Otherwise clauses multi-task, rhythm breathes with scene tempo, and closure line is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Archivist-covenant-ledger conceit refreshes familiar “memory-keeper” trope; pairing it with tidal renewal and lighthouse beam logic gives local specificity. Risk is stylistic (lyric density) rather than structural; execution stays coherent. Could edge higher with a sharper causal twist, but the synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
