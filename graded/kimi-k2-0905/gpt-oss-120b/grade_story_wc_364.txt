<comment>The blacksmith’s interior contradiction—meek yet quietly relentless—stays on the page through embodied hammer-strokes and the trembling palm on stone. The bartered memory is a concrete micro-choice, its scar felt in the hush before the tunnel opens. Yet the “quietly determined” refrain drifts toward label-speak in the final paragraph, muting the cost he just paid. More idiosyncratic speech or a glitch in his smith-step under spectators’ eyes would have sealed the arc.</comment>

<comment>Causal chain holds: failed memory → tunnel opens → silk taken → blade rebuilds land. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the blade’s azure note re-weights the planet’s heart and the crowd’s stance. Cost is visible—the forge wrapped in the now-spent silk, his scar humming—but the lens tilts lyrical/accumulative rather than tight causal, so the final beat feels luminous more than irrevocable. A sharper physical drawback—burned fingerprints, cracked anvil—would have deepened the because/therefore.</comment>

<comment>Orchard planet, floating arches, sapphire fruit, and copper grove are filtered through the smith’s reverent gaze; detail is selective, never tourist list. The mine shaft glyphs glow azure exactly when his palm offers the memory, fusing setting to choice. The forge-under-arch micro-setting returns to charge the final image, its echoing stone a resonant drum for the blade’s first note. One slip: “violet dawns” appears once then vanishes, slightly under-using the chromatic motif that could have threaded pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—trade memory for future strength—is signaled early and tightened once when the tunnel demands the scar. Agency is present (he offers, he descends, he forges), but external pressure stays soft; no rival seeker, no collapsing shaft, so escalation is tonal, not tactical. The final crack-to-crystal moment re-weights the village ground, providing visible consequence, yet the price feels collective more than personal. A mid-shaft hallucination of the failed forge trying to pull him back would have sharpened the cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Theme of bartered awakenings emerges through the silk’s physical exchange, not authorial sermon. The blade-as-rebuilder subverts weapon trope, letting theme crystallize in object. Final image of dancing arch-shadows offers non-literal answer: renewal is communal resonance, not moral dictum. A trace of template cadence in “each hammerfall echoing the planet’s own steadfast chorus” nudges toward statement, keeping the score just shy of 7.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Voice owns a hushed, hammer-steady rhythm that scales with emotional heat; short percussive clauses mimic forge strikes, longer sentences bloom when the silk arrives. Perceptual signature is consistent: copper scent, azure glows, fruit hums filter through a craftsman’s narrowed attention. No dialogue, so no register drift; free indirect stays clean. One poetic stack—“rubble that haunted his dreams pulse like heartbeats”—edges purple but pays off immediately in the next strike, forgiven under lyrical lens.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Sentence variety and ear-rhythm are strong; no template cadence runs. Occasional soft modifiers—“quietly determined,” “gently determined”—repeat stem without deepening nuance, a minor loop. Mixed metaphor “comet draped stalactite” is fleetingly strained yet visually anchored. Closure line “planet’s own steadfast chorus” skirts drumbeat but lands cleanly, so artifact touches do not obscure the final image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Fantasy premise—memory-for-future barter via starlight silk—feels fresh against typical wish-fulfillment trope. Blacksmith who forges not war but rebuilding tools offers inverted heroism. Azure-defiant tone and orchard planet combine into a singular visual stance unlikely to survive relocation. Risk is moderate: lyric accumulation over plot reversals, yet coherence holds. A sharper unseen cost (the blade someday demands its own memory) would have nudged innovation into the 8+ band.</comment>
