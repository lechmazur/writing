<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The translator’s interiority is vivid—concrete sensory memory of father’s “glowing heart” in palm anchors vocation. Micro-choice chain (trace gull wing → align fragment → release into void) externalizes intuition under pressure. Cost is legible: dissolution of relic and self-into-wind renunciation, closing the child-to-now arc. Voice lapses into lyric echo-chamber twice (“time itself is a series of anchors…”) that edges toward performed profundity, trimming full 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: fragment’s vanishment re-weights city lights into “constellation of stories,” cost paid in tangible forfeiture and crystallized stance. Accumulative lens—pattern of painted clues, pulse-images—holds; cadence shift from crowded market to lone balcony crystallizes meaning. Orientation anchored by ~80 words; no lens ambiguity. One causal micro-gap: chain unfastens without spelled transfer of agency from translator to artifact, but pulse-forfeiture covers cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Rooftop market, rope ladders, canvases as doorways supply spatial pressure; body/tool/fragment converge in hollowed arch where choice is forced. Ozone-rain scent and lantern-eye replication feed final image. Selective hyper-detail (“brass constellations”) occasionally over-glazes, but environment directly constrains translator’s movements and supplies the only path to release. Meets 9+ gate: fragment-as-micro-setting charges closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—honor overlooked histories—signals early; pressure mounts via pattern convergence that risks permanent erasure of memory if translator mis-aligns. Escalation is accretive: each painting clue layers density until “air shivers” and chain loosens; no artificial reversals. Cost is conceptual—loss of tangible relic—but felt weight registers on page. Could use one sharper tactical trade-off mid-process to hit 8.5+ band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through image chain: light-as-memory, market-as-archive, wind-as-voice. No moral statement; final whispered promise lets reader carry the illumination. Subtext of translation-as-survival finances every micro-alignment. Minor drift toward abstraction in “time itself is a series of anchors” line, but resonance re-weights prior material without platitude.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>First-person lyric achieves distinct perceptual signature: wind-whispered names, pulse-delayed glass, coin-for-story commerce. Syntax mirrors alchemical process—elliptical, fragmentary, then crystalline final sentence. No head-hop; register stays within translator’s mystic vocation. One template cadence run (“I… I… I…”) mid-paragraph, not at peak, so 9+ remains attainable.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>High information density; most sentences dual-purpose (e.g., “glass cold yet humming with a pulse… eternal instant captured”). Figurative logic stays coherent—no mixed metaphors. Rhythm breathes: long accumulative clauses build to short release: “dissolve into the market’s night.” Scaffolding minimal; only two near-paraphrase echoes (“anchors… anchors…”) but do not touch closure. Clean proofing.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Fusion of rooftop alchemy market + memory-bearing lighthouse fragment feels inevitable and fresh. Concept of translator-of-worlds as archivist of sailor ghosts is non-obvious yet grounded in sensory commerce. Risk in lyric compression pays off: reader required to assemble map-paintings with narrator, mirroring act of translation. Transformation test passes—plot collapses if relic swapped out. No derivative premise penalty.</comment>
