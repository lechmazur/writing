<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Curiosity is named, not embodied; no contradictory impulse under pressure. The promise to guard echoes carries mild cost but is declared, not dramatized. Interiority drifts into lyric abstraction (“weight of incidental heroism”) rather than specific sensation. Voice remains consistent, yet emotional calibration feels smoothed rather than tested.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the restored photo and synchronized hymn reconfigure meaning with felt cost. Causality is soft—scanner synchrony and light spill verge on magical—but pattern is taught early and held. Orientation clear by ~100 words; no lens contradiction. Cost is legible in final image; persistent constraint (promise to guard) shapes future path.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mist-clad atrium, marble statues, and hearing-aid micro-setting are vividly filtered through POV. Glass dome, violet twilight, and ivy tapestry selectively anchor mood. Spatial track clean; no choreography slips. Environment guides attention but does not materially constrain final choice, capping entry to high band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—protect vulnerable voices—signaled early. Escalation is textural: pulses thicken, choir resonance intensifies, photo colors restore. Agency is attention/renunciation rather than confrontation; cost is conceptual resonance, not tangible loss. Tightening deepens mood but does not foreclose live option; still, pressure coheres under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: echoes, photographs, hearing aids as carriers of lost song. Final image answers the question “who will listen?” with quiet vow to guard. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers about scale of guardianship. Wisdom is earned through concrete sensory discovery rather than abstract assertion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>First-person lyric voice maintains perceptual signature: “cartographer of sighs,” “dying heart seeking remembrance.” Syntax swells and contracts with cadence of discovery. No dialogue; free indirect slips are clean. Register stays within plausible lexicon of introspective observer; rhythm supports rather than obscures clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Metaphor density high but patterned early; mixed metaphor risk in “sky whispered through stone” yet pays off in closure resonance. Some scaffold phrases—“faint tremor rose,” “pulse beckoned me”—repeat stems; minor loop artifact. Information density strong; sentences layer sensory, emotional, conceptual work. Final image crisp; no artifact touches closing beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Premise—“contact tracer for hearts” tracking dead voices via hearing aids—is fresh synthesis of ghost-story and data-poetics. Street-singer backstory and marble weeping statues personalize war-memory trope. Risky lyric compression mostly succeeds; reliance on transcendental light burst verges on trope but reweights earlier mist/photo motifs. Specificity of pulse-scanner method keeps concept from feeling gimmick.</comment>
