<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The queen’s “disenchantment” is asserted, not embodied; interiority drifts into cosmic lyricism (“starlight poured into her veins”) without grounding her contradictory impulses in-scene. No micro-choice shows her crown’s weight altering tactics; the orb-burst enlightenment is接收而非争取得来. The retinue functions as backdrop shadows; status crucible is absent.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Closure is a luminous CR—peace purchased by dream-dissolution—but causality between orb-burst and kingdom-wide relief is poetic leap, not earned linkage. Orientation is lush yet delayed; who/where stabilizes only after ~150 words. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; cadence shift at orb-burst reweights stake, satisfying short-form requirement.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>“Ember grotto / cobalt grotto” twin motif is vivid, senses balanced, and reappears charged in the final image, just squeaking past 9-test. Spatial choreography is dream-logic loose—no floor plan—but given lyric mode, acceptable. Selective detail (“air tasted of iron and old rain”) efficiently sets tone without catalog bloat.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—stop recurring dreams—clear early. Pressure accumulates via ascent & starlight density, but no visible cost (fatigue, injury, social risk) is dramatized; orb-burst solves rather than tightens. One meaningful deepening occurs when map-in-basin redirects to alcove, narrowing option under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme of sovereignty vs. private haunting emerges imagistically; crown as key is lovely reconfiguration. No moralizing statement; ambiguity survives. Recurrent starlight motif reweights from curse to map, fulfilling organic emergence. Absence of societal fallout keeps resonance personal, not realm-wide, capping upper band.</question>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Third-person lyric omniscient stays consistent; diction elevated but matching mythic register. Rhythm varies, uses fragment (“Follow,”) for beat acceleration. Metaphors occasionally layer three-deep (“silk ribbons stained with dark ink”) yet pattern is taught early and holds. No dialogue, so voice distinction clause inactive.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Read-aloud cadence musical; however, 14 instances of “-ing” participles in 60-line mid-section create template sway that dulls propulsion. Mixed metaphors (“cascade of light that seemed to bleed”) are coherent within lyric pact but still mildly clutter. No typos; pronoun reference clean. Density high; each sentence advances image or motion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dream-cartography via volcanic starlight is fresh synthesis; avoids stock evil-queen arc. Lyric compression risks obscurity but commits fully. Final crown/key inversion feels inevitable post-orb vision. Some phrasing edges purple, yet specificity of “ember map inside a crystal basin” keeps it this-worldly enough.</comment>
