<comment>The philosopher’s mechanical arm and sundial obsession give him a vivid silhouette, yet his interiority stays ornamental; we never feel contradictory wants under the duel’s pressure. The diplomat’s “diplomatically fierce” mask is stated repeatedly but never tested by a micro-choice that shows cost. The climactic alignment of needle-card + sundial shadow reads as author flourish, not earned character decision. Result: imaginative archetypes, but no lived-in vulnerability that forces a change with felt price.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the philosopher maps the riddle-answer onto the sundial, sealing the overture into a public “map” for future scholars—an undeniable social cost for both duelists. Causal chain is lyric-elliptical rather than strict because/therefore, but pattern is taught early (waiting-for-still-water ritual) and coherent under Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) is clear before 120 words; no penalty. Sundial geometry works as persistent constraint; final pinning of needles to its angles satisfies 9+ quick test. Minor slip: duel escalation summarized more than dramatized, keeping score sub-exceptional.</comment>

<comment>Glass atrium + brook function as micro-setting: reflective surfaces literalize the story’s mirror-of-purpose motif and constrain the duel to a contained echo-chamber. Half-painted sundial is re-used tactilely—angles traced, shadow aligned, needles pinned—so environment directly shapes final image. Sensory economy favors sound (babble, metallic hum) over visual clutter, matching “hidden overture” acoustics. Spatial choreography is clean; no floating bodies or teleporting props.</comment>

<grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—can intellectual combat turn questions into destinations?—is signaled early and re-asked at the end, giving the duel conceptual stakes beyond victory. Escalation is tonal deepening rather than causal narrowing: each sword-clang adds a paragraph to the “story of reason and rhythm,” reweighting the same stake with poetic density. No visible price (blood, forfeiture) is paid; cost is purely conceptual when the duel becomes a public lecture. Sufficient for length under Accumulative lens, but lower band because cost is oblique, not viscerally felt.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<comment>Theme emerges without sermon: the transformation of pure inquiry into shared path is shown via the sundial-needle map, not told. Hidden overture motif starts as private tension, ends as public infrastructure—an elegant CR that reweights earlier motifs. Final riddle-question (“where does a question go…”) is voiced by the philosopher, not the narration, avoiding thematic Echo penalty. Complexity accepted: victory is philosophical yet social, diplomate concedes without humiliation.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<comment>Third-person lyric voice sustains a consistent archaic-philosophic register that matches the atrium-brook soundscape. Sentence rhythm mimics fencing cadence—parataxis for thrusts, trailing participles for ripples—so prose *is* the overture. No dialogue, so naturalism test is waived. Perceptual signature is present (copper fingers whir, blade sings counter-melody), but occasional template cadence (“the… the…” openings) and Latinate abstractions nudge it below 9-band.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<comment>Strong read-aloud musicality; figurative language is disciplined to acoustic/geometry motifs. No mixed metaphors or scaffold loops, but slight over-painting: “dignified chaos” repeated three times becomes ornamental; “question into destination” paraphrased four times approaches churn. Information density high—each sentence layers image + sound + concept—so momentum survives. Closure line “every question… can become a destination” would hit harder if cut to image alone; the explanatory clause blunts the chord.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<comment>Fencing duel as collaborative epistemology feels fresh; merging sundial cryptography with sound-overture is a striking conceptual splice. Core risks—lyric summary over scene, abstract stakes—mostly pay off because the final map-image concretizes the abstraction. Still, “dueling scholars in glass garden” flirts with boutique steampunk tableau; fresher for its execution than its seed. Does not retreat to safety middle, but not quite transformative enough for top band.</comment>
