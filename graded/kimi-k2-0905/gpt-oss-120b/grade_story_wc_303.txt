<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is lush and character-specific—her “mulberry ache” and tactile handling of the ice violin embody grief under pressure. The telepathic vine bond is accepted without diagnostic speak, and her final micro-choice to “propagate dissent” through music is a credible, earned stance. Missing: a visible contradiction that would make her decision cost feel sharper; the empire envoy’s mirrored ache arrives late, so relationship-as-crucible pressure is thin. Still, her flaws (archive-bound caution, solitary grief) directly shape the tactic, satisfying the 9- gate.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the envoy lowers his sword, the city rises, the vines physically grow its foundation—cost is visible and irreversible. Causal lens holds: coffee-stain prophecy → vine dissent encoded in violin → envoy’s change of heart. One soft spot: the envoy’s interior shift is granted to him rather than forced by an overt action from Elara; a hairline slip but not a break. All else—object stakes, time pressure, metaphor pattern—tightens toward this final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The velvet observatory is more than postcard: its brass telescope, swaying lamps, and perforated ceiling become projection surfaces for the destiny map, directly guiding choice. Micro-setting mastery: the ice violin doubles as tool and mirror, its chill constraining Elara’s hand and decision tempo. Spatial choreography is flawless—no floating props or impossible distances. Only the floating city exterior is off-stage; because the closure image is the vine-grown garden rising within the dome, the absence is acceptable.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“dream vs empire”—is declared early and tightened exactly once when the violin/coffee reading forces Elara to broadcast vine-dissent rather than accept annexation. Agency is present but light: her decisive act is to “weave their whispers into the violin’s song,” a sonic tactic that persuades off-stage power. Cost is legible: the empire’s envoy lowers his sword, the city gains autonomy, Elara keeps her mulberry ache—trade-off acknowledged. Pressure plate is single yet sufficient for 700-word scope; could enter 8.5+ if the envoy’s test were on-page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</answer><comment>Theme emerges through recurring organic nets—lattice, vine, perforated map—so “propagate change through roots” stays implicit, never sermonized. Final image reweights the premise: empire’s iron yields to living tendrils, a conceptual repricing of power without spoken moral. Subtext in gesture (envoy’s sword lowering, leaves unfurling as emerald flags) carries the argument. Only a faint halo of pseudo-profundity in “even a single note could propagate change” keeps it shy of 9+.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person lyric close-in stays stable, no head-hop. Perceptual signature is consistent: archival precision (“provenance researcher whose life was a lattice of archives”) meets synesthetic botany (“heard the quiet thoughts of the creeping vines”). Rhythm modulates—long, swaying sentences under amber lamplight, then staccato frost chords. Compression is purposeful; non-standard punctuation absent, so no artifact penalties arise.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Read-aloud cadence varies; sentence lengths and openings modulate without algorithmic drumbeat. Figurative language is dense but patterned (ice, lattice, perforation) and paid off at ceiling-crack climax—no coherence break. No filter-verb stacks or synonym loops; props track cleanly. Highest pressure beat (“She chose to propagate the vines' dissent…”) keeps syntax tight and information multi-layered. A single mixed metaphor—“mulberry ache…flavored every decision like bitter fruit”—is vivid enough to pass.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fusion of ice violin + telepathic botany + coffee-stain cartography feels inevitable, not gimmicky; each element reweights another. Premise transforms two dusty tropes—fortune-telling and chosen-one rebellion—into archival botany noir. Risk in lyric non-linear escalation is taught early by stained porcelain “veins” and pays off in ceiling constellation of cracks. Specificity anchors universals: velvet observatory, brass telescope, mulberry grief—details that would collapse if swapped.</comment>
