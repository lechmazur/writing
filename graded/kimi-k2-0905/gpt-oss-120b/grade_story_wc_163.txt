<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Aria’s interiority drifts into lyric abstraction (“rhythm of belonging”) rather than embodied contradiction; no micro-choice visibly costs her anything, so the ending’s “etched” feeling reads asserted, not earned. The burnt feather acts as symbolic prop, not a decision engine. Because she never risks or forfeits an on-page want, the arc stays observational.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise—she exits with sky-maps and sunrise—but the cost is purely lyrical; no prior option is foreclosed. Causal chain is loose: because she inhales fireflies, therefore the city awakens is magical logic without constraint. Orientation is clear by ~100 words, so no penalty, yet escalation remains atmospheric, not tactical.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Bioluminescent algae, coral pedestal, and holographic dome create tactile, POV-filtered specificity; the city’s glass epochs mirror Aria’s star charts, integrating setting with theme. Spatial choreography stays coherent across descent. The environment does not actively constrain her choices, capping the score below 9.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Stakes—“learn the rhythm of belonging”—stay abstract; no visible price or narrowing of options occurs. The city’s hum escalates lyric density but does not force a decision or trade-off. Agency is contemplative, not consequential; coincidence (fireflies awaken instruments) supplies the climax.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme of belonging emerges through mirrored constellations (desert/sea) and the final image of sky-maps carried ashore. Subtext remains soft; no competing value complicates the longing. The resonance is pleasing but single-note, lacking the friction needed for higher bands.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays stable, with astronomy-laced diction (“constellations,” “comet’s tail”) that feels character-specific. Rhythm modulates between long breathy sentences and crisp fragments, supporting wonder. No dialogue to test voice distinction; internal register never slips into cliché.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Figurative layering is dense—every sentence carries metaphor—but pattern is consistent, not chaotic. Occasional scaffold (“softly ingenious” repeated) and abstract noun stacks (“luminous respite,” “shadowseam wonder”) create slight purple tint. No loops obscure causality; clarity holds through closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Underwater star-map city and landscape astrology feel freshly synthesized; the burnt feather as cosmic tuning fork is an evocative tool. Risk is moderate—lyric accumulation over plot—but the piece commits fully to its mood. Tropes are personalized enough to avoid template feel.</comment>
