<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Interiority is textured—"fidgets productively," "paradox of calm rage"—and the pawn-memory anchors guilt. Yet the self-forgiveness turn leans therapeutic ("he let go of the pawn") rather than dramatized; no fresh micro-choice in the climax proves the change. Still, the single-POV arc is coherent and the embodied anxiety carries most beats.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the dissolved labyrinth and re-hung "banner of peace" show visible cost—his exile status is unchanged but internally reframed. Causal chain holds: decoding threads → gate opens → altar confrontation → release. Orientation is swift; the tapestry-labyrinth link is taught by 25% mark. One minor elasticity: the "soft sigh" gate opening feels slightly convenient, but the prior tactile labor justifies it.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Time-frozen village, lightning-lull, and platinum corridors create a tight, dream-logic stage that filters every choice. The tapestry’s frayed threads literally gate progress, satisfying the 9+ constraint. Sensory economy is good—sound is "muted," wind "never moved"—but the repeated "woven hush" phrase edges toward motif overuse without new informational weight.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—self-forgiveness—is signaled early and tightened once: the pawn-dissolution scene forecloses retreat. Pressure is accumulative/textural; each corridor reflection adds density rather than new external obstacles. Cost is felt (labyrinth softens, exile remains), but the price is largely internal; a sharper external ramification would push higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of forgiveness-as-process emerges through chess metaphors and the unweaving ritual, avoiding explicit moral. The final image of the "woven hush" now singing implies redemption without stating it. Subtext stays in gesture—tracing threads equals retracing sins—though the pawn symbol dominates so thoroughly that secondary nuances have little room.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays close to the tutor’s perceptual filter: syntax lengthens during reflection, shortens during tactile decoding. "Woven hush," "fierce repose" function as compressed paradoxes consistent with his chess-trained mind. No dialogue, so voice distinction is moot; the narrative voice is distinct and sustained.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is rhythmically controlled, with sentence variety that mirrors emotional ebb. Figurative layering is dense ("king’s strategy in a silent game") yet remains coherent. One scaffold tic: "the woven hush" is repeated four times with diminishing returns; trimming one instance would sharpen the music. Otherwise, high information density and zero grammar issues.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Chess-exile meets mythic soul-labyrinth is a fresh synthesis; the tapestry-as-code device particularizes the premise. Risk is moderate—time-frozen village is familiar magic-realist territory—but the internal chess logic redeems it. The pawn-sacrifice war backstory flirts with melodrama yet stays grounded through tactile present action.</comment>
