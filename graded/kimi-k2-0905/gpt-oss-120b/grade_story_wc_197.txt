<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara’s “quiet smile” and “fierce resolve” remain abstract labels; no embodied contradiction plays out under pressure. Her single on-page choice—inserting the key—springs from prior label, not dramatized interior friction, so the cost feels generic rather than personal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the transmission reweights public memory, cost legible in “ghosts they ignored.” Causal lens holds; each beat (key salvage → map read → broadcast) links by therefore. Micro-weakness: the map’s liquid-memory rule is introduced late, barely taught, yet powers climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Auric lagoon and starlit ripples constrain movement (hidden platform) and charge the final silhouette; transmitter antenna pointing “toward the heavens” crystallizes the exit image. Sensory economy favors gold/star coin metaphors that match rebel treasure trope; no clutter, no orientation debt.</comment>

<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—truth broadcast vs. regime indifference—tightens once: map → key → transmission narrows options to one slot. Cost is conceptual but unmistakable: rulers must “confront the ghosts they ignored.” No visible personal loss; hence not quite 8+.</comment>
<question>5</question>
<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through image chain: coins/ripples → forgotten footsteps → public memory reclaimed. No moralizing; final “coded ripple” reweights prior “scattered coins” without statement. Subtext in silence of citizens listening via “cracked radios” carries the emotional after-effect.</comment>
<question>6</question>
<grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Lyrical third-person hovers at consistent mythic distance; no head-hopping. Syntax swells into cadenced anaphora (“the lagoon whispering…”) that mirrors radio wave repetition—pattern taught early and paid off. Diction stays within fairytale register, no filter-verb stacks.</comment>
<question>7</question>
<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Rhythm consciously musical, but figurative density in places (“silver veil,” “molten gold,” “phantom fireflies”) approaches purple threshold; one mixed metaphor—“starlight like scattered coins” then “lagoon… molten gold”—slightly blurs physical logic. No loops, no paraphrase, momentum clean.</comment>
<question>8</question>
<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Fusing phone-booth key + liquid-mirror map + pirate-radio resistance feels fresh; each element transforms mundane tech into mythic artifact. Risk—lyric overwriting—mostly justifies itself through coherent fairytale tone. Transformation test: swap lagoon for alley, story collapses.</comment>
