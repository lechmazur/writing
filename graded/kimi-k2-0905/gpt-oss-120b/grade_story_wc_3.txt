<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Lira’s shift from solitary preservation to shared enlightenment is internally coherent and embodied; the “kindly methodical” trait shows in tactile seed-handling and patient note-taking. The contradiction between haunted ambition and compassionate yield is alive in-scene, not abstract. The final decision to descend carries visible cost—she forfeits the arbor’s certainty—earning the closure turn. Minor: the “physics of transition” want remains slightly academic; a single sensory jolt of personal loss could have tipped it into 8.5+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the seed’s sprout reweights her mission from hoarding to gifting, with the silver-particle snowfall as felt cost. Causal lattice holds—each glyph-pulse → magnetic alignment → seed germination → bridge to spirit—without loose joints. Orientation is clean by word 60; arbor location and floating chronology are anchored through motion and hum. One micro-turn (ladder becomes spiral) tightens the line of action under Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The magnetic arbor is not backdrop but instrument: branch frequencies supply the metaphorical soil that literally tunes the seed. Iron-kissed leaves bending light constrain visibility and therefore choice—she must sing the glyphs at the correct hum. The silver-particle cascade is a final-image environmental cost that recharges every prior metallic whisper. Spatial choreography remains intact as she steps from twig to twig, seed cupped against static.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can haunted ambition be transmuted into living knowledge—tightens once: the seed’s sprout proves the bridge works, foreclosing her retreat into mere archiving. Pressure grows via density increase rather than external antagonist; each aligned leaf adds visceral evidence that the spirit’s departure can still be conversed with. Cost is legible in the arbor’s loss of harmony particles—finite resource now gifted to the clouds. Slight reserve: the stakes are conceptual; a sharper personal stake (memory of a beloved she failed to translate) could have pushed higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges non-didactically: translation as cultivation, not extraction—every decoded glyph a seed that must die to become shared fruit. Subtext lives in magnetic grammar: static discharge = unspoken grief; alignment = consent to let go. The final image of arbor branches “like welcoming arms” reweights earlier haunted ladder into an embrace without moralizing. Avoids explicit “moral” sentence; resonance lingers in the taste of iron on the tongue.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person POV stays tight inside Lira’s perceptual filter: she hears “ancient codes” in wind, notices frequency before color—translator’s synesthesia. Rhythm flexes: long lyrical sentences during humming alignment, staccato notes when seed first cracks. Filter verbs (“she felt”) are minimal and voice-motivated, appearing only when distance is required to survive the spiritual touch. No head-hopping; arbor’s hum remains external phenomenon she interprets, not omniscient lore.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is textured yet propulsive: “iron-kissed leaves humming with static that bent the very light” does triple sensory work in one breath. No synonym loops; each metallic image returns with altered charge (dust → snow → bridge). Figurative language thins at climax—final paragraph trusts plain image of blossom drinking bark, letting metaphor cede to wonder. One micro-scaffold: “she whispered the ancient tablet verses, each glyph mapped to a pulse” could lose “ancient” without loss; otherwise clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Fusion of cuneiform scholarship with living magnetism feels inevitable, not grafted—seed as both data packet and fruit is a fresh synthesis. Haunted-ambition trope is inverted: success is release, not capture. Risk in floating arbor pays off by making physics of transition literally testable on-branch. Not 9+ only because the valley epilogue is foreshadowed rather than dramatized, slightly softening the conceptual punch.</comment>
