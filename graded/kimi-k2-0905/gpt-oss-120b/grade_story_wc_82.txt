<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The lantern maker’s grief is stated rather than dramatized; “fold grief into origami cranes” is abstract and never tested by an on-page contradiction or loss. His interiority circles the same ache in ornate paraphrase (“luminous torment” repeated) without a micro-choice that complicates his stance. The cranes lift, but we don’t see him hesitate, miscut, or sacrifice anything to make them—so the emotional cost is inferred, not embodied. Voice is vivid, yet the absence of visible flaw or counter-desire keeps the arc schematic.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure is a lyrical Resonant Reconfiguration: the basilica ascends/descends while cranes carry grief skyward, a charged poise that reweights the premise. Causality is soft—dream-polishing rules are revealed mid-stream and the noon-shadow mechanic is never motivated—so the lens is Accumulative/Textural rather than tight Causal. Orientation is clear by paragraph 3, but the surreal physics (shadow rises by falling) risks momentary drift. The final image earns its awe, yet the price (lantern empty, grief “dissolving”) is declared, not dramatized, keeping it just shy of 9-band precision.</comment>

<comment>Floating tea garden is sketched with jasmine steam, dew-slick stone, and bamboo arches—economy of sense details that stays inside the maker’s artisan eye. Glass basilica functions as both setting and tool, its refracting panes literally steering the closure ascent; this dual use satisfies the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography stays clean as the maker polishes, folds, and releases cranes across the same ledge. Weather and scent evolve (roasted jasmine at dusk) to mark the cycle’s end, keeping the locale alive rather than backdrop.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“can he transmute private grief into communal light”—is signaled early and deepens through each polishing pass. No external antagonist; pressure is accumulative: each crane folded is another gram of sorrow distilled, a soft but legible tightening. The shadow-detach moment acts as a living clock, forcing the ritual to begin, yet the text repeats this cue twice without new consequence, muting escalation. Cost is conceptual—grief “dissolves” rather than a tangible object lost—so the price is felt but not visible on the page, capping entry to the 8-band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of alchemy—private loss rendered into shared beauty—emerges through imagery of glass, light, and flight rather than exposition. The basilica’s ascent/descent reconfigures meaning: transcendence rooted in submersion, an earned paradox. Subtext in crane-folding is implied, never sermonized, though the phrase “luminous torment” edges toward self-conscious lyric refrain. Final choir of voices offers ambiguous benediction: comfort and indictment coexist, satisfying the call for complexity without tidy moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Third-person close filters every perception through the lantern maker’s artisan gaze: glass ‘thin as a sigh’, sundial shadow ‘like ink’. Syntax stretches into long breath-clauses that mimic the act of glass-blowing, then tightens into single-stroke verbs during crane release—rhythmic control under pressure. No dialogue, so voice must carry idiosyncrasy; diction occasionally over-ornaments (“amber horizon refracting into rainbows that sang to the wind”) but stays pattern-consistent. Perceptual signature is strong enough that any swap of maker for another craft would fracture the metaphor chain, meeting 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm is musical, yet figurative density averages >1 metaphor per sentence; in the final third this tips into purple haze that dulls the closure image. Mixed metaphor risk: “origami cranes…tiny satellites toward the basilica’s crown” layers vehicle on vehicle. Template cadence appears: “He lifts…He watches…He smiles” triple openers near end, noticeable because earlier syntax varied. No paraphrase loops, but redundant anaphora (“the lantern maker…”) costs propulsion; still, grammar is clean and pronouns unambiguous.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Premise—dream-capturing glass church on aerial tea island—synthesizes steampunk spirituality with East-Asian craft ritual; feels fresh yet inevitable. Crucially, the “descends while ascending” paradox is not gimmick: it manifests physically in the basilica and emotionally in the maker’s simultaneous release/return of grief. Risk of over-lyric prose is taken consciously and mostly paid off by closure resonance. Near-echoes of Miyazaki or Le Guin exist, but specificity of lantern-maker trade lore and jasmine-sand scent anchors the vision beyond homage.</comment>
