<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The fortune-cookie writer’s interiority is lyrically sketched—“transpose life into a new key”—but we never see contradictory impulses collide in a single beat; decisions are summarized rather than dramatized. His “surge of purpose” is declared, not embodied in micro-choice, so the foreseen cost feels intellectual, not visceral. The arc lands in stasis rather than change, but the prior causality is too thin to make the renunciation sting.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Closure is present: a Conceptual Repricing that reweights the cookies as propagators of encoded destinies. Yet the lens is Accumulative/Textural, and the causal chain between microdot specs, ink spiral, and reader transformation is elliptically summarized rather than shown; the “visitor” beat arrives late and anonymous, blurring who undergoes the decisive change. Orientation is clear within 120 words, but the pivot from accidental to deliberate prophecy is told, not demonstrated, softening the because/therefore linkage.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The lighthouse, lantern beam, and salt-slick stone are vividly rendered through sensory selection that mirrors the spiral ink motif. Environmental details (steaming tray, copper telegraph coils) are woven into action, constraining how the writer directs scent and ink. The final image of the gull clutching dissolving paper re-uses the setting to charge the thematic reweighting, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—control of encoded fate—arrives early, but pressure escalates only through lyrical summary: “he realized... he set... he guided.” The visitor’s sudden comprehension is off-stage POV leakage; we neither feel the cookies’ cost nor witness a narrowing of the writer’s options. The tightening is poetic rather than tactical, so the cost remains atmospheric, not visceral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>The “open secret” motif emerges organically from fortune-cookie form, and the final reconfiguration—private lives now publicly re-codable—carries understated ethical weight. Theme avoids moral slogans, instead crystallizing in the gull’s cry that “rewires” strangers. The paradox of accidental prophecy is named but not explored in contradiction, keeping ambiguity intact yet slightly under-complicated.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Voice owns a consistent lyric-elliptical texture; diction stays within the narrator’s philosophical register. Sentence rhythm modulates from long, wind-howled clauses to staccato “encoded breaths,” mirroring rising sweep of the lantern. No dialogue to judge; perceptual signature is distinct, though occasional elevated phrasing—“conceptual repricing” level—edges toward loftiness rather than lived-in grit.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and image-rich, yet figurative layering occasionally stacks three metaphors in four lines (“mirror,” “echo,” “flag of revelation”), diluting clarity. Several near-paraphrase pairs (“set free... ripple through the world, as familiar as the scent of sea salt”) create micro-loops. Momentum survives, but the final third’s lyric surfeit slightly dulls the closure image’s precision.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Fusing microdot espionage with fortune-cookie aphorism is a fresh, specific synthesis; the spiral-ink/visual-echo mechanic feels inevitable in hindsight. The concept commits fully, resisting explanatory exposition. Risk is moderate—lyric montage rather than scene—but the piece avoids gimmickry by tethering imagery to the lighthouse’s mechanical sweep.</comment>
