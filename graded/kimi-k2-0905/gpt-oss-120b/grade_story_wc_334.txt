<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The folklorist’s curiosity is asserted but never dramatized as contradiction or risk; she observes, kneels, whispers, but no micro-choice shows her weighing cost or facing failure. Interiority stays scenic (“she realized…”) rather than embodied under pressure. The earned return of memories feels gentle, not a stance that forecloses a path with visible cost—more gift than renunciation. Competence outweighs struggle; flaws stay off-stage.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the orchard re-emerges, songs echo, greenhouse stands “testament,” cost felt in communal nostalgia rather than private loss. Causal chain is lyric-associative (mushroom–constellation–sextant–orchard) rather than because/therefore; pattern holds under Accumulative lens. Orientation is clear by line 5, no penalty. One meaningful tightening—water recedes as caps lock—suffices for length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Greenhouse, wrecks, kelp, rust, saplings: sensory triangulation is vivid and selective, filtered through folklorist’s professional eye. Salt-sugar air and amber sun charge the final image, reweighting stake from loss to reclamation. Spatial choreography stays clean; no floating rooms. World rules stay consistent; no exposition dumps.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recover village memories—signals early; pressure is atmospheric (decay, salt, rust) rather than narrowing options. No visible resource lost or path foreclosed; success arrives as revelation, not trade-off. Escalation reads as density increase of image, not tightening of choice. Cost is communal nostalgia, felt but not paid by protagonist’s agency.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</question><grade>Theme of collective memory reclaimed through living archive emerges via fungal constellation and returned songs, never sermonized. Broken/repaired motif recurs naturally in hulls, sextant, mushroom caps, final orchard. Ambiguity lingers: sea still keeps secrets, greenhouse remains ghostly. Final image reweights premise without moral—memory as perennial root, not moral lesson.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Lyric third-person stays tight to folklorist’s perceptual filter: tide-soaked boots, brine-laden air, sugar-salt taste. Syntax flexes from clipped (“She knelt…”) to sonorous (“chorus of ancient singers”) without losing control. No head-hop or register drift. Dialogue absent; no penalty. Rhythm modulates with scene breath, no template cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm varied; sentences advance image or mythic pulse. Occasional lyrical surplus (“the sea that had both taken and given back stories”) but never muddles causality. No loops, scaffold, or synonym churn. Information density high; each paragraph adds sensory or mythic layer. Closing line crisp, salted, resonant.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Fairy-ring-as-memory-circuit is fresh; shipwreck-constellation mirror less so, but salt-orchard image is specific. Folklorist procedural detail (rust constellations, sextant shard) feels idiosyncratic, not template. Risk resides in lyric accumulative structure rather than twist; coherence maintained. Transformation holds: remove mushroom or greenhouse and story collapses.</comment>
