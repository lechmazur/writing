<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is lyrically rendered (“the weight of every chalk line”) but remains performative; no contradictory impulse acts in-scene. Her only micro-choice—pressing the envelope to the clipboard—is purely ceremonial, so the ending’s “quiet assurance” feels unearned. The flaw is diagnostic self-awareness instead of embodied tension under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the drone-lift reconfigures meaning and carries conceptual cost (“encoded hope”). Causality is lyric-accumulative; the chalk glyphs tighten into pulse, but the mailbox-on-rooftop reveal is introduced late and never constrained prior tactics. Orientation is clear by ~100 words; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The arcade’s golden glow and cracked pavement function as micro-setting that constrains the chalk-code ritual. Sensory hierarchy respects POV—Mara notices neon flicker and sun-warmed paper, not tourist catalog. The clipboard as recurring object charges the final holographic map, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Stakes are declared—“discover meaning in the margins”—but never tightened into a live trade-off; no option is foreclosed. Escalation is textural (color-shift, drone rise) rather than causal; the pressure feels atmospheric, not agency-driven. Cost is conceptual, not viscerally felt.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: marginalia as luminous future-fossil. The final image reweights the premise without moralizing. No motif is forced; chalk, clipboard, and drone recur naturally. Avoids echoed prompt language, though “futuristic nostalgia” is named once mid-text.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person lyric close-up maintains stable psychic distance; perceptual signature is selective (“constellations etched,” “pixelated seas”). Syntax modulates with pressure—short pulses at drone lift. No dialogue to test voice divergence. Register stays within Mara’s plausible lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythm breathes with scene beats; sentence openings vary. Four adjacent sentences begin with “The” in the drone paragraph—minor template cadence (−0.2). No mixed metaphors; “pixelated seas” is precise. Information density high; no scaffold loops. Closure image clear.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: chalk-code + surface-mail + arcade nostalgia. Transformation test passes—this exact emotional arc needs these exact objects. Risk in lyric-accumulative structure heightens coherence. No derivative premise; avoids cliché of “retro-futurist” badge.</comment>
