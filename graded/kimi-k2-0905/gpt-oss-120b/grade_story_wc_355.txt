<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Pacifist’s motive—catalog silence to seed empathy—remains abstract; no embodied contradiction or micro-choice under pressure. The diary opening is a passive triumph, not a costly decision; interiority drifts into performed sincerity (“theatrical sincerity” is named, not dramatized). No relationship crucible or status shift on stage; stakes stay conceptual. Earned stasis is asserted, not paid for.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the glowing diary and collective exhale reweight silence into shared listening; cost is conceptual but legible. Accumulative lens holds: crystal plates, heartbeat tuning, and fireworks cadence tighten texture toward final resonance. Orientation is swift; no因果 breaks. One soft spot: the “locked diary clasp” emits glow before any visible failure or price, blunting the causal hinge.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Workshop rendered as living instrument—iron ribs, copper-lavender vibrations—filters through pacifist’s synesthetic bias; space breathes with him. Micro-setting (diary clasp) physically transmits memory via frequency, constraining the tuning action. Selective sensory hierarchy (sound over sight) mirrors mission. No spatial drift; stars and fireworks supply coherent temporal anchor.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—access hidden silences—signaled early; escalation is textural: each frequency layer thickens resonance until diary yields. No external antagonist; pressure is accumulative density. Final fireworks act as cadence shift, not resolution, leaving silence-to-empathy transfer unfinished—cost felt but options not foreclosed. Sufficient tightening for 600-word scope, yet stakes remain cerebral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme—empathy via attuned listening—emerges through synesthetic cataloguing rather than statement. Final image of glowing pages guiding “lost travelers” reweights prior silences into communal harbor without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers: whose stories, what price? Subtext resides in metallic breath and unseen ink, not explanation. Avoids tidy thesis; resonance is sensory, not platitude.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to pacifist’s perceptual signature: sound as color, tools as musical notes. Rhythm swells with scene—long sentences during tuning, clipped fragments at clasp click. No head-hopping; diction stays within poetic but consistent lexicon. Occasional loftiness (“midnight parchment”) risks register drift yet reads as character’s theatrical idiom.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense but musical; figurative chains serve accumulative lens. No loops or scaffold; each image advances texture. One mixed metaphor—“windows black as midnight parchment” conflates transparency with writing surface—barely grazes clarity. Otherwise precise, varied rhythm; read-aloud ear test passes. High density fits 800-word ceiling without stall.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: empathy as literal frequency tuning of forgotten silences, fused with metallurgic memory. Not a stock trope; execution commits fully. Risk of preciousness is present but justified by voice. Transformational hinge—blank pages blooming only when whispered silences are heard—feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
