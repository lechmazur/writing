<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The stationer’s motive—collecting “textures of time”—is vivid, but interiority is lyric-paraphrase (“understood that invented histories were bridges”) rather than concrete contradiction under pressure; no micro-choice visibly forfeits an alternative path, so the renunciation feels abstract, not earned. Embodied emotion is present in moss-light notation yet never peaks to crystallize cost. Still, perceptual signature and consistent obsession keep him individuated.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure is a lyric Resonant Reconfiguration: the bonsai inhale the lamp’s hum, reweighting invented histories as bridges; cost is conceptual but legible. Causality is accumulative/textural—density of light-notes tightens until meaning refracts; orientation (who/where/when) is clear by word 40. One soft spot: the “town silent” device is declared, never pressed or paid for, so external stakes feel ornamental rather than causal.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Miniature bonsai forest functions as micro-setting: its branching corridors physically guide the stationer’s stops and refract dawn light onto the page, directly shaping how histories are charted. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true—he smells resin, tastes silence, ignores town. Spatial choreography stays crisp; no geography drift. The environment’s living lattice supplies the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—capture invisible time-textures—signaled early; pressure intensifies via light-pattern density rather than external opposition. Escalation is a single deepening: dawn gold scatters, pages darken, silence pulses anew. Because no live option is foreclosed (he simply keeps walking), cost is atmospheric, not tactical; tension accrues but never narrows choice. Sufficient for length under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges obliquely: invented histories as compassionate falsities that keep communal memory alive. Subtext resides in tactile metaphors—pressed petals, refracted lanterns—rather than assertion. Final image of labyrinth inhaling hum reweights premise: stories are bridges, not lies. avoids moralizing; resonance lingers in the reader’s re-evaluation of silence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person lyric voice sustains incandescent restraint: long vowel cadences, controlled metaphor density, diction rooted in stationer’s craft (“satchel heavy with purpose and paper”). Perceptual signature—every observation bent through light-refract lexicon—never falters. No head-hop; psychic distance stable. Filter verbs are voice-motivated (“he would refract that hum”) and pattern-taught early. A hairline slip: “incandescent restraint” is self-diagnostic, but occurs mid-passage, not at peak.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Rhythmic variation mirrors dawn’s gradual brightening; sentences lengthen then fragment as light scatters. Figurative language is dense but patterned—each metaphor extends optic/botanical schema, avoiding mixed-logic. Zero paraphrase loops; no scaffold. Information density high: single sentence often layers time-texture, tool, and motion. Proofing clean; only minor over-modification (“bruised violet sky”) but fits palette.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Premium concept: stationer cartographer of unmade pasts via fluorescent hum-spectrography grafted onto bonsai mountaintop—fresh yet inevitable. Synthesis feels organic; no trope checklist. Risk lies in lyric stillness that could verge precious, but restraint keeps it from ornament. Transformation test passes: swap setting or object and the emotional algebra collapses. One notch off 8+ because silent-town device remains under-exploited.</comment>
