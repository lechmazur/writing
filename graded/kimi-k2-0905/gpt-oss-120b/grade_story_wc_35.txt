<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lir is given a single, mystical competence—tasting memories—that never collides with a contradictory impulse; his interiority is poetic but not individuated (no micro-choice tests the gift). The “sandpaper rough memories” motive is announced, not dramatized through conflicting wants, so the climax feels pre-ordained rather than earned under rising pressure. Because no secondary character shares the scene, relationship crucible and status dynamics are N/A. Still, the embodied sensory hook of “bitter as burnt cumin, bright citrus of redemption” keeps the portrait from abstractions and earns mid-to-high band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lens is Accumulative/Textural: tidal-pool pattern mirrors memory ebb/flow, pressure deepens through imagistic repetition rather than causal reversals. Closure lands as Charged Poise: coral cracks sigh, remorse-carrying chill flips to “sweet promise of memory,” cost felt as atmospheric release. Orientation anchor (“who/where/when”) is cleanly delivered inside first 60 words. No meaningful tightening—no option is foreclosed—so escalation stays imagistic rather than tactical; cost is tonal, not tactical, keeping score sub-8.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Desert-fortress-after-rain is sketched with economy: slick stone, wind-scarred walls, brine droplets weeping from stone—details that double as emotional barometer. Coral pavilion is micro-setting-as-object; its gradual fracture physically enacts the unloading of remorse, satisfying the 9+ gate (“environment constrains/charges final image”). Spatial choreography is implicit but clear—Lir moves from doorway to arch to palm-on-ice—no impossible positions. Sensory hierarchy reflects chef’s POV—taste metaphor dominates, grounding abstractions in palate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake is release of collective remorse; pressure escalates imagistically—cold intensifies, cracks widen, brine droplets increase—rather than through a reversible choice. Single micro-turn: palm-through-arch flips chill to warmth, remorse dissolves; this is the only beat where protagonist action visibly alters stakes. Cost is atmospheric (fortress left “brittle,” ready to whisper-fracture) rather than personal/irrevocable, so escalation feels gentle. Agency is present but ritualized; no live option is surrendered, capping high-band entry.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of collective guilt transmuted through sensory ritual emerges implicitly; no character moralizes. Image-set of tide, salt, citrus, and coral accretes meaning without overt statement. Final taste-shift reweights earlier bitterness into possible redemption—an earned conceptual reprise. No tidy moral, no final-paragraph thesis, but because escalation remains imagistic rather than ethical, resonance stays in high-mid band, not 9+.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited adheres tightly to Lir’s palate-centered perception; no head-hops. Syntax is lyric, rhythmic, mimic of tidal breathing—“each motion a recipe, each pause a tasting”—yet remains legible under Accumulative lens. Diction stays within chef’s sensory lexicon; no register drift. Free indirect bursts (“He knew…”) are cleanly italicized by syntax rather than marked italics, maintaining distance control.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong read-aloud cadence; sentence length varies, no template cadence runs. Metaphors are consistent (tide, kitchen spice, geological fracture) and mutually coherent, avoiding mixed-vehicle muddle. Occasional near-loop: “stone… stone… storm-worn shield” in adjacent sentences, a minor echo not at closure, so −0.2 only. Information density high—each sentence layers taste, touch, and emotional valence—prose rarely stalls.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Central conceit—chef tasting communal remorse crystallized in coral—is fresh synthesis of magic-realist gastronomy and geo-memory. Tidal-pool-as-memory-map offers non-obvious structural spine. Risk: abstractions could have collapsed into theme-poem, but specificity of spice notes and cracking coral keeps it narrative. No close echoes of famous scenes; transformation test passes—plot could not survive renaming or re-skinning. Falls short of 9 because concept remains more dazzling than character contradiction.</comment>
