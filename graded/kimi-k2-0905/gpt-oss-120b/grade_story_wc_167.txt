<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is lyrically specific—“concentric rings breathe, each ripple a sentence”—but the piece never forces her to test her creed against external resistance; the only pressure is her own rapture. The pocketed stone at the end registers as souvenir, not cost, because no live option is foreclosed. She observes value rather than risking anything for it, so the arc is mood, not change.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly as Charged Poise: the nets become “jeweled crowns,” reweighting the mundane under the Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality is interior-pattern rather than event, but the final image crystallizes meaning with visible cost—the harbor’s ledger is “balanced,” implying future reckonings. The piece teaches its lyric pattern early and sustains it, satisfying the mosaic exception.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prism atrium, tide breath, and mist-glow are tactile, selective, and return to charge the final image; the nets’ transformation is inseparable from the glass refraction. Spatial choreography is immaculate—stone, pond, pier, market stalls track without drift. Environment is not backdrop but optical instrument that refracts value itself, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade>
<comment>Stake—“illuminate value in the mundane”—is declared early and deepened through sensory intensification rather than external opposition. The single meaningful tightening is the nets’ transfiguration, a purely perceptual escalation; no option is narrowed, no price exacted from Mira. Sufficient for lyric mode, but lacks the trade-off or constraint required for 8+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: value is not intrinsic but refracted through attentive seeing. The final image of “jeweled crowns” reconfigures prior material without moralizing. Ambiguity is purposeful—harbor ledger “balances” hints at unspoken losses—yet the insight remains contemplative rather than urgent, keeping it just below the 8.5 tier.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Mira’s perceptual bias—“light fractured into colors that seemed to argue”—with consistent syntactic shimmer. No dialogue, so voice carries all texture; diction is controlled, slightly elevated, but anchored in glass-worker optics. Rhythm modulates with longer cadences at calm peaks; no head-hop or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet aerated—each sentence layers image and concept without scaffold. Occasional soft repeats (“quiet testimonies…quiet galaxy”) are within lyric tolerance and pattern-taught. No mixed metaphors or filter-verb stacks; final third is clean. A single paraphrase loop costs the 0.2 that keeps it under 8.2.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Harbor-glazier who reads value through rippled light is fresh; the prism-atrium as optical confession booth synthesizes science and mysticism without gimmick. Risk is moderate—lyric meditation instead of plot—but execution commits fully. Transformation test: swap glass-worker for baker and the arc collapses, confirming specificity.</comment>
