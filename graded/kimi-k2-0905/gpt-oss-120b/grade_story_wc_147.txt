<comment>Mara’s interiority never contradicts itself; every beat repeats the same tidy awe. The “epiphany” line bottle the fleeting breath of eternity is pure therapy-speak, no embodied cost. Because her panic dissolves off-page after sniffing perfume, the change feels administered, not earned. The promise to share the scent is declared, never dramatized, so no path is foreclosed with visible price.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade>
<comment>Closure is a declared Conceptual Repricing rather than an on-page image with cost; the vial merely “glowed faintly” and the world “inhaled” in summary. Causality loops: the temple first demands the beacon be let fade, then later returns the vial anyway—no persistent constraint. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, but the final cadence repeats prior perfume imagery without tightening. Orientation acceptable; who/where anchored by line 3.</comment>

<comment>Underwater temple is vividly filtered through diver priorities: kelp-draped pillars, bioluminescent fish spelling glyphs, amber hush outside stained glass. Selective sensory hierarchy—sound of own pulse, cool basalt, faint scent—keeps economy tight. Spatial choreography clean; no impossible moves. Environment never constrains a choice or charges the final image, so micro-setting gate not met, capping at 6.8.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—retrieve vial, deliver hope—signaled early. Pressure remains static: danger is the abstract “battery waning,” never tightened by an on-page countdown or depleted resource. The single meaningful turn (letting beacon fade) is cost-free because the temple immediately returns the vial; no option is foreclosed. Instance of coincidence resolving tension, not complicating it.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.2</grade>
<comment>Theme—perfume as bottled eternity—announced repeatedly in exposition rather than emerging from events. Subtext drowned by overt thesis lines: “harness the ephemeral,” “scent of eternity,” “bridge worlds.” Final paragraph moralizes the message, replacing image with sermon. No counter-readings or ambiguity offered; sentimentality untempered.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric close to Mara; POV stable, no head-hop. Perceptual signature limited: repeated “hush” and “scent” become mantra rather than idiosyncratic filter. Rhythm swells toward incantatory cadence that suits temple awe, but clauses grow syrupy under pressure. Diction occasionally overshoots POV lexicon—“lonesome splendor,” “conceptual repricing” tone—but deviation is consistent and intentional.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.0</grade>
<comment>High metaphor density sustained across mid-pressure beats; purple tinge (“tide of gathered hush…cradled her like a mother’s breath”) but pattern taught early. Several paraphrase loops—“hush” echoed four times in two sentences; “scent of eternity” restated as “perfume of hope.” No mixed metaphors or grammar slips; rhythm breathes with scene. Closure image clean, so −0.4 for accumulation only.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Premise—“perfume that captures unseen sunrise”—is fresh, non-obvious synthesis of alchemy and abyssal exploration. Tropes (lost temple, bioluminescent augury) remain stock, not transformed. Risk taken with lyric accumulation over causal drive, but payoff stays conceptual rather than tactical. Specificity of diver lore (HUD, beacon, basalt column) lends authenticity yet could swap settings with minor edits.</comment>
