<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Alchemist’s interiority is poetic but generic; “directed spontaneity” is asserted, not embodied. No contradictory impulse is staged; choices are group rituals, not individual micro-decisions under pressure. Friends function as a chorus; no status shifts or interpersonal cost register. Closure is a sentimental vow rather than an earned renunciation or visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: repeated brush dips and shell glow build density. Closure is a Charged Poise—dome of amber light reweights prior material. Cost is conceptual (they must guard the glow) but not felt on the page; no concrete forfeiture shown. Orientation clear by line 3; lens taught early and intact.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>“Ember nexus at twilight” is vividly atmospheric; heat-as-memory rule is learned through action. Shell-as-micro-setting constrains the final image: its spiral literally holds the new light. Sensory selectivity is poetically skewed but drifts toward symbol rather than choice-constraint. Meets 9+ gate by charging final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“capture the density of presence”—stays abstract; no concrete risk or omission tested. Pressure is lyrical accumulation, not narrowing options. Tightening occurs when breath is added, but cost remains metaphorical. Agency is collective ritual; no individual trade-off forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges via iterative glow imagery: light from ash, presence from ephemera. Final whispered line reweights premise without moralizing. Subtext stays poetic but safe; no genuine moral ambiguity or loss complicates the uplift. Resonant but lacks bite.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Lyric third-person maintains coherent omniscient distance; diction stays within alchemist’s register. Rhythm modulates with scene intensity—short pulses during glow transfer. No dialogue to test voice distinction, but narrative voice is consistent. Filter verbs (“he felt”) are minimal and justified.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Prose is lush but loops: “revalue,” “returning differently,” “density of presence” repeated without new inflection. Mixed metaphors—“spiraled into a dome of soft amber”—blur spatial logic. Template cadence in brush-dip beats dulls momentum. No artifacts touch closure; image remains legible.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Pocket-sun alchemy + nautilus conduit is fresh, yet “heat is memory” trope is familiar. Conceptual combo feels inevitable in hindsight but risks preciousness. Stakes stay cozy—no inversion or darker implication. Risk is aesthetic, not ethical; transformation is interior glow, not world logic shift.</comment>
