<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elya’s interiority is vivid—hands “tingling,” heartbeat syncing with glass—but her choices are mostly discovery-driven rather than dilemma-driven; the ledger’s pull is external until the kiln insertion, so the final stance feels slightly gift-wrapped rather than wrenched. Still, embodied emotion and glass-specific perception keep her from archetype.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: frost pattern → ledger → shards → kiln, each layer reweighting survival into creation; the “scorched testament” recurs as both scar and map, landing in a Charged Poise where the canyon sings back. Cost is visible—the ledger strip sacrificed to the kiln—so closure meets RR criteria. Transitions are legible (fire site → canyon → mine → rim) and orientation is anchored by ~80 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Basalt floor, soot-snow charcoal, kiln glow—each tactile detail narrows Elya’s options; frost veins literally guide footfall and later refract in the final glass. Canyon walls double as echo chamber and mirror, charging the singing glass finale; no extra geographic fat. Micro-setting (ledger strip, kiln mouth) is handled repeatedly, constraining every micro-choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—rebirth of art from ashes—tightens once: frost path reveals hidden mine; that single deepening is enough for 600-word scale. No antagonist, but the fragility of glass versus fire supplies coherent pressure. Cost (ledger strip buried, fire risk re-assumed) is legible; escalation is steady, not steep.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from iterated scorch-and-ice imagery: creation born of damage, purpose found in pauses. No moralizing; final “glass sang its story to the universe” reweights prior frost/ledger pattern without abstract assertion. Ambiguity lingers—smuggler’s morality unresolved—inviting reflection rather than dictating meaning.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Elya’s glass-artist eye: “glassy hush,” “luminous shards humming,” syntax molten when fire rises, brittle when frost cracks. No head-hops; perceptual signature remains consistent. Patterned repetition (“drifting resonance… steadily adaptive”) is taught early and resolves in final cadence, justifying lyric echo.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with scene temperature—short clauses during fire escape, elongated sentences under star chill. Occasional poetic stack (“glassy hush that seemed to breathe with the wind”) risks purple but stays character-true. Only minor scaffold: “she realized that…” repeats twice; not enough to dull closure. No mixed metaphors or filter-verb clutter.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Frost contrails as smuggler cipher feels fresh; glass artist reading ice like sheet music is specific synthesis. Canyon-as-kiln echo turns landscape into instrument. Risk is lyric accumulative structure itself—could have read as collage—but pattern is taught early and pays off, so gamble succeeds.</comment>
