<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lira’s interiority is textured—her boots “stirring fallen leaves” shows embodied vigilance—and the deciduous-vow metaphor lets her contradictory impulses (cling to guild pride vs. embrace orchard wisdom) act in the same breath. The micro-choice to kneel and use the bag contents is character-specific, but the “feisty spark” is asserted rather than demonstrated through risk or impatience; we never see her snap or gamble. Mira functions only as witness, so the relationship crucible is absent; the cost is present but diffuse (lost guild claim) rather than personally sharpened in-scene. Still, the final stance crystallizes under a visible price—she vows seasonal return—meeting the 9+ quick test for Earned Stasis.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the repaired lenses and tightened ribbon reconfigure both vision and legacy with undeniable felt cost (she must keep returning). Causality holds on Accumulative/Textural lens—each stroke of ink/amber adds density until the final chime. Orientation is anchored by line 3 (who, where, when). No.teleporting props; the ribbon snag seeds the bag-contents payoff. One minor softness: the breach itself is off-stage, but the narrative treats it as lived pressure, not outline hole.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The orchard–cathedral mash-up is specific, sensuous, and choice-bearing: cracked stained-glass gold dictates where Lira lays the lenses, turning light into tool. Micro-setting (ribbon, pine bench) constrains the mending choreography. Vocabulary stays vegetal and ecclesiastical—“vaulted grove,” “chorus of deciduous vows”—without catalog excess. Spatial clarity tracks cleanly from rafters to bench to exit hymn.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restore sight & generational bridge) is signaled early; pressure tightens when the ribbon snag forces improvised use of bag contents, linking mending glass to healing kin. Escalation is accumulative—each lens shard re-weights the stake—rather than causal-reversal, fitting the lyric mode. Visible price: she commits to seasonal return, foreclosing guild nostalgia. Luck assists (light through glass) but does not resolve; agency remains in her strokes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: persistence as natural cycle, not moral. The deciduous vow image re-weights at closure, answering the generational-wisdom question without sermon. Subtext sits in gesture—tightening the ribbon equals tightening covenant. One soft echo: “accidental wisdom” is named in last line, a mild thematic echo (−0.2) but still fused to image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays anchored to Lira’s perceptual filter—“world sharpen, colors deepening like ripe apples”—with syntax that lengthens under calm and shortens during the final click. No head-hop; Mira’s interior is inferred only through audible gasp, permissible. Diction stays arboreal and artisanal, avoiding corporate drift. Dialogue is minimal but natural child question, carrying subtext about patience.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with scene tempo: long cadences for leaf-whisper exposition, tighter fragments during needle-work. High info density—each sentence layers task, sensory filter, and metaphor without synonym loops. No mixed metaphors; cracked glass / cracked cathedral light stays coherent. Closing chime is sonic single-word payoff, not cliché.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Cathedral-orched orchard is fresh mash-up; deciduous vows as renewable covenant re-angles standard repair trope. Transformation test passes: if relocated to ordinary garden, generational bridge loses sacrament height. Risk taken with lyric repetition of vows, but pattern taught early and paid off in final whisper. Slight familiarity in “mother teaches child while mending” frame holds score sub-8.5.</comment>
