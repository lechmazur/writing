<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lila’s interiority—“the comforting unease that settled like a soft blanket”—is simultaneously embodied and contradictory, showing her practiced fatalism under pressure. Her micro-choice to hurl the lanterns into darkness crystallizes a hierarchy of values: ancestral loyalty over personal safety. The antique fob’s tactile coldness externalizes time’s distortion and anchors her obstinate refusal to let history dictate her move. Cost is legible: the truce survives only until sunrise, leaving her path foreclosed by perpetual vigilance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: because Lila decodes Marrow’s false-start habit, she can plant the decoy vial, therefore collapsing the rival raid and preserving the tunnel lights. Closure is a Charged Poise—watch fob ticking atop the elders’ table while dawn extinguishes every lantern—reconfiguring stakes: perpetual distrust now the only “peace.” Persistent constraint (sunset deadline) shapes every tactic; the final image makes the cost undeniable.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Rotting-pier market is evoked through salt-ferment air, driftwood stalls, and the “rumors that tasted like iron,” selective sensory triage under stealth pressure. The lanterns-as-setting constrain the climax: their sudden absence disables the rival crew and reweights the truce. Micro-object—the brass fob—functions as portable setting, charging the final negotiating table image. Spatial choreography stays clean: scout lunges, Lila sidesteps, rope coil is tracked tether-to-throw.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—keep the tunnels lit without breaking the no-gunfire truce—tightens when the scout cracks the lock; Lila’s lantern-toss is a decisive narrowing of options that trades visibility for survival. Agency drives escalation: her false-start rehearsal enables the vapor decoy and the blackout gambit. Sunrise supplies visible price; the truce expires with the dawn she ushers in, perpetual conflict foreclosed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme of inherited distrust emerges from brass timepiece and inherited lullaby of “trust breaking,” culminating in the final whisper that accepts unease as safety. No moralizing; the reprise of salt-ferment air reframes comforting unease as the only sustainable peace. Lantern extinction image reweights the premise: light equals target, darkness equals fragile safety. Ambiguity lingers—will Lila replay this night forever?—earned through particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays latched to Lila’s sensorium: “rumors that tasted like iron” carries her bootlegger palate. Syntax tightens under pressure—“She seized a rope coil, pulling it tight… with a swift tug hurled them into the gloom”—mimicking pulse. No head-hopping; elders’ cloudy eyes filtered through her perception. Register remains coastal-criminal, never drifts into literary self-consciousness.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>High information density: one sentence can anchor smell, heritage, and stakes—“antique watch fob… warm from forgotten voyages.” Metaphors are clean and motivated: “comforting unease like a soft blanket” embodies her paradoxical calm. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances prop, choice, or atmosphere. No figurative muddle in the blackout beat where clarity is life-or-death.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: moonshine-heritage stealth raid to preserve a “truce of hush” reframes pirate convention into Prohibition-era noir. Inherited timepiece as ticking metronote for perpetual distrust feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking compression—800-word single-night arc—heightens stakes without explanatory padding. Specificity: “rust-iron taste of rumors” and “lanterns hurled into gloom” could not transplant to another genre unchanged.</comment>
