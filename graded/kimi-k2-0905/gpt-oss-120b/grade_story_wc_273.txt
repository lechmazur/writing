<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Kael’s “serene anger” is stated repeatedly but never embodied in a micro-choice that costs him; the interiority stays at label level (“his voice trembled with a calm fury”). The only visible decision—declaring the world will listen—arrives without prior causality or new risk, so the renunciation feels un-earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: ink patterns thicken until they reweight perception. Closure is a Charged Poise—the spiral’s fade makes the universe’s pause undeniable—so the unit lands. Yet the price (Kael’s outline dissolving) is asserted, not felt, because the story never anchors how concrete loss alters his next breath; causality stays lyrical rather than paid-for.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Desert wind, stone alcoves, chrome drone, bleached-bone skin—details are selective and POV-filtered. The ink’s vanishing scent in the final line recharges the visual motif, meeting the 9+ gate for setting-as-final-image; still, spatial choreography is vague (where exactly is the spiral released?), keeping it below 8.8.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—“why time slows in crisis”—is signaled early; pressure deepens as the ink patterns literalize the pause. Escalation is purely imagistic, not tactical: no option narrows, no resource is lost. The cost is conceptual (collective breath) rather than personal, so the tightening stays atmospheric, not visceral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the recurring vanish/appear ink trope: memory and history are erasable unless witnessed. The ending’s scent-whisper offers a non-literal answer—perception itself is the brake on erasure—without moralizing. Ambiguity is purposeful, but the abstraction keeps resonance cerebral, not gut-level.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays tight to Kael’s alien perception: “eyes…burned with a serene anger,” “chrome feathers flickering like liquid mercury.” Rhythm accelerates into fragments under peak pressure (“He turned…thanked…promised”). No head-hopping; drone’s mechanical hum contrasts his biological stillness. Filter verbs rare; diction stays within plausible tracker lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Sentence variety is strong; opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes. Figurative density is high but patterned (ink = memory), so tolerable. One scaffold loop: “patterns…patterns” across two adjacent clauses. No mixed metaphors; clarity intact at closure. Temporal sequence clean; no simultaneity errors.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The disappearing-ink-as-time-map concept feels fresh; it literalizes the nomads’ mystery without explanatory dump. Albino tracker + drone pairing avoids default desert tropes. Final spiral reprise grows inevitable from earlier seed. Risk-taking is structural (lyric accumulation vs. causal plot) and pays off in legible CR; not gimmick.</comment>
