<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Aria’s “chaotically precise” interiority is vivid—her whispered equations vibrate the air—but the promised internal contradiction never detonates; she powers through every beat without visible mis-wiring. The archeologist motive is asserted, not dramatized; the only micro-choice is to keep pressing on, so the arc is linear rather than helical. The mirror-palm pulse supplies embodied emotion, yet the cost (stone could fracture) is floated, never levied on her. Earned Stasis is gestured at but not paid, so the closure lands as hopeful posture, not irreversible foreclosing.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The lens is Accumulative/Textural: cadence-shift and image-density reweight the stake rather than causal chains. Orientation is swift—“moonlit canyon” by line 2—so no penalty. Closure is a Charged Poise: the fading tableau reconfigures meaning with felt cost (dreams will vanish again). The “synaptic plasticity” rule is lyric metaphor, not taught mechanics, so the bridge holds only poetically, not causally—acceptable under this lens but limits upper band.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The canyon is rendered through Aria’s tool-use and body—basalt column as lab bench, fissures as synapses—so micro-setting qualifies and charges the final image. Sensory hierarchy obeys POV: engineer-noticed “liquid quartz” moonlight, circuitry wind. Spatial choreography is clean: portable lab, mirror alignment, palm-press, exit silhouette. Environment constrains the tactic: stone hum answers only when the shard-neurons map onto it. Weather is lunar spill that literally powers the reflection, so setting is agent, not backdrop.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“catalog abandoned dreams”—is signaled early; pressure tightens when revival, not mere recording, becomes implied. Escalation is accretive: each mirrored shard rewires stone, tableau brightens, risk of fracture mentioned. Cost is conceptual (dreams fade again at dawn) rather than personal loss, keeping pressure legible but not visceral. Agency remains internal—she could walk away—so tension is moderate; one meaningful deepening suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: memory as living geology, resurrection versus preservation. Subtext resides in mirror-shard = neuron metaphor that fuses human and mineral archives. Final fade-out offers resonant reweighting: archives are ephemeral, archeology is ongoing communion, not capture. Avoids moralizing; the canyon’s hum answers without verdict, leaving plausible counter-reading that Aria’s quest is quixotic.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person tight stays locked to Aria’s perceptual signature—helical syntax, engineer lexicon. No head-hopping. Rhythm swells with emotional intensity: short pulses mirror neural firing; longer lyrical sentences carry reverie. Register consistent—no academic drift. No dialogue to judge. Final silhouette image crystallizes voice: “ready to catalog the next abandoned dream” reads as cadence-earned, not tagline.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Strong information density: one sentence often layers sensory, metaphorical, and plot work. Occasional lyrical overlap—“quaking reverie” appears twice within four lines—triggers minor paraphrase loop (−0.2). Metaphors stay internally coherent (stone synapses, liquid quartz moonlight). No filter-verb stacks. Opening and closing lines are crisp, propulsive. Overall rhythm breathes with escalation, but the loop keeps it from flawless polish.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fusion of neurology + geology via broken naval optic is fresh synthesis; abandoned dreams as mineralized data is non-obvious. Risk—treating rock as rewireable tissue—pays off conceptually without violating internal logic. Specificity: “portable lab beside crumbling basalt column” anchors premise in tactile detail, preventing abstraction. The trope of mirror-as-memory is familiar, but here it is literalized through synaptic-stone interface, transforming cliché into mechanism.</comment>
