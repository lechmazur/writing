<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lira’s face-blindness is never exploited as gimmick; instead it quietly underwrites every pigment choice and the final renunciation of sighted verification. The micro-choices—counting drying intervals by coin-notches, pressing the eroded星座 into wet lapis—show a hierarchy of values where tactile precision outranks visual proof. Interiority stays concrete (“fractally precise hand that seemed to echo the coin’s tiny grooves”) and avoids diagnostic language. Closure cost is felt: she smiles while the sky she cannot see collapses into dust, proving the stance was earned, not asserted.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: each layer of pigment and each coin-guided notch thickens density until the ceiling becomes a living sky. The demolition deadline supplies a single coherent pressure that narrows to the final indent; no off-stage rescue. Closure is a Charged Poise: the mural shimmers exactly as stone falls, reconfiguring value—art survives as perceptual event, not physical object. Cost is legible in the last breath before dust, making the because/therefore linkage (“she chose to finish rather than flee”) undeniable.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The hollowed tree trunk is not backdrop but tool: its bark walls absorb and echo pigment, enabling the sky-capture illusion. Spatial choreography is immaculate—easel, floorboard safe, alcove coin, ceiling—each distance tracked without drift. Environment directly constrains tactic: the curved interior dictates the spiral of blues, while the condemned building across the lot provides the ticking clock. Final image recharges setting: the trunk becomes “a cathedral of sky,” reweighting the prior description with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—mirror the sky before demolition—signaled in paragraph two and tightened by each coin-notched interval. One meaningful deepening: the recognition that limits are thresholds, not walls, crystallized when she presses the coin into wet pigment, narrowing options to final stroke or surrender. Cost is visible: the mural’s shimmer exists only while the building falls, a fleeting foreclosing of escape. Agency remains interior yet decisive; no coincidence resolves the conflict.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: limits as generative edge, art as perceptual transference rather than object. The sky-on-bark image reconfigures the premise without moralizing. Subtext operates in silence—the held breath before collapse—and in gesture (coin pressed into pigment). Final image offers resonant non-literal answer: the sky is felt, not seen, and survives inside the viewer, not the wall.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays locked to Lira’s tactile POV; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is distinct—“fractally precise,” “rhythm of light she could not see”—creating a syntactic shimmer that mimics pigment layers. Rhythm accelerates with drying intervals, then calms into the final held breath. No filter-verb clutter; each sentence propels image or choice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Line-level craft is disciplined: no scaffold loops, no mixed metaphors. Figurative language is sparse but exact—“sunrise trapped in timber”—and never obscures causality. Information density high: one sentence often fuses pigment recipe, emotional stakes, and time pressure. Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; paragraph cuts are clean, each advancing knowledge or image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes face-blind artist + doomed tree library + coin-guided cosmos in a way that feels inevitable, not gimmicky. Fresh inflection: using constellation indentations as both lock-pick and brush-guide fuses craft and cosmos. Risk—lyric stillness inside demolition countdown—pays off in Charged Poise. Specificity of pigment slurry and bark curvature prevents swap-out; story collapses if any element genericized.</comment>
