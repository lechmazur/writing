<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The nameless narrator’s contradictory impulse—clinging to erased identity while becoming an archive for others—remains interior and textural; no second character appears, so status/relationship bullets are N/A. Micro-choices (pocketing the label, stepping back from the glowing murals) are present and tied to the lens, but the “felt cost” is more conceptual than embodied. The arc is a credible renunciation of official identity, yet the emotional price is stated (“finally felt a purpose”) rather than shown through bodily cost. Meets the 9+ quick test structurally, but the absence of corporeal stakes caps it just below the top band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the label’s glow projects erased histories and reweights the port into a “museum of vanished moments,” cost felt in the “cold filament” against steel. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of layered fragments, sepia filter, tide-metronome—held without contradiction. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) is taught by word 30 (“towering labyrinth of shipping containers… sea’s tide”), so no penalty. One tightens at the high-tide projection that forecloses the option of forgetting; persistent constraint is the narrator’s voided identity that enables the archival role. Meets 9+ quick test; only a hairline lack of causal ripple keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setting is the containerscape itself: steel corridors that “sway with each tide,” constraining movement and rewriting the map. The poison-label micro-object becomes the perceptual filter that literally re-colors the world sepia, charging the final ghost-mural image. Sensory hierarchy obeys POV: salt-stink, radio crackle, cold filament on fingertips—never tourist catalog. Spatial choreography is clean; the exit path is legible after the tide recedes. Meets 9+ quick test, but the environment does not physically block a final exit, so tops at 8.7.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recover erased histories—signaled in line 1. Escalation is textural: each overheard fragment adds density until the label’s numbers glow and project the murals, narrowing the narrator’s option to remain merely a passive observer. Cost is conceptual (permanent exile from official identity) rather than tangible; still legible under Accumulative lens. One meaningful tightening suffices at this length; no reversal, but the projection is the decisive intensification.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges via the accumulation of ghost-stories: erasure is systemic, but memory can be smuggled back through layered whispers. No explicit thesis; the final image of the narrator as “living archive” reweights the opening death-certificate void. Subtext resides in the label’s sepia filter—history is a tint you can choose to see. Ambiguity lingers: will the port truly remember, or is the archive only skin-deep? Complex, unsentimental, and earned.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>First-person lyric voice is distinct: “rusted bones,” “cold filament,” “palimpsest of voices”—perceptual signature is consistent and tide-modulated. No dialogue, so dialogue bullets N/A. Pattern of layered fragments is taught early and paid off in the final projection; elision (“my name is unimportant”) is purposeful, not obstructive. Rhythm breathes with tide beats; no head-hopping or register drift. A whisper below 9.0 only because the voice edges toward poetic uniformity at times.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High information density: single sentences layer time, scent, and metaphor (“sepia hue… museum of vanished moments”). No paraphrase loops or scaffold; metaphors stay coherent (“rusted bones” = containers). One mixed vehicle: “layers filter reality” is abstract, but immediately grounded by visual filter of label. Filter-verb clusters absent. Closure sentence—“texture of memory I could touch and share”—is crisp, propulsive, and artifact-free.</question>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Premise flips the usual ghost-story: the living man is the ghost, the port is the haunted house. Poison-label-as-projector is a fresh optic device; erased histories made literal through tide-timed light show. Risky accumulative structure taught early and paid off. Specificity: timestamps on label match overheard snippets—an indexing system that feels inevitable in hindsight. Transformation test passes: swap label for generic map and the climax collapses.</comment>
