<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction is vivid—“already simply complicated” mind wrestling with backward-growing vines—but the curator’s final acceptance is more declared than earned by dramatized micro-choices; the bathroom epiphanies repeat the same beat rather than deepening risk. Embodied emotion (luminous pollen on skin) is specific, yet the emotional cost is conceptual rather than felt, so the renunciation reads as graceful but lightly paid.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure is a crisp Conceptual Repricing: pressing the shell projects the constellation map, making the inherited loop visible and charging the asteroid ground. Causality is lyric-accumulative rather than tight because/therefore; the orchard’s answers dissolve-then-reassemble, teaching the pattern early and paying off in the final image, so the lens holds with poetic coherence. The cost is conceptual but legible—he relinquishes linear life-narrative—and the mosaic tile pulse crystallizes the reconfiguration on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Astral orchard is sketched in shimmering whispers and luminous pollen rather than catalogued, giving micro-setting economy. The asteroid’s low-gravity feel is tactile when trees bend and pollen settles on skin; the bathroom tiles reconfigure as cracked-shell mosaic, turning setting into an active oracle that constrains revelation. Environment directly shapes the breakthrough beat—only in that echoing stall does the mosaic pulse—so the gate for 9+ is met.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</question>
<comment>Dominant stake—“surrender linear narrative for inherited loops”—is signaled early and tightens once when the shell’s void floods him with futures already happened, a clear deepening. Pressure is lyric-accumulative: each dissolved question adds starlight density until the mosaic moment forces the trade-off; cost is conceptual (brightened disquiet) rather than visceral, so the tightening is meaningful but not sharply priced.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as the surrender of linearity for networked time; the constellation map is the non-literal answer that reweights earlier pollen and shell motifs without moralizing. Subtext resides in mirror-whisper and pollen settling—inheritance as luminous debris—keeping the insight embedded in image. The refrain “simply complicated” risks thematic echo, but it is folded into voice rather than final assertion, so the penalty is minor.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric voice sustains a star-lit, orchard-hum texture; diction stays within a curator’s wonder without academic drift. Syntax ripples with repetitive pollen / starlight motifs that teach the accumulative pattern; no head-hopping. Dialogue is absent, so voice distinctness is judged by perceptual signature—he maps paradoxes in bathroom tiles—which remains consistent and specific.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sentences breathe and contract with revelation pace; metaphor density peaks only at the mosaic pulse where it is earned. No paraphrase loops, but “luminous” and “starlight” recur enough to approach template cadence; the repetition serves the accumulative design so the artifact is light. Opening line anchors voice and stakes cleanly; final line resolves by image-action (“he turned, ready to write”) that recharges the orchard hum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses pistachio-shell micro-cameo with cosmic nonlinear inheritance—fresh, non-obvious synthesis. Risky lyric-accumulative structure is taught early and paid off in the constellation projection, so bold form heightens meaning without obscuring clarity. Transformation test: story collapses if shell is swapped for any generic relic because its emptied-seed void is the conceptual key. Specific detail (pollen as inherited thought-nodes) keeps the frame from feeling gimmick.</comment>
