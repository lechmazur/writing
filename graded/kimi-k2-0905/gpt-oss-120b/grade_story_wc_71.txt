<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade>
<comment>The narrator’s “creeping normality noticer” vocation is asserted rather than dramatized; no contradictory impulse or micro-choice under pressure shows him failing or refining his noticing. The only visible decision—placing the shard on the bench—lacks stakes or cost, so the closing “sanctification” feels gifted, not earned. Interiority drifts into lyric generalities (“world smooth itself into habit”) that could belong to any reflective wanderer. Still, the perceptual filter is consistent, and the elderly woman momentarily tests his gaze, keeping the score above the mid-line.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the town’s pulse syncs to the hush, reweighting the premise that silence can colonize a place. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern thickens rather than causal chain—and the final image of “slow, warm ember” makes the cost atmospheric rather than personal. Orientation is clear by line 50; no penalty. The shard’s teleport from shop to bench without on-page transition is a minor logistical flicker but does not rupture the lyric design.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The bay, cottages, and pier are filtered through a synesthetic palette (“amber halos,” “salted lullaby”) that teaches the reader to read atmosphere as character. The orris shard functions as micro-setting: its milky speckles become a “tiny moon” that later irradiates the whole town, so environment literally constrains perception. Spatial choreography is clean—bench, cup, flower, windows—each object stays tagged and gains echo. No world-rule inconsistency; sensory hierarchy favors the narrator’s scent-oriented bias, fitting the perfumer lens.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“can silence sanctify without trap?”—is signaled early but never seriously endangered; the hush spreads unopposed. Escalation is a thickening of texture rather than a narrowing of options; no credible loss or reversal tests the narrator’s commitment. The elderly woman’s memory acts as confirmation, not complication. Cost is atmospheric (collective sigh) rather than personal, keeping pressure moderate.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: silence as colonizing force that turns observation into communion. Subtext lives in objects—cup, flower—made vessels by displacement, implying sanctification is accidental, not willed. Final image of streetlights “thanking” the houses reconfigures the gaze without moralizing. The concept avoids explicit thesis statements; only the shopkeeper’s “shard of hush” borders on echo but is brief enough to tolerate.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Voice owns a perfumed, tidal rhythm—long sentences swell and recede, mirroring bay water. Diction stays within a poetic but plausible register (“brine and promise,” “ember that could not be named”). No head-hopping; perceptual signature is consistent—every noticed detail is filtered through scent and sound. Dialogue is minimal and paratactic, preserving the hush; the elderly woman’s whisper feels like a tide-line, not an exposition drop.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is lush yet information-dense; most lines layer image and theme. Occasional perfume—“daydream” as verb, “lazy thoughts across the quiet bay”—approaches purple but stays pattern-consistent. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; sentence openings vary. One mixed metaphor (“tide that never ceases” alongside “dust on shoulders”) is minor enough to keep below artifact threshold. Final line cadence earns its quiet resonance.</comment>

<grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>The “creeping normality noticer” frame plus silence-as-physical-substance merges two fresh angles on quiet observation stories. Risk is taken in letting atmosphere overpower plot; the wager pays off because the final image reweights all prior detail. Specificity of orris root (iris-flavored, antique perfumer’s cache) anchors the concept in lived craft rather than generic magic. Could tip into cliché of “town breathes with protagonist,” but the scent-oriented micro-mechanics keep it particular.</comment>
