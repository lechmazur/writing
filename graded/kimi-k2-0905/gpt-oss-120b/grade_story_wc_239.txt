<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The witness’s interior contradiction—seeking truth while erasing self—is dramatized through the literal retreat of her shadow; the dictionary, handled in three beats, externalizes memory and decays with her. Micro-choice under pressure (placing the book on the crystal) costs her corporeal presence, an earned vanishing. Yet the “end-of-history” vocation is asserted more than lived; we get no biographical flaw or misbelief that complicates the ritual, so the arc edges toward archetype rather than individual. Still, the embodiment of extinction as bodily fade-out gives the reader a visible price, satisfying the 9+ quick test at this length.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each spiraling clause adds density until the final image reweights the premise—history ends not with bang but hush. Orientation is taught by deliberately drifting anchors (“lost in time” named early), waiving penalty. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the seamless horizon revalues time itself, cost felt in her erasure. The only bar to 9.0 is a hairline lack of persistent constraint shaping earlier tactics; the spiral rule is declared, not tested against her until the end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The temple library is not backdrop but interface: stone aisles breathe, tablets in non-languages press against her fingers, floor dissolves into star-map—each detail alters her gait and final step. Micro-setting (the dictionary’s humming pages) functions as tool and portal, charging the closure vortex. Spatial choreography remains exact as she walks outward while inward, distance measured in heartbeats. No slips; environment directly constrains the ritual and the final disappearance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—unravel cosmic illusions—is signaled in paragraph one and tightens when the spiral glyphs demand she surrender physical coherence. The single meaningful deepening occurs at the crystal: continue and vanish, or stop and keep false constellations; she chooses, paying with body. Pressure is accumulative—each translated tablet adds weight until the map folds. Cost is legible, but escalation is atmospheric rather than tactical; hence shy of 8.8.</question>

<comment>Theme emerges from motif of silence that accrues meaning: initial “resounding hush” is aesthetic, final hush is ontological—silence as the medium of truth. No moral spoken; the reconfigured cosmos is shown by image of converged horizon. Dictionary’s reprise as “quiet beacon” reweights earlier signal into emblem of sustained balance. Avoids tidy profundity, but epiphany is slightly single-note; complexity is conceptual rather than emotional, capping score below 9.0.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</question><comment>Third-person lyric maintains perceptual signature: breath-arches, star-notes, parchment-folded time—diction stays within a mystic scholar’s lexicon. Rhythmic anaphora (“a resounding hush… the resounding hush…”) teaches pattern that pays off in final cadence. No dialogue, so no convergence risk. Filter verbs (“she felt”) are minimal and voice-motivated; immediacy preserved. Distinct syntactic torque carries throughout without monotony, meeting 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</question>
<comment>High information density: one sentence can layer sensory, symbolic, and causal work (“pages unfolded into a vortex of light that swallowed the surrounding void”). Figurative runs are patterned early, hence exempt from density penalty. No mixed metaphors; spiral vehicles stay coherent. Micro-loop: “resounding hush” echo is intentional motif, not scaffold. One paraphrase pair (“journeying inward while walking out became literal…”) but does not recur at climax, keeping slip below −0.2.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</question>
<comment>Synthesis of esoteric cosmology with embodied ritual feels fresh; “spiral arbitration” is not standard trope and is literalized as walking/reading spiral. Risk—erasure of protagonist—heightens stakes without gimmick, paid off in crystalline vanishing. Detail particular: dictionary margins glowing into star-map is memorable image not swappable with generic book. Concept commits fully; no retreat to metaphor. Earned +0.3 risk bonus within band.</comment>
