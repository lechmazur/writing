<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lia’s “bright attentiveness” is shown through concrete metadata tracing and the deliberate lie she fabricates, not merely asserted. Her internal contradiction—curiosity versus complicity in viral deception—surfaces in the decision to repost the meme, a micro-choice that visibly costs her innocence. The final vow to “guard the hidden corridors” crystallizes an earned stance with moral freight. Interiority stays specific to a data-archivist’s sensorium (amber server glow, flickering checksums), avoiding stock emotion labels.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: Lia’s second, deliberate lie transforms the archive from static repository into living beacon, a Conceptual Repricing that makes the crew’s “silence you felt as absence” newly legible as presence. Causal linkage holds—each 17-42-108 spike is traceable to her bait post that re-animates deleted bits. Orientation is anchored by word 80 (“vaulted archives of the global social network”) and never loosens. Only nit: the checksum revelation is narrated rather than decoded in-scene, a micro-loss of immediacy at the climax.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The emoji wall and rusted rack function as micro-settings that physically constrain Lia’s movement and tool access, satisfying the 9+ gate. Sensory hierarchy is data-archivist specific—glow of amber status LEDs, static-thick air, low thrum of legacy drives—rather than tourist catalog. Spatial choreography is clean: concealed farm behind obsolete emoji wall → rusted rack → dusty terminal → vault door. Weather/environment is irrelevant here, correctly omitted rather than forced.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</question><comment>Dominant stake—can erased voices be reclaimed?—is signaled in paragraph 1 and tightens when Lia risks institutional violation by seeding the meme. The meaning tightening occurs at the checksum realization: the numbers are not ghosts but a key that forecloses the option to dismiss the case. Cost is visible—her complicity in spreading a lie inside the very system she curates. Under causal lens, one meaningful escalation is sufficient; the story delivers it.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the inversion of absence into presence via archived metadata; no character sermonizes the moral. The final image—“the archive pulsed with the living echoes”—reweights all prior “forgotten songs” without abstract statement. Subtext is carried in gesture: the act of reposting a fabricated tribute is simultaneously betrayal and resurrection. The reader is left to contemplate who else might be stored in the silence we scroll past daily.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Voice is crisp, data-cultist, tinged with reverence for lost packets: “amber light,” “phantom breadcrumb,” “digital afterlife.” Syntax tightens under pressure—short declaratives when files vanish on copy attempt. No dialogue, so no head-hop risk; single POV stays modest (she infers, hypothesizes, never knows too much). Register never drifts into corporate boilerplate; “checksum” and “metadata” are precise, necessary, and filtered through Lia’s expert perception.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies: long lyric sentence for choir-of-data opener, then staccato discoveries (“17, 42, 108—spiking”). Information density is high; every sentence advances archive lore or Lia’s tactic. No synonym loops or template cadence; metaphors stay consistent (sound/echo motif). One mixed metaphor—“glow… whispered echoing verses”—is minor, does not obscure causality. Closure image is clean, uncluttered.</comment>

<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fusion of cold-case procedural with digital afterlife feels inevitable yet fresh; no trope checklist. The 17-42-108 pattern is not a gimmick—it is the crew’s自救 protocol, transformed from easter-egg to lifeline. Risky second dissemination of the same lie deepens moral complexity rather than repeating beats. Specificity of “obsolete emoji wall” and “rusted rack” anchors the concept in tactile detail impossible to swap without collapse.</comment>
