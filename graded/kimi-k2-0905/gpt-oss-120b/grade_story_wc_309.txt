<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Selric’s soft-glow failure and quiet-brilliance goal are consistent; the interiority is concrete (“his own doubts”) and embodied (“robes frayed like old drafts”). The final acceptance feels earned because the keystone trial directly reweights his self-perception. Still, the only micro-choice that costs him on-page is the symbolic unstrap; no secondary flaw complicates the ascent, so the arc is more luminous epiphany than crucible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the keystone pulse scatters “fireflies that refused to be measured,” re-pricing the rule-set of mechanized creativity with visible conceptual cost. Causal linkage is lyric-accumulative rather than tight because/therefore, but the pattern is taught early (“lingering luminance”) and paid off in the final image. Orientation is anchored by ~70 words; no teleporting props or knowledge leaps occur. The mist-walk mechanics are soft-magic, yet they are seeded by the hermit and never solve a problem they didn’t help create.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The icebound spire, luminous fog, and garden-folly keystone are selective, sensory, and integrated into footfall chimes and frost crackle; the setting constrains the only viable path upward and literally supports the final step. Spatial choreography stays coherent; no impossible geography. The “brilliant dimness” motif evolves from visual echo to conceptual re-pricing, meeting the 9+ gate for environment-as-constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prove the worth of quiet brilliance—is signaled in paragraph 1; pressure tightens when the mist thickens and each step “releases a quiet sigh,” forcing a public-private test of legitimacy. Escalation is textural-density rather than causal reversal, but the cadence shift from cold monument to breathing spire visibly reweights options. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral: the keystone scatters unmeasurable light, forfeiting council acclaim forever; this is legible and tied to the final image.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete particulars: mechanized fireworks vs. fireflies that “refused to be measured.” The keystone’s final pulse offers a non-literal answer—value lies in the unquantifiable—without sermonizing. Ambiguity is preserved: the cities below remain efficient, the mage still penniless, yet the reader feels the repricing. No final-paragraph thesis statement; the image does the work.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Third-person lyric voice sustains a consistent perceptual signature: Selric notices frayed drafts, soft glows, mist chimes—details aligned with his gentle hypersensitivity. Syntax modulates from long reflective curls to clipped breaths at the summit. No dialogue appears; no head-hopping. Occasional elevated diction (“conceptual repricing”) is narratorial, not POV drift, and rare enough to stay within voice tolerance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Rhythm breathes with ascent—long sentences for climb, fragment-like pulses at keystone touch. Information density is high; most lines do setting + interiority + metaphor in one stroke. Two micro-loops: “accommodates impossibilities” appears twice in close proximity; “lingering luminance” thrice. Mixed metaphor risk at “garden folly keystone… humming” is absorbed by fairy-tale register. No artifact touches the closure beat; momentum stays airborne.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Fusing “garden folly” architecture with high-altitude ice spire is fresh; likewise the soft-glow magical disability in a world of mechanized fireworks. The mist-walk motif is familiar fantasy, but its function as humility test rather than power flex re-weights it. Conceptual repricing of unmeasurable light vs. algorithmic art feels inevitable in hindsight, not contrived. Risk stays coherent—no gimmicks, no late rule patches.</comment>
