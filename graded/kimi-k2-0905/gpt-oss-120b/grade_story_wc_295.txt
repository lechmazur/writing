<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is vivid—“the weight of the phrase settle in her chest”—and her micro-choice to speak the telegram aloud is embodied. Yet her motives plateau; once she decides to “read the sky,” no contradictory impulse or new risk complicates her. The story tells us she feels doubt lifted rather than dramatizing a visible cost for that shift. Interior texture is strong, but the arc lacks a late, costly renunciation to earn full believability.</comment>

<comment>The piece lands a Resonant Reconfiguration: placing the telegram beside the crystal reweights “share the burden” from abstract plea to enacted contract with the sky. Causality is lyric-accumulative rather than tight because/therefore; stars “answering” is poetic correlation, not engineered logic, but the pattern is internally consistent and taught early. Orientation is swift—plateau observatory, night, telegram by ~80 words. Closure beat carries felt conceptual cost: the temple opens, Mara’s solitude dissolves into communal covenant. Minor elasticity in causal linkage keeps it sub-9.</comment>

<comment>Setting is filtered through Mara’s chronicler gaze—daylily scent mixing with ozone, telescope hum syncing with heartbeat—creating an atmospheric micro-climate that guides her attention. The observatory dome, marble chair, and variable-star cluster are not backdrop but tools that literally project the inscription she must read. Spatial choreography is clean: dome opens, she aligns telescope, light arrows point to mountain. Environment constrains the only possible solution, satisfying the 9+ gate, though a hair more tactile navigation would clinch it.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—decode temple before doubt fractures her—signals early. Escalation is textural: each star-pulse thickens the pattern, deepening rather than narrowing options. Agency is present—she aligns, whispers, records—but the tightening is a soft luminosity, not a hard trade-off. Cost is conceptual (solitude → shared covenant) rather than tangible loss; visible price is faint, holding the score mid-band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: “words heal with words” is enacted when her whispered telegram literally opens stone. The daylily scent’s return beside the crystal reweights shared burden from poetic motif to functional key. No final moralizing; the lullaby of light is image, not thesis. Ambiguity lingers—will future dreamers answer back?—inviting reflection without sentimentality.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is lush, synesthetic, yet disciplined: “restless night,” “midnight solace,” “variable songs” form a coherent perceptual signature unique to a dream chronicler. Syntax modulates—long breathy clauses for star-gazing, curt phrases when glyphs lock. No dialogue, so no contamination. Free-indirect style stays clean; diction never exceeds Mara’s arcane lexicon. Minor risk: occasional perfume-ozone pairing edges toward motif tic, but it pays off in closure image.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; sentences carry double duty—e.g., “the daylily-pressed telegram…curling like a sigh” delivers scent, object, mood, metaphor. No paraphrase loops; each repetition (shared burdens, variable stars) accrues new semantic layer. Metaphors stay coherent within astral/flowery field. One micro-slip: “the night grew softer” is cliché, but it does not touch closure beat. Rhythm breathes with Mara’s heartbeat, satisfying read-aloud ear.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Fusion of lucid-dream archiving with star-script decryption feels fresh; neither trope dominates, and each redefines the other. Daylily telegram as cipher key is a lovely, specific invention. Risk is moderate—lyric accumulative structure rather than conventional plot—but execution commits fully. Could edge higher if the temple’s social consequences beyond Mara were hinted, but within 725 words the concept is distinctly angled.</comment>
