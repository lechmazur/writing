<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Arin’s luminous skepticism is evoked more through poetic epithets than embodied contradiction; the “dying-star” skin and compass-licking ritual are vivid, but no contradictory impulse is dramatized under pressure. The micro-choice to taste the ring is repeated rather than escalated, so the final “realization” reads as summary, not earned renunciation. Cost is atmospheric, not personal—no path is foreclosed on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of aurora, lavender, and spore vapors thickens until the compass lines glow, reweighting the stake from “curiosity” to “kinship.” Closure is a Charged Poise—the sweet metallic note crystallizes options—but the cost is ecological, not character-specific. Orientation anchors appear late (~150 words) yet serve the final image, so waiver applies. Causality is pattern-based, not because/therefore; acceptable under Accumulative rules.</comment>

<comment>Bluff, aurora, and ring form a micro-setting trio that actively steers the compass; lavender scent as “soft binary code” is a sensory hook that returns in the closing cadence. Spatial choreography stays clean: Arin at edge, carriers gathered, spores drifting, ring pressed to tongue—no floating bodies. The environment constrains the final calibration, satisfying the 9+ gate. One hairline slip: “dying star” skin is never re-anchored to physical action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—decoding weather carriers—remains abstract; the tightening is a shift in atmospheric taste, not a narrowing of live options. Agency is observational: tasting, watching, recording; no tactic is altered by a visible loss or tool forfeiture. Escalation is textural (sweet→sour→sweet metallic) and works under Accumulative lens, but the absence of a personal cost keeps the score sub-8. Closure reconfigures meaning, not tactical space.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: attunement to planetary mood versus technological mapping. The compass as “learning paths” and forest “election” reframes knowledge as negotiation, not control. Final image reweights earlier skepticism into quiet belonging without sermonizing. Minor abstraction of “secret heart” flirts with pseudo-profundity but is saved by the tasted metallic note that makes the insight corporeal.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric voice sustains a consistent perceptual signature: wind has flavor, circuits breathe, aurora ripples in cobalt-magenta. Syntax modulates from long luminous clauses to short calibration fragments, mirroring the shift from wonder to focus. No dialogue, so register drift risk is bypassed. Diction stays within poetic sf register; “terrestrially cosmic” is justified by the story’s own semantic logic.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Rhythm is deliberate and varied; paragraph cuts land on sensory beats. Figurative density is high but patterned—each metaphor returns to taste/compass/aurora triad—so the overwriting cap is waived. One scaffold lapse: “luminous yet skeptical” repeats twice in adjacent sentences. No mixed metaphors or simultaneity errors. Final line cadence earns its lullaby without lapsing into purple.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The election of trees releasing vote-spores that tweak microclimate to calibrate an emergent compass is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis. Risk is high—lyric eco-sf with tasting protagonist—but coherence holds. The concept commits fully; no late rule changes. Specificity of “lavender scent as soft binary code” is memorable and irreplicable; removal would collapse the tonal lattice. Meets 9+ quick test: hindsight inevitability + risk heightens stakes.</comment>
