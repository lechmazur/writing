<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Lira’s quietly deliberate nature is shown through tactile ritual (tracing glyphs, listening for the key) and her childhood riddle supplies a clean emotional engine. Interiority stays concrete—no label-speak—and the final smile is proportionate to the cost of completing the loops. Yet she never faces a genuine contradiction or flaw that might complicate her success; the risk feels intellectual rather than personal, so the arc flirts with safety-hedging.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the “map of shadow routes” reweights the premise and the key’s final winding signals a persistent constraint. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each traced loop tightens pattern until the translucent doorway pays it off. Orientation is anchored early by wind, copper plates, telescope; no disorientation serves the ending, so the Orientation Test penalty is waived.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The nocturnal observatory is filtered through Lira’s selective attention—clockwork scent, parchment air—so detail never stalls momentum. The floating-isle frame stays consistent but light; world-rules (glyph circuits, spoon-ripples) are learned by action, not dump. The telescope lens doubling as the doorway threshold lets the micro-setting constrain the final step, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Stakes are legible from the first paragraph: solve the shadow riddle or remain haunted. Pressure escalates by pattern accumulation—each completed loop tightens the circuit—rather than external opposition, coherent with the Accumulative lens. A visible price is paid: the key winds down, the isle settles, shadows vanish into the core; the cost is felt but modest, keeping the score below 8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: knowledge demands patient, iterative closure of one’s own observational gaps. The spoon-ripple backstory and migrating shadows braid into an epistemological argument without authorial sermon. Final image reframes noon darkness as migratory rest, offering resonant ambiguity—yet the insight feels gently cerebral rather than morally costly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person POV remains tight to Lira’s perceptual quirks: she hears wind through arches, smells parchment, counts gear-ticks. Syntax mirrors her deliberation—measured cadence, tactile verbs—without drifting into purple. No head-hopping or register slippage; psychic distance stays consistent through the final pulse of light.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is lean and musical; sentences vary in length, avoid template cadence. Figurative language is sparse and precise—“time folded back on itself”—never clustering to obscure causality. One minor scaffold: “quietly deliberate method” is repeated almost verbatim; a −0.2 loop keeps the score sub-9.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The spoon-bent-time hook and shadow-migration payoff synthesize clock-punk cosmology with a lyric riddle, feeling specific rather than borrowed. Risk is taken with an almost ritualistic structure, yet pattern is taught early and closure remains legible. The concept would collapse if transplanted to another world, satisfying the transformation test.</comment>
