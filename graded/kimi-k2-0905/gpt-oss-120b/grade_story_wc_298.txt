<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Maelia’s interior contradiction—gentle yet reckless—surfaces only in summary; no embodied moment shows both traits colliding under pressure. The “storm of purpose” is label-speak; we never see her hesitate or suffer a visible trade-off while pressing soot into bone. Her final smile and exit feel earned because the amber thread visibly lightens her palm, but the emotional cost is asserted, not dramatized. Interiority stays atmospheric rather than specific; we learn she “feels burdens lighten” but not how that ache lived in her body.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: each sigil and root-inlay thickens pattern until the amber conduit reweights the void. Closure lands as Charged Poise—the orchard’s sigh and Maelia’s lantern-thread crystallize options and cost without explanative gloss. Orientation is swift: catacomb orchard, skeletal trees, lone figure, burned card—all within first 60 words. Causality stays coherent under the lyrical pattern; every soot-line and luminescent spread is a visible “therefore” that accumulates toward the final breathing orchard.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard is never static: roots shiver, bones align, soil drinks ink—each physical shift alters Maelia’s access and tactics. Half-lit corridors provide live lighting that governs when sigils glow and when she kneels. Spatial choreography is clean; vertebrae crown, hollow cavity, exit tunnel stay consistently tracked. The micro-setting—burned card turned amber thread—functions as portable lantern and final image, recharging every prior root-inlay.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</question><comment>Dominant stake—fill her soul-void—is signaled in paragraph two and tightened each time a sigil is pressed; the orchard’s incremental response narrows her options to continue or quit. No external antagonist is needed; pressure is the orchard’s susurrus and the visible shrinking ash. One meaningful deepening: the card dissolves into amber conduit, reweighting the premise so future barters are now stitched inside the orchard. Cost is legible—she exits carrying the thread as permanent obligation—but the price feels light because the prior void was never dramatized as acute pain.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges as reciprocal repair: every destiny she barters plants hope inside the giver and the orchard, turning exploitation into mutuality. Subtext is carried in image—ash-to-amber, bone-to-soil—rather than statement; no final moral is preached. The orchard’s exhale and Maelia’s lantern-thread offer a resonant, non-literal answer: healing is shared graft, not self-filling. Complexity is honored; she remains a wanderer who will keep bartering, implying ongoing ethical risk.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person lyric achieves a consistent dusky resolve: syntax lengthens and breathes with the orchard’s susurrus, then tightens at each sigil press. Perceptual signature favors chthonic textures—soot, marrow, amber—never lapsing into tourist-catalog gothic. No dialogue, so voice stability rests on rhythmic control and metaphoric coherence, both maintained. Register stays within Maelia’s plausible lexicon; “trammel,” “ossified,” “susurrus” feel native to her ritual diction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Sentences carry double duty—e.g., “root shivered, and a faint luminescence rose”—propelling while texturing. Metaphors stay internally consistent: veins/ink/threads all serve the same vascular logic. No scaffold loops or synonym churn; each sigil, root, and bone variant adds new visual data. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and re-charge motif without mechanical symmetry.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Catacomb orchard itself is a fresh synthesis—ossuary plus grove—yet the tarot-inlay mechanic feels like familiar occult embroidery. Specificity of ash-threaded marrow and vertebrae crown keeps the concept from sliding into generic necro-garden. Risk is moderate: lyric accumulation over plot, but coherence holds. Fresh inflection arrives when the burned card dissolves into orchard vasculature—an image that feels inevitable in hindsight yet non-obvious at entry.</comment>
