<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The barefoot stargazer is sketched with evocative constellation-map jacket and opera glasses, giving her a memorable silhouette, but interiority is abstract (“awkward confidence bloom”) rather than embodied contradiction; no micro-choice under pressure reveals a hierarchy of values. The stone’s hum triggers her decision, yet the causality is mystical rather than character-driven; the final vow feels willed by theme, not by prior flaw or desire. She remains largely a receptor for the setting’s magic, so the “earned stasis” carries conceptual but not personal cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the bay’s engines roar back, workers emerge, and the stone’s hum reconfigures the lull into living pulse—visible conceptual cost. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern is taught early via the glyph-stone resonance and cadence of “hum” refrains. Orientation clear by ~70 words; no teleporting props. However, escalation is atmospheric, not tactical: the reignition happens *to* her and the rebels, not *through* a decision that forecloses a path, so the tightening is felt as vibe-shift rather than option-shift.</comment>

<comment>The repair bay is rendered with selective, sensory economy—rusted cathedral, cracked concrete, broken hulls—each detail doubling as emotional analogue. The stone circle beneath the concrete is a micro-setting that literally powers the climax; the opera glasses act as tool-setting hybrid, refracting light and glyph. Spatial choreography remains stable; bodies track cleanly from crate to console to window. Environment constrains the final image: sunrise reflected in reclaimed hearts, not distant stars—setting reweights the thematic telescope from cosmic to communal.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake: transform lull into living rebellion without burning it down. Pressure escalates via density increase—hum layers, dust spirals, engines cough—rather than tactical trade-off. The protagonist’s agency is listener-as-trigger, not negotiator or saboteur; cost is collective, not personal. Coincidence (stone responds to whisper) complicates; it does not resolve, but the lack of a visible personal price keeps escalation conceptual rather than visceral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: meaning is not destination but rhythmic participation—cycles of stasis and reignition. No overt thesis statements; final vow is whispered to horizon, not explained. Opera glasses and stone circle form a returning duality (micro/macro) that reprices the premise: cosmos is mirrored in human collectives. Subtext operates through imagery rather than dialogue, inviting reflection on repair vs. rebellion without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric voice sustains a consistent perceptual signature: sky “bruised,” air “vibrates with thunderous serenity,” dust “glitters like distant galaxies.” Syntax elongates and contracts to mimic hum cadence; no filter-verb bloat. Diction stays within stargazer lexicon (constellation maps, opera glasses) without register drift. Compression (“barefoot stargazer perched...”) teaches pattern early; elision pays off in final sunrise compression. No dialogue to test, so voice coherence rests on metaphoric control and rhythmic return.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>High information density: each sentence layers metaphor *and* propels (“glyph pulsed, matching the rhythm...”). Rhythm varies naturally; no template cadence or synonym loops detected. Metaphors are coherent—hum as rain on quiet lake—rather than contradictory. Opening and final lines act as bookends: margin of daylight → first true sunrise, satisfying paragraph cut test. Minor purple moments (“rusted cathedral,” “key forged from starlight and steel”) but they serve the lyric register and do not obscure causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Fusion of stone-circle myth with derelict spaceport feels fresh; ancient ritual reboots rocket-age rebellion without irony. Opera glasses as low-tech telescope repurposed for glyph-reading is a specific, non-obvious tool choice. Risk taken: atmospheric escalation over causal plot, but pattern is taught and closure coherent. Transformation test passes—swap opera glasses for binoculars or change setting and the metaphoric resonance collapses. Slight deduction for near-echo of “rusted cathedral” trope in decayed-space trope, but constellation-jacket and hum-stone offset with particularity.</comment>
