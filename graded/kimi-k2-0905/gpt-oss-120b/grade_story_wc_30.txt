<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The titan-gear librarian’s interiority is mostly poetic summary (“he understood,” “he sensed,” “he realized”) rather than embodied contradiction under pressure; no micro-choice shows gears literally slowing or speeding with moonlight. The final decision to open blank shelves is declared, not dramatized with visible cost—no risk of mechanical seizure, social ridicule, or loss of scroll-memory. Emotional states are labeled (“quiet gratitude,” “yearning”) instead of felt through bronze-cog tremors or salt-stung leather. Because the climax is summary, the migration of his own identity feels ornamental rather than a crucible that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the key melts into the creel, reweighting the premise that routine can hold wonder. The cost is conceptual but legible—the librarian accepts his own identity must migrate, a stasis that forecloses immutable selfhood. Causality is lyric-associative rather than tight because/therefore; the rupture of “tomorrow disappeared” is never clarified or paid off as a constraint that narrows options. Still, the inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds: moonlit images tighten toward the final glowing creel, and the pattern is taught early enough to keep the drift coherent.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The tidal atrium is vividly anchored within the first 120 words through silver water, marble arches, and bronze-cog anatomy; spatial footing stays steady. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven—librarian notices scroll glow, gear tempo, brine scent—rather than tourist catalog. The creel functions as micro-setting: its bamboo walls constrain the key’s final fusion, charging the closure image. Weather and moonlight evolve causally with identity fluctuation, meeting the 9+ gate that environment shapes the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving wonder in routine—is declared early but remains abstract; no concrete resource (time, scroll-memory, social credit) is at risk. Pressure deepens only imagistically (gears soften, water teal-shifts) rather than narrowing tactical options; the librarian never faces a forced trade-off between preserving stories and preserving self. The smelting scene is described, not dramatized with beats of failure or cost. Escalation is atmospheric, sufficient for Accumulative lens, but lacks a visible price that alters later moves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme of identity migration emerges through moonlit imagery and the creel’s song rather than explicit thesis, avoiding sermonizing. The final image—key melted into bamboo—reweights routine as a living vessel, offering quiet resonance. Subtext lurks in the creel’s whispered coasts and the librarian’s slowed gears, implying acceptance of impermanence without stating it. Complexity is honored: no moral is extracted, only an invitation to write anew.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person lyric voice maintains stable distance, filtering perception through bronze-and-salt diction (“brine and cedar,” “ripple-patterned like tides”). Syntax modulates from long tidal clauses to the clipped final “He returned,” mirroring gear slowdown. No head-hopping; POV stays locked to librarian. The prose texture is distinctive and consistent, meeting the 9+ quick test for perceptual signature under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm is fluid; sentence openings vary, paragraphs breathe. Information density is high—each image carries moon/sea/gear triple duty. Occasional template cadence (“the librarian… the librarian…”) and abstract labels (“wonder in routine”) dull immediacy but do not obscure causality or closure. No mixed metaphors or scaffold loops in peak beats; artifacts stay below closure-touch threshold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Synthesis of clockwork librarian + lunar identity tides + bamboo creel is non-obvious and feels inevitable in hindsight. The premise commits fully to lyric fabulism without explanatory hand-holding. Specific detail (wintersun serenity, gear-softening under crescent) freshens familiar moon imagery. Risk-taking in chronology-rupture (“after tomorrow disappeared”) is bold, though underdeveloped; still, the conceptual repricing lands cleanly.</comment>
