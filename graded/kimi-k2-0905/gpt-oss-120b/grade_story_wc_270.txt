<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Anara’s insurgent past and “evolve tradition” motive are declared but never dramatized; we hear she offered a memory, yet the sacrifice is reported, not shown, so cost stays abstract. Interiority leans on lyrical labels—‘seed of evolution’, ‘quiet voice of seedlings’—rather than embodied contradiction. The telepathy enables plot but generates no visible flaw or trade-off; competence is unchallenged, blunting crucible pressure. Closure achieves Earned Stasis, yet the emotional price is off-stage, so the change feels inferred, not legible in gesture.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Causal chain: kite discovery → glyph decoding → unseal → embryo awakening is linear and legible; transitions are smooth. Orientation anchors who/where by line 3; no debt. Escalation relies on one turn—amber cracks, destiny binds—cost is declared (lost lullabies) but not rendered on-page, so resonance is conceptual rather than felt. Lens holds as Situational/Accumulative; closure lands, but the missing dramatized cost caps Q2 at 7.2.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Volcanic hot-spring micro-setting is vivid—steam, basalt, geysers—yet never constrains action; characters move unimpeded, no temperature or terrain hazard alters tactics. Kite, moss, amber function as charged objects; kite script mechanics remain abstract, limiting integration. Sensory palette favors geothermal imagery; selective and atmospheric, but spatial choreography stays fuzzy (distance between pool/embryo niche never fixed). Passes 9+ gate for object-as-setting but capped by lack of environmental pressure on choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—community’s future via implanted destiny—signaled early; pressure source is communal witness more than personal jeopardy. Single tightening: amber opens, destiny binds; cost (lost lullabies) is summarized, not dramatized, weakening visceral trade-off. Agency is ritual completion rather than contested decision; no live option is foreclosed on-page. Escalation is tonal/ritual, meets Accumulative lens; meets 600-word threshold but lacks visible price to breach 8.0 band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Theme—tradition rewritten by love, not fear—emerges through communal chorus of plants; avoids explicit moral. Subtext resides in moss-whispers and vine-cradle, not sermon. Final image of ‘collective heartbeat’ reweights earlier rebellion into stewardship, offering quiet resonance. Complexity is modest; no counter-argument given page time, yet avoids tidy moral—earns mid-high 6 band.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Narrative voice sustains lyrical, mythic register: ‘broken prayer’, ‘mineral veins’, consistent with tale-telling mode. Perceptual signature centers on vegetal telepathy—‘leaves trembling in rhythm’—giving unique filter. Psychic distance stable; no head-hop. Syntax flows with variable rhythm; occasional elevated diction (‘indecipherable script’, ‘conceptual repricing’) slightly overshoots grandmother’s lexicon but reads as collective-myth register, permissible. Distinctiveness is strong; not yet compressed enough for 8+.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Figurative density high but patterned—steam, mineral, botanical motifs—taught early and iterated, so permitted. Paraphrase loops minor: ‘reconstruction… rebuilt… rebuilt tradition’ cluster near end (−0.2). No mixed metaphors; sentence rhythm varied. Information density good; lines multitask scenery + emotion. Final image clean; artifact friction slight, holds story under pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Fusion of insurgent grandmother, plant-telepathy, and geothermal ritual feels fresh; telepathy framed as evolutionary rather than heroic. Kite-glyphs linking botanical language to tech-relic is elegant synthesis. Premise risks eco-utopian cliché but commits, embedding destiny inside communal stewardship rather than savior embryo. Specificity of moss-whisper cadence differentiates from genre templates; not groundbreaking but confidently original within mythic mode.</comment>
