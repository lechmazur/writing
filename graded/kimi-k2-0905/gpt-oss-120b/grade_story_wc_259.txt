<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The historian’s motive—pursuit of forbidden knowledge—is declared repeatedly but never tested by an on-page dilemma; interiority lapses into lyrical labels (“anguished joy”) rather than embodied contradiction. Micro-choices exist—irregular steps—but they are described in summary, not dramatized, so no cost is legible. The arc amounts to a mood passage rather than a credible shift in stance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The closure qualifies as Conceptual Repricing: the prism reweights the premise by releasing “atoms of nostalgia” into the world. Yet the causal chain is weak—random footfalls are declared to open the pagoda without intermediate failure or price—so the lens feels Accumulative/Textural rather than Causal. Orientation is clear within 120 words, but the legible lens ambiguity at closure keeps the score mid-band.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The archive’s breathing walls, shifting floor echoes, and parchment scent create tactile immediacy; the bronze prism’s light is used as a tool that constrains movement (must avoid patterns) and charges the final image. Spatial choreography is tight across the single corridor scene. The 9+ gate is missed only because the prism’s physical rules remain metaphorical rather than operationally specific.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Stakes—access to forbidden knowledge—are announced early, but pressure escalates only by lyrical intensification (“air grew heavy,” “cascade of light”) rather than a narrowing of options or visible cost. The single “purification” moment is authorially guaranteed once random stepping succeeds; no resource is spent or lost. Under Accumulative lens, the deepening is sensuous but not consequential enough for 8-band entry.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</question><comment>Theme—purification through unpredictability—emerges imagistically, never sermonized. The final “new stories” implication offers a resonant reconfiguration, yet the lack of on-page cost keeps the insight abstract. Ambiguity is purposeful, but the emotional after-effect is more atmospheric than specific.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Third-person lyric voice sustains a consistent cadence of long, breathy sentences that mirror the historian’s trance; perceptual signature is vivid (“lantern trembling,” “scent of old parchment”). Filter-verb clusters appear but are sparse enough not to stall momentum. Diction stays within an antiquarian scholar’s plausible lexicon; no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Sentences vary in length and opening, avoiding template cadence; metaphor strings (“liquid memory,” “vortex of forgotten childhoods”) are dense but coherent under the lyric mode. A few near-paraphrase pairs occur (“steady yet unpredictably shifting light” vs. “steadily unpredictable”) yet do not obscure causality. Closure image is clear, allowing mid-band score.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The “avoid patterns” mechanism repurposes dance-theory into a purification ritual; the bronze prism as memory-encoder is fresh, not standard fantasy furniture. Risk is taken with lyric accumulation over causal plot, and it largely pays off in a memorable tonal signature. The concept is specific enough that swapping elements would collapse the design.</comment>
