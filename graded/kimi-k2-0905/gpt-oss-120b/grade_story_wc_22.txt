<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The coachman’s listening priesthood and ancestral mission provide a clear, embodied motive; interiority stays concrete (“his tongue shaping sounds that no living ear had heard”). Yet the emotional arc is static—no contradictory impulse or visible flaw is tested under pressure, so the final smile feels lightly earned rather than costly.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a lyric Conceptual Repricing: the dead-language phrase sinks, sealing the submerged concord with undeniable conceptual cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: bird-calls → seed release → phosphorescent garden, each image tightening the pattern. Orientation is anchored within 120 words; causality is lyric, not mechanical, and remains coherent.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Jetty, rust-patched cart, and phosphorescent algae are tactile, selective, and return charged in the final glow. The narrow ribbon of timber physically constrains every step, while the reef-death aftermath supplies the moral context. One micro-setting—the seed box—reprises as the ritual object that seeds the closing image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake: will the dead tongue translate into living growth? Pressure mounts via pattern accumulation—each bird-call narrows which pod can be released. The coachman’s agency is attention/ritual endurance; the price is the unrecoverable past he carries. No reversible turn, but the tightening of pattern suffices under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: battlefield → garden via linguistic memory. The refrained “narrow vastness” reweights from spatial descriptor to existential paradox in the last line, achieving Conceptual Repricing. No moralizing; the silence after the dropped phrase lets the reader feel the cost of peace built on loss.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays close to the coachman’s priestly perceptual filter: “he listened as a priest reads liturgy.” Syntax lengthens into liturgical cadence, then compresses at the scatter moment. No head-hopping; patterned elision (“the submerged concord”) is seeded early and paid off in the final sinking phrase.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm modulates from ceremonial rolling clauses to the staccato of pods unfurling. Metaphors (bleached bones, bruised violet) are spare and anchored in POV. No loops or scaffold; one near-repeat of “narrow vastness” is purposeful reprise, not churn. Final image is clean, luminous, uncluttered.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The premise—linguistic resurrection of extinct flora via bird-cadence translation—is fresh, yet grows organically from the grief of a dead reef. Risky lyric structure taught early and held to a charged closure. The “narrow vastness” paradox synthesizes form and theme without gimmickry; emotional specificity prevents abstraction.</comment>
