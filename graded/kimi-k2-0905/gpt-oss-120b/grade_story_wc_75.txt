<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Liora’s motive—reviving art to keep displaced souls intact—stays consistent, but her interiority is delivered in lyrical paraphrase (“rosewater dread”) rather than scene-level contradiction. The artisan-revival beat is dramatized, yet the decisive choice (breaking the first loaf) is communal, diffusing individual cost. No contradictory impulse is staged inside her; she is more conductor than pressured agent. Meets basic Change/Stasis test, but micro-choice hierarchy is generic.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: repeated sensory images (rosewater, emerald, yeast) accrue density until the amphitheatre doors thaw and the stage re-lights; closure is a Charged Poise where displaced persons “finally felt at home.” Causality is associative rather than strict because/therefore, acceptable under the lens. Orientation anchors within 120 words. Cost is atmospheric—loss of dread—rather than a tangible forfeit; still palpable on-page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Grotto/waterfall functions as textured pressure: mist seeps into stone, dictates scent palette, and physically gates the hidden amphitheatre. Specificity is high—“emerald light refracted into the mist”—but spatial choreography is soft; crowd and stage positions blur. Sensory hierarchy favors smell over visual precision, matching refugee social priorities. Tool (lens) and micro-setting (bread initials) constrain final ritual, satisfying 9+ test.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—arts must revive or collective memory dies—is clear early, but escalation is largely atmospheric; deepening happens via color return, not narrowing options. No credible loss of time, tool, or social credit is dramatized. Coincidence (lens flash triggers door thaw) is permitted under Accumulative lens. Final narrowing is emotional—acceptance replaces dread—so pressure coheres, yet remains abstract.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges as “identity survives through shared art”; repeated initials (bread, stone, lens) shift from loss-marker to ownership-marker. Subtext resides in gesture—breaking bread equals reclaiming narrative space—avoiding moral statement. Rosewater dread motif reweights at closure, now sweet-bitter rather than paralytic. Slight abstraction keeps it shy of 8+.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Third-person lyric voice maintains sensorial compression and rosewater lexis; diction stays inside Liora’s cultured register. No dialogue, so no voice convergence. Rhythm is incantatory, repeating noun-adjective pairs; pattern is taught early and pays off in final prism line. Filter-verb clusters (“the scent rosewater mingled”) mildly dull immediacy but fit texture-first strategy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Figurative language saturates nearly every sentence; density risk is partially offset by accumulative design, yet metaphors sometimes stack (“echoing the waterfall that roared”) and create minor coherence drag. No template cadence; sentence openings vary. Several near-paraphrase pairs (“displaced persons, refugees of a vanished valley”) could be tightened. Closure image avoids purple overload, saving 9+.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Fusion of beekeeper ghost, emerald opera glass, and bread-initial ritual feels specific; removal would break the story’s symbolic circuitry. Refugee-city-behind-waterfall is fresh, though “hidden grotto as refuge” has lineage. Conceptual commitment is full—arts literally thaw stone—preventing gimmick. Risk lies in lyric overload, but it mostly justifies itself.</comment>
