<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong interiority—“a calm blade ready for battle,” “warlike serenity”—gives her a distinct emotional signature. The lost-finder trait is shown twice and drives the climax (amulet recovery). Yet her guardedness never cracks; the “heart finally open” moment is asserted, not dramatized, blunting the promised change.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each concentric chant ring tightens the stake by compressing the ice/memory. Closure lands cleanly—“the lake’s surface clears, reflecting…truths beneath”—with visible cost (seed’s hunger turned inward). No causal leaps; geography and object states track.</question>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Swirling orchard vortex, frost-rimmed eyes, silver-bird shards—every descriptor is sensory and purpose-driven. The lake/orchard dyad evolves from menace to reverent garden, mirroring internal thaw. Micro-setting (seed on palm) directly constrains the final sealing choice.</question>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—liberate the frozen confession—signals early and tightens through each expanding rune-circle. One credible micro-cost: seed’s hunger redirected, risking self-consumption. Escalation is steady (ice shards → syllables → palm burn) rather than a single wrenching reversal.</question>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges via image pattern: reflection vs. depth, blade vs. peace. Final mirror now “reflects…truths beneath” reweights the opening motif without moralizing. Warlike serenity stays complex—peace bought by rehearsed violence—resisting tidy closure.</question>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays close to her sinewy attention: “branches twisting…as if the trees themselves were spiraling.” Rhythm modulates—long sentences for incantation, clipped fragments at shard climax. No head-hop; perceptual signature remains frost-edged and fisher-patient.</question>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>High information density—“seed pulses, recognizing the surge of released memory” does triple duty. One metaphor mix: “branches…spiraling into a void” then “silver birds” shards—both vivid, but bird/branch vehicles coexist without collision. No loops; cadence mirrors drum-like chant.</question>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Frozen confession as crystallized battle-truth, memory-eating seed repurposed to store rather than devour—fresh synthesis. Orchard vortex blends eco-horror with memory archaeology; not a trope checklist. Final “mirror that finally reflects…truths beneath” flips familiar lake metaphor into earned insight.</question>
