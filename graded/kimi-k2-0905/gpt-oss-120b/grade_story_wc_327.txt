<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The copper-veined storyteller’s motive—transmute texture into sound before language dies—remains steady and is embodied in every beat (whispering to the diamond, tracing birds, sealing the tunnel). Interiority is lyrical yet concrete (“the copper veins in his skin tingled”), never drifting into label-speak. The only absence is a second on-page character, so relationship/status dynamics are N/A; no deduction. The arc is Earned Stasis: he accepts the song will be locked in stone and bone, a visible cost paid on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the final note seeds the wind, the birds re-weave, and the tunnel forever stores the new tongue—conceptual cost is undeniable. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: cadence layers (echoes, fracture-glow, wing-pulses) tighten until meaning is re-inscribed in stone. Orientation is crystalline: “mouth of a tunnel of echoes” anchors who/where in line 1; time = perpetual dusk. No causal break; the diamond’s crack and the birds’ spirals are earned pattern, not coincidence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The canyon, bone towers, and flawed diamond are not backdrop but instruments: the towers’ ribs calibrate resonance, the tunnel’s walls absorb/refuse sound, the diamond’s fissures diffract light that guides the birds’ new spiral. Micro-setting (the diamond as portable echo chamber) literally constrains the final tactic—its fracture dictates the cadence that seals the language inside bone. Sensory hierarchy skews auditory/tactile, fit to a translator of texture-into-sound. Spatial choreography is immaculate; the storyteller’s fingers, the stone’s glow, and the swifts’ tightening loops track without drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake = save the language from mute death; signaled in line 3. Escalation is cadence-based: each bird-loop tightens the echo-tunnel’s hum, narrowing options until only the fracture-release can complete the lexicon. Protagonist agency = tracing the spirals and cracking the diamond; luck never intervenes. Cost is the irreversible sealing—once the note falls, the new tongue is entombed in bone, a price legible in the final silence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the metamorphosis of loss into legacy: extinction becomes inscription. The flawed diamond reweights from curse to crucible, the birds from omens to co-authors; no moral is stated. Final image of “long shadows that whispered the same song” offers non-literal answer: memory can outlive utterance if encoded in matter and motion. Ambiguity lingers—will anyone ever decode the bone-tunnel?—yet the story commits to the cost of that uncertainty.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person lyric adheres to a single, stable focalizer; no head-hop. Perceptual signature is synesthetic—sound is seen, texture is heard—mirroring the translator’s gift. Diction stays within plausible storyteller register (“quietly articulate,” “cadence of the flock”) without academic drift. Rhythm accelerates into breathless anaphora during fracture-release, then settles into the hush of sealed echoes, mirroring emotional arc.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence adds pressure or texture. Metaphors are coherent—bone towers as ribs, diamond as shell—without mixed logic. High information density: one sentence often fuses setting, stakes, and sensory gear (“He whispered to the flawed diamond, inviting it to listen, to drink the invisible song of the birds”). Read-aloud rhythm modulates from cavernous long vowels to staccato chimes; paragraph cuts land on cadence shifts. No artifact touches the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresco of echo-tunnel, copper-veined translator, and fracture-song is unlike any prior fable; tropes of “last language” and “cursed gem” are alchemized into pure texture. The birds-as-notation system is a fresh, non-obvious method that feels inevitable once shown. Risk-taking—entire plot is a rising sound-wave—heightens coherence rather than gimmickry. Specificity of geologic/biologic detail (swifts’ wingbeats as punctuation) anchors the surreal frame in lived matter.</comment>
