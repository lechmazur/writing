<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Rook’s transition from body-finder to memory-keeper is anchored in sensory memory and a single, embodied bark-choice that re-opens the chest; the interior contradiction between duty and fatigue is implied rather than dramatized in-scene, muting cost. Micro-choices (nudge, bark, seal) show values, yet no visible failure or friction with another will keeps the arc shy of full crucible pressure. Still, the moment he re-waxes the leaf the path forecloses with quiet weight, earning a credibly limited change.</comment>

<comment>The cylinder→prism→leaf causal chain is tight, each groove-color beat widening history and narrowing Rook’s next move. Orientation (who/where/when) lands by line 4; moon-groove decoding rule is taught early and paid off when scarlet band reveals the chest site. Closure (Earned Stasis) is on-page: resealing the leaf costs him the comfort of forgetting; the settlement’s sigh confirms the reconfiguration. Persistent constraint—the leaf’s hum now inside him—shapes future guardianship, meeting the 9+ cost test.</comment>

<comment>Scrapyard towers, rust grit under paws, and prism-cast spectrum hues give tactile, non-visual weight; every descriptor doubles as action cue (glass rotates, dust sings). The leaf-as-micro-setting constrains the final choice—its copper veins literally pulse, forcing Rook’s renunciation. Spatial choreography is flawless: half-buried kiosk, collapsed door, wax cradle track cleanly. Environment mirrors internal shift: amber wasteland brightens to violet-tinted sky after the leaf is resealed, charging the closing image.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—"translate distance into closeness"—is signaled in paragraph 3 and tested by each color-stanza. Escalation is accumulative: each spectral revelation tightens the noose of memory until the leaf’s hum becomes unbearable proximity. Agency remains canine-physical (sniff, nudge, bark) rather than strategic, but the final resealing is a decisive refusal that costs oblivion. Price is unmistakable: he volunteers to carry every voice, a lifelong weight.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Theme of reclamation through memory emerges wordlessly from the sequential unveiling of wars encoded in color; no character moralizes. The autumn leaf’s copper veins recycle the sky’s earlier amber glow, re-pricing both as living circuitry rather than dead ornament. Final promise to the wind offers Charged Poise: connection is possible only if someone consents to be haunted. Ambiguity lingers—will the voices drown him?—but complexity is embraced, not tidied.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person liminal close-third stays inside a bloodhound’s sensory bandwidth—smell as text, ears "pruning the hush," joints stirring metallic dust-song—creating a distinct perceptual signature. Syntax lengthens and compresses with sniff-circles and bark-staccato, no head-hopping. Diction ("rusted phonograph cylinder," "waxen leaf") remains within canine idiom without anthropomorphic overreach. Prism mechanics and groove-reading are taught early, paid off cleanly, no POV leakage.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with sniff-paced sibilance and metallic percussion of rust-grooves; no template cadence. Figurative control keeps mixed metaphors coherent: "letters trembling like fireflies in a storm" blends light and sound without violating physical logic. Information density is high—each sentence layers history, color, scent. Minor scaffold: "vanished engines and empty promises" is abstract, but compression serves elegiac tone and does not touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Post-apocalyptic memory-hound is fresh, yet the true invention is the phonograph-as-olfactory-console and color-as-scent translation, a non-obvious sensory synesthesia that feels inevitable once taught. Waxed leaf MacGuffin avoids cliché by functioning as both battery and burden. Risk—canine POV in lyric mode—heightens rather than obscures stakes. No derivative premise drift; archetypes are re-wired through specific sensory mechanics.</comment>
