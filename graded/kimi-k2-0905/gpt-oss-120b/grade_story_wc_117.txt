<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Liora’s interiority is soft-focus (“cautious exuberance” is repeated rather than dramatized) and the only micro-choice—closing the locket—has no visible cost. The curl’s emotional weight is asserted, never tested against a counter-impulse, so the arc is sentimental summary, not pressured change.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the eclipse pattern intensifies mood and the curl re-appears to create Charged Poise. Yet the decisive reconfiguration (“world reborn in the echo of the song”) is declared, not embodied; no tangible price is shown, so closure feels cost-free.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Sage Ridge is sketched with selective sensory anchors—silver ring of light, dreaming roots—that mirror internal hush without clutter. The harp-as-micro-setting constrains pacing and justifies 9+ gate; environment does not yet alter tactics enough for top band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Stake is clear—deliver wonder through music—but pressure is atmospheric, not tactical; no option is foreclosed, no price exacted when the song ends. Eclipse supplies grandeur, not escalation; consequently the tension curve is flat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Ordinary magic emerges organically via curl, harp, and communal hush; the refrain “magic does not need grand gestures” is stated late, blunting subtext. Still, theme lingers through final image of midwife gifting curls—earned reconfiguration without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Third-person lyric maintains steady distance, cadence slows to match breath-music motif; no head-hop. Filter verbs occasionally dull immediacy (“seemed to approve”), yet diction is consistent and perceptual signature stays tethered to Liora’s auditory bias.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose is fluid but leans on soft intensifiers (“quiet that felt like the breath of the earth itself”) and stock dyads (“travelers, locals, children”). No loops or mixed metaphors, yet sentence rhythm can settle into lullaby repetition that cushions rather than propels.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Fusion of music therapy with eclipse is fresh; generational curl motif avoids cliché by anchoring in midwife ritual. Risk is modest—lyric pastoral mode is safe terrain—but specificity of harp tuned to wind lifts the piece above generic wonder tales.</comment>
