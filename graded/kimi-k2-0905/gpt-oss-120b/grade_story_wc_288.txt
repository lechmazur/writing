<question>1</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is lyrically voiced but remains at a single emotional register; contradictory impulses are declared (“brittle awakenings”) rather than dramatized in choice. No micro-choice under pressure visibly forecloses a path—she walks, places, records, whispers, but the stakes never force a recognizably costly trade-off. The claimed contemporaneity with the sky-whale stays ornamental; it alters neither tactic nor self-risk. Closure is a felt uplift rather than an earned renunciation, so cost is ambient, not character-bound.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the sunrise-on-memory reframes isolation→independence via the sundial glow, cost felt as conceptual rather than causal. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of light/hum/echo intensifies until meaning reweights; no causal chain required and none supplied. Orientation is established by word 40, no penalty. The piece teaches its lyric repetitions early and pays them off in the final image; transitions are legible under the mosaic shard rhythm.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The tidal-above-clouds library is evoked through kelp-shelves, humming marble, and a stone circle that literally vibrates choice into script—setting actively enables the climax. Micro-setting (the brass sundial) is handled in six distinct beats, its mirror-state evolving from passive catch to active beacon that recharges the final sunrise. Sensory hierarchy privileges weightless motion and haptic hum, filtering perception through Mira’s researcher bias. Spatial choreography tracks her ascent onto the mist-stair without drift or contradiction.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</question><grade><comment>Dominant stake—turning the library’s echo into an independent chorus—is declared but never sharply tested; pressure is atmospheric, not tactical. Escalation is textural: each luminous ripple adds density rather than narrows options. The sole visible cost is the sky-whale silhouette fading, which is aesthetic rather than felt forfeiture. Agency stays contemplative; no irreversible choice or resource lost on page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of coexistence emerges imagistically—sundial reflects whale, whale ribs mirror stone arches—without moralizing. Subtext relies on light-echo doubles (memory↔present, isolation↔community) that culminate in the sunrise re-pricing. The rejection of “brittle awakenings” as failure is subtly earned through Mira’s final whispered vow, not asserted. Ambiguity lingers: independence is declared but unproven, letting resonance outweigh message.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Third-person lyric achieves a consistent perceptual signature: selective attention to vibration, mirrored light, and whale-bone geometry. Syntax modulates—long clause-clouds drift, then compress into short beats (“She stepped. She climbed.”) to echo pulse. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk is zero; diction stays within researcher-poet lexicon. Patterned repetition of “atomically reflective” and “brittle awakenings” is deliberate, taught early, and paid off in final glow.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>High figurative density in every sentence risks purple overload, yet the maritime-light motif sustains internal logic; mixed-metaphor count is zero. One scaffold loop detected—“the hum of an ancient stone circle” repeated with near-paraphrase twice in mid-text—subtracts propulsion. Opening and closing lines are sharp; middle paragraphs rely on cumulative anaphora (“The library… The clouds…”) that can feel templated. Overall, ear-test passes; information is layered, but trimming 5% synonym shimmer would tighten.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: cloud-sea library + extant contemporary of extinct sky-whale + sundial-as-memory-lens is non-obvious yet internally coherent. Risk-taking lies in relentless lyric accumulation rather than event; pattern is taught early and closure remains legible. Specificity (atomically reflective brass, ink-sea clouds) anchors abstraction, resisting generic surrealism. Minor deduction for whale-contemporary claim that never complicates plot—conceptual boldness slightly under-exploited.</comment>
