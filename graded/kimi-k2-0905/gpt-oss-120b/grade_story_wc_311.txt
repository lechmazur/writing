<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lira’s interior contradiction—grief versus the need to name—drives every beat; the micro-choice to speak “Astraeon” crystallizes motive into irrevocable action with visible cost (weight lifts, halo forms). Memory of the sailor surfaces as earned payoff, not epiphany. No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible N/A.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the echo shifts from burden to bridge, cost legible in the lifting halo and the remembered name. Accumulative lens holds—each naming beat densifies the stake—pattern taught by 25 % and paid off in final aurora. Orientation anchored by line 3; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Observatory stone, cracked dome, and scattered light constrain every gesture; the atlas page recurs as micro-setting whose phosphorescence enables the crystallization. Final aurora reuses the same light physics, charging the closing image. Sensory hierarchy filters through Lira’s reaper-perception—dust motes as prisms, chant as low frequency—never tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—name the nameless fears—tightens with each crystalline verse; options narrow as remaining crystals dwindle. The act of naming visibly costs psychic weight, foreclosing endless mourning. Accumulative escalation coherent: each new name = denser resonance + lighter monster = brighter aurora. No coincidence; agency pure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme—grief transformed by linguistic sacrifice—emerges through image, not statement; the aurora is the non-literal answer. Forgotten phrases return as constellations, reweighting sacrifice from loss to gift. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in the unspoken names still drifting skyward.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person lyric remains tight to Lira’s perceptual signature: “cloak dripping with the sighs of unkept promises” fuses body and mood. Syntax lengthens under awe, contracts under decisive naming; no head-hop. Diction stays within reaper-myth lexicon—“conduits of luminous memory”—no register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies: long breathless clauses for aurora ascent, clipped fragments for naming beats. No scaffold loops; each sentence advances image or stakes. Figurative chain (crystal→droplet→aurora) stays coherent, physics intact. One mixed metaphor minor: “second heart” for monster pulse, but does not blur closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fusion of maritime bestiary, astronomical observatory, and reaper mythology feels non-obvious; naming-as-exorcism reframes both star lore and grief ritual. Atlas page repurposed from nautical dread to stellar map—inevitable in hindsight. Risk in lyric accumulative structure pays off in luminous final image without gimmickry.</comment>
