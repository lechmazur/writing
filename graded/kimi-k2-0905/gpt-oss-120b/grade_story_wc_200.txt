<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Mara’s “modestly fearless” stance is shown through her steady advance into the gorge, but the interior contradiction is asserted rather than dramatized; the crocodile-tooth artifact gives her an external cue, so the moment of genuine fear/courage overlap is only sketched. Her micro-choice to risk the joke is the single visible pivot, yet the cost (exposure to hostile spirits) is announced, not felt on the body, so the endurance registers as safe. The collector identity stays atmospheric; we never see her decide whether to pocket or abandon a soul, so the occupation is costume more than crucible. Still, the final laugh-charged tooth glows as a concrete reconfiguration, giving her arc a legible before/after under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<comment>The Accumulative/Textural drive is taught early through repeating echo/laughter motifs and holds to the end; closure arrives as a Charged Poise—the gorge hums with repurposed grief—so the lens is coherent. Orientation is secured by word 60, well inside the 120-word safe-zone. The decisive change (joke → laughter → tooth ignites) is on-page and charged with conceptual cost: the gorge’s acoustic ecology is permanently altered. Causality is loose but pattern-true; no teleporting props or retro-patching.</comment>

<comment>Echo Gorge is rendered through sonic/motion detail—slap of boots, glass-sunrise water, harp string tension—rather than postcard vistas, keeping density high. The gorge’s wall is both altar and resonating chamber, so the micro-setting directly enables the final sonic alchemy. Spatial choreography is clean: tooth pressed to wall → vibrations channel → laughter wraps stone, no impossible positions. Environment never constrains logistics; it supplies the acoustic rule-set that makes the climax plausible, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“can these whispers be converted to laughter?”—is signaled early; pressure accumulates via each bent harp note tightening the acoustic noose. The single meaningful deepening occurs when Mara realizes laughter is the missing reagent, forcing her to hazard the goat joke; the cost is social-aesthetic (ridicule risk) rather than bodily, but it is visible. Escalation is textural: sorrow density increases until the pattern snaps into giggles; no coincidence resolves the turn. Could wish for a sharper tactical loss (tooth cracks? voice hoarse?), but the felt acoustic shift meets the bar.</comment>

<grade>8.2</question>
<comment>Theme—grief transmuted through communal laughter—emerges from the sonic imagery rather than thesis statements, avoiding overt moralizing. The reweighting is elegantly non-literal: sorrowful echoes become “fireflies” of redeemed story-light, a conceptual repricing that invites reflection without tidy closure. Subtext operates in gesture: the act of pressing tooth to stone is simultaneously archeological and intimate, hinting at relic-worship without exposition. No final-paragraph sermon, so the resonance lingers.</comment>

<comment>Third-person distant stays stable; no head-hop. Perceptual signature is aural—Mara catalogues vibrations, sighs, echoes—giving the narration a tuned-ear texture that distinguishes it from generic fantasy diction. Syntax tightens under pressure: clauses shorten as harp notes “bend the air,” mirroring the rising frequency. No dialogue, so voice evaluation rests on narrative rhythm, which is controlled and purposeful.</comment>

<grade>8.0</question>
<comment>High information density: one sentence often layers sensory data, mythic cue, and plot function (“the relic sang a low, resonant tone that coaxed the spirits”). Figurative language is selective—three metaphors in climax beat, each acoustic, so pattern holds. One minor paraphrase loop: “luminous ache” is reused twice in closing paragraph; a −0.2 artifact nudge applies but does not touch causality. Sentence variety and paragraph cuts are clean; no scaffold bloat.</comment>

<comment>Premise freshens the “speaking-with-dead” trope by requiring a joke as conduit, a non-obvious ritual twist. Specificity of misaligned harp as signal processor, rather than generic bell, gives world-logic memorable texture. Crocodile tooth relic is particular to regional myth palette, avoiding standard rune/stone cliché. Still, the wandering-minstrel joke is lightly recycled whimsy; a joke that only this gorge could birth would have pushed ingenuity higher.</comment>
