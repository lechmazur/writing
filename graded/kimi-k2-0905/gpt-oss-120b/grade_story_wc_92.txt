<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Kael’s calmly inventive trait stays credible and active—he deciphers the sundial, plants code-marks, endures the blackout patrol, and finally triggers the cradle. Interiority is concrete (“curiosity turned into quiet intrigue”) and embodied in the bronze quill’s tiny clinks. Yet the silent-revolution motive is declared rather than conflicted; we never feel him doubt or sacrifice, so the cost feels abstract. Still, within 600–800 words he undergoes a visible shift from guardian to conspirator, earned by his own micro-choices.</comment>

<comment>The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: blackout hush → encoded sundial → bronze quill → cradle activation → cognitive ripple. Each beat adds density and narrows the stake from “find the cradle” to “ignite minds.” Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the fort’s pulse is rewired, soldiers rewrite logbooks, Kael’s quill is “now a simple ornament”—a charged poise with visible social cost. No causal gaps; orientation is anchored by line 3; the final image reweights all prior glimmers.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The fort’s phosphorescent marble, glass roses, and mirrored shards are tactile tools: the roses refract faint light for stealth, the shards amplify the sundial code. Spatial choreography is clean—Kael slips from portal to tower to basement without drift. Sensory selection (visual pulse, quill clink, “winking hush”) mirrors the stealth stakes. Environment literally illuminates the rebellion’s path, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“awaken dormant minds without battle”—is signaled early and tightens through each encoded mark; the blackout clock heightens risk of detection. One meaningful deepening: when Kael slots the quill, the cradle’s invisible current rewrites the garrison’s thoughts, foreclosing the option of overt revolt. Cost is conceptual but legible: the fort’s loyalty circuitry is permanently rewired. Agency stays his; coincidence never rescues.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: soft light as covert power, beauty as insurgent tool. The cradle literalizes “ideas without fire”; the glass roses’ facets echo refracted dissent. No moral is stated; the final “quiet thunder” image reweights the blackout from silence to seedbed. Subtext in guards’ “secret smiles” is enough; ambiguity lingers about what ideas sprout, avoiding tidy truisms.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric, compressed, pattern-taught: “winking hush,” “phosphorescent pulse,” “quiet thunder” recur with shifting charge. Perceptual signature is Kael’s—angles, glimmers, constellations—never touristic. Rhythm modulates: longer clauses for calm decoding, staccato fragments (“clink softly”) for stealth. No dialogue, so no voice convergence; diction stays within a sentinel’s plausible lexicon. Elision (“slipping between corridors”) is strategic, paid off by the final lattice of light.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet limpid: “luminous fort…loomed like a sleeping giant” sets tonal metaphor then cedes to concrete action. No scaffold loops; each sentence adds either sensory precision or causal step. Figurative layering is high but patterned—light, pulse, spark—so coherence holds. Peak beat (“cascade of invisible currents”) avoids purple by anchoring in bodily effect: “fluttered through the fort’s veins.”</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The synthesis—twilight blackout + half-painted sundial + idea-igniting cradle—feels fresh yet inevitable. Tropes (sentinel, secret map, silent coup) are retooled through luminous architecture and cognitive rather than kinetic warfare. Specificity of glass roses, bronze quill, and phosphorescent marble prevents generic swap-out. Risk is taken: a revolution without a single spoken order, and it pays off in a replicable blueprint of light.</comment>
