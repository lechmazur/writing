<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority is lush and specific— “a tremor of grief” lodged in the visor’s reflection— but the inspector’s contradictory impulses (scientist vs. elegist) are asserted rather than dramatized in a single choice. His only visible micro-decision is to whisper a valediction, a beat that arrives late and feels safe rather than costly. Still, the voice-driven perception stays individual, never drifting into generic space-poet cliché, so the portraiture remains strong if not quite crucible-forged.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the shutter-click final image reweights the entire quest, turning archival duty into private grief. Causality is lyric-accumulative: each chemical, geological, and lunar cue stacks until the blackening film triggers the camera; the chain never breaks. Orientation is effortless—moonlit summit, visor, tripod planted by line 4—so the reader is anchored before the first hundred words elapse. The only drag is a 60-word reflective lull mid-text that slows rather than tightens, keeping the piece just shy of the 9-band.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The moonlit summit is not backdrop but protagonist: powdery basalt shifts under the tripod, the Earth-rise glare forces the inspector to recalibrate his stance, and the chemical plume becomes the final “ghost.” Every sensory pick is filtered through occupational bias—he notes lens pedigree and silver-nitrate timing before he notices his own heartbeat—so the environment actively constraints tactics. This is setting-as-crank: without the razor-thin dawn window, the chemical trigger and emotional stakes collapse.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stakes are legible from the first sentence: capture the last grain before sunlight erases it. Pressure tightens once—the chemical bar blackens, the shutter must fire—and that single turn forecloses all retry options. Cost is present (the grain will be “reclaimed by colonies”), yet the inspector neither sacrifices nor risks anything personal; the price is borne by the object, not the agent. Sufficient escalation for this length, but the absence of a lived-body trade-off caps the tension just below the top tier.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges as the paradox of archival permanence achieved through inevitable loss: the photograph preserves what it dooms by exposing it to light. No character ever utters a thesis; the idea is woven through the darkening film strip, the rover-forgotten cavity, the colony expansion. The final whispered blessing is a gesture, not a moral, leaving a resonant aftertaste of noble futility. Complexity is honored—the universe “receives the offering” yet remains indifferent—so the piece avoids pat conclusion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Voice is crystalline, low-frequency, and science-haunted: “powdery basalt,” “nascent Earth sunrise,” “chemical vapor like a ghost.” Syntax lengthens and breathes to mimic the dawning hush, then fractures into staccato clicks at the moment of capture. No head-hop, no filter-verb clutter; perceptual signature is consistent—he sees the world as exposure times and focal lengths. Minor dock for one ornamental adjective string (“soft gold and lingering shadows”) that briefly prettifies rather than reveals.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Line-level craft is near-flawless: every sentence either advances the chemical countdown, textures the lunar surface, or sharpens the inspector’s inner calibration. Metaphors are spare and precise—visor “reflecting the thin silver glow”—never competing with the physics. No scaffold loops, no synonym churn, no register drift; the one audible alliteration (“breath of the world before sunrise”) is earned by thematic resonance. Read-aloud rhythm accelerates into the final click, then exhales with the descending footsteps, mirroring heartbeat and exposure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>The fresh angle is treating lunar exploration not as conquest but as elegiac archiving; the hourglass grain is a reversal of time’s usual flow, bottling unspent midnights. The chemical-trigger camera repurposes 19th-century wet-plate poetics inside a hard-SF suit, a synthesis that feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk is taken in the lyric, near-prose-poem cadence, yet coherence is maintained. The concept doesn’t push past the 9-line because the emotional arc—lonely guardian preserves doomed relic—maps closely to other eco-elegies; the lunar skin is new, the skeleton recognizable.</comment>
