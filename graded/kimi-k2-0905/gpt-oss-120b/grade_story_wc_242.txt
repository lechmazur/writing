<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Mara’s isolation and mission are stated rather than dramatized; we never see her hesitate, sacrifice, or risk anything concrete. The interior contradiction between estrangement and communion is asserted, not embodied in a beat where she must choose. The final “stepping out” is symbolic but cost-free on the page, so the arc feels observed, not earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each new caller layers the disc’s loop, tightening the pattern until the tunnel itself “breathes” the cadence—an effective Resonant Reconfiguration. Orientation is swift and spatially steady. The only causal gap: Mara’s decision to leave the booth is unmotivated by any preceding pressure or forfeiture, so the closure carries conceptual but not felt cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The tunnel’s damp, rusted conduits and the glass disc’s firefly glints are filtered through Mara’s tuned-out attention, making the setting both external landscape and emotional tuning fork. The disc reappears with shifting light at each loop, charging the final image. One minor over-description: “ghostly arpeggios looping back on themselves like a question without answer” repeats the same idea in adjacent clauses.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether estrangement can become connection—tightens as each wrong-number voice thickens the loop. Pressure escalates texturally: the disc’s tone grows denser, the tunnel “breathes softer,” implying stakes without raising external jeopardy. Because Mara faces no concrete trade-off, the cost remains atmospheric rather than viscerally felt.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly: endings are raw material for beginnings if someone listens long enough to re-loop grief into song. The disc’s accumulating voices make the abstraction audible. The final “Thank you” whispered by an unheard speaker offers a quiet Conceptual Repricing that reweights isolation as communal resonance—effective, though Mara’s own change is still off-stage.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Mara’s selective ear: she notices drips, neon flickers, and harmonic overtones, never slipping into tourist catalog. Syntax lengthens and shortens with the loop’s inhale-exhale rhythm. One register drift: “cultivated estrangement” and “conceptual repricing” read like craft-shop labels rather than a tunnel-dweller’s idiom.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is musical—varied cadence, strong verbs (“the concrete itself recognized a new cadence”)—but leans on ghostly/haunted modifiers in adjacent sentences, creating a faint echo loop. No scaffolding or paraphrase loops obscure causality. The final clause “promise etched into the very walls” is elegant yet slightly abstract; a tactile image would sharpen closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The wrong-number harmonica hotline is a fresh synthesis; the glass disc as analog sampler of grief feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk is taken with a nearly static scene, but the accumulative design justifies it. The concept would collapse if relocated above ground or swapped for a jukebox, proving irreplaceability.</comment>
