<comment>Mara’s interiority is vivid—cataloguing dreams like weather charts—but the “empirically whimsical” trait is named more than dramatized; her final incantation feels slightly unearned because the prior beat shows translation of symbols but not a visible moment where her empirical side clashes with whimsy. The earned micro-choice is the whispered incantation, yet the cost (luminous doubt) is stated rather than embodied in gesture or sacrifice. Flaw is minor: the contradiction is present but not sharpened under pressure.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the seed sprouts and the ridge exhales stories, reweighting meaning with undeniable conceptual cost—collective memory is now a living conduit. Causal chain holds: each translated dream symbol brightens the lanterns, tightening toward the sprout. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) is clear by word 40. One scaffold loop—“the seed would only sprout before the monsoon arrives” repeated in paraphrase—slightly dulls momentum but does not touch the final image.</comment>

<comment>The ridge in bloom functions as micro-setting that constrains the ritual: jade vines = river map, orchid pulse = festival rhythm, petals = lost names—each detail is re-used to translate dream into anchor, directly enabling the sprout. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven (citrus-rain air, phosphorescent lanterns). Final image—amber blossom exhaling old stories—charges the closure. No spatial drift. Gate met: environment shapes tactics and final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—protect cultural memory via seed before monsoon—is signaled early and tightens perceptibly: each symbolic translation brightens lanterns, visibly raising odds of success. Agency is internal (symbolic decoding) but forecloses alternative paths—she can’t force sprout, only prepare. Cost is conceptual but legible: luminous doubt that storm may drown shoots. One meaningful deepening suffices; no reversal required. Coincidence absent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: empirical rigor + communal dream = living archive. No explicit thesis; final amber blossom is non-literal answer. Subtext resides in lantern glow as empirical confirmation of myth. No final-paragraph moral. One near-echo—“let the rain hear our story before it falls”—skirts thematic statement but arrives as ritual speech, not authorial nudge. Resonance lingers: memory must be planted before storm.</comment>

<comment>Third-person lyric achieves consistent perceptual signature: Mara notices world as data-set (petal=ledger entry, vine=tributary map). Rhythm modulates—long sentences for dream drift, clipped noun-phrases during translation. No head-hopping; distance stable. Diction stays within lexicon of island chronicler. Filter verbs used sparingly and voice-motivated. Final incantation cadence mirrors earlier dream fragments, showing taught pattern payoff.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Strong information density: single sentences fuse sensory, symbolic, and plot work (“lanterns…flickering like questions in a bright hall of doubt”). One paraphrase loop on monsoon deadline noted above costs −0.2. Mixed metaphors avoided; vehicles stay physical. No template cadence. Final third clean—no artifacts touch closure. Read-aloud rhythm varied. Minor hedge: “tasted of citrus and rain” could compress, but does not stall beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Premise—reality-checking scholars who test myth against stone—feels fresh and fully committed; knowledge fruit that feeds ideas instead of sugar is specific, not quirky ornament. Synthesis of empirical method with communal dream logic is non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Transformation test passes: remove island rules and story collapses. Risk in lyric accumulative structure pays off—closure image reconfigures meaning without explanatory dump. No close echoes of famous scenes.</comment>
