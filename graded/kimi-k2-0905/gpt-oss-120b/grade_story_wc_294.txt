<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Arlen’s polished calm is repeatedly embodied (steady lantern, twilight over arena) and drives his micro-choice to pin foreign bills as territorial markers; the final pocketing of the euro converts paternal legacy into quiet purpose with felt cost. Interior contradiction flickers only once—doubts whispered after funding—yet remains abstract; more embodied tension under pressure would lift the score. The renunciation of LoopForge’s loop-logic is earned, but the emotional price is implied rather than viscerally dramatized on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Causal lens holds: because Arlen’s calm dissuades Maya, the algorithm reroutes; therefore the startup’s arc peaks and crashes, and he returns to the train. Closure lands in the pocketed euro + dawn walk—an Earned Stasis that reweights legacy with visible cost. Orientation is clean within 120 words; no teleporting props. One soft spot: the crash is compressed into one sentence; a single concrete beat of server stall or investor flight would tighten causality to 9+.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The abandoned circus train is not postcard backdrop—its cracked wagons and faded banners constrain where Arlen can place markers, and the final dusky amber light through broken windows charges the Earned Stasis. Foreign bills as micro-setting objects are handled tactilely (pinned, fluttering, pocketed) and directly shape algorithm boundaries. Spatial choreography is flawless: first-, second-, third-car bill sequence tracks cleanly. One hairline slip: “dusky harmony” is used four times; trimming one would perfect specificity.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—loop vs. new horizon—is signaled early and tightens when Arlen dissuades Maya, foreclosing creative-route expansion; the startup’s crash then externalizes that cost. Pressure escalates under causal lens: each pinned bill narrows the map’s possibility space. Visible price is legible (foreign notes left fluttering after crash), though the beat is brief. A mid-scene micro-reversal—Maya’s protest met by calm refusal—suffices for this length; no further reversal required.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from particulars: looping data vs. looping train vs. looping legacy, all charged by the final image of Arlen walking toward a new co-working space—an exit turned entrance. No overt moralizing; the pocketed euro reweights “circles are not failures” without stating it. Foreign bills and circus safety-rails braid into a quiet meditation on measured hope. Resonance lingers because the concept of circularity is repriced, not lectured.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Arlen’s perceptual signature: scents of distant ports, lantern-calm, dusky harmony. Syntax mirrors his cadence—measured clauses, no frantic fragments—until dawn walk where shorter sentences signal forward motion. No head-hopping; Maya’s interior is inferred only through Arlen’s reading of her protest. Distinct idiom is sustained; only “digital territorial markers” drifts toward corporate register, but the phrase is immediately re-grounded by the tactile pinning of franc, yen, peso.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, high-density: single sentences often do double duty (“the office…resonated with a dusky harmony that matched his own calm”). No loops or scaffold; metaphors stay consistent (lantern, twilight, arena). One mixed image—“gunfire dissolve into dust”—is fleeting. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image that re-charges markers. Filter verbs are sparse and voice-motivated. Minor: four “dusky” repeats; else variety is natural.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of startup cartography + circus-train safety rails + foreign bills as boundary glyphs is fresh, non-obvious, and inevitable in hindsight. Risk—using an abandoned circus train as physical algorithm interface—pays off because it constrains placement and reweights legacy. Transformation test fails if names/places swapped: the train’s rusted specificity and bill-collection idiosyncrasy are inseparable from Arlen’s calm. No template echo; avoids tech-bro cliché by routing tech through tactile childhood relics.</comment>
