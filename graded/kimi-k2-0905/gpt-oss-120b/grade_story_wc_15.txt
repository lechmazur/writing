<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Contradictory impulses (obedience to guild taboo vs. dream-urge to weave) surface only in abstract assertion, never dramatised in a single beat where she risks tangible reprisal; the “courage to break old laws” is declared, not tested. Interiority is lush but cycles the same lyric labels (“orchid solace,” “hauntingly optimistic”) instead of sharpening under rising risk. Final stance qualifies as Earned Stasis, yet the cost feels atmospheric rather than personal and specific.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a crystal-clear Resonant Reconfiguration: the labyrinth’s meaning flips from ruin to reverence via luminous sewn corridors, cost legible in the guildmasters’ humbled kneeling. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—each dream-stitch layers density until the pattern ruptures the prohibition. However, orientation of time and physical logic of the “overlapping sleepwalking paths” remain fuzzy past the 120-word mark; the waiver is not earned because the payoff does not resolve the disorientation, so −0.3 applied.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The red canyon walls, tide-pool absence, and narrow stone arch anchor spatially; the loom, illustration plate, and glowing yarn function as micro-settings that constrain choice (weaving is physically forbidden here). Sensory selection skews visual/orchid-perfume but stays filtered through weaver’s tide-focused perception. Environment passively mirrors mood; it does not actively complicate tactics except by taboo, keeping the score just below the 9-line where setting must shape the final image under pressure.</question>

<comment>Dominant stake—restore hope to a desiccated labyrinth—signals early and tightens through each stitched filament; escalation is Accumulative: empty tide-pool silence → luminous yarn veins → guildmasters humbled. Protagonist’s agency is continuous (every dream-step sews), but the visible price (risk of punishment, exhaustion, injury) is implied rather than dramatised, capping entry to the 8-band where cost must be unmistakable on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme of renewal through outlaw art emerges organically via stitched light overtaking cracked stone; no thesis is stated. Subtext of precedents breaking under soft insistence is embodied in the guildmasters’ silent kneel. Ambiguity lingers: will the tide ever return? Final sunrise-on-plate image reweights earlier emptiness with quiet awe, satisfying the non-literal answer test.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric voice sustains tide-and-loom cadence with tidal syntax of long swells and soft caesuras. Diction stays within weaver’s poetic register; no filter-verb clutter. Distinct perceptual signature—world viewed as weave, colour as orchid, silence as song—remains coherent. Minor over-petting of “orchid solace” and “hauntingly optimistic” keeps it just sub-9.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm breathes with scene pauses; sentence openings vary; no loops or paraphrase clusters. Metaphors stay physically coherent (tide, yarn, frost veins). Occasional modifier stacks (“hauntingly optimistic lullaby,” “orchid veins in frost”) border purple but serve voice, so −0.2 only. Dense information per sentence; final line lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The concept of sleepwalking-weaving contraband light into unyielding stone feels fresh; familiar “artist vs. decree” trope is rethreaded through loom-and-labyrinth physicality impossible elsewhere. Specificity of illustration plate absorbing dream-veins and guiding future pilgrims is memorable. Risky lyric accumulation succeeds without breaking clarity, meriting the bonus +0.3.</comment>
