<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is poetic but abstract; her contradictions are declared (“quietly inspired”) rather than embodied in gesture. The micro-choice to pour sand into the jar is present, yet the cost—risk of losing the echo or herself—is only implied, not felt. No genuine flaw complicates the turn; she succeeds without visible trade-off, so the arc leans inspirational rather than crucible-forged.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the final bridge of sand reweights the prophecy rule-set, making time-reversal a lived social cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of button → echo match tightens meaningfully. One scaffold loop—“the truth unravels” repeated twice—blurs cadence, keeping it shy of 8.0 purity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The amber walls, buttons, and jar form a micro-setting that actively constrains every beat; button placement literally reshapes the echo’s song. Sensory hierarchy is POV-tight—Mara notices dust weight, sunrise seal, metal warmth—never tourist catalog. Spatial choreography is flawless: buttons move from floor → map → river pattern → echo discharge, all tracked beat-by-beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—decode prophecy or time stays scrambled—is signaled early and tightens once: the echo-jar demands buttons to speak. Escalation is Accumulative: each matched button increases sonic density until the warehouse roars. Price is conceptual rather than visceral; no personal injury or social loss is risked, so cost stays legible but abstract.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from pattern: collective memory (buttons) + living echo = time is communal, not linear. No explicit moral; final image of sand-bridge lets reader feel the re-weighting. Subtext in button engravings (“cliffs will listen”) reconfigures prophecy without stating thesis. Minor drift: “shared wisdom” is named once, but the choral grain-song afterward earns the abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person lyric voice sustains amber, canyon, hourglass diction without purple overload. Perceptual signature is consistent: Mara’s attention gravitates to seams, glow, metallic whispers—never generic. Rhythm modulates: short declaratives under pressure (“She stepped onto it”) against longer incantatory rolls. Zero head-hopping; POV distance holds.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density: single sentences fuse sensorium + action (“amber walls breathed slow glow”). One paraphrase loop—“the truth unravels” twice—costs −0.2; no mixed metaphors. Strong verbs throughout—“jar sang,” “cliffs listened”—avoid nominalization bloat. Final line achieves charged poise without explanatory tag.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: prophecy decoding via antique buttons + bottled canyon echo is non-obvious and inevitable in hindsight. Risk in treating time as choral sand pays off: reader feels the world rewrite itself. No trope patching; hourglass turner becomes communal conductor, not stock mystic. Specificity of sunrise-seal on jar keeps concept from drifting into generic magic.</comment>
