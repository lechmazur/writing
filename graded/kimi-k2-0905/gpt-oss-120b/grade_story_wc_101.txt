<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority stays concrete—she listens “beneath the terra-cotta arbor,” rings the bell only after candles are snuffed, and feels responsibility “settle on her shoulders.” These embodied beats anchor her motive to feed mouths without drawing patrols. No secondary character exerts live pressure, so the crucible is her own endurance; the choice to keep the bell ringing is earned yet not reversed, so the arc is slight but credible. Hairline slip: “amplified quiet” repeats four times without new contradiction, blunting inner voice at the end.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the final dawn image reweights the bell’s echo into a promise that sanctions cannot silence. The causal chain—sanctions → anonymous donations → bell signal → volunteers → next sunrise—tightens once but cleanly. Orientation anchor (ridge, dawn, exile settlement) appears by line 4; no debt. Cost is felt in the “growing number of mouths” and the bell’s lone nightly toll, a audible price that persists. Lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern holds without contradiction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Terra-cotta arbor, hollow at its base, and moonlit bell create a micro-setting that constrains every move: donations must fit the hollow, sound must travel through trees, ridge blocks patrol sightlines. Sensory triage is POV-driven—Mara hears “amplified quiet,” sees “faint moonlight” on silver, never wastes a beat on postcard vistas. Weather is absent but irrelevant; spatial choreography keeps volunteers disappearing “into the darkness” while Mara stays anchored. The arbor’s clay crown returns in the final image, charging closure.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—feed mouths unseen—declared early; pressure escalates by accumulation: each donated sack ups the risk if patrols hear the bell. No reversal, but one meaningful deepening: children now carry sacks, tying knots, proving the chain will outlive elders. Agency is Mara’s persistence in ringing, not a single decisive act; cost is the nightly exposure of the bell tone. Coincidence absent; escalation coherent under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</question>
<comment>Theme of mutual aid under siege emerges through concrete particulars—brown paper, single straw, bell’s low tone—never thesis-speak. Subtext lives in silence: packages bear “no name ever appeared,” yet everyone knows they are fed. Final image reframes bell echo as lullaby, reweighting quiet from threat to promise. No moral summary; resonance lingers in sensory echo.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Mara; perceptual signature filters setting through her risk-ear—“amplified quiet,” “secret heartbeat.” Syntax lengthens in calm dawn, shortens at midnight beat: “She rang once.” No dialogue, so voice must carry texture; diction stays within her plausible lexicon. One softening tic: “gently persistent rhythm” is repeated twice; otherwise rhythm modulates with scene heat.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</question>
<comment>Read-aloud cadence varies; paragraph cuts are purposeful—each advances bell, sack, or ridge image. No scaffold loops, but “amplified quiet”/“quiet knowledge” nudges synonym churn. Figurative language stays physical—“curled like smoke”—and coherent. Information density high; no line summarizable without loss.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: sanctions-era exile commune sustained by anonymous night-runs and a single silver bell as both signal and lullaby. Risk is quiet而非戏剧化 yet holds. The bell’s dual role—tool and metaphor—feels inevitable, not gimmick. Derivative notes: “fireflies” lanterns, “spine” ridge; still, the whole is specific enough to resist swap test.</comment>
