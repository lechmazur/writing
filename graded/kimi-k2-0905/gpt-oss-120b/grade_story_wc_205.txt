<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira’s “burnished sorrow” and her pivot from insurrectionist to myth-maker are vivid and embodied; contradictory impulses (triumph/regret, loss/creation) braid through every micro-choice. The shard-in-pocket final gesture crystallizes a credible renunciation—her revolution now lives in reflected light, not rifles. Only the absence of another on-page character keeps this from full crucible pressure; the interior arc is otherwise complete and earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a luminous Conceptual Repricing: the shard’s refracted light rewrites the asteroid’s DNA while Lira pockets its sliver as perpetual cost. The “time-becomes-visible” ellipse is taught early, paid off when the storm-mirror mosaic irreversibly frescoes the halls. Causality is lyric but legible—because she covers the mirrors, therefore the elders’ dispute dissolves into collaborative chorus. The persistent constraint is that every future visitor carries away literal fragments of the story; the ending image hums with that ongoing price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>“Baroque asteroid” is no postcard: copper spires, marble arches, and mirrored observatory actively constrain tactics—without the storm-lit mirrors the cultural rewrite fails. Micro-setting is the shard itself, whose refracting edge becomes compass and scalpel for civilization. Sensory hierarchy skews visual, yet the aurora-silver rain and final pocketed fragment anchor tactile reality. The setting’s gilded decay mirrors Lira’s internal corrosion, charging the final frescoes with reciprocal loss.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><pressure>Pressure is single-track: will the shard be weapon or prism? Escalation arrives with the storm’s timed veil—covering the mirrors is the one irreversible gamble that forecloses retreat. Cost is visible: the elders surrender their origin myths to shared light, and Lira’s rebellion is permanently converted from arms to artifacts. The tightening is accumulative rather than causal, but the final refraction reweights the stake with unmistakable price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</question><grade><comment>Theme emerges refractively: stories are shattered vessels whose fractures refract brighter futures. No moral is stated; the final image of pocketed glass reconfigures “revolution” as portable, fragile light. “Burnished sorrow” is the tonal constant—loss and possibility alloyed—yet the piece resists sentimentality by keeping every insight anchored to shard-light on stone. The reader leaves with the after-image that civilizations are rewritten one angled glint at a time.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person lyric hovers at shallow psychic distance, filtering nebula and hymn-etched marble through Lira’s poet-eye without purple drift. Syntax swells and contracts with storm tempo; fragments like “burnished sorrow” recur as mantra yet avoid template cadence. Dialogue is absent, so voice distinction is internal—her verses stitch collapsing worlds, a diction no elder could utter. The final whispered vow sustains the rhythmic crest without head-hop or register slip.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is compressed cathedral: every sentence refracts twin jobs—image and stakes—without scaffold. Metaphors (gilded relic, mirrored rain) stay internally coherent and physics-loyal. Zero filter-verb stacks; strong verbs (“etched,” “stitch,” “reecho”) carry motion. The closing line’s “asteroid seemed to inhale” risks personification, but the breath is Lira’s, so the image holds.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The shard-as-renewal engine is fresh, yet the deeper risk is turning astronomical mirrors into a cultural printing press—an inversion that feels inevitable once seen. Baroque asteroid plus visible-time storm plus poet-revolutionary synthesizes a singular aesthetic organism; swap any part and the fresco fails. The burnished-sorrow tone subverts the usual triumph-of-art trope by keeping loss soldered to creation. This is not “rebel redeems self through art” but “rebel accepts that art is slower, sharper civil war.”</comment>
