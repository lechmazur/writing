<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Interiority is lush but diffuse; “half-remembered maps” and “stitched feathers” evoke wonder yet never sharpen into contradictory impulse. No micro-choice under pressure shows flaw or cost; the garden quest is accepted without resistance or trade-off. Voice is singular, but the absence of visible error or sacrifice keeps the arc below 7.0.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of ink-river, blooming verbs, and glowing card reweights meaning at close. Orientation is taught by deliberate fog-disorientation that pays off when bay reveals fleet; no penalty. Closure is a Charged Poise—garden found, fleet waiting—felt cost is the eternal custodian burden now assumed; lens holds cleanly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Carnival ship, cracked mirrors, ink-river, and name-flowers are tactile, lived-in, and constrain action (card slot, portal dive). Fog-bay and garden each evolve with plot; no static tour. One cap: the bay’s spatial logic (distances, deck layout) is briefly floated during carousel pirouette, preventing 9.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—recover lost names—signaled early; pressure tightens when ink-river threatens to erase verses. Agency visible: she threads, dives, nets, assembles; each step forfeits passivity. No secondary loss (tool, wound) on-page, so cost is conceptual not visceral; caps ascent to high 7s.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Theme of reclamation-through-story emerges via mosaic of ink, mirrors, and petal-portals; no authorial thesis stated. Final image of lantern-fleet implies custodian eternity without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers: is she savior or condemned cataloguer? Complexity maintained, but earlier abstract “trapped freedom” phrase is a light echo-hit (−0.2).</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric close-distance stable throughout. Perceptual signature is synesthetic-eclectic: “rusted chains of light,” “storybook water” — idiosyncratic, consistent. Syntax flexes with cadence of carousel music; no head-hopping. One hairline slip: “freedom can be both cage and wind” edges aphoristic, but fits accumulative lens and is earned by imagistic context.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>High figurative density almost every sentence; pattern is taught early (“mist clung,” “stitched feathers”) and justified by lyric mode, so −0.3 not −0.7. Mixed metaphors rare; “rusted chains of light” is coherent. One scaffold: “echoed with the sound of a distant carousel music” could compress to “distant carousel music echoed.” Closure line clean, so remains above 7.5.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: maritime ghost-carnival + ink-river + etymological garden. Conceptual risk of non-linear mosaic paid off by coherent closure. Mirrors-as-past-fragments and name-petals feel inevitable in hindsight. Slight over-familiarity of “abandoned carnival” trope prevents 9.0, but transformation via language-physics is distinctive.</comment>
