<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Mara’s obsession with night-blooming flowers is concrete and childhood-anchored, giving her a sharp interior contradiction between wonder and winter-doubt. The postcards function as an embodied memory-tool, charging every beat inside the cathedral; her micro-choice to align one postcard with the glass triggers the climactic vision. The tears and “new rhythm” show earned emotional shift, though the hush/bloom metaphor is stated more than dramatized. Internal conflict is present but softened by lyric summary rather than a gritty, costly decision.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the cathedral prism reweights the world’s rule—night blooming is a communal promise, not a mystery to solve—leaving Mara in Charged Poise with the cost being her surrendered skepticism. Causality holds under Accumulative/Textural lens: each postcard adds refractive memory-density until the glass garden ignites. Orientation is clean inside 120 words; single transition from pavilion to cathedral is legible. One soft spot: the “bridge” mechanism is asserted rather than shown in mid-action, slightly blurring the therefore linkage.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Amber light, cracked panes, and phosphorescent petals are sensory and selective, never touristic; the body is present via vibrating stone under soles. The postcard-glass alignment is a micro-setting/tool that literally refracts choice and charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate. Cathedral spatial logic—cavity, lenses, spectrum—remains coherent. Minor slack: “autumn’s amber scent” is a stock synesthesia; still, environment constrains perception throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“will the night flower answer repay her lifelong doubt?”—is signaled early and tightens when the glass must respond to the postcard. Escalation is textural: each sepia face adds refractive pressure until the hidden garden pulsing with her heartbeat forces stance crystallization. Cost is conceptual (winter-doubt surrendered) rather than visceral, but legible in the final image. No false cliffhangers; coincidence merely reveals, never rescues.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges without sermon: night blooming as communal promise reframes solitude into shared continuum. Subtext lives in glass layers—what looks opaque can transmit memory if aligned. Final image reweights “dawning hush” from silence to pledge, achieving conceptual repricing. One hedge: the word “promise” is uttered narratively near the end; though earned, it flirts with overt statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Mara’s perceptual filter—light, glass, heartbeat—without head-hop. Syntax flexes from elongated sensory clauses to short, pulse-like fragments under revelation. Diction remains within arts-and-cathedral lexicon: “sepia,” “phosphorescent,” “umbral,” all character-plausible. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk zero. Filter verbs (“she felt”) are sparse and rhythm-motivated, not diluting.</question>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm alternates fluid cadence with crystalline fragments; no template churn detected. Metaphors stay physically coherent—glass waterfall, silver threads—avoiding mixed vehicles. One paraphrase loop: “quiet fire… amber light… amber scent” within two sentences; minor, does not touch closure. High information density in single-line paragraph transitions; no scaffolding nouns.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Night-bloom quest reframed as collective memory optics is fresh; postcard-glass alignment device is non-obvious and inevitable in hindsight. “Etched glass cathedral revealing hidden garden” could slide toward trope, but the refraction physics and 1920s postcard specificity transform it. Risk taken with lyric accumulative structure rather than causal plot, paid off by resonant closure. Slight proximity to magical-artist subgenre keeps it from topping 9.0.</comment>
