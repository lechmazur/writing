<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Mara’s contradictory interiority—carving lightness while emotionally void—plays in-scene and drives every beat; the blank-face device externalizes her detachment and the mandate’s pressure without over-labeling. Her final smile is an earned, ambiguous renunciation that costs her any public affect, foreclosing both rebellion and compliance. The one flaw is that the bouquet’s cost is more asserted than bodily felt; still, the micro-choices around cedar shavings keep motive legible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the baton and bouquet crystallize a new hush that reweights the mandate’s rules without breaking them. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each shaving thickens the pattern until the final cadence shift. Cost is visible in the last image: “a silence that now seemed less imposed and more chosen.” No orientation debt; turbine shadows and kitchen anchor by word 60.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Wind-turbine shadows act as living set, rhythmically slicing the floor and forcing Mara to time her strokes; the cedar block literally constrains how thin the baton can go, charging the final image. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: she smells decay, hears low hymn, sees only what the blades let through. Micro-setting (cedar, bouquet, cracked porch) repeatedly alters her tactics; no static postcard filler.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can grief breathe inside forced joy?—tightens once: the baton’s completion narrows Mara’s options to private hush or public smile. Agency is purely gestural and narrative, yet the cost is felt: she forfeits overt resistance. No reversal, but the deepening cadence reweights the stake under Accumulative lens; turbine speed mirrors the internal intensification.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges obliquely: art as covert grief-work inside a happiness regime. The final image reframes prior motifs—shavings as “whispers,” bouquet as archived decay—without moral statement. Ambiguity is purposeful: reader must decide if the baton is tool, trophy, or tombstone. Minor deduction for one line that nears thematic echo: “a silence that honored both joy and grief.”</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Narrative voice stays in tight third, filtered through Mara’s numb perceptual signature: blades are “indifferent giants,” shavings “snow in a world that no longer remembered winter.” Syntax lengthens and contracts with carving strokes, creating rhythmic propulsion. No head-hopping; diction remains within her plausible lexicon. The theatrical narration is motivated character behavior, not writerly intrusion.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and imagistic yet avoids purple overload; figurative language is patterned early and paid off. One scaffold ripple: “carving a path for lightness” is echoed three clauses later—“carving light from sorrow”—but the variation rescues it. No mixed metaphors, no filter-verb stacks. Final line earns its lift: “leaving the world a little less empty.”</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Familiar dystopian trope (affect control) is re-angled through tactile micro-resistance: whittling as illegal grief. Cedar shavings replacing banned snow is specific and memorable. Risk—static theater-for-one—pays off because the turbines keep external pressure alive. Not quite 9 because the happiness mandate remains abstract backdrop rather than lived contradiction.</comment>
