<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara’s perceptual gift is concrete—dust patterns, mirror glints, mainspring pulse—but her interiority stays external. We see her act and notice, yet never learn why ghosts matter personally; the only cost is a “feather-light” gratitude that feels weightless rather than priced. The ledger retrieval changes nothing about her tactics or self-concept; it merely rewards attention. Competence is vivid, but contradiction and genuine struggle are missing.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative-textural lens: dust-to-diagram, barrel-to-heartbeat, ledger-to-acknowledgment. Closure is a Charged Poise—the attic hatch silhouette stays open, ghost gratitude settled—so cost is atmospheric, not personal. Orientation is clear by line 15; transitions are smooth. The beat sequence is discovery→mapping→retrieval, each layer thickening texture rather than narrowing options, and the final image reweights earlier motifs cleanly.</comment>

<comment>Ticket-office micro-ecology is tactile: rain-slick glass, sawdust breath, brass coil tremor. Mirrors, ladder, hatch, and ledger act as objects that constrain movement and frame the final glow. Spatial track across counter→ladder→attic keeps bodies and distances exact. Weather and decay directly enable the dust-diagram method, so environment shapes tactics and charges the closing silhouette.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“what ceilings hide”—is signaled early and pursued single-mindedly. Pressure escalates only by accretion: each new textual layer (dust map, mirror ghosts, ledger) deepens ambiance rather than threatening or foreclosing. Agency is pure observation; no live option is sacrificed, no price is exacted from Mara. Consequently, tension is atmospheric, not consequential; the tightening is poetic, not strategic.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Theme of acknowledgement versus erosio emerges implicitly through found ledger and ghost chorus. No moral is stated; resonance rests in the attic hatch left aglow. Subtext is carried by object gestures—mainspring heartbeat, dust footprints—rather than articulated insight. Complexity is modest but cleanly organic to the accumulative pattern.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays strictly tethered to Mara’s sensorium: selective attention to fissures, brass tremor, perfume of decay. Syntax lengthens and compresses with ladder creaks and pulse ticks, giving prose a rhythmic signature. Diction favors mechanical precision (“horologist’s mainspring barrel,” “lattice of decayed canvas”) that feels vocation-true. No head-hop or register drift; voice is consistent and atmospheric.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm alternates fluidly; clauses breathe during discovery then tighten during hatch pry. Figurative language is selective—“marquee flapped like a tired animal”—and stays coherent. Minor scaffold: two “faint” repetitions within three lines; not intrusive enough to dull closure. High informational density: each sentence layers setting, tool, and spectral cue without paraphrase loops.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Combines elevator tech, ghost-seeing, and dust-pattern forensics—an unexpected synthesis that feels inevitable once launched. Circus-as-haunt is familiar, but the use of a mainspring barrel as ghost lantern + structural mapper is fresh micro-invention. Risk is moderate; concept commits fully without hedging. Specific detail—midnight-stopped clock face, brittle ledger ink—grounds novelty in sensory fact.</comment>
