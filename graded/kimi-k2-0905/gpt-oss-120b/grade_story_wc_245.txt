<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lira’s interior contradiction—yearning to map emotion yet denying sight—is dramatized in every beat: she douses with her ring, absorbs sorrow through skin, and finally renounces external cartography. The renunciation costs her the safety of known paths, shown when she turns back “toward the forest entrance” having internalized the stillpoint. No stock therapy-speak; emotions live in fingertip pulses and ring vibrations. Skin-language trait and ring-compass dowsing constrain every choice; the climax fuses them into a single harmonic chord whose price is permanent vulnerability to every tongue the forest breathes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Lira steps out of the stillpoint having forfeited detached observer status; the forest’s final sigh confirms the cost is felt. Accumulative lens holds—each ultrasonic note layers until the pure tone folds time. The “quiet blaze of inner light” image unmistakably reweights earlier motifs. No orientation debt; anchors clear at word 40. Minor deduction: stillpoint mechanics remain slightly abstract, preventing 9+.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ultrasonic forest is not backdrop but active instrument: trees hum pathways, bark knots emit freeze-tone, ring vibrates in sympathy—each constrains her next step. Micro-setting collapses into the platinum ring and the wounded-oak bark she touches at climax; both objects re-charge the final image. Sensory hierarchy obeys blind POV—sound, touch, magnetic pull—never resorting to visual cheat. Spatial choreography immaculate: she “places her hand on the bark” exactly where the crescendo locks, aligning ring axis and stillpoint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—map interior emotion—tightens when the melody shifts to a single tone that forecloses retreat; she must touch the wounded oak or lose the trail forever. Cost is visible: absorption of forest sorrow through skin leaves her “mind a cartographer of inner realms,” a role she can neither renounce nor fully survive. Agency preserved throughout; ring dowsing and skin-language are her decisions, not gifts. One meaningful intensification suffices under Accumulative lens—pattern break at pure tone reweights all prior notes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete merges: languages dissolve into one chord, proving that empathy demands surrender of safe outsider stance. Final image—“trail of soft notes for any future traveler”—re-prices her victory: she becomes the map, not the mapper. No moralizing; insight stays inside the luminous pulse she carries. Subtext hums in ring’s meteor iron and forest’s sigh, never stated.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical third-person keeps perceptual signature blind: “world sang in frequencies too high for ordinary ears” filters everything through her skin-echo lexicon. Rhythm modulates—long liquid sentences swell with melody, then fracture at the freeze-tone. No filter-verb stacks; verbs are strong: “traced,” “absorbs,” “dowse.” No dialogue hence no contamination. Patterned elision (“the veil of sound”) is taught early and paid off at entry to stillpoint.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sentences perform double duty: “platinum compass ring that glowed faintly against her palm” anchors object, light source, and imminent cost in one clause. Zero paraphrase loops; each metaphor extends sonic logic—ring “resonates,” bark “crescendoed.” No register drift; diction stays within poetic fabula. Final line “horizon of her own becoming” risks abstraction but earns resonance by echoing “map of her soul” two beats earlier.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: blind cartographer + ultrasonic forest + emotion-absorbing skin feels inevitable yet unseen before. Stillpoint as folded-time emotion nexus reconfigures familiar quest-into-self trope without gimmick. Risk in lyric compression pays off—closure remains legible. Could swap names but not sensory grammar; specificity is baked into ring metal and bark note.</comment>
