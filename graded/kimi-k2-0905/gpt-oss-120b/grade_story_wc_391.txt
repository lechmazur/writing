<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara's interiority stays concrete—her “restrained wildness” is shown through quiet footfalls and the brass-compass gesture. The micro-choice to align the needle with the viaduct’s pulse crystallizes her stake and costs her prior restlessness. No contradictory impulse is dramatized in-scene, so the internal conflict is more asserted than embodied, holding this just below the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: moon-arc imagery layers until the cadence shift at apex moon hum. The closure is a Charged Poise—final silver line plus released tether—felt cost legible without exposition. Orientation anchored by word 40, transitions clean within the single shard. One causality micro-gap: the “rain” that magnetized the viaduct is never grounded in present weather logic, but the mis-step is outside the closure beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The frozen lake surface and basalt pillars constrain every move—ice must be crossed softly, compass set on steel lattice, breath visible. The brass compass re-appears as the charged final image, its needle aligned to the new rhythm. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven: Elara notices magnetic tremor before wind chill. No spatial drift; bodies and objects track cleanly in a 360° tableau.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—sculpt patience from impatience—tightens via moon-tracking density; each nightly pass deepens pattern recognition until the humming apex forecloses the option to quit. Cost is visible: she forfeits her prior “restless yearning” and accepts the lake’s slower heartbeat. No external antagonist needed; pressure is situational and coherent under the chosen lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the iterative moon paths rather than thesis statements—patience is shown as accumulated attention, not preached. Final image reweights the premise: the lake’s “patient eyes” retroactively re-illuminate every prior glimmer. Resonance is specific to ice, basalt, magnetism; abstractions avoided. No moralizing line mars the exit.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person POV stays tightly aligned to Elara’s perceptual filter; diction never exceeds a field-mapper’s lexicon. Rhythmic control mirrors content—long sentences for moon arcs, clipped fragments at magnetic surge. No head-hopping or filter-verb clutter. Brass compass functions as a rhythmic refrain, its metallic beat echoing the viaduct hum.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Figurative language is selective: only two metaphors per high-pressure beat, each extending the magnetic/ice conceit. Sentence variety supports breath and surge; no template cadence runs. One near-loop—“patient revolution” repeated at open and close—is earned thematic reprise, not scaffold. Clarity never buckles; information density remains high.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Fusion of planetary magnetism, lunar tracking, and emotional patience feels fresh yet inevitable. No pop-culture or workshop-template echoes detected. Risk lies in the lyric accumulative structure itself; the piece commits fully, never defaulting to causal plot for safety. Conceptual integrity intact—every metaphor is grounded in either steel, ice, or light.</comment>
