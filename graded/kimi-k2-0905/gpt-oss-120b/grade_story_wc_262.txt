<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Interiority is lush and poetic, but the crystal gazer remains a mystic cipher: no contradiction, flaw, or cost undercuts her calm mastery. Every action is serene success—no visible struggle, error, or emotional back-pressure—so the “earned” quality required for 9+ is missing. Her final whispered goodbye costs her nothing the reader can feel; the love simply floods in without price. At this length, a single visible fracture or risk would have humanized her and lifted the score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: each new image deepens the same emotional density rather than causing events. Closure is a lyrical Charged Poise—the river of light and audience of shadows—whose cost is conceptually legible (“unused love cascade”) even if not corporeally felt. However, no meaningful tightening or option foreclosure occurs; the story widens into transcendence rather than narrowing under pressure. Because the ending reconfigures meaning without a before/after choice, it satisfies RR but not DC, capping high-band entry.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Projection booth, velvet seats, rusted tin box—details are specific, sensory, and POV-filtered (“dust of forgotten reels swirled like slow snow”). The cinema architecture folds into the metaphysical labyrinth, so setting literally constrains the psychic search path. Micro-objects—wax-sealed letters, torn film strip—are handled repeatedly, their evolving state tracked (“celluloid frames melt into liquid light”). No orientational drift; space stays coherent even as it expands into galaxies inside her mind.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“where unused love is stored”—is signaled early but remains abstract; no concrete loss or ticking clock sharpens it. Pressure is atmospheric, not tactical: each discovery deepens aura rather than limiting options. Escalation is poetic accrual rather than a turning point that forecloses a path; therefore cost is conceptual, not viscerally felt. Sufficient for mid-band under Accumulative lens, but entry to 8+ requires a moment where a live option is sacrificed.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly: unexpressed affection as a cosmic archive waiting for retrieval. The refrain of “never mailed” good-byes and the final image of shadows applauding fuse personal and metaphysical registers without sermonizing. Ambiguity is purposeful—the gazer leaves humming, love still “unused” yet mobile—so the reader continues to weigh emotional hoarding versus release. Final chord resolves earlier musical motif, giving a non-literal answer that avoids tidy moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Third-person omniscient stays fixed on the gazer, yet diction is intoxicatingly her own: “cartographer mapping invisible continents,” “storm held in her throat.” Rhythm swells and subsides with the hush-thunder motif; syntax grows longer as space dilates, mirroring psychic expansion. No head-hopping or filter-verb clutter; perception is always her biased lens. Voice is the story’s engine; without it, the piece would collapse into mere symbol.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Almost every sentence layers image, sound, and motion; no paraphrase loops or synonym churn. Metaphors are audacious yet internally coherent (“river of memory” follows naturally from melted celluloid). A few stacked modifiers (“slow snow of forgotten reels”) flirt with purple, but they occur early in a low-pressure zone and establish tonal contract. Closure beat is clean, unpolluted by artifice, sustaining high-band eligibility.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Combines psychometry, cinema hauntology, and love-as-particle physics in a synthesis that feels fresh yet inevitable. Risk is high—lyric essay disguised as narrative—but commitment is absolute; no retreat to conventional scene or antagonist. “Unused love” as astronomical constellation re-weights familiar heartbreak trope. Could edge higher if a single causal constraint had been invented, but originality within lyric mode is already memorable.</comment>
