<question>1</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Mara’s calm indexer persona is vividly embodied in her micro-choices— aligning brass gears, noting ink hue shifts—yet her interior contradictions remain thin; the “tranquilly perceptive” label is repeated rather than dramatized. The final moment of stamping the charter slab carries earned cost, but the transition from private scholar to civic defender feels sketched rather than pressured. No secondary character applies live pressure, so relationship crucible tests are waived. Competence dominates over flaw, muting the necessary struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The causal chain is legible: indexer → hypothesis → vault → charter proven → city acts. Closure lands with Conceptual Repricing: the stamped glyph reweights civic memory. However, the blackout’s time pressure loosens after the first scene; once the council funds lights, urgency evaporates and the vault descent feels convenient rather than compelled. Stamp-cipher reveal is a late rule-add that the narrative retroactively justifies, not one seeded with visible constraint.</comment>

<comment>Sunken-library atmosphere is immersive: water-worn marble, rising parchment scent, lantern-amber dapples. Micro-setting—the stamp’s brass lattice—literally guides Mara to the vault, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial tracking is clean; no impossible moves. The surface council chamber, by contrast, is a white-room shrug; one sentence of civic décor would anchor the power shift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>Stakes are declared early: trace honest origins. Mid-story tightening arrives when the flood-is-sacrifice hypothesis risks ridicule, but the council accepts it without resistance, flattening escalation. The vault descent carries personal stake—her reputation—but no visible price (time, breath, injury) is spent on-page. Final civic protection feels like gift, not hard-won cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Theme—knowledge vs. myth—emerges through the stamp’s evolving meaning: heirloom → seal → cipher → charter key. The ending image of tidal-powered lights reframes “stillness” as active stewardship, a resonant reconfiguration. Yet the council’s frictionless agreement lets the moral question glide rather than bite. Subtext is present but not piercing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person POV stays tightly latched to Mara’s perceptual filter: “scent of old parchment rose like a mournful sigh” is indexer-specific synesthesia. Syntax modulates with pressure—short clauses during vault descent, longer rhythmic piles while cataloguing. No head-hop or register drift. Dialogue is absent, so voice distinction across speech is waived; internal voice remains coherent and textured.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, vivid, and largely loop-free; however, “dappled resolve” recurs four times, creating template cadence that dulls the final paragraph. Mixed metaphors (“quiet proof,” “tangible foundation”) stack in closure beat, slightly blurring the image. Information density is high; every sentence advances cataloguing or myth-testing. Minor scaffold sentences appear (“She was tranquilly perceptive…”) but do not obscure causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>The submerged archive + indexer frame is fresh, and the stamp-cipher vault twist feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk is taken—lyric accumulation rather than confrontation—but the council’s instant funding softens the societal edge. Specificity of drowned-scribe poetry cross-referenced against sea-charts grounds the concept. Could swap city names without breaking arc, so transformation is partial.</comment>
