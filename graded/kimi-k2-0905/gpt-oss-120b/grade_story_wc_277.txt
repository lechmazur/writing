<question>1</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Mira’s desire to uncover truth is declared early and re-iterated, yet her interiority stays generic (“feeling its weight like a secret waiting to be inked”) and never contradicts itself; the rosewood nib is fondled but never forces a hard trade-off, so the promised heir’s legacy never complicates her choices. The closing hand-off to the journalist is the first moment of visible cost, but it is sprung late and feels like a gracious gesture rather than a compelled loss. No contradictory impulse is staged in scene; therefore endurance is not “earned,” merely asserted.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The causal spine holds: journalist’s call → Mira climbs → nib-actuated console → ledger located → hand-off; each step follows cleanly. Orientation is clear within 120 words, but the ledger’s sudden appearance as an already-solved encryption inside the archives softens the decisive change; the cost (risk to Mira or the paper empire) is implied, not dramatized. Closure qualifies as Conceptual Repricing, yet the repricing is narrated rather than felt on the body or resources, so the lens stays Hybrid-Accumulative rather than fully Causal under pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Observatory is sketched with selective, echoing, glass-and-steel detail; telescope pipes “hummed with a low resonance that reminded her of the rustle of newspaper pages” tightly fuses profession to place. Spatial choreography is clean: stair, dome, console, slot remain trackable. Weather (“soft pewter,” “pale clouds”) mirrors theme without overt symbol; the environment does not physically obstruct or resource Mira, so it enriches rather than constrains—hence the 9+ gate for environmental constraint is not tripped, capping at 8.8.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—“find the ledger or the city stays complicit”—is announced early; pressure escalates only once, when the console accepts the nib and projects the lattice. The tightening is intellectual (hypothesis proven) rather than physical or social; no resource is spent, no door slammed shut. Consequently the cost is conceptual, legible but abstract; the absence of a tangible price keeps the escalation below the 8+ band where visible cost is required.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Theme—truth as corrective gravity—emerges through the “orbits of regret” hologram and the nib’s lineage; no moral is stated, yet the idea is repeatedly named rather than dramatized in conflicting actions. Subtext is thin: the journalist’s arrival carries no hidden agenda, Mira betrays no mixed motive. The closing image of sky “turning the pages of a fresh edition” is resonant but arrives as a single metaphoric lift; complexity is suggested, not tested through character contradiction.</comment>

<comment>Voice is lush, rhythmic, and consistent: long sentences swirl like dome-light, then compress for chimes and slots. Diction (“soft pewter,” “solemn yet playful”) stays within an educated, literary register appropriate to an heiress-poet. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is stable—“ink once fell like rain on dead stories” colors every noticed surface. Minor over-modification in the climax (“solemn playfulness that made the weight of responsibility feel like a mischievous jest”) slightly blunts immediacy, but cadence control remains impressive under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm is fluid; sentence variety strong. However, metaphor density reaches nearly every sentence in the climax block (“floating thought,” “ink…rain,” “orbits of regret”) without pattern payoff, triggering −0.5. Occasional scaffold phrases (“a method that turned assumptions inside out until only truth remained”) summarize what the action already shows. No typos or pronoun drift, but the lyric overlay occasionally obscures precise causality; still, closure image is clear, so cap sits mid-7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fusing investigative journalism with astronomical metaphor and formal-logic method is fresh; the “orbits of regret” hologram literalizes moral bookkeeping via celestial mechanics. The nib-as-decryption-key transforms a heritage prop into an active cipher, avoiding mere nostalgia. Risky lyric compression is mostly earned; no obvious pop-culture or workshop template echoes. While the core plot (hidden ledger topples corruption) is familiar, the conceptual packaging and tonal tightrope walk feel idiosyncratic and memorable.</comment>
