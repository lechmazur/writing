<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The bellhop’s muteness is a strong external constraint, but his interiority is only gestured at through ritual (placing the bolt). Guests remain a blurred collective; no individual micro-choices under pressure. The earned stance—accepting silence as safety’s price—is present but distributed across a group, softening personal cost. Interior contradiction and embodied emotion are implied rather than dramatized in a single character.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the copper shimmer re-weights silence from menace to covenant. Accumulative lens holds: bolt → discoloration → copper glow re-codes safety as acquiescence. Cost is legible in the final image (“willingness to bear silence”). Orientation (who/where/when) is tacit but inferable by 120 words; no penalty. Causality is lyric rather than event-driven, appropriate to chosen lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Cobalt walls, frost-laced tiles, and the bolt’s dull iron create a micro-setting that constrains choice—cold enforces stillness. Spatial choreography is clean: bolt placed on step → stair glows → bellhop ascends. Sensory hierarchy favors visual chill, mirroring thematic freeze. The fortress-as-body metaphor is sustained without overt symbolic nudging.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“is safety worth eternal silence?”—is signaled early. Pressure tightens once: amber → copper discoloration literalizes the cost. Agency is collective and contemplative rather than active; no reversible option is closed, only emotionally re-priced. Suitable for accumulative/textural lens but lacks a visible personal forfeiture that would push higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges via color shift and bolt reprise: silence transmuted from prison to covenant. Subtext resides in the bellhop’s wordless vigil and the guests’ mute assent. Final image reconfigures premise without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers—crack may bring sunrise or deeper frost—inviting reflection beyond the page.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person lyric maintains stable distance; diction (“seraphically mundane,” “frostbitten hope”) is patterned and taught early. Rhythm swells and contracts with snowfall cadence. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is collective yet consistent. Compression and elision (“nerve regeneration experiment” left abstract) are legible within lyric contract.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm alternates between long frost-drifts and short pulses. Information density high: one sentence often layers sensory, symbolic, and causal weight. Minor template cadence in triple adjective clusters (“slow, deliberate flakes”) but does not stall closure. Metaphors stay internally coherent; no mixed vehicles.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Fusion of cloistered sci-fi clinic with medieval chant-ritual feels fresh. Silence-as-currency and color-shift payoff avoid generic tropes. Risk in lyric accumulation is moderate; payoff is cerebral rather than visceral. Specificity of “piano bench bolt” rescues premise from abstract chill.</comment>
