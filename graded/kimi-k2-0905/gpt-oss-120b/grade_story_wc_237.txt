<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Lira’s interiority is lyrically specific—“breath between storms,” “luminous rune of purpose”—but the arc is purely cathartic; no contradictory impulse or micro-choice is dramatized, so the transformation feels foregone rather than earned under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: each image layer (tea, quill, crystal, mist) reweights the stake until the final dissolution reconfigures meaning. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with conceptual cost—scars become legible stories—taught by pattern early and landed cleanly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Floating platform, moonstone tea set, and crystallizing quill form a micro-setting that actively constrains the ritual steps; spatial choreography is stable, sensory hierarchy reflects POV bias, and the final mist embrace recharges the opening silver hush.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—transform scars into stories—signaled early; pressure escalates via accretion of sensory density rather than causal reversal. One meaningful tightening: quill tip submerged, shards flare, scars coalesce into light; cost is legible as luminous permanence, but no live option is foreclosed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through concrete recurrence: breath, crystal, feather, tea all reconfigure from wound to witness. Final image—“luminous verses ready to be read”—offers resonant non-literal answer without moralizing; ambiguity lingers about who will read them.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric voice sustains perceptual signature—selective attention to glyphs, jasmine, wind chimes—without head-hopping. Syntax modulates with pressure: longer clauses build breath, fragments at crystal flare; diction stays within scholar-poet lexicon, no filter-verb clutter.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with scene tempo; figurative layering is dense yet purposeful—each metaphor (crystal shards as sung wind) advances atmosphere. One paraphrase loop: “breath between storms” repeated without new inflection; otherwise high density, zero scaffold, no mixed vehicles.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Rune-scar alchemy fused with tea-ceremony transcendence feels fresh; crystallizing quill and airborne marble platform create idiosyncratic image set. Risk is lyric stillness rather than plot twist, but specificity prevents generic fantasy drift; transformation test passes—story collapses if elements swapped.</comment>
