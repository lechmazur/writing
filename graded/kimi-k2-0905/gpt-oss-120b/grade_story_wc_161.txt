<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Lila’s mourning and re-invention motive is clear from the first paragraph; her micro-choices—slicing the meteorite, tying slivers to birds, mapping dust—embody the stakes. Interiority stays concrete (“balance the weight of her past with the present task”) and links action to emotion without label-speak. The arc from isolation to trusting the birds and the city is legible, but the cost of that trust is asserted rather than felt—no beat shows her risking a bird’s loss or a failed flight. Still, contradiction is present: she both clings to loss and launches it away, giving the closure credible emotional origin.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>The piece teaches an accumulative/textural pattern early—dust spirals → paper trails → pigeon routes—and holds it to the end. Orientation (who/where/when) is anchored within 40 words; the skylight and attic function as micro-setting. Closure is a Charged Poise: the glowing map on the wall crystallizes the braid of memory and renewal, cost felt in the chip’s fading light. The lens never wavers, but the cost is mildly abstract; a single bird failure or returned note could have sharpened the price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Attic, skylight column, dust motes, pigeon feathers, meteorite iridescence—details are selective, sensory, and filtered through Lila’s attention. The dust spirals double as both setting piece and tactical tool for mapping, qualifying as micro-setting that constrains choices. Spatial choreography is clean: birds launch, return, perch; Lila reaches, slices, labels. The environment evolves (sunrise/sunset angles change) and subtly mirrors her thawing interior state without overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: preserve lost songs by encoding them into transmittable trails. Pressure escalates via density—dust maps multiply, pigeons carry more slices, attic chorus swells—rather than causal reversals. One meaningful tightening: when she risks the final sliver of meteorite, the map becomes “a living heart,” foreclosing future edits. Cost is conceptual (the chip fades) rather than visceral; still, agency remains hers throughout.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of layered renewal—moss over stone—emerges through recurrence of trails, dust, and songs rather than exposition. Subtext resides in gesture: tying a shard to a bird’s leg is both memorial and release. The final image (map glowing on the wall) answers the thematic question implicitly: memory travels best when launched, not locked. Avoids sermon; ambiguity lingers—will the humming fade completely?</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Lila’s perceptual bias—she notices air currents, light angles, parchment texture. Syntax lengthens during meditative beats, fragments under urgency (“Thus she attached…”). No dialogue, so voice contamination risk zero. Pattern of anaphora (“Each sunrise… Each sunset…”) is taught early and paid off, giving the prose musical cohesion that mirrors the meteorite song.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; scaffolding minimal. Information density high: one line can layer dust motion, map notation, and emotional import. Figurative language is controlled; only one mixed moment (“bloom with a withering grace”) but it is intentionally oxymoronic and thematic, so allowed. No loops, no filter-verb stacks, no register drift; clean mechanics.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Fusion of meteorite music, dust cartography, and courier pigeons is fresh and specific; removal would collapse the concept. The “paper trail” literalized as vortex geometry feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk—using lyric accumulation instead of causal plot—pays off via coherent closure. Slight deduction for echoing familiar grief-craft tropes (attic mementos, grandmother song) but synthesis overrides them.</comment>
