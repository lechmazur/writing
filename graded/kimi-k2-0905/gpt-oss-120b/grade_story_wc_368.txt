<comment>Lira’s watchful dye-master identity and donor-heart strangeness give her a distinct perceptual filter; her micro-choice to follow the wing’s sun-trail reweights the ending. Interiority is concrete (“eyes, sharp as the edge of a cut glass”) yet stays within lyric register. Motivation to “magnetize stories” is declared early and finally re-codified at the loom, so the through-line is legible. Flaw: no contradictory impulse under pressure—she glides from revelation to promise without testing or risking anything on-page, so the cost is conceptual, not embodied.</comment>

<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: the piece accretes images until the loom reconfigures meaning. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Lira’s promise crystallizes options and stakes, but the cost (the burden of guarding iridescence) is only asserted, not dramatized. Orientation is taught by line 3 and holds; no temporal or spatial confusion. The weakness: no tightening turn between middle and ending; revelation is delivered by scroll rather than by a decision forced under pressure, so escalation is scenic, not causal.</comment>

<comment>Floating rock tea house, amber mist, and crystal-singing garden are sketched with economy and kept tactile: Lira grips cool stone with bare feet, swings dye bottles, sets wing on loom. Each detail either guides access (sun trails) or constrains action (loom threads). The valley rules stay consistent—sun trails are readable only with donor heart—so world logic is learned through use, not exposition. Micro-setting passes 9-gate: the loom’s moonlight threads charge the final image and foreclose paths.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—why stories magnetize—remains abstract; no concrete loss or narrowing of options is dramatized. Escalation is imagistic (scroll → loom → beacon) rather than a trade-off under pressure; the protagonist never confronts a live cost or antagonistic force. Agency is observational: she reads, smiles, whispers; the final illumination happens to the valley, not through a risk she takes. Pressure accumulates in density, not consequence, fitting the Accumulative lens but limiting visceral stakes to mid-band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of “iridescent caution” emerges organically: beauty that warns is shown via wing, scroll, and loom rather than asserted. Final image—light cascade carrying stories—offers a non-literal answer to the magnetism question, reweighting earlier motifs. Avoids preachiness; no character voices the thesis. Weakness: theme stays one-note; no plausible counter-reading or moral ambiguity is invited, keeping it shy of 9-territory.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric voice is stable, with perceptual signature in color-dye metaphors and wind-script conceit. Syntax flexes from elongated cadence to breathless ribbon unfurl, matching sunrise tension. No head-hopping; POV distance stays consistent. Diction lives inside Lira’s artisan lexicon without drifting into purple overload; filter verbs are minimal and voice-motivated.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>High density: “amber kettle,” “quietly explosive,” “sapphire ribbon” compress world and mood into single phrases. Rhythm modulates; no template cadence detected. One lapse—“quietly explosive” is used twice within 30 words, creating a micro-echo that slightly dulls the second hit. Otherwise metaphor vehicles stay coherent; no mixed logic or simultaneity errors. Clean grammar and pronoun tracking.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Donor-heart sun-trail reading, dye-master as story-magnet decoder, and morpho-wing loom beacon synthesize into a fresh conceptual constellation. The fusion feels particular to this valley; swapping any core image would break the symbolic circuitry. Risk is taken with lyric accumulative structure and pays off in legible closure. Not quite 9+ because the abstract stake (people magnetize stories) remains familiar at core, though the surface embroidery is luminous.</comment>
