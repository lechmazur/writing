<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Marin’s deafness is shown through haptic attention to vibration rather than label; her decision to flip the shell forward is a visible micro-choice that costs her the safety of silence and thaws her chest. The internal contradiction—music teacher who cannot hear—drives every beat. No second character on page, so status/relationship bullets n/a; interiority stays concrete, avoids therapy-speak. Earned stasis: she accepts seasonal return visits, acknowledging numbness may recur—cost felt.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the cavern’s “mirrored hush” becomes Charged Poise—silence now reflects feeling, foreclosing Marin's prior detachment. Causal lens holds: because she plays reversed songs → filament glows; therefore she flips to forward → pressure bursts → heartbeat returns. Orientation clean by line 3; single scene, no prop drift. Cost is legible—“warming the cold that had settled there for years”—but not persistently constraining after exit; keeps score sub-9.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>“Petrified drum-skin turntable” and “filament of hush” are concrete, bias-filtered through Marin’s vibration-oriented perception. Cavern constrains acoustics and thus her method; the needle’s splinter is a micro-setting that charges the final image. Sensory economy: only touch and kinetics described, matching POV. Environment mirrors internal state without overt symbolism—stone thaws as she does.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—thaw emotional numbness—signaled in paragraph 1. Single meaningful tightening: flipping shells forward converts silent vibration into felt pressure, narrowing option to remain detached. Cost visible: “warming the cold inside her chest.” No antagonist needed; pressure is situational-mirrored. Escalation sufficient for 700-word span but not persistently costly post-scene, keeping sub-8.5.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</question><comment>Theme—silence can be sculpted into feeling—emerges through action, not assertion. Subtext in the glow shift of the filament: quiet becomes mirror rather than void. Final image of seasonal return cycles offers Charged Poise, refusing tidy cure. No moralizing; emotional aftereffect lingers via “gentle pull” future visitors will feel.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person intimate stays locked to Marin; perceptual signature is vibration-centric diction (“tugged at her marrow,” “soft pulse inside her chest”). Rhythm modulates: long lyrical sentences during reversed playback, shorter clauses at flip moment. No dialogue, so no voice convergence. Free indirect clean: “she remembered” segues into paraphrase, not exposition dump.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High information density: one sentence often does description + causality (“When she turned the crank…afterglow”). No scaffold loops; metaphors consistent (sound=thread/ribbon). Occasional elevated phrasing—“jagged filament of hush”—justified by lyric mode taught early. Final third clean; no artifact touches closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fusion of deaf music teacher + backward phonograph + “filament of hush” feels idiosyncratic yet inevitable. Reversal trope (play songs backward) repurposed as emotional defibrillator, not gimmick. Conceptual integrity: every rule (muted cavern, needle fracture, hush filament) pays off in final image. Risky lyric structure held under causal lens without clarity loss.</comment>
