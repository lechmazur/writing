<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lira’s hunger for a “shape of home” is palpable and embodied—every feather-stroke on the stone is a micro-choice that reweights her interior map. The moment she opens the mercury-skin book and inhales pine-rain-lullaby, memory becomes a viscered stake rather than a label. However, the childhood courtyard shard is narrated more than dramatized, so the cost feels recalled rather than re-lived. Still, her final renunciation—laying the stone back—earns credible stasis and keeps contradiction alive inside her.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each feather-touch thickens the sensory pattern until the single corridor-and-book intensification reweights “home” from fixed place to portable resonance. Closure is a clear Charged Poise: mountain inhales, Lira exhales, and both are changed. Causality is lyric rather than plot-sequential, but the pattern is taught early (“substitute reality nightly”) and pays off in the final breath-image. Cost is atmospheric yet legible—she gives up the stone’s addictive substitution for an earned internal cadence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>The mountain-store is sketched with selective, sense-driven strokes—pine-resin-ink, vellum that pulses like skin—each detail tethered to Lira’s perceptual bias rather than tourist inventory. Micro-setting (the stone, the feather, the mercury-book) functions as tactile terrain: the stone’s grain and the feather’s whisper constrain how she reads and therefore how she moves. Spatial choreography stays coherent: she drifts, finds the corridor, opens the book; no floating impossible shelves. Environment charges the final image—mountain lungs expand only because prior sensory bricks were laid.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“find the shape of home”—is signaled in paragraph one and tightens when memory turns painful (mid-text deepening). No external antagonist, yet pressure is coherent: each feather-stroke escalates the cost of hallucinated home versus lived homelessness. Final corridor/book beat narrows option from seeking place to carrying resonance, a clear agency-driven reconfiguration. Price is conceptual rather than tangible, but accumulative design makes the reweighting felt.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: home as inhalable melody rather than map coordinate. Motif of “hidden thunder” migrates from book-pages to ribcage without authorial commentary, achieving resonance through image shift. No moralizing close; the final exhalation is an earned, ambiguous chord—reader invited to hear the silence that follows. Childhood courtyard functions as mythic fragment rather than sentimental trigger, keeping theme clear of nostalgia syrup.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays tight to Lira’s mercury-biased perception: “eyes…pools of liquid metal,” “stone ribs expanding like lungs of an ancient beast”—metaphors are coherent with her glass-seer ontology. Syntax lengthens then compresses in sync with corridor discovery and final breath, proving rhythmic control. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk zero; diction remains within plausible seer-poet register. Feather-as-reading-method is taught early, legitimizing later lyric elisions.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose breathes: long sensory sentences coil, then snap to short clauses at the book-opening beat. No loops, no synonym churn; each detail either advances image or tightens pattern. Metaphors stay internally coherent (glass, mercury, thunder) and do not crowd high-pressure moment. Opening line anchors tone; final line returns to breath-melody, satisfying read-aloud cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Mercury-seer in a breathing mountain-bookstore is fresh, yet concept succeeds because lyric texture and emotional stakes are inseparable from setting. Risk—substituting nightly dream-reality via feather-texture—pays off when same feather guides realignment of “home.” No borrowed pop-culture tropes; even childhood courtyard is rendered as shard-memory rather than genre flashback. Transformation test passes: story would collapse if feather or mountain were swapped for generic equivalents.</comment>
