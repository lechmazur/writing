<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Marlow’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“his boots echoing…like footsteps on a grave”), contradictions act in-scene (stubborn resolve vs crushing pressure), and the final renunciation—floating the last shard where “no mortal could linger”—earns its cost through prior causal micro-choices. One hairline slip: the phrase “carrier of silence” drifts toward diagnostic self-label, nudging deduction. Overall, a textured, flaw-balanced portrait that lands under Earned Stasis.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the library’s “quiet pulse” reweights the premise, making rest a civic act with conceptual cost. Causal chain holds: lens cracked by storm → reassembly atop cradle → light pulses coerce tablets to glow → spirits settle. No teleporting props; every beat advances knowledge or narrows options. The persistent constraint—water pressure against fragile glass—shapes tactics and charges the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Micro-setting triumph: the cracked lens itself becomes environment, constraining every placement choice. Spatial choreography is precise (rust-cradle on marble pedestal three metres above floor). Sensory hierarchy narrows to bioluminescent fish projections under glass, mirroring internal hope. The vaulted dome as “trembling eye” reprises at closure, recharging earlier motifs.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—turning endless echo into sanctuary—tightens via each lens placement; third shard placement narrows live option (“no mortal could linger”). Price is visible: centuries’ weight pressing ribs, breath rationed. Escalation is steady, one meaningful deepening suffices. Slight shortfall: cost could be sharper had a named spirit resisted before yielding.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: rest as civic architecture, not sentiment. Final image—“library’s glow seeped into the abyss”—offers non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext in silence, phosphorescent ink, and fractured light avoids abstraction. No thematic echo; complexity held.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is distinct: Marlow notices “patient sigh” of sea, “phosphorescent ink…like ghosts,” syntax lengthens underwater. Rhythm modulates with pressure—clipped when lungs compress, wave-long in light ripples. No head-hopping; interior access stays strictly bound. Filter verbs (“felt,” “understood”) are voice-motivated, not clutter.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Information density high: single sentences carry place, tool, emotion (“water pressed…patient sigh”). No loops or synonym churn; metaphor vehicles consistent (glass eye, ribs, pulse). One mixed metaphor—“cracked like the memory of a storm”—but resolved by closure. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with scene tempo.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: underwater necropolis as lighthouse, undertaker as curator of silence. Conceptual risk—rest as spatial installation—pays off via tangible mechanics. Transformation test fails if lens swapped out; specificity anchors novelty. Risk heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
