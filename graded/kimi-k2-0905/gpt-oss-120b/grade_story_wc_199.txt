<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lira’s quiet, ritualized devotion is vivid, but interiority drifts into lyrical summary (“mossy delight of centuries-old bark”) rather than contradictory impulse under pressure; the final transformation is asserted, not dramatized with visible cost, so the arc feels smoothed rather than earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the luminous script cascade reweights the grove into a living archive, cost felt in her irreversible perceptual merger; causality is Accumulative/Textural—each leaf-reading deepens pattern rather than forcing because/therefore turns—held cleanly to the last image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>“Ashen skyborne arbor” is anchored early and tightens choice: the canopy’s ash-filtered light limits visibility, guiding her to underground water; moonstone dust and crystal pool return as micro-setting that charges the final beacon, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—decode or remain blind—surfaces early; pressure escalates through each leaf deciphered, but the spring discovery is a gift, not a narrowing trade-off; cost is aesthetic rather than tactical, keeping tension just below the 8-band threshold.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Theme of remembrance-through-care emerges via living parchment metaphor; subtext whispers that human order must bow to forest syntax, but the final gratitude leaf verges on stating the thesis, trimming the highest band.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Lira’s synesthetic perception; diction (“prod-ed,” “moonstone hue”) repeats ritual cadence without monotony; no head-hop, no filter-verb bloat—voice is consistent and atmospheric.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is lush yet propulsive; only minor loop (“each leaf… each pattern… each seed”) and occasional stacked epithets dull momentum; metaphors stay coherent, and final beacon image is uncluttered.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Arboreal cryptography feels fresh; seed-sorting librarian merges botany with epigraphy in a way that would collapse if swapped for generic mystic; risk is moderate—lyric eco-fantasy is crowded—but specificity of moonstone dust as ink solvent lifts it above trope.</comment>
