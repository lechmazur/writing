<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The ghost bride’s interiority is lyrically specific (“love that was both gentle and poisonous”), and her micro-choice to release the venomous sigh is embodied and costly. The contradictory impulses—yearning to stay / duty to dissolve—coexist in the same beats, satisfying the 9+ test. Flaw: the bead’s emotional weight is asserted more than dramatized in early beats, a hairline slip that keeps her from 9.0.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the bead pulsing “with a soft, mournful elation” reconfigures the orchard and the reader’s sense of debt forever. Causality holds under an Accumulative lens—each ghostly visit layers resonance until the final breath crystallizes meaning. The Orientation Test is waived; the early lyric disorientation is taught and pays off in the translucent glass walls. Cost is undeniable—her extinction fertilizes the blossoms—so the 9+ gate is met.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The greenhouse, bead, and winter-cracked fields are not backdrop but instruments: the bead’s glow dictates when vines stir, the endless night forces the venom-sigh to become sunlight. Spatial choreography is immaculate; the veil’s ash trail and the bead’s placement on branches track cleanly. The 9+ gate is satisfied—the bead’s final pulse charges the image—so the slight excess of visual over tactile detail caps at 8.9, not 8.8.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—discharge the heart-debt—is signaled in line 3 and tightens through each cameo; the final sigh is the visible price that forecloses her continued haunting. Agency is present but lightly distributed across lyric shards; one decisive tightening would lift this to 8.8+. Still, the cadence shift from metallic frost to lantern-blossoms is felt, satisfying the lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: debt as living compost, love as toxin that feeds new growth. The returning “mournful elation” reweights from dirge to triumph in the final image, a non-literal answer that trusts the reader. No moralizing, no allegory—just the bead’s pulse insisting remembrance is the price of beauty.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The voice is elided-lyric yet stabilized by perceptual signature: “wind sang a low, metallic hymn” is heard only by a ghost who once tasted molten hope. Syntax modulates from long breathy clauses to the final fragment “mournful elation,” mirroring her dissipating form. No head-hopping, no filter-verb drift; the piece teaches its pattern and pays it off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm is deliberate: three-beat anaphora (“each…each…each”) escalates like a chant, then breaks into the spare final sentence. Only one scaffold loop—“resonant awakening” appears twice in adjacent lines—minor, non-closure touching. Figurative language is dense but coherent; no mixed metaphors or register drift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The alchemical orchard that transmutes metal into memory via ghostly pollination is a synthesis I haven’t seen; risk is high yet controlled. The “lovingly venomous” conceit could have slid into gothic kitsch but is grounded in the tactile cost of her extinction. The final image of lantern-blossoms against a newly lit horizon feels inevitable yet unforeseeable. +0.4 risk bonus applied.</comment>
