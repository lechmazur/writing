<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The novelist’s contradiction—yearning to bind hopes yet doubting the right—anchors every beat; embodied unease (“doubt gnawed at the edges”) and micro-choices (ritual placement of shell) stay particular. No second on-page character, so status crucible exempt. Final renunciation—closing notebook, pocketing shell—earns credible Earned Stasis with visible cost (story “settled into a calm that resonated like the sea after a storm”). Interiority never drifts into diagnostic label-speak, keeping voice individual.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern—gathering ephemeral cameos against narrative current—tightens through cadence shift and density increase until final Charged Poise. Closure lands on-page: “the spiral seashell fragment glowed brighter, completing the arc,” reweighting prior hopes with undeniable conceptual cost. Anchors who/where/when implicit by word 60 (feral nexus, mist, novelist). No causality breaks; shell and mist constrain tactics throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Micro-setting (spiral shell fragment) functions as environment: its curve guides ink, constrains final inscription, and charges closing image. Mist is sensory-filtered (“swirling hush,” “curling like applause”) and alters proximity; stones remain half-glimpsed, keeping spatial choreography light but legible. Sensory economy favors hush, pulse, breath—matching lyric stakes. Weather evolves with plot—mist thickens at binding moment—charging rather than decorating the climax.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—collect hopes against narrative current—signaled in line 1; tightening occurs when current tries to “pull her words away,” forcing anchoring ritual with shell. Escalation is textural: each cameo adds density until final child-whisper deepens cost. No off-stage resolution; protagonist’s agency (turn page, close notebook) crystallizes stance with felt cost. Coincidence absent; pressure coherent under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from pattern: binding fleeting hopes into逆流 mosaic—never stated, only enacted. Subtext lives in shell’s spiral—memory’s endless curve—recharged in final glow. Final image (notebook shut, sea-calm resonance) offers non-literal answer to “who owns hope?” without moralizing. Ambiguity persists: hopes may still escape, yet promise of “new horizon” lingers—complex, unsentimental.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person lyric voice sustains perceptual signature: mist “curling like applause,” time “folding,” narrative river as current. Syntax mirrors breathless watchfulness—long phrase followed by hinge-beat (“She knew…”). No head-hopping; distance stable. Diction stays within novelist-poet lexicon; no filter-verb stacks. Rhythm accelerates under pressure, then settles into post-storm calm—tight, taught, paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High information density: single sentences layer sensory, metaphoric, and causal work (“mist…curling like applause around her shoulders”). No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances. Metaphors stay coherent—spiral as compass, current as逆流—without muddled logic. Minor elevated diction (“feral nexus”) reads intentional, voice-motivated. Final line cadence mirrors inhale/exhale, satisfying ear.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Premise—feral misty nexus where novelists harvest ephemeral hopes—feels fresh yet mythic. Transformation test fails: core arc (gather fragments → bind → doubt → accept cost) could survive renaming. Yet specificity of shell-guided ink,逆流 mosaic, and mist-reader applause supplies memorable inflection. Risk-taking (lyric accumulative structure) heightens coherence without gimmickry. Slight deduction for near-archetype of artist collecting souls.</comment>
