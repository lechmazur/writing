<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mara’s insomnia and “methodically hopeful” trait are asserted but not embodied; she never visibly struggles to stay awake, so the insomnia reads as a label. The key choice—leaving the kindness note—is endearing yet low-stakes and feels pre-planned, not pressured by an interior contradiction. Missing a beat where her hope actually wobbles costs full credibility. Still, her quiet perseverance and tactile brush-cleaning give her a distinct heartbeat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the greenhouse light reframes the courier’s memory and the city’s smog in one charged breath, re-pricing kindness itself; the cost is ambient yet legible. Causality is accumulative/lyric rather than plot-domino, taught early by the moon-brush-link-to-daydream pattern, and the lens holds. No orientation debt; who/where settled by line 3. The final image crystallizes stakes without explanatory blur.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The greenhouse glass, moon-silver on leaves, and soot-stained city skyline filter every beat through sensory hierarchy; the moon-tipped brush functions as micro-setting that constrains Mara’s ritual and charges the courier’s finale. Selective detail—rain-collected rinse water, saffron hush—anchors mood without catalogue bloat. Spatial choreography is lean but clean; bodies track. Needed one more body-under-glass constraint to breach 9.0.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—proving strangers remember kindness—remains abstract until Jiro’s memory bloom, so pressure is atmospheric rather than tactical; no option narrows for Mara. The courier’s return supplies a micro-turn that reweights the premise, enough for lyric-accumulative closure at this length. Cost is felt conceptually, not personally, preventing 8.8+.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from recurrence of moon-lit messages and unsolicited notes; no final moralizing. The idea that graffiti of gratitude can outlast language is resonant but floats at allegorical altitude; slightly too neat. Still, ambiguity lingers—city smog never lifts—so complexity holds.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Mara’s perceptual filter: moonlight “coaxing a hidden shore” is painterly, not tourist-catalogue. Cadence modulates: long breathless clauses for reverie, clipped fragments at dawn transition. No head-hop; courier’s interior is inferred through gesture, preserving distance control. A few overwritten adjectives (“saffron quiet” repeated) keep it from 9+.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High information density—most sentences layer pigment, memory, and civic haze simultaneously. Rhythm breathes with scene tempo; paragraph lengths vary. A faint scaffold loop—“each stroke a promise / each line a syllable”—but it’s motif-taught, not artifact clutter. Mixed metaphor (“lantern… breathed a saffron quiet”) is audacious yet coherent under painterly lens; no clarity break. Closure line is clean.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The rooftop greenhouse as lantern-plus-philology lab, kindness notes as non-urban urban ritual—the synthesis feels fresh yet inevitable. Revered ancient scripts re-materialized in watercolor is a smart inversion of the usual cyber-language trope. Could edge higher if courier’s memory linked back to a brush-stroke he actually saw, tightening symmetry.</comment>
