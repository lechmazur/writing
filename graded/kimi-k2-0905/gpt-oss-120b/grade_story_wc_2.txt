<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Mara’s curiosity about broken gears is concrete and particular; her decision to follow the compass is embodied through tactile handling of tools and moss-lit staging. Interior contradiction is light—mainly the intellectual thrill of paradox—so the arc feels more observational than crucible. The final “uncertainly certain” smile is earned by the waterfall scene, but emotional cost stays ambient rather than visceral. Still, her perceptual signature (smell of ozone, erratic clock-ticks) individualizes her throughout.</comment>

<comment>Causal chain holds: courier drop → greenhouse test → tunnel → cavern → inscription; each step because/therefore. Closure is Charged Poise rather than decisive act—the compass on the brazier reweights her craft with conceptual cost (“let uncertainty guide”). Spatial orientation is complete by line 10; time anchor (“damp morning”) arrives even earlier. Minor slack: the orange flicker is introduced seconds before use, but the image still crystallizes options neatly.</comment>

<comment>Phosphorescent algae, ozone-iron mist, and silver leaf-dust are selective, sensory, and filtered through Mara’s tinkerer bias. The greenhouse becomes a working instrument rather than postcard, and the waterfall cavern supplies both spectacle and the brazier prop that powers closure. Spatial choreography is clean—no impossible moves behind the water curtain. Environment directly shapes tactics: the leaf swirl is the lab, the algae the lantern, the brazier the key-turn.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—Mara’s quest to decipher the frozen compass—signals early and tightens once: the needle’s first tremor forecloses retreat. Cost is conceptual rather than tangible (no lost tool or injury), but the inscription’s command reweights her future craft. Agency stays internal; the external world obliges too readily (tunnel opens, coals still glow), so pressure feels situational more than adversarial. Still, the final stance crystallizes with visible consequence for her occupation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as improvisation over perfectible order; the compass inscription is the only overt statement, arrived at through ordeal, so it lands as CR rather than lecture. Recurring images—broken clocks, swirling leaves, ash-smell—accumulate into a coherent meditation on uncertainty without moralizing. The ending reweights the premise: Mara will now sell clients “uncertainty as feature,” a resonant non-literal answer. Ambiguity lingers but is purposeful, not confusing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Third-limited stays locked to Mara; perceptual signature is strong—“silver dust caught the low light,” “smelled of ozone and old iron.” Syntax grows shorter under waterfall pressure, mirroring heartbeat. No dialogue, so voice modulation happens through cadence shift and diction control. Filter verbs are minimal and voice-motivated; the lyric compression in “each cracked gear whispered a story” teaches the pattern early and sustains it.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and image-rich yet propulsive; sentences advance at least two jobs (e.g., “tunnels…hummed with damp air and the distant roar” sets acoustics, humidity, scale). A few metaphor stacks verge on purple (“silvery sheets…ozone and old iron”) but stay legible and payoff-linked. No loops, paraphrase, or scaffold detected. Opening and closing lines are crisp, anchoring voice and recharging motif respectively.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Frozen-compass-as-key-to-subterranean-archives gives a fresh slant on both “lost relic” and “under-city” tropes. Transformation test passes: Mara’s clock-repair métier is inseparable from the conceit. Particularized details—phosphorescent moss workbench, ozone-iron scent—keep the world from feeling generic. Risk is moderate (lyric accumulation over plot twists), but the synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
