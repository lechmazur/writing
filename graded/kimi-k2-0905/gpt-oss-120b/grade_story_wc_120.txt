<comment>Lian’s interior contradiction—yearning to conduct unheard symphonies while fearing the cost of surrendering her past—is embodied in the trembling frost-score she draws. Emotion is shown through tactile micro-choices (aligning shell curve to horizon, releasing glass cookie) rather than labels. The final smile and hovering fingertips crystallize a credible renunciation of homesickness as burden, converting it to compass, with the visual cost of fracturing horizon paid on the page. Still, the causal link between childhood memory-map and the exact moment of symphonic release is more poetic assertion than dramatized sequence, keeping the arc just shy of full inevitability.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the fractured mirrored horizon reconfigures meaning and forecloses return to prior silence, cost legible in the cascading shards. Causality is lyric-accumulative rather than strict because/therefore; pattern taught early by nautilus-as-compass holds. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are intact by word 60. The slight causal gap between memory-mapping and the lake’s actual sonic transformation keeps the lens from full causal purity, but the resonant reconfiguration satisfies under Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>

<comment>Glass spire, frozen lake, and nautilus shell function as micro-setting objects that constrain choice: shell curve guides the score etched on frost, spire amplifies sound, lake becomes vibrating membrane. Sensory hierarchy favors hush, shimmer, and breath—perfect for a story about unheard music. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible positions. The horizon reflection evolves from illusion to fractured baton, charging the final image and meeting the 9+ gate test for environment-as-constraint.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—transform chronic homesickness into audible creation—signals early. One meaningful tightening: the moment horizon fractures into luminous batons, foreclosing passive nostalgia and demanding conductor stance. Cost is visible in shattered horizon and released cookie. Pressure accumulates via density of light/sound images rather than causal reversals; sufficient for 600-word lyric mode but lacks a second tightening beat to reach top band.</comment>

<comment>Theme emerges organically: the cost of turning private longing into public music. No moralizing; final fortune is image-based baton/score metaphor. Motif of mirrored horizon reweights from illusion to instrument without abstract statement. Childhood memory reframed as musical notation feels earned through shell spiral, not imposed. Ambiguity lingers—does the world truly hear, or only Lian?—inviting reflection without confusion.</comment>

<comment>Third-person lyric close-distance stays stable; no head-hop. Perceptual signature is music-from-silence synesthesia: “upended hush,” “ripple a note she could finally see.” Syntax mirrors crescendo—long breathless clauses build to short declarative “Conduct.” No dialogue, so evaluation focuses on rhythmic control of description, which remains character-particular and pressure-responsive. Minor over-alliteration (“fractured into shards” / “cascaded” / “conductor”) is voice-consistent and forgivable.</comment>

<comment>Prose is dense yet musical: information carries rhythm, syntax breathes with scene crescendo. Figurative language is patterned early (sound-through-glass) and paid off, avoiding purple overload. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence adds new sensory angle or causal tilt. Opening and closing lines anchor and resolve via image without scaffolding. One strained metaphor—“membrane of vibrating chords”—slightly blurs physical logic, preventing 9.0.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Fuses fortune-cookie mysticism with synesthetic symphonics in a way that feels inevitable yet fresh. Risk-taking—turning frozen lake into orchestral instrument—pays off through consistent glass/sound physics set up early. Childhood memory as musical notation is non-obvious synthesis. Could not swap shell, horizon, or spire without collapsing logic. Avoids twee eccentricity by grounding each magical beat in tactile action.</comment>
