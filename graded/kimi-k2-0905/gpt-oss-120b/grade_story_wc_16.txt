<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is lyrically textured (“carefully reckless,” “cautious exuberance”) and her micro-choices (tracing glyphs, whispering promises) link motive to action. Yet the emotional stakes stay slightly abstract—no embodied contradiction or visible flaw surfaces under pressure, so the final pledge feels more ritual than cost. Still, her perceptual signature holds and the profession shapes what she notices, satisfying baseline individuation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The piece lands a textbook Conceptual Repricing: the covenant is restored and silence rewritten into dialogue, with the archive’s audible breath as undeniable social cost. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each promise-layer thickens resonance until the final chord reweights meaning. Orientation is immediate; transitions are unnecessary in this single-scene design. The “before paths diverge” ticking clock is named but not tracked, a hairline slip that keeps it shy of 9.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The glass ink well functions as micro-setting: it sings, brightens, and ultimately beams like a beacon—its tactile states constrain pace and charge the final image. Dusty vault, pulsing shelves, and luminescent droplets are selective, sense-distributed details filtered through a linguist’s bias for sound and symbol. Spatial choreography is clean; no geography drifts. Environment actively answers her promises, meeting the 9+ gate even if world-rules remain lightly sketched.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</question><grade>The dominant stake—restore trust after silence—anchors every glyph-promise; escalation is the mounting chord of awakened scripts. Each knot untied tightens the next option until the final pledge forecloses her exit: she must now carry the voices outward. Cost is conceptual but legible: the archive breathes, shadows nod, covenant reborn—social pressure made audible. No visible personal loss is felt, keeping it just below the 8.8 tier.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</question><grade>Theme emerges from pattern, not sermon: promises as living syntax, memory as covenant. The “symphonies of truth” reprice at closure when the chord escapes the walls, shifting trust from artifact to community. Ambiguity lingers—will future readers keep the pact?—offering useful after-effect. No meta-commentary or tidy moral intrudes, only the earned resonance of restored dialogue.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</question><grade>Third-person lyric remains stable, pitched to Elara’s synesthetic ear; diction stays within an arcane-linguist lexicon. Rhythm modulates—long breathy clauses for wonder, curt fragments at knot-release—without template drift. No dialogue appears, so voice-contamination tests are waived. Filter verbs are minimal; perceptual signature (“ink sang a low chord”) is character-specific and consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</question><grade>Sentences carry triple duty: sensory, symbolic, causal. Metaphors stay coherent—ink as sunrise, knot as storm—without mixed vehicles. Occasional uplifted register (“luminescent script fell like droplets”) flirts with purple yet serves the accumulative crescendo. One paraphrase loop (“promise” thrice in two lines) is a hairline scar; clarity never blurs, but 9+ remains unreachable.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</question><grade>The “ink that sings truth in chords” converts a familiar scribe trope into acoustical epistemology; the archive’s covenant becomes a living score. Risk lies in full lyric commit—truth as audible harmony—yet payoff lands cleanly when the walls themselves harmonize. Specificity of glyphs (curve, twin spiral, tangled storm-knot) prevents generic transfer; remove ink-well or promise-method and the frame collapses. A fresh synthesis that feels inevitable after the final chord.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</question><grade>Her expertise dictates every move—choice of ink, reading glyphs as promises, whispering rain to the storm-knot. Two beats hinge on her call: the knot’s release and the final pledge to carry voices outward. Profession is irreplaceable; swap in generic scholar and logic frays. Cost is social, not personal, keeping it from top band.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>9.2</question><grade>Glow, song, and beam are three evolving states; the well’s chord swells to close the story. Each stroke narrows her path—she must finish before ink dries and paths diverge. Remove it and no sonic covenant, no beacon for future seekers. Personal cost is implicit—she is now bound as carrier—cementing indispensability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</question><grade>The concept converts dead glyphs into audible chords; each promise-layer is a musical interval toward restored trust. It shapes tactics—she “reads” harmony, not just meaning—and charges the ending when the archive exhales a symphony. Abstract yet dramatized; without it, the covenant stays mute.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.3</question><grade>Trait surfaces early and modulates action: she dips ink while “carefully reckless,” accepting fragility of bridges. No visible downside erupts; the risk is named more than felt. Still, the paradox frames her method and recurs in the final acceptance of duty, satisfying two-of-three gates.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</question><grade>“Unsnarl” is literalized when the storm-knot untwists into droplets; this visual turn unlocks the covenant paragraph. It is the sole reversal that changes her options—ink brightens, next verse offered. Without the unsnarling, no cascade, no chord, no invitation to continue chronicle.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.0</question><grade>Method is taught by 25% mark and drives every glyph interaction: promise to sunrise, promise to river, promise to rain. Mechanics matter—one vow enables the next glyph to sing. It shapes the ending pledge as the ultimate promise, chaining past to future scribes.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</question><grade>Archive supplies the only resource—promise-embedded glyphs—and applies social pressure: keepers emerge once trust is restored. Spatial cues are minimal but sufficient; the breathing wall is the critical micro-setting. Without the archive’s covenant, stakes evaporate.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.4</question><grade>Clock is declared (“before paths diverge”) yet never tightens through measurable beats; no ink-level or shutter-sequence tracks elapsed time. Its presence frames urgency but fails to alter tactics mid-scene. Serves as decorative tension rather than constraining force.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.5</question><grade>Motive is restated each time she offers a new promise, linking personal mission to collective covenant. Friction appears: each promise risks fracturing bridges, yet silence must end. The final pledge dramatizes the desire with visible cost—she is now bound as messenger—lifting it above mere label.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</question><grade>Tone modulates—hush of dust to sunrise ink to cautious pledge—mirroring her twin impulse. It charges the ending: solemn gratitude + luminous beacon = earned poise. Coherent across beats and indispensable to emotional cadence; swap tone and the covenant feels either flippant or dreary.</comment>
