<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The fiddler’s interiority is lyric but diffuse; “luminous disbelief” is repeated instead of embodied contradiction. His decision to keep traveling is earned, yet the cost is declared (“weight of the moment”) rather than dramatized in muscle or breath. Micro-choices (lifting bow, placing glass) are present, but the emotional differential between external calm and internal fracture is not made legible in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the glass photograph becomes a transferable “doorway” that reweights sin itself. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of flutter, pixel, echo—held to the final image. Cost is felt (“weight… like ash”), yet the causal chain from one song to universal amnesty is asserted, not constrained; the pixel rule is taught but not tested in failure, so the price feels illustrative rather than inevitable.</comment>

<comment>Mountain ridge and scaffold wrap function as environmental syntax: wind-readable map directly steers his trek, while pine-needle sunrise exposes the plate. Tool-as-setting (glass flake) constrains the final exposure; its chemical fog pairs with light to decide the hitchhiker’s fate. Spatial choreography is clean; distance from pullout to summit is implied through echoing chords, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—turning “never” into possible photograph—signals early and escalates by accretion of echo, flutter, pixel. One meaningful tightening: the sky literally splits, spilling amber that forces the exposure beat. Cost is conceptual (amnesty now portable), but no live option is foreclosed for the fiddler; he gains vocation without visible forfeiture, keeping pressure shy of 8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme of redeemable oblivion emerges from repeated pixels, flutters, plates—images that can be re-written. Final reconfiguration rescues the vanished, reframing erasure itself as data awaiting playback. No moral is stated; resonance is optical and musical rather than preached. The concept stays particular to this ridge, avoiding universalist decal.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric sustains a perceptual signature attuned to sonic geography: “notes… map,” “mountain answered in reverberating sighs.” Syntax lengthens and compresses with ascent, no head-hopping. Occasional lofted diction (“pixelated amnesty”) is justified by conceptual world-rule taught early. Filter verbs minimal; metaphor vehicles stay acoustic/light-based, keeping texture coherent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Rhythm modulates from short dusk clauses to long sunrise sentences, supporting breath of climb. Few near-loops (“luminous disbelief” 2×, “sculpt possibility from the ashes of ‘never’” 2×) but they land at emotional crests, not hidden. Metaphors stay internally coherent (echo, flutter, pixel); no mixed vehicles. Information density high; each paragraph advances exposure or map knowledge.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fusion of obsolete wet-plate chemistry with digital pixel forgiveness is fresh; both are optical redemption systems made tactile. The scaffold-wrap-as-wind-map turns construction debris into living cartography—an image not seen elsewhere. Risk stakes the entire metaphysics on a single glass flake, and the payoff commits fully. Derivative echo is faint; the synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight yet non-obvious at entry.</comment>
