<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Mara’s interiority is concrete (“felt the weight of generations,” “warmly curious heart swelling”) and her micro-choices under pressure—kneeling, placing the disc, turning it—are character-specific. The contradiction between scientific excavation and spiritual re-enchantment is implied but never dramatized in a single sharp moment; the final smile feels slightly epiphanic rather than hard-won. No second character steps on-stage, so status/relationship tests are N/A; still, her flaws (naïve optimism) are shown but do not boomerang with visible cost. Meets the 9+ threshold for embodied motives, but the lack of a palpable price keeps it below 9.0.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: each unearthed shard thickens the sacred density until the final click of the sundial base reweights the orchard into a living shrine. Orientation is clean (“stepped through the stone portal” by line 1); causality is lyric rather than tight because/therefore yet the pattern is taught early and closure lands as Charged Poise—the silver circle alignment and bone-chime crystallize options for future pilgrims. Cost is felt: Mara’s solitary labor, the scholars who vanished, and the orchard’s reclaimed voice. One hairline slip: the “quiet voice” literalizes the magic rather than leaving it in poised ambiguity, else 9+.</comment>

<comment>Catacomb orchard is not backdrop but instrument: roots lift like hands, moonlight strikes the disc, bones become sounding gears—all constrain Mara’s gestures and charge the final altar image. Sensory hierarchy is biased to touch and sound (hum of roots, bone cadence) reflecting an archaeologist-tuned attention. Spatial choreography is flawless; every shard is handled, every root tracked. Environment directly enables the culminating alignment of shadows, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—restore lost faith—signals early and tightens through each unearthed relic; the meaningful deepening is the moment roots physically respond to the sundial base, turning abstract hope into bodily risk. Cost is conceptual: the vanished scholars foreshadow danger, and Mara’s solitary exhaustion is implied though not viscerally staged. Agency is accumulative—each fragment placed is a prayer—but no single beat forces a trade-off that forecloses an option. Sufficient for 8-band, but lacks a visible wound or irreversible sacrifice to push higher.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: diaspora return as reversal of entropy, time measured not in hours but in remembered bones. Subtext lives in gesture—roots recoiling equal ancestors accepting her hand. Final image of sunrise bands across the threshold offers Conceptual Repricing: the tomb becomes threshold, faith becomes porous to the living. Avoids explicit moral; slight ding for the voiced “thank you” which over-articulates what the image already conveys.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited maintains consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature is tactile-archaeological (“twisted roots that snaked between bones like pale rivers of memory”). Rhythm swells and ebbs with sentence length, mirroring the orchard’s breathing hum. No dialogue, so voice purity is uncontested. Filter verbs are minimal and motivated; diction stays within an educated returnee’s lexicon. One clause—“marrow of the dead whispered faint hymns”—edges purple yet is earned by established lyric pattern.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but breathable; nouns and verbs carry weight (“snaked,” “glint,” “clicked”). No loops or scaffold; metaphor chain (roots = rivers = clock gears) stays internally coherent. One mixed metaphor—“roots lifting like reverent hands” plus “marrow whispering hymns”—slightly overloads the beat but does not obscure causality. Opening and closing lines are muscular and image-driven, passing the read-aloud test.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Familiar diaspora-return and ancestor-veneration tropes are retooled through the catacomb-orchard conceit and the sundial-as-heart pacemaker, producing a non-obvious synthesis. Specificity of iron disc etched with constellations, or bones ticking like unseen clock, transforms generic pilgrimage into archaeological séance. Risk in lyric escalator structure pays off with coherent closure. Not quite 9+ because the emotional arc is warm rather than dangerous, lacking a final unsettling twist that would make the freshness unforgettable.</comment>
