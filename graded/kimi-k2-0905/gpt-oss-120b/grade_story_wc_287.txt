<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is lyrically embodied (“protected vulnerability” pulses through every beat) and her micro-choices (kneeling on the ledge, clicking the latch, whispering covenant) enact a believable hierarchy of values. The arc is a credible renunciation: she pays with perpetual return and nightly exposure, cost made visible in the final “cool mist” and departing sigh. Flaw: no contradictory impulse is allowed to surface in-scene; she is too harmoniously single-minded, blunting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each luminous vine adds density until the harbor’s atmosphere is re-priced. Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing—the glowing fire-escape ladder rewrites what darkness means for the whole port, and the cost (“she would return each season,” exposed flesh to night air) is legible in the final exhale. Orientation is anchored within 120 words; only the rose-petal clock is late-appearing but it is decorative, not causal, so no penalty. One strand of scaffold—“quivering hush” thrice in two sentences—nicks perfection.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The moonlit harbor is rendered through POV-filtered selection (oil lanterns that “sputter,” gulls “usually raucous” now stilled), and the fire-escape micro-setting literally constrains every move. Sensory hierarchy is respected: scent of sea-mist is admitted only when Mara “feels the cool mist curl,” tying setting to body. One missed chance: the “old rosebush” is only a visual cue, never tactile or olfactory, so it fails the 9+ tool/body gate. Still, spatial choreography is flawless across the vertical descent and ledge planting.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“darkness will not claim the harbor’s heart”—is signaled early and escalates by density, not twist. Each planted vine incrementally raises the ante until the final image reweights safety for the entire waterfront. Agency is present but gentle: her only decisive act is the first latch-click; after that the vines grow by moon physics, muting visible cost. A sharper tightening midpoint would have pushed the band higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through recurring light/dark materiality rather than statement; “to reflect light into dark corners” is dramatized, never sermonized. The closing “resilient glow” re-prices the lockmaster heirloom and the gardener’s ritual without moralizing. One soft echo: “protected vulnerability” is named twice—acceptable because the second instance is embedded in bodily sensation, not thesis. Complexity holds—no tidy moral, only an open covenant with night.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric distances stays stable; perceptual signature is distinct—“argent ribbon,” “wistfully pragmatic care,” “rhythm of oars in water” are idiosyncratic yet consistent. Syntax modulates: long languid clauses mirror tide drag, then compress for the latch click. No dialogue, therefore no voice convergence risk. Register remains within a night-literate gardener’s plausible lexicon; no corporate trespass.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Rhythm is tidal—long rolling sentences break against single-beat fragments (“The latch clicked”). Figurative language is dense yet coherent; vehicles stay maritime (moon as ribbon, vines as oars). Micro-loop spotted: “quivering hush” appears three times in closing paragraph—minor because it accrues mantra power rather than clutter. No scaffold, no synonym churn, no mixed metaphors; closure image is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>The “fire-escape gardener” who plants bioluminescent vines using a locksmith’s gauge tooth is a fresh synthesis; it collapses urban decay, covert horticulture, and heirloom craft into one image. Conceptual risk—lyric accumulation instead of overt conflict—pays off in the re-priced harbor. Familiar trope of moonlit waterfront is re-inflected through vertical gardening and tool-as-wand specificity. Still, the rose-petal clock feels imported from fairy-tale rather than earned by the world’s new physics, a trace of ornamental convenience.</comment>
