<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The dusk noticer’s interiority is lyrical but abstract; his contradictory impulses are asserted (“luminous regret” vs “gratitude”) rather than dramatized through micro-choice under pressure. No visible cost is paid for the metamorphose he undergoes; the stone warms, but he neither risks nor forfeits anything. His motives remain static observer-ideals rather than escalating wants that force tactical change.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Closure is a gentle Conceptual Repricing—the stone now “hums with captured shadows”—but the cost is purely atmospheric; nothing is relinquished or foreclosed. Causal chain is loose: watching footage → aligning stone → stone glows; the footage itself never resists or complicates, so the turn feels ornamental. The lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern holds, yet the tightening is only a brightness shift, not an option-limiting beat.</comment>

<comment>The blooming-above-clouds library is sketched with lush, sensory strokes (“soft perfume of rain-kissed clouds”) and the micro-setting of the river stone pedestal functions as tactile anchor. Spatial choreography is dreamlike but coherent; no anchor contradictions. However, the environment never actively constrains his choices; it merely mirrors mood, so it caps below the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.1</grade>
<comment>Stakes are announced—preserve hope, trap the shadow—but the shadow never pushes back; footage loops unchanged, so pressure is ambient, not escalating.只有一个 meaningful turn: placing stone beside screen; it brightens without demanding trade-off or risk. Cost remains conceptual and unfelt on the page, so escalation reads as decorous accumulation rather than rising pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>Theme of cyclical hope vs ephemeral memory emerges through mirrored children and the stone’s preservation, but it is stated in repeated abstractions (“shape of hope,” “promise alive”) rather than concrete consequence. Final image reweights earlier motifs (kite silhouette) yet lands softly moralizing. Subtext is thin; the library’s breathing and stone’s glow are overt allegory rather than charged silence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is consistently lyric-ornate; perceptual signature relies on twilight imagery and liquid metaphors (“watercolor skies,” “velvet cushion”). Syntax is varied, but cadence can slide into template repetition (“softly deliberate” echoed three times). No dialogue to test; POV stays stable. Diction occasionally overshoots POV plausibility (“conceptual repricing”-level diction for a solitary watcher) but remains internally consistent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.7</grade>
<comment>Figurative density is high; stacked abstract metaphors (“library’s ribs of a great wing,” “moonlight-cold promise”) create atmospheric haze that slows propulsion. No scaffold loops, but near-paraphrase clusters (“shadow unbound” repeated with minor adjective shifts) dull urgency. Final paragraph blooms into sunrise without syntactic let-up, obscuring the thin causal chain. Read-aloud rhythm is musical yet information-poor; many sentences perform atmosphere rather than advancement.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Premise—twilight librarian crystallizing hope via archival footage—offers fresh blend of solarpunk and memory-curation, but execution drifts into generic lyric mysticism. Shadow-as-unbound-memory is evocative yet under-differentiated; could swap “echo,” “trace,” “ghost” without structural change. Risk-taking is present in cloud-level library, but world rules stay soft. The synthesis feels promising yet not fully realized; particulars need sharper bite to transcend ornament.</comment>
