<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Interiority is poetically dense but abstract; wants and fears never crystallize into concrete micro-choices under pressure. The “labyrinth of self” remains metaphorical—no moment shows him electing one corridor over another with visible stakes. Emotional states are named (“felt the world sigh,” “promise of becoming periodically eternal”) rather than embodied in gesture or risk. Closure relies on dissolution of the tablet, a deus-type beat rather than a choice that costs.

<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—the tablet dissolves, timelines reseal—but causality is lyric-associative rather than because/therefore. The procedural-generation engine is asserted, never demonstrated; we never watch an algorithm output constrain a decision. Orientation is lyrically delayed yet ultimately functional; waiver applies. Accumulation cap −0.8 for two distinct non-closure issues: (1) teleporting tablet dissolution solves the climax without prior setup, (2) “fractured timelines” declared but never narrow options on-page.

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>“Glowing viaduct after rain” is vividly selective—phosphorescent droplets as musical notes—yet never constrains tactics or charges closure. Micro-setting (tablet, boots) likewise decorative; no beat hinges on their physical properties. Sensory hierarchy skews visual-only under high stakes; gravity-defiance physics accepted without rule-teaching. High-band gate missed because no environment or prop alters the final move.

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“conquer the labyrinth of self”—is announced early but pressure stays lyrical; no tightening beat forces a fork or forfeiture. Escalation is textural (repetition of “darkening brightness,” “periodically eternal”) rather than causal; options don’t narrow. The cost is conceptual at closure (tablet lost) but not felt as tactical sacrifice earlier. Agency remains contemplative; protagonist never risks a wrong corridor.

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of embracing all fractured selves emerges imagistically rather than through dramatized self-confrontations; no single echo-self is given weight. Subtext operates in mirrored light/water imagery, but refrain risks self-paraphrase (“darkening brightness” ×3). Final line reweights premise effectively—owning every timeline is mastering self—achieving resonance without moralizing. Ambiguity stays deliberate; complexity acknowledged.

<comment>Voice is lush, rhythmic, consistent in register; diction stays within cosmic-lyric idiom. Perceptual signature leans philosophical rather than bodily, but maintains stable distance. No dialogue to test naturalism. Occasional template cadence (“each…each…each”) mildly dulls propulsion but pattern is taught early and paid off. High-band gate missed only because closure line repeats prior phrasing without fresh syntactic turn.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>Metaphors are frequently stacked (“inverted roots,” “broken mirrors,” “dying star”) risking purple overload, yet stay legible. Paraphrase loops minor: “fractured timelines…periodically eternal” concepts reworded across adjacent sentences. Information density high; sentences multitask. Filter-verb clusters absent; pronoun reference clean. Final third carries figurative muddle (“darkening brightness reaching apex”) disallowing 9+.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Combines gravity-defiance, procedural-generation, and inner-labyrinth tropes into a synesthetic lyric montage; synthesis feels inevitable. Risk in nonlinear, image-driven structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specificity of “droplet-notes” and “amber pulsing like dying star” freshens familiar cosmic mood. Deduction for proximity to widespread “fractured timelines” trope; not fully transformed.</comment>
