<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The priest’s interiority is evocative—his sensed “clock of possession” and the single-color obsession—but we never see a contradictory impulse in scene; he simply proceeds. His final stance (lowering the instrument, bowing to silence) is a peaceful renunciation, yet the cost feels conceptual rather than embodied: no sacrificed relationship, no irreversible wound. At this length the absence of a second on-page character is acceptable, but the lack of micro-choice under duress keeps the arc in mid-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the indigo flare exposes “hidden assumptions that had shackled the city’s heart,” re-weighting the world-rule. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density of echo, color, and silence tightens until the stillness shatters. Orientation is immediate (“a waning cathedral that floated between worlds”). Minor causality gap: the anchor’s shift from threat to beacon is asserted, not shown, but the final image still carries felt cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Cathedral, palette, loop pedal, and dimensional anchor all function as micro-setting: the pedal’s spiral and the indigo droplets physically constrain how the ritual can proceed. Sensory hierarchy favors sonic and chromatic immediacy, matching the priest’s perceptual bias. Spatial choreography stays clean—“the cathedral walls seemed to inhale, pulling the resonances into a single point.” The anchor’s final steadying is the concrete payoff that earns the high-band mark.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prevent possession of self or city—is signaled early. Escalation is textural: each loop layer thickens the silence until the stillness ruptures; the tightening is legible. Visible price is oblique (his soul “might be consumed”), but the conceptual re-weighting of the city’s assumptions serves as the requisite cost under Accumulative lens. A crisper embodied forfeiture would have pushed higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges—“perception can be rewired by focused attention and repetition”—through the indigo motif and echo spiral rather than statement. The final image reframes the earlier “muffled clarity” as civic renewal, a resonant reconfiguration. No moralizing sentence intrudes. The concept of “unraveled stillness” stays abstract; a more grounded social example earlier would have lifted the score further.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Voice is lyric, ritualistic, and consistent: syntactic elongation mirrors echoing loops, lexicon stays within priestly register. Perceptual signature is strong—“rosary of reverberations,” “honey over stone.” No dialogue to test, so voice-distinctiveness rests on narration alone. The patterned repetition of “decorates with silence” and “muffled clarity” is taught early and paid off, justifying the stylistic compression.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but seldom clogged; clauses carry double duty (sound/ethics). A few metaphor stacks—“spiral of tonal prayer,” “cascade of silent colors”—risk purple, yet they occur at the climax where heightened diction is earned. No loops or synonym churn detected. Strong read-aloud rhythm; paragraph cuts are purposeful.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses ecclesiastical ritual with looper tech and dimensional physics—a fresh synthesis. The single-color palette as theological instrument is specific and memorable. Risk is taken with lyric exposition, but coherence holds. Could edge higher if the city’s pre-ritual state had been sketched with one sharp, grounded detail to prove transformation.</comment>
