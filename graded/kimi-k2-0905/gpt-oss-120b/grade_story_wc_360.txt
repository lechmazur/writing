<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Mara’s interior contradiction—scholarly detachment vs. the flood of borrowed grief—surfaces only in summary; the moment she “felt her own pulse align” is told, not embodied. No micro-choice shows her risking or forfeiting anything; the fragment simply answers her. The coat-pocket promise is a future cost, not one paid on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the cracked halo sprays the room with “colors of all the personalities,” a visible reweighting of her theorem. Causality is thin—why the fragment cracks now is unmotivated—but the image retroactively charges prior printing acts. Orientation is swift; the lens is Accumulative/Textural and holds.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Topaz dust refracting equations through the fragment is a micro-setting that directly enables the climactic reweighting; the dome’s breathing walls mirror her own press rhythm, tying environment to final image. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered. Spatial choreography stays clean in the single-room scene.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Stake—prove emotion is quantifiable—is signaled early. Pressure escalates only texturally: inkings accumulate, the room glows brighter, but no choice narrows or forecloses an option. The fragment’s crack is a gift, not a cost she forces. No visible price alters her tactics; thus escalation feels observational rather than driven.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Theme—empathy as transposable mathematics—emerges through the refracting topaz light and the cracked halo’s spectral spray, not authorial statement. The final image reconfigures the premise without moralizing. Ambiguity is purposeful, inviting counter-readings about the violence of commodifying feeling. No echoing platitude cheapens the insight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric-cryptic yet consistent: long vowel-rich sentences mimic press rolls; diction stays within a poet-printer’s lexicon. Perceptual signature is strong—“inked plates beneath the trembling dome” filters world through tactile typographic detail. No head-hopping; psychic distance stable. Compression (“the mathematics of emotion were hidden in the rhythm of ink”) is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Rhythm modulates from languid opening cadences to shorter pulses at the fragment crack, mirroring rising stakes. Figurative layering is dense but patterned, not cluttered; mixed metaphors are avoided. Occasional scaffold—“each borrowed personality seeped… each whispering a fraction”—is repetitive but does not obscure causality or dull the final image. Clean grammar and strong verbs throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Fusing letterpress poetics with quantum empathy is a fresh synthesis; the halo fragment as cracked mirror of multiple selves transforms a familiar light-crystal trope. Risky lyric density is committed to fully and pays off in the spectral closure image. The concept could not survive relocation to another craft or setting without collapse, passing the transformation test.</comment>
