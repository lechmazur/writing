<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interiority is present (“trembling fingers,” “quiet pride”) yet remains generic; no contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene. Micro-choice at crown-touch is singular but credible under short-scope. “Regally unpretentious” is label-only; no visible trade-off. Closure renunciation is earned, cost felt, satisfying 600-word threshold.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: pellet→map→alcove→crown→sunder, each because/therefore step tightening options. Orientation anchored by line 6; no debt. Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: sky restarts, crown pocketed, temple sings—cost visible in collapse. Slight over-reliance on atmospheric summary between beats keeps it from 9.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Library breathes through parchment scent, melting shelves, stone hymn—details are filtered via the titan’s slowed-time perception and constrain movement. Iron pellet’s etched wavering line turns from prop to truth engine, re-weighted at collapse. Spatial choreography remains exact; bodies/props track. No environment-charged final tactic, so capped at 8.8 per 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“unmask pretender”—signaled early; each ink reveal narrows physical and moral options until only crown-confrontation remains. Sundering is protagonist-triggered with immediate spatial cost (collapse). Cost is visible but abstracted through temple metaphor; lacks a concrete personal loss beyond mission completion. Still, agency and escalation cohere under causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of truth dissolving false sovereignty emerges via ink, rune, crumbling architecture—never sermonized. Final image of collapsing stones singing renewal reweights earlier “graceful collapse” motif without explicit moral. Ambiguity lingers: is titan guardian or destroyer? Minor abstraction keeps it from 9—cost is cosmic, not personal.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person lyric omniscient stays stable, pitched to titan’s mythic scale: “diminutive titan,” “planetary presence.” Syntax ripples—parallel anaphora, cathedral cadence—yet never obscures causality. No dialogue, hence no voice-distinction test. Diction drifts slightly ornate for 600-word scope but matches temple grandeur; perceptual signature consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High figurative density but patterned: “stone and dust,” “slow tide,” “graceful collapse” echo and repay at closure. No synonym loops or scaffold; rhythm breathes with collapse tempo. Strong verbs, sensory nouns, minimal filters. Final line “ancient stones sang a low hymn” clinches aural echo cleanly. Micro-flaw: occasional stacked modifiers (“regally unpretentious crown of faded glyphs”) but not obscuring.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fusing titanic scale with library dust feels fresh; ink pellet as truth engine repurposes mundane material. “Rune of drift” concept drives plot rather than wallpaper. Mythic collapse turned renewal avoids apocalypse cliché. Risk is coherent—cosmic stakes miniaturized via 600-word lyric arc—clarity intact. Tiny echo of Borges/“Library of Babel” keeps it sub-9.</comment>
