<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Lysander’s motives are lyrically stated but never sharpened into a concrete contradiction; the “centuries-old betrayal” stays abstract, so the final swap feels symbolic rather than personally costly. Interiority is lush but generic—no micro-choice shows him weighing real loss. The closure beat (“his own soul expand”) is told, not embodied. Competence dominates; struggle is cosmetic.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the spire’s thaw reweights the world’s rule-set and the village children inherit wonder—cost is legible in the melting ice that can never be refrozen. Causality is lyric-accumulative rather than strict because/therefore, but the pattern is taught early and holds. Orientation is swift; the sky-wrong cue anchors time. One meaningful tightening occurs when the final queen swap cracks the frost—sufficient for 600-word scale.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Ice, altitude, and twilight are filtered through Lysander’s artisan gaze; every detail (velvet coat, brass lid, melt-water ink) either constrains tactics or charges the final thaw. The spire itself functions as micro-setting—its ledge, gears, and frost dictate pacing and bodily risk. Sensory hierarchy favors touch and sound over postcard vistas. Environment is not backdrop; it is the antagonist that melts at cost.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“amend the curse”—is signaled early and narrows to the final swap. Pressure escalates via accumulative texture: each chess release softens ice audibly, a audible countdown. Yet the cost is borne by the world, not the protagonist; personal stakes remain abstract. Sufficient tightening for this length, but not viscerally felt.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme—memory as playable, theft as restoration—emerges through the chess-swap ritual rather than exposition. The pocket lid’s returning lullaby reweights the meaning of “thief” into archivist-bard. No moral is declared; the village children’s new dreams supply quiet resonance. Avoids tidy binaries between crime and gift.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays tightly anchored to Lysander’s artisan perception; diction (“sacredly playful,” “cautious abandon”) is consistent and voice-driven. Syntax modulates—long breathless clauses for ascent, staccato swaps for tension. No dialogue, so no voice leakage. Perceptual signature is distinct: wind-read, gear-song, frost-under-boot.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is lush but disciplined: each sentence advances image or tactic. Only minor loop—“each exchange felt like a prayer” echoes prior “silent amendment”—slows momentum. Metaphors stay coherent within ice/gear lexicon. Read-aloud rhythm propels toward the thaw.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Fantasy tropes—thief-hero, cursed spire—are retooled through tactile miniatures (chess vaults) and inverse theft (restoration). The pocket sundial lid’s lullaby mechanic is fresh and indispensable to closure. Risk-taking lies in lyric accumulation rather than twist, but coherence never buckles. Specificity of melt-water ink and gear-song prevents generic feel.</comment>
