<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Mara’s blindness and methodical nature are asserted repeatedly but never dramatized through tactile choices that risk failure; the only concrete action—tracing names—could be done by anyone. Her “dormant empathy” is declared, not embodied in a beat where she might refuse or regret something tangible. The promised contradiction between method and tenderness stays theoretical, so the final awakening feels unearned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The accumulative/textural lens holds: each brushstroke and echo layers density until the quarry literally cracks open the names, a clean Conceptual Repricing. Orientation is swift, causality is lyric rather than plot-driven, and the closing image reweights the premise. Still, the lack of a visible cost to Mara—no brush dropped, no cut finger—keeps the closure from stinging.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The quarry is never generic: mist breathes, stone inhales sorrow, the ribbon glints like blood. These details are filtered through Mara’s fingers and memory, anchoring every beat. The final fissure and tear on the rock are tactile consequences that charge the closing image, satisfying the 9+ gate for setting-as-constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Stake—giving the vanished names back to air—is clear and poetic, but pressure escalates only atmospherically: mist thickens, stone cracks. Mara’s agency is entirely interior; she never faces a live dilemma or trade-off. Because no option is ever foreclosed, the cost feels conceptual rather than felt, capping escalation at the lyric threshold.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: erasure versus reclamation, sight versus touch. The ribbon’s return as glinting tear is a perfect non-literal answer. Avoids overt thesis, but the concept of “awakening empathy in stone” is voiced once and drifts toward anthropomorphic shorthand, nudging it down from resonance into decoration.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays tight to Mara’s fingertip scale, with sentence rhythms that mimic slow brushwork. Filter verbs are minimal; metaphors (“lance of pigment”) serve the battlefield conceit. No head-hop, no register drift; the voice is consistent, compressed, and teaches its pattern early enough to carry the final crack.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is textured but disciplined: each sentence either advances the canvas or the quarry’s breathing. One paraphrase loop (“stone…stone…stone” in adjacent clauses) and a soft near-churn of “echo”/“hush”/“whisper” slightly dull the ear. Otherwise clean, vivid, and read-aloud rhythmic with no closure-touching artifacts.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The face-blind portraitist who paints the missing dead onto stone is a fresh synthesis; the quarry as witness rather than grave is an elegant inversion. Risk is taken with lyric accumulation over plot, and it largely pays off. The concept stays specific to this site and this touch, resisting template drift.</comment>
