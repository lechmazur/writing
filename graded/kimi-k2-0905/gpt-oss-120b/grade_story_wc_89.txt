<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Liora’s yearning for Arion is vivid, but interiority drifts into lyric summary (“cosmic intimacy,” “infinite bond”) that tells us depth rather than showing contradictory impulses under pressure; no micro-choice after the antler-touch registers a felt cost or irreversible trade-off, so the transformation reads as fated, not earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the mutual touch reconfigures both beings and forecloses pure human life for Liora with visible bark skin. Causality holds under Accumulative/Textural lens—each spice-gathering beat thickens moonlit mood until the veil thins—but the cookie fortune functions as ornamental echo rather than causal trigger, slightly blunting the decisive moment.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Orchard is rendered through selective sensory triage: violet glow on jars, moonlight painting leaves silver, scent curling like starlight. These details double as pressure tools—spice jars hum, moonlight dictates ritual timing—so environment actively enables the transformation rather than merely decorating it.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reforge bond beyond death—is signaled early and tightens when spice paste risks turning her bones to bark. However, escalation is atmospheric, not tactical; no alternative path is foreclosed on the page, so the cost feels prospective rather than paid, keeping pressure below the 8-band threshold.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of eternal reciprocity emerges through reciprocal embodiment rather than statement; final image of nightly spice offering crystallizes the cycle without moralizing. Subtext would sharpen if the cookie fortune’s ambiguity re-entered to reweight the permanence of her choice, but the piece avoids overt thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Liora’s perceptual filter: moonlight as pulse, orchard as breath. Syntax lengthens and softens under awe, then compresses at the touch—“cosmos contract”—mirroring emotional crest. No head-hopping; diction remains within her mythic register throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose is lush but disciplined: each metaphor extends the moon-fire-plant axis; no mixed vehicles. Occasional cadence loops—“ever steady, ever loving, ever bound”—slow final momentum; a 0.3 deduction for ornamental triad that repeats prior beat without new pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Fusion of phoenix aftermath, permanent moon, and reluctant arborification feels fresh; the mutual metamorphosis into shared hybrid flips the usual “taming the beast” trope into mutual surrender. Risk lies in high lyric mode, but specificity of spice scents and bark skin keeps it from generic fairy-tale pastiche.</comment>
