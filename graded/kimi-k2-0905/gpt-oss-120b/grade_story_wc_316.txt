<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Kael’s numbness and paradox-blade are vivid, but interiority drifts into label-speak (“defeat emotional numbness,” “complementary opposites”) that tells rather than embodies. The micro-choice to cut the jar lands, yet the prior beats feel pre-decided, muting contradictory impulse. Earned cost is present—the cracked glass and shared pulse—but the arc’s emotional risk is cushioned by abstract diction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure is clean: the slice frees the Duplicate, rewrites history, and charges Kael with felt twin pulse—visible cost under a Causal lens. Orientation anchors by line 4; transitions are smooth. One tightening beat suffices. No causality breaks, though the factions’ off-stage shouting is thin motivation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Floating basalt, luminous fluid, and shifting chronologies are sharply sensed and filter through Kael’s body. The dojo’s spatial choreography stays coherent; the jar’s glass constrains the final act. Weather/history-rewrite could press choices harder, but the setting still mirrors internal thaw. Enough specificity for 8-band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore feeling—is signaled early and tightened when the blade actually cracks containment; options narrow from “guard or free” to “merge and share.” Factions supply external pressure, but their threat stays verbal; still, the protagonist’s agency drives the decisive turn and pays an on-page physical price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of reintegration after ego-death emerges through the Duplicate’s awakening rather than thesis statements. Final image of twin pulses offers resonant reconfiguration without moralizing. Occasional abstractions (“vivify dead parts”) slightly dilute subtext, yet the silence-versus-slash pairing keeps complexity alive.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Third-person lingers close to Kael’s sensory filter; diction stays controlled and rhythmic. Paradox-blade metaphor is sustained without overwriting. No dialogue to test voice distinction, but internal cadence modulates under pressure. One register drift: “conceptual repricing” voice sneaks in, but it doesn’t contaminate peak beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Prose is lean, with strong verbs and varied sentence rhythm; only minor paraphrase loops (“slice through pretense” repeated). Metaphors stay coherent; no mixed vehicles. One filter-verb cluster around “felt a surge,” but it clears quickly. Clean copy, high density, momentum intact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Ego-death plus floating dojo clone custody feels fresh, yet the piece grounds abstraction in sensory stakes. Paradox-blade as non-metal concept is risky but paid off through the final crack. Could edge higher if faction politics were more than backdrop, but the synthesis still reframes familiar tropes with earned specificity.</comment>
