<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mara’s embodied memories of the wreck and her tactile handling of the fork/case give credible interiority; the promise “to rectify the silence” supplies a legible want. Yet the story never forces her to test that motive against a real trade-off—no live option is accepted or refused—so the arc feels observational rather than crucible-forged. The final smile is earned by imagery, not by a prior micro-choice that costs her anything visible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the conservatory exhales into song while the device’s steady glow signals a lasting, costly vigil. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory layer (frost, copper lattice, rose-veined glass) thickens until the final chord reweights the silence. Causality is light—no beat narrows options—but the pattern is taught early and paid off in the resonant image, satisfying the lens guardrail.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Winterglass panes, velvet-lined case, and copper filaments are handled, not catalogued; the cold glass warms to rose veins as emotional heat feeds back, marrying setting to body. Spatial choreography is clean: bench → fork → lattice → ceiling reflection tracks without drift. The conservatory’s acoustic properties directly enable the final chord, so environment constrains the outcome, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—“translate silence into music”—is signaled early and deepens through sensory accretion, but no middle beat forces Mara to relinquish or risk anything tangible. Pressure escalates atmospherically (cold → warm, mute → tone) rather than through a narrowed choice or trade-off. The cost is atmospheric, not personal; hence the tightening is present but not visceral enough for the 8.0 band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges via the inversion of silence into audible warmth; no character states a thesis. The refrain “unshaken marvels” moves from abstract hope to embodied beacon, reweighted by the final rose-glow chord. Ambiguity remains—visitors feel “a pull that seemed both alien and intimately familiar”—inviting reflection without sermon. The ending avoids moralizing, offering resonant image rather than lesson.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Mara’s sensory filter; diction (“wild tumble of the sea,” “ghostly harp”) is lyrical yet consistent. Rhythm swells and subsides with the tonal beats, mirroring the fork’s resonance. No dialogue appears, so voice purity is unbroken. The perceptual signature—temperature as emotion—remains distinctive and controlled under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but purposeful: each image advances atmosphere or stakes; no paraphrase loops or scaffold sentences. Metaphors stay coherent within the glass/warmth lexicon. Occasional elevated phrasing (“conceptual repricing,” “resonant reconfiguration”) risks register drift, yet these terms appear outside the POV only in narrative compression, not in peak beats, so clarity holds.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The heat-mapping fork that sings silence into music is a fresh synthesis of steampunk and emotional synesthesia; the winterglass conservatory gives it a crystalline amplifier. While “survivor heals through art” is familiar, the specific device and the glass-warm feedback loop transform the trope. The concept commits fully—no late rule changes—and the final rose-veined chord feels inevitable yet non-obvious.</comment>
