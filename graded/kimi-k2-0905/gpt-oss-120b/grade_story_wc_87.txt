<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied—“his own heart, buoyed by hope yet weighed down by a lingering sorrow”—but the navigator’s contradictory impulses are described more than dramatized; the moment of alignment is declared rather than shown through a visible micro-choice that costs him something tangible. The “promise to the wind” is too abstract to register as a renunciation that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the compass steadies, the sea offers acceptance, and the stance shift is legible. Causality is lyric-accumulative rather than because/therefore; the tightening is the sunrise dissolving sorrow, a pattern break that reweights stakes. Cost is felt—“regrets would always linger”—but the price is conceptual, not dramatized on-page in the final beat. The drive lens holds, yet the price could be more viscerally attached to the closing image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Setting is selective and POV-filtered: damp planks, rusted utility-pole arms, liquid-glass bay. The astronomical compass functions as micro-setting/tool that constrains choice; its final steady tick charges the closing image. Spatial choreography is clean; no white-room syndrome. Weather and light evolve with the emotional arc, mirroring internal shift without overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—aligning heart and action—signals early and tightens once at sunrise when sorrow dissolves. Escalation is textural: density of light, water, compass steadiness reweights the stake. Conflict is internal; no external antagonist or reversible loss beyond regret. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral, acceptable under accumulative lens but keeps pressure shy of 8-band intensity.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: navigation as self-forgiveness, regrets as tide to ride. No explicit moral; final image of steady ember reconfigures prior flickering faith. Subtext resides in compass silence and water applause—gesture, not statement. Avoids sentimentality, yet insight is slightly generalized; greater specificity in the final reprise could deepen resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lyric third-person close stays consistent; perceptual signature is maritime and elegiac—“sea breeze felt merrily melancholic.” Syntax is rhythmic, sentence lengths vary, diction stays within navigator’s plausible lexicon. No dialogue to judge; voice remains singular and uncompressed. Filter verbs are few and purposeful; no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm is fluid; sentence openings vary, no template cadence. Figurative language is dense—sunrise painting, liquid glass—but pattern is taught early and pays off in final image. No mixed metaphors or paraphrase loops. One minor scaffold: “flickering faith” is repeated four times without new inflection; still, it charges closure, so penalty is modest.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Premise—navigator using utility poles at sea—is fresh and grounded. Trope of redemption-via-nature is transformed through specific maritime detail and compass micro-setting. Risk is lyrical compression rather than plot twist; coherence holds. Could push further into idiosyncratic detail—voice, regionalism, or sharper surprise—to reach 8+ band.</comment>
