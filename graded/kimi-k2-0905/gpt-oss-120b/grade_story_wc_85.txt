<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid—body feels the watch hand “warm in my palm” and guilt is rendered as a physical ledger—but the shift from mercenary to penitent relies on a single abstract phrase rather than a visible forfeit. The final renunciation is present but the cost is only asserted (“weight…lifted”), not dramatized; still, the voice-specific shame carries the arc convincingly.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the watch-hand pressed to wood reconfigures the protagonist’s future practice under a Resonant Reconfiguration of “honest memory.” Causal chain holds—envelope summons → driftwood sift → phrase emerges → hand set down—though the envelope’s gold promise never meets an on-page forfeiture, slightly blunting cost legibility.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The cobalt terrace and the watch hand both constrain choice and charge the final image; their return in the last paragraph reweights earlier dusk light as a moral mirror. Selective sensory layering (“sieved hush,” “wood sang”) keeps description lean while anchoring spatial logic on the sand.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.7</question><comment>Single dominant stake—guilt vs. need for truth—tightens when the driftwood phrase strips the protagonist’s professional armor. The meaningful turn occurs at the carving alignment, yet escalation is more accumulative/textural than causal; the price is felt but not externally tested.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: “manufactured lineages” versus the irreducible weight of withheld truth. The driftwood phrase and watch hand serve as non-literal rebuttal to the protagonist’s trade, avoiding moralizing; the aftertaste is a credible ethical repricing rather than a stated lesson.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>First-person voice is consistent, compressed, and lyrical without purple drift; diction like “sieved hush” is pattern-taught early and paid off at the humming wood. Syntax mirrors the narrator’s professional cataloguing habit, then loosens into remorseful cadence once the phrase is found—an intentional modulation that heightens pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong rhythmic variety and high information density; occasional stacked modifiers (“night-black water,” “tempered regret”) flirt with overwriting but never obscure causality. One template loop—“the weight of…” repeated in adjacent sentences—dulls momentum slightly before the close.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The “false genealogies” premise feels fresh, and the driftwood archive literalizes memory in a tactile way. While the guilt-to-redemption arc is familiar, the synthesis of watch-hand key and tidal ledger gives it a memorable slant; could push deeper into societal stakes for sharper originality.</comment>
