<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is lush but abstract; “retrocognitively trapped” is announced, never dramatized in a micro-choice that costs her. The single observable decision—whispering thanks to the garden—feels like gratitude, not a crucible that forecloses a path. No contradictory impulse is played out in scene, so the ending’s “witness” stance reads as serene rather than earned renunciation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the maze stands complete, photographs gone, scent of memory left—cost is felt. Causality is Accumulative/Textural: each sensorial layer dissolves into the next until the final image reweights the stake. The lens holds, but the poem-like drift never tightens once; pressure plateaus rather than escalates, keeping the score below 8.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setting is the story’s engine: the breathing bridge, sine-wave hedges, and mist-borne photographs constrain every perception. Hyperbolic corridors and heartbeat-responsive leaves make space itself a tactical obstacle. The garden’s final luminescent arch is inseparable from the closure image, easily clearing the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Stake—“dissolve the boundaries between memory and moment”—is signaled early and never shifts. Pressure is ambient, not tightening; the child’s wonder is lovely but doesn’t narrow Mara’s options or raise cost. No visible price is extracted from the protagonist, so escalation stays moderate.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges as the tactile fragility of time; fading photographs and dissolving pigments carry it without sermon. The final scent-of-memory image offers a resonant, non-literal answer. Some symbolic layering (halo fragment, hyperbolic geometry) remains ornamental, preventing the leap to 9.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Mara’s synesthetic perception: “trembling fabric that resonated with both loss and renewal.” Rhythm swells and ebbs with the garden’s breath, no head-hopping. Occasional elevated diction (“mutable sanctuary,” “conceptual truths”) slightly overshoots character lexicon, holding below 9.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Sentence music is deliberate—long breathy clauses mimic vine-webs, then snap to short beats: “She whispered.” No loops or scaffold; every line adds sensory or causal layer. A few abstract nouns (“texture of time”) could be traded for concrete images, keeping it from full 9.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fusing hyperbolic garden mazes with retrocognitive synesthesia feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric accumulation pays off when the final arch blooms from dissolved photographs. The concept commits fully—no retreat to puzzle-box clichés—earning the high band.</comment>
