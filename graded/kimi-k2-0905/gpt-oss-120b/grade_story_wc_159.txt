<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Interiority is lyrical but abstract—“foxglove regret,” “violet sorrow” diagnose emotion rather than embody it. No contradictory impulses are staged in scene; the caretaker’s ritual is serene repetition, never forced to choose or lose. The final “softer shade” of regret is asserted, not dramatized; cost is atmospheric, not felt.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of nightly ritual → traveler arrival → rekindled echo. Closure is a Charged Poise (caretaker resumes, now with traveler-carried names) and carries conceptual cost—her labor is endless. Orientation is swift; transitions are fluid within the single shard. No meaningful tightening inside the ritual itself; escalation is additive, not decisive.</comment>

<comment>“Glass orchids,” “opal panes,” “suspended vellum” create tactile, luminous micro-setting. Light refracting through cracked bamboo into “translucent organ” is specific and re-used at climax. Cloud-parchment beyond the window situates the library above the world without exposition dump. Spatial choreography is clean; objects are handled, not catalogued.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—preserve forgotten names—is declared early but never tested; no obstacle threatens the ritual. Pressure is ambient (feelings fade) rather than immediate. Traveler’s arrival adds resonance yet changes nothing for the caretaker’s tactics or risk. One gentle deepening—names leave with traveler—but no option is foreclosed, no price exacted on page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of memory’s cyclical fragility emerges through repeated light-and-echo imagery rather than statement. Final image of “choir of resurrected echoes” reweights earlier ritual as communal, not solitary. Avoids explicit moral; ambiguity remains whether preservation equals restoration. Some abstraction—“museum of extinct feelings”—skirts sentimentality but stays evocative.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays close to caretaker’s hush-paced attention; diction (“pale light seeped,” “shy star”) is consistent. Rhythm lengthens with candle glow, shortens with wind crack—tight sonic control. No dialogue, so no voice clash. Register never drifts; perceptual signature is filtered through her gentle, meticulous gaze.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is lush yet generally precise; occasional perfume—“bittersweet ache that made each breath taste of violet sorrow”—edges purple. No loops or scaffold; sentences vary in length and opening. Figurative chain sustained across entire piece without mixed metaphors. High density, but ornamental layer occasionally slows propulsion in mid-paragraph.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Museum of extinct feelings + cloud-top opal library is fresh synthesis; not a trope rehash. Ritual of recording names into glass orchids feels invented yet inevitable. Traveler arrival is expected beat, but orchid gift re-circulates sound outward, expanding premise. Risk is lyric stasis rather than plot surprise, yet concept commits fully.</comment>
