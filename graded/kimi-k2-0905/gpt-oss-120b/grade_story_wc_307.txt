<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Mira’s reversed-aging biology is vivid as a condition, but it never alters her micro-choices under pressure; the withheld revelation is a cerebral decision, not a beat where her body forces a trade-off. The stakes are emotional, not corporeal, so the curse stays ornamental. Interiority is poetic but lacks contradictory impulse during the actual grotto confrontation; the moment of “smiling” at the mirror feels grafted on, not earned by prior visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: the stone→rings→magnetic hum pattern accretes meaning toward the grotto mirror. Closure is a quiet Conceptual Repricing: Mira re-labels her curse as teachable art, with conceptual cost legible in the phrase “the art of appearing just as one chose to vanish.” However, the delayed-reveal mechanic is told rather than demonstrated in-scene; the causal chain is metaphoric, not consequential. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are clear within 120 words, satisfying the test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Environment is selective and atmospheric: floating rock, obsidian cliff, iron filings, ozone scent—all filtered through Mira’s meditative attention. The magnetic grotto itself becomes a micro-setting that physically pulls her body, constraining her final stance. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible positions. The sycamore hush functions as a recurring auditory object that charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate for setting-as-constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—transform the curse into teachable vanishing—is signaled early. Pressure deepens via pattern accumulation rather than options narrowing; the grotto’s mirror is the first concrete test, offering a conceptual rather than tactical reversal. Cost is conceptual (she must accept perpetual disappearance-in-appearance), but not viscerally felt on-page; no resource is forfeited. Escalation is textured, not causal; sufficient for length, but not charged enough to breach 8.0.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: the paradox that mastery of appearance requires embracing disappearance. The pond-ring cipher and mirror reprise reweight“vanishing” from curse to craft without explicit moral. Subtext is carried through imagery (stone, rings, iron filings) rather than assertion. Final smile crystallizes the reconfiguration, avoiding sermon; ambiguity lingers about what “teaching vanishing” will cost her students—nice thematic leak.</comment>

<comment>Third-person lyric voice sustains a hushed, incantatory rhythm that mirrors the trance state. Perceptual signature is consistent: Mira notices magnetic pulls, sycamore breath, concentric ripples—never generic catalog. Syntax favors elongated, breath-coordinated clauses; no template cadence. Compression and elision (“she whispered to the wind…”) are pattern-taught early and paid off in the mirrored grotto scene; closure remains legible.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and musical; figuratives are disciplined—no mixed metaphors. Rhythmic variety supports trance momentum; paragraph cuts are clean. Only minor loop risk: “sycamore hush” repeated thrice could feel incantatory or redundant, but each reprise shifts context (dawn, chamber, final image), so it accrues rather than loops. No filter-verb stacks; no artifacts touch closure. Read-aloud ear test passes.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>The reverse-aging + magnetic grotto + pond-cipher synthesis feels fresh; not a template plot. Transformation test fails—core arc could survive with different metaphors—but the specificity of magnetic filings as night-moths and rings read as growth rings lends memorable sensory signature. Delayed revelation as physical practice (withholding perception) is a Conceptual Repricing twist rarely dramatized. Risk is moderate; reward coherence high.</comment>
