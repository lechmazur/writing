<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Liora’s interiority glows: the “restless curiosity” against “ancient rituals” is shown, not told, and her micro-choice to align prism with frost is a value-revealing act. The embodied grief pulse and engine-sputter provide external confirmation of internal shift. Only the “vow to share” feels slightly abstract; a concrete next risk would clinch full cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The causal chain (prism → frost → grief → engine → road) is lucid and each link tightens the previous. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the prism’s new glow is an undeniable social cost—the world must now feel what objects hid. Orientation is nailed in line 2; no caps triggered. The “truthful lie” refrain could have been reprised in the final sentence to seal lens consistency at 9+.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Quartz arbor, dew-slick vines, and frost filigree are tactile and POV-filtered; the windshield becomes a micro-setting that literally rewrites the car’s interior. Mist and engine vibration evolve with the beat, constraining breath and sound. Only the sedan’s “plain road” feels generic; a single rust streak or cracked mirror would have kept the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—prove objects hold emotion—tightens when frost veins bloom and grief pulses; the cost is the traveler’s memory now loosed into world. Agency is crystalline: Liora’s alignment act, not luck, triggers every escalation. One more visible price (cracked prism facet, blood-warm glass) would push to 9+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the prism’s color-spill: memory is not private but migratory. The truthful-lie paradox is embodied in frost that is both ice and light, never exposited. Final image of “shadows lengthened and brightened” offers resonant, non-moral answer to the stakes. Avoids thematic echo perfectly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person lyric sustains a mystic, slightly archaic diction (“commune,” “arbor,” “veil of silver”) without purple drift. Perceptual signature is sharp: Liora notices facet-to-frost fit like “teeth in a secret lock.” Rhythm modulates—long breathy clauses build to engine cough—without monotony. One near-slip: “truth wrapped in paradox” flirts with abstract label but is saved by sonic chant context.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm is varied; sentence openings rotate across participle, prepositional, and subject-start patterns. No loops or synonym churn; “shifted hush” returns only to reweight meaning. Figurative density is high but patterned early, so payoff justifies risk. Minor tightening: “the truth of her hypothesis crystallized” is tell-ish; a physical shard-image could have shown it.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The fusion of mineral emotion-storage with frost-interface is fresh, not trope-mined. Conceptual risk—emotion as transferable mineral lattice—commits fully and follows to social cost. Specificity of quartz arbor plus battered sedan yokes mystic and mundane in a way that would collapse if relocated. Only the “truthful lies” refrain feels lightly borrowed; its payoff redeploys in light rather than statement.</comment>
