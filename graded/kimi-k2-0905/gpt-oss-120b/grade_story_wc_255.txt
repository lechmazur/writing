<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Selene’s “innocently cunning” trait is shown through micro-choices—arranging ferns, coaxing ivy—but interiority drifts into lyrical abstraction (“fractured palette of her own sight”) that tells rather than embodies contradiction. The final renunciation of perfection is earned by the reed-driven pattern, yet the cost is only asserted, not felt in a concrete forfeiture on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the courtyard glass flowers sprout, reweighting imperfection as luminous. Causality is lyric-accumulative; each plant arrangement tightens Selene’s perceptual stake, but the reed’s rule-set is taught late and the phoenix clock stays ornamental, so the cost is conceptually visible yet not viscerally paid on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>The courtyard’s mirrored shards, furnace breath, and reed’s metallic sigh are filtered through Selene’s synesthetic bias, constraining her color-bartering tactics. Glass surfaces evolve from reflecting sunrise to sprouting new flowers, integrating setting into the final image with causal specificity.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—trading perfect sight for imperfect wonder—tightens through each plant-reed transaction; the teal chord and night-cereus circle are visible tightenings. Escalation is accumulative: each hue confessed narrows her palette toward acceptance; the final glass garden crystallizes the cost, though the phoenix remains an ambient intensifier rather than active pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of imperfect grace emerges from the reed’s metallic sighs and cracked vase, never sermonized. The final image of name-spectrum glass flowers reconfigures beauty as fracture without moralizing, inviting counter-readings of disability as alternative sight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays tight to Selene’s synesthetic perception; diction (“shards of sunrise,” “breathing spine”) is consistent and character-bound. Sentence rhythm mimics brushstroke cadence, modulating under pressure without head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is lush yet selective; no loops or scaffold. Occasional stacked modifiers (“folded metal surfaces shimmering like a tongue ready to speak”) risk density but serve the reed’s animate logic and do not obscure the final image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Colorblind painter bartering hues from plant-whispers via concertina reed is a fresh synthesis; the reed-as-translator transforms a steampunk trope into perceptual prosthesis. Imperfection-as-beauty is familiar, but the synesthetic barter system makes the angle inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
