<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The exorcist’s guilt and need to apologize feel genuine, but interiority leans on abstract perfume/”induced currents” shorthand rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. Micro-choices (placing bottle, arranging pages) are present yet read ritualized rather than risky; cost is declared (“weight of ash”) more than dramatized. Relationship with Mara is off-stage memory only, so status crucible and secondary pressure bullets don’t activate. Closure choice—whisper apology into orchard wind—earns some credit as renunciation, but causality to prior flaws is thin.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: orchard hush + perfume bridge crystallize options and felt cost. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—repetitions of scent, music, pages build until cadence shifts in the final “exhaled chord.” Orientation clean by line 3. One causal gap: why the perfume current now works after years is asserted not shown, but does not break closure. One meaningful tightening: apology sheet drifts down, reweighting stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Sheet-music archive and orchard outside act as micro-setting polarity—archive’s sealed silence vs. imminent axe—guiding her decision to externalize apology into open air. Piano lid, stacked scores, blue glow of currents give tactile props that constrain ritual choreography. Sensory hierarchy favors sound/olfactory detail, reflecting exorcist’s professional bias. Final image of archive exhaling chord recharges the setting-as-witness, meeting 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (deliver apology) signaled in para 3. Escalation via accumulative pattern: each scent/music beat thickens regret until apology sheet falls—visible price that narrows future silence. Agency is attention/ritual endurance rather than external fight; still forecloses path to inaction. Cost is atmospheric yet legible—orchidgeist accepts permanent relational loss while sound-carrying wind remains.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of “imperfect miracles” emerges concretely through cracked mirror metaphor and finally through flawed yet lingering musical apology—avoids moralizing. Subtext in silence of falling trees and paper-chord aftermath invites reader to weigh absolution without reply. No echoic thesis line; final image reweights earlier gossip-as-exorcism concept with undeniable social cost. Complexity kept: apology may never reach Mara, keeping theme ambiguous.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Lyric-ritual voice sustains perceptual signature—musicological diction, scent-as-sound synesthesia—without generic tics. Distance stable in single floating POV; compressions (“hush pressed against panes”) intentional. One filter-verb cluster (“smelled of…smelled of…”) but not in peak beat, so 9+ not disallowed. Dialogue absent; no penalty.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Rhythm modulates: long aromatic clauses build, then shorten into axe-fall cadence. Figurative density high but patterned early (induced currents metaphor taught), so avoids purple overwrite penalty. One minor scaffold: “metaphor…metaphor” restatement. Mixed logic in “induced currents pulsed…like prayer”—electric vs spiritual metaphor mash, but does not cloud closure. Strong final line anchors echo cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Gossip-exorcist who heals via perfumed music archive offers fresh synthesis of occult & archival subcultures. Core risk—lyric accumulation over external plot—holds without gimmickry. Transformation test: if bottle/archive replaced, ritual mechanics collapse, proving element specificity. Risk distinction +0.3 for committing to scent-as-electricity magic without exposition.</comment>
