<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Interiority is sensorily anchored and embodied; the “pearl of stillness” device gives her a usable, character-specific ritual. No contradictory impulse is shown in-scene—grief never fights against her resolve—so the arc is smooth but not razor-sharged. The photograph touch supplies a micro-choice that tilts stance, earning the moderate change. Voice stays coherent, but the absence of visible flaw or mistake keeps her just shy of live-wire complexity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the final step toward the cliff reconfigures options with felt cost—she chooses to plant hope while still carrying the photo’s wound. Lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern (wind, salt, plant life) intensifies and cadence pivots on “shared pause.” Orientation is clear by line 6; no causality breaks. A single tightening suffices for this length, but the cost is present and legible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Arboretum and body-as-setting constrain movement: wind tugs needles across skin, bench placement dictates pause, cliff edge forces final stance. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true—she catalogs scent, texture, breath in priority order. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from shaded walk to stone bench to cliff lip. Environment is not a postcard; it supplies the tactile cues that trigger her somatic safety markers.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will she stay frozen in trauma or risk renewed engagement—is signaled early. Escalation is textural: each gust, scent, and gull call layers density until the “pearl” swells; this deepening reweights the stake without external plot reversals. Cost is visible: she steps toward the precipice while still clutching the damaged photo, foreclosing retreat into pure detachment. Agency is present but lyrical; a single meaningful intensification meets the 800-word threshold.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through iterated natural images rather than statement: wind-blown lavender, scarred sapling, and tidal pulse quietly argue that life persists past ruin. The promise whispered to the oak is the only overt articulation, but it is earned through prior sensory pattern. Ambiguity remains—hope is planted, not guaranteed—avoiding moralistic tie-off. Final image of shared breath between woman and world reconfigures meaning without slogan.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays close to sensorium, diction within plausible reach of a trauma-honed observer. Syntax modulates: longer cadences for stillness, clipped fragments (“She called that moment a pearl”) under spike of memory. No head-hop; perceptual signature is consistent. Filter verbs are minimal and voice-motivated; rhythm breathes with her measured steps.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose is dense but not overcrowded; most sentences carry dual duty (e.g., “The gardens were a tapestry…” anchors setting + metaphor). Two adjacent “wind” sentences near midpoint verge on paraphrase but diverge in function; minor loop, not closure-touched. Mixed-metaphor risk (“map of loss and hope”) is brief and contextually grounded. Final paragraph varies cadence effectively, closing on an image that recharges “pearl” without textual clutter.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</comment><comment>Premise—drone-strike wedding survivor finding somatic stillness in coastal arboretum—combines familiar trauma-recovery with fresh ecological framing. “Pearl of stillness” as internal safety technology feels particular, not imported self-help jargon. Transformation test fails if relocated to generic garden, proving specificity. Risk is moderate; lyric accumulation substitutes for plot shock, but coherence holds.</comment>
