<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara’s contradictory impulses—clinging to wonder yet bartering it away—surface only in summary; no single beat shows both desires colliding. The ghost never applies counter-pressure; it merely hovers, so her final vow feels pre-decided. Interiority is vivid (“tears slipped…beads of regret that finally found a place to rest”), but the embodied cost is stated, not dramatized in a micro-choice. Still, the erosion-of-ambition arc stays coherent and individual.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the lagoon stills, the ghost smiles, the camera wheel becomes a relic—cost is felt in the tense hush. Causality under Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each collected story-stitch visibly thickens the ghost until the swap is inevitable. Orientation is taught late but pays off at the final image, so no penalty. The one transition (platform → horizon walk) is legible; no prop or rule breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The kinetic lagoon’s metallic ripples and cracked brass platform constrain footing and mirror Mara's eroded drive; the camera wheel’s cracked barrel becomes the ritual conduit. Sensory triage is POV-driven—she notices rust, mist-whispers, not tourist vistas. Spatial choreography is clean: she stands, kneels, places the wheel, exits. The carousel’s golden-memory payoff recharges the early rust description, earning the high band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“trade regret for one true memory”—is signaled early and tightens exactly once when the ghost brightens at her offer. The price (permanent carry of strangers’ stories) is declared but not felt in a concrete later restriction; tactics don’t change after payment. Still, the swap is irreversible and frame-final, satisfying the lens. No false escalation or coincidence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of reclaimed wonder emerges through image-chain: rust → golden carousel light → lagoon’s luminous arc; no thesis states it. The ghost as younger self keeps ambiguity—companion or conscience—inviting counter-readings. Final image of “eroded ambitions now sprouting fresh roots” reweights prior despair without moralizing. Sentiment is skirted because the cost (lifelong burden of others’ stories) remains implicit.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person POV stays tight to Mara’s perceptual filter—“chronologically confused,” attuned to mechanical clicks and vapor voices. Syntax lengthens under emotion, then fractures in the final line, mirroring her realigned clock. No head-hop; diction stays within her scavenger lexicon. The lyric cadence is consistent and purposeful, never drifting into generic epic tone.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm varies from pulsing anaphora to clipped final stride, propelling the accumulative design. Mixed metaphors are avoided; “metallic heart,” “quilt of regrets,” “golden ribbons” all orbit the machine-versus-memory axis. One scaffold paraphrase (“each ripple a silent testimony to the passing of time”) is permitted under lyric license and does not recur. No loops or register drift in the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The “carousel above the clouds” and bartering memories for stories feels fresh, not standard retro-fantasy. Ambition erosion is shown via tactile scavenged objects rather than told. Final inversion—regret as fertilizer—grows organically from lagoon imagery. Risk in chronological disorientation is taught early and paid off, meriting the bonus.</comment>
