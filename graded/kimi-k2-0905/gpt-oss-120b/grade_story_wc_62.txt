<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Eliam’s meditative nature is evoked lyrically, but interiority stays abstract (“a fiercely meditative river”) without embodied contradiction under pressure; no micro-choice shows him risking error or revising tactics, so the arc feels observed rather than earned. The sister and villagers remain off-stage, so relationship crucible is absent. Closure relies on symbolic recognition, not a decision that costs him anything visible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of ribbon + butterfly + poem accretes meaning until the basin stone “sings.” Closure lands as Charged Poise—the heart-shaped ribbon river reconfigures grief into shared artifact—cost is conceptual (grief made public/flowing) rather than personal to Eliam. Orientation is clear early; causality between spiral stones and ribbon length is loose but acceptable under lyric pattern. No decisive change or renunciation by protagonist keeps it below 8.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Greenhouse glass, humidity, stone table, and shifting dusk light are tactile and filter through Eliam’s carver gaze; cracked panes and jasmine/metal scent anchor every beat. Spatial tracking stays coherent as butterflies converge at the arch and stones spiral outward. The ribbon river finale charges the central image, satisfying the 9+ gate for setting-object that constrains final form.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—render collective grief legible—is signaled early. Pressure escalates texturally: each butterfly wave and ribbon hue thickens the pattern, but Eliam’s agency is limited to observation and arrangement; no moment forces a hard trade-off or irreversible risk. The tightening is aesthetic, not tactical, so cost remains communal and conceptual rather than personal and felt.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—grief as migratory, communal tapestry—emerges through accreted images of butterflies, ribbons, poems, flowing water; no explicit thesis is stated. Final basin that “sings” offers resonant reconfiguration without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers about whether sorrow is eased or merely made beautiful, sustaining aftertaste. Slight abstraction in Eliam’s interiority keeps it from higher band.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Third-person lyric voice maintains steady perceptual signature of stone-carver: light “slips,” stone “shivers,” ribbon “hums.” Syntax lengthens and softens to mimic dusk diffusion; diction stays concrete and tactile. No dialogue appears, so voice contamination risk is zero. Occasional loft (“spectral mentorship,” “thundering calm”) edges toward poetic abstraction but remains internally consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is lush yet selective; each sentence layers image or sound without paraphrase loops. Mixed metaphors (“flock of butterflies” carrying sorrow fragments) risk conceptual clutter but stay legible. Filter verbs minimal; strong nouns/verbs dominate. Final paragraph achieves rhythmic cadence that mirrors ribbon coiling. One notch below 8+ because metaphor density peaks at closure, slightly dulling causal edge.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Fusion of butterfly migration, gravestone carving, and ribbon archive feels fresh; avoids familiar ghost-story tropes by keeping Mara as gentle breeze rather than plot device. Risk-taking in lyric accumulative structure pays off in resonant final image. Could edge higher with sharper personal cost to Eliam, but conceptual reweighting of collective grief is memorable and non-obvious.</comment>
