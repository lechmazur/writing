<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The painter’s interiority is textured—melancholy, sensory, artist-specific—but remains curiously static; no contradictory impulse is forced to the surface until the final beat, and even then the “promise” is accepted without visible struggle or cost. The shell-key reveal is accepted with trembling fingers but no micro-choice that could have gone another way; thus the arc is more recognition than transformation. Still, the perceptual filter of “colors that linger longer than the tides” keeps the voice from generics.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the glowing shells on the easel reweight the premise, the cost is the secrecy itself—he will keep painting alone—so the lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds. The wrong-turn-into-oasis is coincidence, but it complicates rather than resolves, satisfying Situational allowance. Orientation is clean by line 3; no因果链断裂. The only drag is a mild “and-then” feel between cave nodes, but each node adds density, so escalation remains coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Environment is vivid, selective, painterly: weathered boards, brine-scented air, stalactites as “shattered mirror” echo the cracked mirror without overt symbolism. The quay, cave, and oasis each supply distinct sensory palette and constrain movement—tidal exit, narrow tunnel, enclosed pool—so spatial choreography is clean. The painted shell recurs as micro-setting/object that charges the final image, clearing the 9+ gate for Q3.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“find a moment that will not dissolve”—is signaled early; the tightening occurs when the key proves the moment can be hoarded, narrowing future options to secrecy. Cost is present but abstract (solitude, silence); no concrete loss (time, tool, relationship) is dramatized, so pressure stays lyrical rather than visceral. Sufficient for 7-band, but the lack of a palpable forfeiture keeps it from 8+.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through recurrence of mirrors, shells, and painted light: art as a fragile vessel that traps flux. The final canvas pulsing like a “living reminder” offers Conceptual Repricing—eternity redefined as private, portable, unshared. No moralizing; the silence after the last brushstroke invites the reader to feel the cost of hoarded beauty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>First-person voice is painterly, synesthetic, and rhythmically controlled—syntax lengthens and contracts like tide breath. Filter verbs are minimal; metaphor is integrated (“tunnels twisted like brushstrokes of a tempest”) without purple drift. Perceptual signature is consistent: color, texture, light. No dialogue, so no voice convergence issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet fluid; sentences often carry double duty (image + motion). One paraphrase loop (“each curve revealing a new echo… echo of distant waves”) is minor. No scaffold, no register drift; figurative logic stays coherent. Closure image is crisp, unpolluted by overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>The “hidden oasis that tests aloofness” is a fresh inflection on the artist-sequesters-time trope; the painted shells as lantern-suns feels specific to this painter’s cosmology. Risk is moderate—lyric accumulative structure—but pays off in a resonant final image. Not radically novel, yet the synthesis of cracked mirror / shattered stalactites / shell-canvas is memorable.</comment>
