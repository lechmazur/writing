<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mara’s longing to “restore sacred practices” is stated early and her gentle agency (touching the tendril, playing the lyre) stays consistent. Emotion remains at a single reverent register—no contradiction or embodied cost is staged under pressure—so the arc feels more ritual procession than crucible. The final kneel and whispered promise register as quiet closure, not a path foreclosed with visible price. Characterization is coherent and atmospheric, but the absence of interior friction or risk limits depth.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The causal chain is legible: moon-rise → lyre → pollen → covenant renewed. Orientation is immediate (“edge of the ancient forest… pre-dawn”) and the single scene stays anchored. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—the valley’s “heartbeat” rewoven—yet the cost is communal, not personal, weakening the felt stake for Mara. A lyrical, accumulative design is inferred; escalation is tonal density rather than narrowing options.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Sensory selection is disciplined: dew scent, pine, brass lyre, golden pollen—each filtered through Mara’s tinker-reverence. Micro-setting (the vine-wrapped altar) literally conducts the magic and charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clean; no tourist catalog. The world-rule (moonlight turns silver to gold) is learned through action, not dump. Environment, tool, and body constrain every beat; meets 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Stakes—“restore sacred practices”—are declared, but the valley’s survival is abstract; no concrete loss or ticking malfunction pressures Mara. Escalation is tonal: hush deepens, light brightens, pollen falls; the vine’s response is cooperative, not resistive. Agency remains ritual facilitation rather than problem-solving under duress. The final covenant is restorative, not a trade-off that forecloses an option for Mara.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme—memory as ecological repair—emerges through the recurring motif of song-threads rewoven into living bark. No moral is stated; the final image of “pages of an ancient book turning” reweights the earlier “golden stories” without commentary. Subtext stays implicit: transmission to children hints at cyclical stewardship. Complexity is modest but coherent; resonance lingers in the ear metaphor.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person lyric mode sustains a consistent reverent cadence; diction (“copper-capped finger,” “harvest moon’s promise”) is textured yet within fairy-tale register. No head-hop; psychic distance stable. Filter verbs are minimal; perception stays embodied. Rhythm swells and subsides with the music beat; final line offers quiet cadence closure. Minor template echo in repeated “golden” but pattern feels purposeful.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm is musical; sentence lengths vary, paragraph cuts tight. Few scaffold phrases; one near-loop (“golden stories… golden halo… golden threads”) is earned by motif. Metaphors stay coherent (light = story = pollen). No mixed vehicles or register drift. Information density high; each line does dual atmospheric-character work. Minor prop certainty: lyre origin given in one clause, sufficient for lyric mode.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Familiar “moon-ritual restores nature” frame is refreshed by tactile tinker-tech (brass lyre, copper finger-cap) and synesthetic song-light. Specificity of pollen-as-vow and bark-as-book offers fresh inflection. Risk is tonal rather than structural; nevertheless the piece commits fully to its lyric accumulative design. Not radically novel, but the synthesis of maker-craft and vegetal magic feels particular and memorable.</comment>
