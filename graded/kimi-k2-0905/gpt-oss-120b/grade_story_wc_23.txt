<question>1</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Navigator’s motive is vivid—mapping loss via midnight calls—but she never makes a visible choice that costs her anything; the engine-building is reported, not dramatized, so interior contradiction and embodied cost stay abstract. The censer foot warms in sync with her pulse, yet that correlation is stated, not tested under pressure. A single micro-choice—refuse a coordinate, risk the station—would have pushed this to 7+. </comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: each shard adds density until the final Charged Poise when ships mirror constellations, reweighting the station from outward to inward beacon. The tightening is present—the lattice engine steadies the signal—but the decisive change is lyrical, not causal, and the cost is conceptual rather than felt by a body. Closure valid, but lack of navigator agency in the beat caps it below 8. </comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Signal station as micro-setting is superbly tactile: cracked walls, flickering consoles, reclaimed wiring—every prop alters tactics. The censer foot’s moonlit patina literally guides wiring decisions, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography stays clean across the single location; no orientation debt. </comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—give shape to emptiness—remains abstract; escalation is atmospheric (signal steadies, ships appear) rather than a narrowing of options for the protagonist. The lattice build is the only visible trade-off, but it succeeds without observable price. Conceptual cost at the end keeps it above 6, but agency is missing. </comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</question><comment>Theme emerges cleanly from the conceit: reverse migration as necessity, not nostalgia. Final image—lanterns flickering like patina—reweights prior material without moralizing. Subtext lives in silence: no voiced grief, only copper coils and incense. The lack of a tangible cost for the navigator keeps it from 8+. </comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Voice is textured, nautical-lyric (“skeletal ribs,” “patina bronze censer foot”) and stays consistent to navigator’s map-born lexicon. Rhythm modulates: long breaths for ritual, clipped clauses for soldered joints. No dialogue, so no voice convergence; perceptual signature distinct. Sparse filter verbs; compression taught early and paid off in final patina-lantern rhyme. </comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</question><comment>Read-aloud rhythm is strong, but metaphor density in every sentence of the climax drifts toward purple (“incense-laden scent mingle with the sea breeze”). No loops or scaffold; information density high. One mixed metaphor—“invisible rivers across the sky”—lightly muddles physics. Closure image untouched, so stays sub-8. </comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Reverse migration as literal navigation tech, not metaphor, is fresh; coupling it to a moon-phased censer-foot engine feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk taken with lyric accumulative structure pays off. The concept would collapse if names or places were swapped—good transformation test. Slight deduction for familiar post-disaster station tropes. </comment>
