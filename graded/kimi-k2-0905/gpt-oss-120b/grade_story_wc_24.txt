<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The shepherd’s interior contradiction—curiosity vs. the ritualized duty of counting—is present but stays abstract; no micro-choice is dramatized that visibly risks failure or social cost. His “peculiar” calling is named repeatedly yet never complicates action; the mantle key hums but does not force a decision. The ending renunciation is therefore felt as mood, not as a path foreclosed by prior stakes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the horizon dissolves into “pure, steady light” and the key’s cool touch reweights time as breath-interval, not number—cost is the lifelong vigilance he now accepts. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern of backwards counting and gear-pulse thickens until the cadence flip at zero. Orientation is secure by line 6; no causal reversal, but density shift satisfies one-scene tightening rule.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Hydrau­lic clock station, fjord, and mantle key function as micro-setting: the razor-edged gears and tide-locked horizon physically constrain the ritual and charge the final image. Sensory triangulation (metallic scent, water breath, key chill) is filtered through profession-specific attention. Spatial choreography stays coherent across the single continuous scene.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“what clocks really measure”—is declared early; pressure tightens once via the zero-count release that fuses tide and machine. Cost is oblique (lifetime of vigilance accepted) rather than a visible forfeit on the page. Agency is contemplative, not tactical; escalation is cadence-based, sufficient under Accumulative lens but thin for high-band cost clarity.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through recurrence of breath vs. tick imagery; final reconfiguration reframes time as lived interval, avoiding explicit moral. Subtext resides in the key’s temperature and the horizon’s dissolution—no reader-level sermon. Ambiguity is productive: ritual as devotion or trap.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Third-limited voice is stable, with engineer’s perceptual signature: gear-tooth precision, water pressure, metallic scent. Rhythmic control mirrors hydraulic pulse; backwards count creates patterned cadence that pays off in final zero-beat. No dialogue, hence no voice convergence issue.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong read-aloud rhythm; sentences vary and compress under count-pressure. Occasional lyrical stacks (“silver glass of water that seemed to hold its breath”) flirt with overwriting but serve atmospheric density. Zero loops or scaffold; no mixed metaphors. Line-level artifacts do not touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Hydraulic horologist at fjord-edge is fresh; backwards count as time-ritual is non-obvious. Conceptual swap—horizon as breath-interval—reweights familiar sunset trope. Risk is moderate; transformation feels specific to this voice and setting, not template.</comment>
