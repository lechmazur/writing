<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Lira’s interiority is lyrically precise—“protected vulnerability” as both felt sensation and strategic stance—but her contradictory impulses (grief vs. caretaking) remain parallel rather than clashing in-scene; the amber pendant catalyzes action yet never endangers or re-prices her goal, so the final smile feels lightly earned rather than costly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the server-into-lullaby shift is legible, warm, conceptually costly (viral memory → tender archive). Causal chain holds under Accumulative/Textural lens—each stone/proffer thickens texture until moss rewrites code—though the pendant-as-key is a gentle miracle rather than a motivated pivot.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mossy server cathedral anchors every beat; cracked glass floor with icicle-drip pattern becomes a spatial score that Lira literally plays by placing stones, so setting constrains micro-movements and charges the final interface-activation image with undeniable specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—transform viral shame into gentle memory—tightens via textural accretion (stones → moss → code) rather than a single forked choice; the “honeyed hush” deepens perceptually but no option is foreclosed, so escalation is atmospheric, not tactical, keeping cost legible but soft.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of reclamation emerges through organic metaphor: digital scars lullabied by living systems; no overt thesis, yet the final firefly-amber mirroring reweights confession from public wound to private pollinator—resonant, unsentimental, with plausible counter-reading that quietism can’t erase viral violence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person lyric achieves a distinctive synesthetic cadence—“emerald silence,” “honeyed hush”—that fuses tech and garden lexicons; diction stays within Lira’s contemplative perceptual range, no head-hop, no filter-verb stacks, rhythm swells and subsides with her breathing pattern, satisfying read-aloud ear.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Almost zero scaffold; only micro-loop is “honeyed hush” echoed four times, but it functions as pulse track, not filler. Metaphors stay coherent (icicle drip = spiral score) and serve information density; final clause “stitched together a future where pain could rest in honeyed hush” lands without syntactic drag.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Fusion of abandoned data-center and moss garden is fresh; viral-confession backstory reversed into botanical lullaby archive feels non-obvious. Risky lyric accumulation could have collapsed into eco-pastiche, but specificity of drip-pattern mechanics and server-code resurrection keeps concept integral, not ornamental.</comment>
