<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Lira’s interiority is lyrically rendered but stays at a single emotional temperature; the “cosmic verse” motive is declared, not dramatized through contradiction or micro-choice. No second character appears, so status/relationship tests are N/A. The final smile registers a shift, yet the cost of exile dissolves into cosmic uplift without a visible forfeiture on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the inked stanza pulses, exile reframes into pilgrimage, and moonstone dust seeds the world—cost is conceptual but legible. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: imagistic repetition (tide, dust, ink) tightens toward the final reconfiguration. Orientation is swift; causality is loose but coherent under lyric logic. No meaningful tightening beat narrows options, so escalation stays flat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Garden, pool, moonlight, and tide are filtered through Lira’s dancer perception; sensory hierarchy favors motion and touch over visual catalog. The moonstone speck and night-bloom serve as micro-settings that charge the final image. Spatial choreography is clean; no world-rule violations. Environment does not constrain tactics, capping entry to high band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Stake—“write a cosmic verse on skin”—is declared early but never tested by opposition or risk; no alternative path is foreclosed. Pressure remains ambient, rising only through denser imagery rather than narrowed agency. The final act succeeds exactly as envisioned, so escalation is decorative, not tactical. Cost is retrospective and conceptual, not experienced as loss within the conflict window.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme of chosen solitude as creative conduit emerges imagistically rather than by assertion; no moralizing line spoils the effect. Recurrent tide/ink imagery reweights exile from wound to womb, achieving quiet resonance. Ambiguity remains—readers may question whether art justifies isolation—but the piece invites rather than answers. No motif feels grafted; each return is incremental.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Lira’s dancer sensorium; perceptual signature favors rhythm, liquidity, and negative space. Syntax lengthens and contracts with tidal motion; diction stays within poetic but never spills into purple. No dialogue appears, so voice purity is unbroken. Patterned elision (“slipped through the invisible cracks”) is taught early and paid off at climax.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is lush yet propulsive; sentences carry double duty—image plus forward motion. Occasional soft repeats (“obsidian grace” twice) and near-synonym clusters (“pulse,” “cadence,” “rhythm”) slightly dull edge. No mixed metaphors or filter-verb stacks. Final paragraph avoids syntactic monotony, letting the last strand of dust linger. A trim of two adjectives per beat would sharpen high-tension lines.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fusion of tide-dancing, tattooing constellations onto skin, and elective exile feels fresh and specific; not a trope mash-up seen elsewhere. Conceptual risk—lyric accumulative structure over causal plot—pays off in resonant closure. Could travel with names changed, but the kinesthetic marriage of sea and ink would still identify the piece. Minor deduction for cosmic-ink idea echoing existing SFF tattoos.</comment>
