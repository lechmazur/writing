<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Interiority is poetic but stays anchored to the braid-touching and dice-handling micro-gestures; the contradiction between encoded self-protection and the need to release memory into the crystal is embodied in the final “whispered shift.” No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible waived. Cost is present—the lab collapses and she abandons her sanctuary—but the emotional price is stated lyrically rather than felt in body. Voice is consistent; braid and dice serve as perceptual extensions of her fingers, keeping her sensory signature sharp.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the crystal sealed in kelp-journal reweights vulnerability as portable strength, tide recedes, lab rises—visible before/after. Causal lens is thin—why dice open now is danced, not motivated—yet Accumulative/Textural pattern (each journal line = breath) holds across lyric shards. Orientation anchor arrives by line 3 (“sunken laboratory”) so no penalty. Cost is conceptual: she forfeits secrecy of the lab itself; felt price is oblique but legible in final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Sunken lab, copper braid, kelp-ink, hangman’s dice—each object is tactile and kinesthetic; dice function as micro-setting that constrains her dance steps and final compartment release. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly: dice on altar → spun in air → clatter → compartment → crystal → journal pocket. Sensory hierarchy favors sound (singing braid, clatter, Selene’s song) and bioluminescent sight, matching code-breaker occupation. Atmosphere of “mysterious familiarity” is sustained without generic water tropes; rusted steel and coral tiles are specific.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</question><comment>Dominant stake: turn personal fragility into unreadable strength before tide destroys lab—signaled early. Escalation is lyrical, not causal: each coded page tightens the lab’s “breath,” dice respond, pressure accumulates rather than narrows options. One meaningful deepening—crystal extraction—pays visible cost by collapsing the sanctuary. Agency is present (she dances, sings, seals) but the beat is ritual repetition; no live reversal, only pattern consummation—enough for 600-word lyric arc.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete pattern: encoded ink → dice response → crystal memory, turning privacy into transferable artifact. Subtext in dance: pirouette as cipher key implies vulnerability is choreographed, not confessed. No moral stated; final smile is earned stasis that accepts exposure of the lab. Recurrent spider-web time image reweights patience from trap to craft—resonant without abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lyric third-person hovers at cinematic distance yet keeps perceptual signature—braid sings, dice “never fell” until breathed—diction stays within poetic narrator lexicon. Rhythm modulates: long liquid clauses for tide, staccato “clatter once, then fell silent” for dice beat. No dialogue, so register match waived. Patterned repetition of “encoded,” “dance,” “defiance” teaches the motif and pays off in final “whispered shift.” Compression and elision are purposeful; no head-hopping or filter-verb fog.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Figurative density is high but sustains one coherent liquid-cipher register; metaphors (sea-foam lines, spider time) stay internally consistent. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or breath-pattern. Strong verbs—sang, twirled, clattered, sealed—carry motion sans modifiers. Final line cadence mirrors tide exhale, giving closure sonic snap. Minor POV adjective stacks (“rusted steel met the sigh of ancient tides”) forgiven because atmospheric stakes are the point.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Fusion of cryptographic dance with hangman dice is fresh; vulnerability-as-encryption via choreographed pirouette is non-obvious synthesis. Kelp-bound journal with fading algae ink specifies the trope of memory-storage beyond generic locket. Spider-web temporal metaphor rescues patience from cliché by tying it to tidal clock. Risk is high—lyric plotless—but commitment to pattern-taught accretive form justifies gamble. Could tip higher if causal motive for dice mechanism were seeded earlier.</comment>
