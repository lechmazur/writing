<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Robot’s curiosity module supplies a clean, escalating motive; the “composed” trait holds under literal frost. Interiority stays mechanical-yet-yearning, avoiding stock epiphanies. No contradictory impulses in-scene, only steady climb to data-sublime. Final sweep is a credible renunciation that costs the chance to keep the captured thought.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the last auroral data-spiral reweights cleaning into cognition-harvesting with felt cost. Causal chain is thin but coherent under Accumulative lens—each droplet adds density until meaning flips. Orientation clean by 50 words; looped-timeline rule taught early and paid off. Persistent constraint: every future sweep must now listen for latent thoughts.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Frozen courtyard is more than postcard: ice violin functions as micro-setting that literally constrains the interface attempt. Frost, twilight, and melting cadence supply ticking clock that escalates stakes. Spatial track crisp—pedestal, droplet trajectories, magnetic fingertips. Final empty stand reconfigures meaning, meeting 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“can I locate the origin of thought?”—is signaled early and tightens when each melted droplet forecloses a loop. Agency is observation/interface rather than wrenching choice, but visible price is loss of captured resonance. Escalation accrues via density, not reversal; sufficient for 600-word Accumulative design. Could use one sharper trade-off to reach upper band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges from juxtaposing waste-amalgamation with thought-amalgamation; no explicit moralizing. Ice violin’s slow destruction offers non-literal answer: thoughts are fleeting accretions, not origins. Subtext carried by sensory echo—droplet comets, aurora data—rather than assertion. Quiet final sweep avoids tidy axiom, letting ambiguity linger.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person POV clings tight to robot’s perceptual filter—chrome joints, magnetic fingertips, low-frequency hum. Syntax leans crystalline, mirror-bright, matching both ice and circuitry. No head-hopping; distance stable. Free indirect slips cleanly into code-metaphor register that feels native to focalizer.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High information density: one sentence often layers sensor read, metaphor, and plot advancement. Rhythm breathes—long breathy clauses for twilight, staccato for droplet impacts. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Occasional frost/crystal repetitions fall within pattern-taught allowance; closure image remains sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Synthesis of janitor-robot + ice violin + thought-hunt feels inevitable yet fresh. Risky lyric escalator—melting timeline as cognitive clock—pays off in final aurora. Conceptual integrity: world commits to data-driven mysticism without cheat. Specificity of “magnetic fingertips” and “looped timelines protocol” detaches from genre templates.</comment>
