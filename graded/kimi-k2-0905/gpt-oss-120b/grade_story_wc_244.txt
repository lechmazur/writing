<comment>Lira’s “desperately jocular” mask is repeatedly embodied—jokes about broken signals, “laugh that sounded like a rusted hinge”—and the contradiction between quips and mission stakes is visible on the page. The micro-choice to accept the caretaker’s ivy-pattern puzzle is motivated by her prior creed of “polite anarchy” and reciprocity, so the final relinquishment of the moon fragment feels earned. Interiority sometimes drifts into abstract labels—“network of empathy,” “cycle of isolation”—that soften the specificity promised by her logistics background. Still, the jocular trait actively shapes tactics and the climax, satisfying the 9+ test at this length.</comment>

<comment>Causal lens holds: because Lira believes reciprocity can be engineered, she therefore answers the rumor, recruits misfits, and releases the fragment. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—she decides the “cure” is the act of passing the lantern onward, a visible cost (loss of talisman) that reweights the premise. Orientation is clear by word 60; no teleporting props. The ivy-pattern puzzle is a micro-turn, not a second decisive change, so it doesn’t violate the single-DC rule.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The station’s swallowed platforms, green curtain of ivy, and cracked comet-imprinted slab are tactile, specific, and steer the ivy-cutting puzzle that unlocks the fragment. Environment doubles as map and antagonist; pruning pattern = key. Sensory hierarchy favors touch and sound (rusted-hinge laugh, warm pebble) over tourist visuals. The lantern-as-capsule in the final image recharges the setting, satisfying the 9+ constraint test.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—deliver loneliness cure—signaled in paragraph 2 and tightened when she vows to share any discovered cure. Agency drives every beat: she summons the caretaker, hacks the shears-contraption, and chooses to pass the fragment rather than keep it. Cost is visible: relinquishing the moon rock’s warmth enacts the reciprocity she preaches. One meaningful tightening suffices under 800-word scope; escalation is causal, not multi-reversal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: reciprocity as praxis, not slogan. The moon fragment’s chime traveling “along the rumor chains” reconfigures empathy from abstraction to sensory event. Final image—lantern handed onward—offers resonant, non-moral answer: loneliness is eased only by continuing the chain. No final-paragraph sermon; insight stays implicit in the act.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited clings tightly to Lira’s jocular-perceptive filter: “gladly joked about broken signals,” “laugh that sounded like a rusted hinge.” Syntax mirrors her rhythm—long, lightly chaotic sentences for logistics chaos; clipped fragments at puzzle reveal. No head-hop; caretaker’s grin stays external, maintaining distance. Filter verbs are minimal and voice-motivated.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; paragraph lengths breathe. Figurative language is selective—ivy “like a green curtain,” moon rock “like a captive star”—and paid off. No mixed metaphors or template cadence; “hacked together a contraption of old signal lights…” is dense, propulsive. One paraphrase loop spotted (“rumor that…rumor chains…”) but not in closure third; artifacts do not obscure causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Moon rock as loneliness vaccine via rumor-chain delivery is refreshingly non-obvious. “Polite anarchy” and logistics jargon hybridize into a credible operative creed. The ivy-pattern key transforms garden overgrowth into narrative lockpick—specific, not quirky ornament. Risky tonal tightrope (whimsy + desolation) held without slip; synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
