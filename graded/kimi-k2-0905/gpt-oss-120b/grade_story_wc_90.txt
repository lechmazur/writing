<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Nara’s pacifism is stated, never betrayed, yet never tested by an antagonist; the interior contradiction is lyrically sketched (“weightless with joy” vs. “cold pressure”) but stays abstract. Her micro-choice—smile to lighten, step through—earns the ending, but the absence of live opposition keeps the arc thin.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens: imagistic refrains (“faint shimmer,” “stitch,” “seam”) tighten toward the rupture-garden. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the dimension blossoms, Nara weightless, cost legible in her irrevocable exile from the ship. One shard, no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The ship-body as micro-setting constrains every move—rusted corridor gravity, hull sigh, vacuum silence—culminating in the garden that reconfigures the palette. Sensory triage filters through Nara’s pacifist attention: photons as “mournful fireflies,” wind carrying “scent of untouched forests.”</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake: open the locked dimension without force. Escalation is textural: shimmer density, smile-activated weight loss, seam widening—each beat raising the cost of failure (perpetual drift vs. new genesis). The final grin seizes the decisive leverage; no external antagonist required.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme—“grief transmuted into genesis through compassion”—emerges from the tear-crystal’s trajectory, not exposition. The garden’s nameless hues reprice the earlier “long-dried tears,” converting sorrow into regenerative light without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lyric third-person adheres to Nara’s perceptual filter: hush, shimmer, rust, weightlessness. Syntax elongates then fractures at rupture—“a pale wind breathed”—mirroring seam split. No head-hop; compressions (“ghost of forgotten propulsion”) taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Read-aloud cadence varies: spondaic hull-hums, then liquid pre-rupture anaphora. Metaphors stay coherent (tear as needle, fireflies as photons), no mixed vehicles. One scaffold near start (“patched panels humming…”) quickly absorbed into action.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Synthesizes Buddhist tear-relic, Clarkean lone gardener, and gravitational mood-physics into a fresh eschatology. The pacifist victory-through-joy twist feels inevitable yet uncommon; no trope mining for easy sentiment.</comment>
