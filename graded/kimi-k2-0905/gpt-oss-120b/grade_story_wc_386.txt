<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The whisperer’s interiority is lyrically specific—ice filaments, dream-tide, borrowed starlight in her veins—yet her contradictory impulse (to expose purity without force) is declared, not dramatized in a single visible micro-choice. The final palm-to-globe beat is emotionally embodied, but the cost (cold melt as promise) remains metaphorical rather than tactical. No secondary character applies pressure, so the “relationship as crucible” bullet is waived. She earns a credible renunciation, but the absence of an on-page flaw-driven mistake keeps the arc just shy of 8-band intensity.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—the vapor window bridging shrine and dreamscape reweights the meaning of “pure thing” with social cost visible in the strangers’ bright eyes. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens: dream-cameo density → lattice recognition → vapor bridge. The melted globe’s amber pulse supplies the felt cost on the page. Orientation is anchored by lantern, cliff, shrine within 120 words; no penalty applied.</comment>

<comment>The glacier shrine is tactile—ice walls quiver with starlight, candles catch slivers, the globe’s liquid mirror warms under palm—each detail constrains the whisperer’s gentle touch. Environment, body, and recurring object (globe) co-function as micro-setting that directly charges the final image. Selective sensory hierarchy (cold scent of pine-salt) reflects her vocational bias. Spatial choreography is clean across the single continuous scene.</comment>

<comment>Stakes—“to salvage something pure from the wreckage”—are declared early; pressure tightens when the lattice of dreams sharpens into a physical vapor window, foreclosing the option to remain passive. The whisperer’s agency drives every beat: she records, maps, whispers, embeds, places palm. Cost is legible in the cold melt that enters her skin and the starlight that solidifies in her veins. One meaningful tightening suffices for this length; escalation coheres under Accumulative lens without external antagonist.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the recursive image-set: melted globe / broken compass / gull-with-glass—all fragments of a purity that exists only when re-collected from strangers’ dreams. Final image (sunrise promising illumination of countless shattered dreams) offers non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in silence: no exposition explains why the sea grieves. The refrain of borrowed starlight reweights from décor to circulating life-blood, earning quiet resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person POV maintains steady lyric distance; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is convincingly otherworldly—lantern light trembles, starlight is “borrowed,” compass spins “erratically” in dreamed decks—yet diction stays within plausible diver-philosopher lexicon. Rhythmic control heightens toward closure: short clauses (“She whispered. The glass trembled.”) mimic vapor filament rising. No dialogue appears; therefore dialogue bullets are waived.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings shift from participial to subject-verb without template cadence. Figurative density is high but patterned early (“ice filaments through a loom of memory”) and paid off at closure, so penalty waived. One paraphrase loop detected—“each fragment mirrored the broken pieces of the snow globe / Each fragment mirrored…” within a single beat—triggers −0.2. No mixed metaphors; no filter-verb stacks in high-pressure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Premise—wreck-diver who harvests dream cameos to reassemble a melted portal—feels fresh against familiar ghost-whisperer frame. Risky lyric accumulation of dream-smoke, starlight, vapor could have collapsed into vagueness yet coheres under taught pattern. Specificity of pine-and-salt scent and warped crystal skin prevents abstraction. Transformation test fails: swap “melted music box” for globe and story still functions, capping originality just below 9-band excellence.</comment>
