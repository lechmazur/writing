<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Milo’s spiritual curiosity is shown through concrete micro-choices—aligning the lens, slowing breath, whispering to the veil—so the trait drives action. Yet interiority drifts into lyrical abstraction (“why the stars sang”) that tells more than embodies, and the final beat is serenity rather than a visible cost. The arc is credible, but the lack of contradiction or forfeiture keeps the change too smooth.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each breath thickens the image-density until the lattice brightens and love spills back into the world. Closure is a Charged Poise—Milo stands at the tunnel mouth while the viaduct blossoms, the cost being the now-dimmed tear and the perpetual openness of “continual revealing.” No causal ambiguity; pattern taught early, paid off in final luminescence.</comment>

<comment>The twilight viaduct is no backdrop—its breathing arches and silver pollen actively respond to Milo’s exhalations, literally guiding his tempo and access. Spatial choreography is clean: lens, tile, tunnel, lattice track without drift. Sensory hierarchy favors scent and color over tourist visuals, and the jasmine-tasting air fogs the lens, forcing slower breaths that trigger the map. Setting thus constrains tactics and charges the final glowing blossoms image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“to free unused love”—is signaled early and escalates via breath-paced discovery; each slower exhale tightens access to the reservoir. No external antagonist, but the veil of forgotten promises functions as coherent pressure that forces Milo’s stance crystallization. Cost is conceptual yet legible: once released, the love can’t be re-bottled, and the tear’s glow is spent. Agency remains internal and accumulative, sufficient under Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically from the concrete act of breathing love back into circulation; no overt moralizing. The lattice of unspoken stories reweights the familiar “stored love” trope into visual, material terms. Final image—viaduct blossoms glowing with reclaimed compassion—offers a quiet conceptual repricing rather than a stated thesis. Minor deduction for the “pilgrim of sparks” epithet that nudges toward thematic label.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Milo’s perceptual filter: breath, color, stone, pollen. Diction (“spiritually curious,” “pilgrim of sparks”) occasionally rises above the camera-artisan’s likely lexicon, but the rhythmic breath-count lines teach the pattern early and hold. Syntax modulates—long luminescent clauses swell, then cut to short pulses at tunnel entrance—mirroring inhale/exhale without drumbeat monotony. No dialogue to distort voice; overall a distinctive, consistent texture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>High information density: each sentence layers sensory, emotional, and conceptual work without paraphrase loops. Metaphors stay coherent (“breathing dragon,” “lantern chest”) and serve inhale/exhale motif. Occasional elevated phrasing (“conceptual repricing,” “silence reservoir”) slightly overshoots POV register, but never in the closure beat. Rhythm breathes with the scene; no scaffold or synonym churn.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Camera-obscura-as-portal and breath-controlled lattice give a fresh mechanical twist to the “stored love” myth. Viaduct setting and jasmine-tasting fog particularize the frame, preventing generic anywhere placement. Concept feels inevitable in hindsight yet not overtly borrowed. Risk is moderate—lyric accumulation over plot—but pattern is taught and lands cleanly. Could push further into tactile or social consequence for higher band.</comment>
