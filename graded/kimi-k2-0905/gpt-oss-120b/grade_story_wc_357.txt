<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira’s quiet, tactile micro-choices—skimming the canopy, lowering the obsidian probe, finally releasing the tip—track a credible arc from curiosity to custodial responsibility. Interiority stays concrete and bias-filtered (“the planet’s own heartbeat,” “quiet balloons”). The renunciation at the end costs her sole ownership of the secret, a visible forfeiture that earns the Earned Stasis closure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the dissolved tip drifting into soil re-prices the planet’s rule-set and Mira’s role. Causal linkage holds throughout: inversion hour → probe → find → test → release. The final image carries undeniable conceptual cost—she can now “hear and guide” but no longer possesses the catalyst. One micro-turn (gravity normalizes) tightens options without breaking lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Floating rock arches, upward river, phosphorescent roots—each detail is filtered through pilot attention and later constrains flight path or probe placement. The moss-veined bough and star-metal glint function as micro-settings that decide where the probe lands. Final basin glow re-anchors the arches as the renewal node. Spatial choreography stays clean: craft, river, branch, basin track without drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</answer><comment>Dominant stake—find the resilience source—tightens when the probe’s chime confirms the tip’s presence, narrowing her choice to keep or release. The inversion hour acts as a live clock that forces speed and tags every beat with physical risk. Releasing the tip costs exclusive knowledge, a felt price that reweights her future expeditions. Agency drives every turn; coincidence is decorative, not resolver.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Resilience emerges as an emergent rhythm between planet and listener rather than a moral. The dissolved arrow tip reconfigures “source” from object to participatory practice, an earned conceptual repricing. Silence and echo motif shifts from eerie absence to purposeful listening, charged in the final line. No overt thesis is stated; the theme lives in the image of glowing particulate soil.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tightly lashed to Mira’s pilot perceptions—water-glint navigation, probe torque, engine hum. Diction stays aeronautic and hydraulic (“skim,” “veins,” “swirl upward”) without academic drift. No head-hop; focalization is stable. Rhythm modulates: long, liquid sentences in inversion, shorter clipped units as gravity normalizes.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High information density: one sentence often handles motion, sensory filter, and world rule. No loops or scaffold; “whirling silence” returns only when the image gains new weight. Metaphors (translucent coral, emerald fire) remain consistent with orchard/sea hybrid aesthetic and do not crowd high-pressure beats. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with gravity shifts.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Inversion-hour orchard plus echo-navigation feels fresh, yet rules are cued early and obeyed. The broken star-metal arrow tip repurposes a familiar trope into planet-scale bio-technology whose cost is stewardship rather than conquest. Risk—letting the macguffin dissolve—pays off by shifting the narrative lens from acquisition to attunement. Specificity of “floating rock arches like translucent coral” anchors the image in memory.</comment>
