<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>Interiority is evocative—“confidently uncertain” paradox anchors voice—but emotional embodiment drifts into abstract pulses and tides. Micro-choice is present (pen twist, whisper) yet stakes feel intellectualized; no bodily cost or irreversible decision scars the page. The shift from chaos to ordered rows is declared, not dramatized through visible failure/sweat. Still, narrator’s perceptual signature stays consistent and flaw-rooted.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: final “listening” stance crystallizes options with conceptual cost—history edited yet identity preserved. Causality is lyric-accumulative; each pen-stroke adds texture rather than narrows external options. Orientation anchors early (lab, anomaly, desk) and holds. However, the tightening midpoint is a touch diffuse—no single beat where failure felt inevitable—so cost is more atmospheric than acute.</comment>

<comment>The gravitational anomaly functions as micro-setting: it bends the pen, directs the rewriting, and charges the final soft hum. Sensory selection is POV-filtered—inkless nib glints like comet shard, garden-pruning metaphor mirrors data rows—integrated into action rather than catalogued. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible moves. The lab never becomes white-room because the anomaly keeps squeezing thought and tool.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—restore corrupted orchard without erasing self—signaled early. Pressure escalates via texture: tangled light-ribbons slowly straighten as pen rewrites; anomaly’s tide keeps options precarious. Agency is present—narrator chooses to “unbend” logic and whisper edits—but the tightening is lyrical rather than a single forked path with felt forfeiture. Cost is conceptual (accepting uncertainty) not visceral, adequate for length but keeps score below 8.0.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through recurrent gardening/astral images: pruning, seeds, buds, orbits—history as cultivar rather than ledger. No moralizing statement; final “listening” offers Conceptual Repricing that reweights authority—control surrendered grants clarity. Ambiguity is purposeful: anomaly neither punished nor conquered, merely interpreted. Subtext whispers that revision itself is the only permanence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Voice is poet-scientist hybrid: precise (“spacetime curvature”) yet lyrical (“orchard of data”). Perceptual signature consistent— narrator notices shimmer, tidal pull, comet fragment. Rhythm modulates: long tidal sentences in calm, clipped fragments under rewrite pressure. No dialogue to test naturalism; internal monologue avoids filter verbs and keeps diction within astrophysics lexicon. Distinctive and sustained.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Metaphor density is high but patterned early—garden, tide, star-talk—so reads as taught rather than accidental. A few paraphrase loops (“strange comfort” repeated, “unbend” over-used) dull final third momentum. No contradictory vehicles; physics metaphors stay internally consistent. Strong paragraph cut test: each graf advances texture or knowledge. Overall propulsive but hairline surplus of shimmer adjectives keeps it under 8.0.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Premise—celestial linguist rewriting reality with dry pen in living gravity well—feels fresh yet inevitable. Fusion of astrophysics and horticulture is specific to this voice. Pen-as-needle sewing spacetime threads transforms familiar “fix-the-past” trope into tactile craft. Risky lyric structure holds; no gimmick, no retreat. Transformation test passes—swap pen or anomaly and whole fabric unravels.</comment>
