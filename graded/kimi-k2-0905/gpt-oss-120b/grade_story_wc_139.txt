<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Mara’s contradictory drives—inheritance of con-artist tools vs hunger for verifiable honesty—stay alive in every beat; the moment she whispers the cracked-wall formula the internal split crystallizes. Her embodied stillness (“felt in the soles of her feet”) and the micro-choice to slip parchment under the pot show values in hierarchy under pressure. The only bar to 9-band is that the father’s “mathematics” is told more than enacted earlier; still, the ink-payoff reweights her flaw into resolve with visible cost, meeting the 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal linkage holds: because asylum officials demand proof → therefore Mara must activate the ink → because the ink answers grief-laden atmosphere → therefore contract glows and walls of rigidity dissolve. Orientation anchored by word 60; no lens ambiguity. Closure carries undeniable conceptual cost—bureaucratic rule-set rewritten by alchemical equity, “calm, equitable breath” legible as RR. Slight short of 9.0 only because the commission’s reaction is reported in a single sentence rather than dramatized beat, softening the Decisive Change edge.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prep-room as micro-setting constrains every move: lilies/incense filter attention, mahogany table dictates pot placement, curtains register the final shift. Sensory economy is severe—two smells, one texture, one visual glow—yet each guides choice or signals transformation. Object-as-setting (ink pot) physically enables the closure contract, satisfying 9+ gate. Spatial choreography immaculate; no credibility strain.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“prove lineage fairness to secure asylum”—is signaled early; pressure tightens when grief-fog must thicken enough to awaken ink. Single meaningful deepening occurs at the whispered formula, narrowing option from petition to covenant. Protagonist agency drives the turn; cost legible in her marrow dissolve and in commission’s breathed shift. Keeps within lens; coincidence absent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of equity-as-alchemy emerges through ink-image, equation-circle, and final bureaucratic exhalation—never stated. Subtext lives in objects: lilies (death) vs glowing ink (vitality) reweights “deathly vitality” from tone to philosophy. Final image reconfigures asylum from legal shield to living covenant—Conceptual Repricing with social cost undeniable. No sermon, tidy moral, or prompt-echo lines.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited clings to Mara’s perceptual filter: brass “dulled by decades of careful handling” is a con-noir observation, not museum data. Rhythm compresses under stress—clusters of monosyllables (“balance, give, receive, equal”) mimic chant. No head-hop; free indirect clean. Register stays within her lexicon; final wind metaphor grows from curtain flutter she physically sees, so diction earned.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Zero scaffold, no synonym loops; each sentence advances image or causality. Opening line anchors voice and stakes in one breath; final line (“ink pot clinked softly”) recharges earlier object with after-cost. Figurative language sparse—only “midnight river,” “veins of gold”—each tied to ink’s physical behavior, avoiding purple. Syntax varies; no template cadence; read-aloud ear test passes.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fusion of con-artist inheritance + bureaucratic asylum + alchemical ink is fresh synthesis; asylum trope flipped from victim narrative to equity covenant. Mathematics of fairness rendered as visible gold circle—specific image, not abstract slogan. Transformation test: if names/places swapped, conceptual engine collapses because ink-pot properties and asylum commission are integral. Risk (asylum via occult ink) paid off with coherent closure.</comment>
