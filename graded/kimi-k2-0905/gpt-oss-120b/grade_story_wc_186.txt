<comment>Motivation—“prove coincidences have meaning”—is declared repeatedly yet never tested by a contradictingchoice; custodian acts only in calm ritual, no embodied contradiction or micro-choice under pressure. Interiority drifts into lyric abstraction (“thistle-blown hope” loop) instead of concrete stakes. Final vow costs nothing visible; no path foreclosed, so Earned Stasis remains theoretical.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise—beacon lit, travelers arriving—image reweights premise with undeniable social hope, but cost is only asserted (“refuses to be crushed”), not dramatized. Lens is Accumulative/Textural: repeated star/prism alignments accumulate until cadence shifts at lantern kiss; pattern taught early and coherent. Orientation clean within 120 words; no causality breaks, yet no persistent constraint priced on-page.</comment>

<comment>Glass pavilion, prism, and star-scratched floor are tactile, wind-vibrated, sound-bent; micro-setting directly supplies the resonance that ignites beacon. Selective sensory triangulation (hum, glass-song, tarnished metal) keeps exposition lean while tethering ritual steps to physical anchors. Final image of amplified pavilion singing charges closure, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“prove pattern exists”—stays abstract; no external obstacle or internal counter-desire threatens failure, so pressure plateaus. Escalation is purely cadence: each paragraph adds another hopeful witness; options never narrow, no trade-off forced. Caravan arrival is additive luck, not tightening.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Theme of meaning-through-fragility emerges organically from prism > shard > rekindled network; refrain from moralizing until penultimate clause (“proving that even the smallest coincidence can kindle a future”), a minor echo that still lets image do final lift. Subtext relies on silence/hush paradox rather than interpersonal tension, acceptable for lyric mode but limits depth.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>First-person custodial voice sustains archaic, star-chart idiom without register drift; perceptual signature skews skyward, wind-listening, glass-feeling. Repetition of “thistle-blown hope” is patterned, taught early, and pays off in final line; rhythm modulates with ritual pacing. No dialogue present; no POV leakage.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Generally vivid, but metaphor density clusters (“glass walls sing like thistle… ribbon of light unfurls… shard remembers”) create slight purple drag in the pivotal ignition beat. Paraphrase loops (“hope that refuses to be crushed… no wind can fully extinguish”) dilute momentum. Grammar clean, pronouns stable; scaffolding minimal but present.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Post-collapse beacon重启 via silence-shard is fresh synthesis; star-path cartography gives tactile novelty to familiar “light-in-dark” trope. Risk taken with lyric accumulation rather than causal jeopardy, but coherence holds. Derivative echoes (Tolkien watch-fires, McCarthy ash) are transformed through sonic glass and hush mechanics.</comment>
