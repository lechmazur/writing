<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The conjurer’s “gently inventive” curiosity and compassionate motive are stated repeatedly but never collide with a credible counter-desire; interiority stays abstract (“felt a pulse of hope”) and no micro-choice risks anything tangible. Emotion is named rather than embodied in gesture or contradiction; the glass-eyes placement is delicate but stakes-free. He undergoes no change beyond a whispered incantation that merely confirms what the orchard already showed him; the cost is atmospheric, not personal. Character passes as functional lyric guide, not crucible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the equation “grief plus hope equals a new kind of growth” is legible in the final petal-fall, satisfying the RR/CR requirement with conceptual cost. Causality is Accumulative/Textural: droplet-notes, crack-patterns, and petal-rain build density until meaning reweights; no because/therefore turns are required. Orientation is clear by sentence four; no spatial or temporal drift. The single-scene default is met; no prop or motif breaks continuity. A tighter micro-turn between eyes-on-stone and petal-release would sharpen inevitability, but the arc coheres under the chosen lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Cavern orchard, stalactite-drips, moss, and mosaic stone are tactile, lived-in, and filtered through the conjurer’s selective attention; sound and silver light guide his spatial choreography. The orchard functions as both macro-setting and micro-tool: droplet vibrations literally translate grief into numbers on the stone, constraining his recording action and charging closure. No geographic vagueness or white-room lapses; every descriptor earns its place by advancing the equation motif. Setting could hit 9.0 if one environmental detail backfired or resisted him, adding price.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Stake—“understand the mathematics of emotion”—is announced early but remains cerebral; pressure escalates only texturally via accumulating droplet-notes and glowing numbers, never threatening loss or forcing a trade-off. No live option is foreclosed; the conjurer’s path stays linear from arrival to departure. Cost is conceptual rather than felt; the orchard gains petals, he gains insight, neither forfeits anything. Sufficient for lyric accumulative mode, yet sub-8.0 because escalation lacks visible price that alters later tactics.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges cleanly: ambiguous loss reframed as generative equation. No explicit moralizing; the final petal image reweights prior sorrow without commentary. Recurrent motifs—glass eyes, cracks, droplets—accumulate rather than decorate, culminating in the numeric glow that re-prices grief. Complexity is acknowledged yet stays somewhat tidy; a counter-argument or residue of unresolved pain would deepen resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person omniscient hovers lightly above the conjurer yet stays consistent; diction (“dovetail,” “vellum and old rune ink”) matches arcane scholar without sliding into purple. Rhythm modulates with long breathed sentences that mirror subterranean hush; no filter-verb clusters or template cadence. Dialogue is absent by design; voice remains singular and coherent. Perceptual signature is more poetic than idiosyncratic—still, it sustains lyric control without head-hop.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is lush yet mostly precise: “silver shadows,” “luminous petals” evoke without stacking mixed metaphors. One paraphrase loop—“orchard’s quiet lull” / “orchard grew silent”—occurs early; otherwise redundancy is minimal. Sentence openers vary; droplet syntax stays monosyllabic to mimic drip. Final third avoids overwriting, letting petal-fall stand unadorned; this restraint prevents artifact bleed into closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>“Mathematics of emotion” mined through subterranean orchard and taxidermist eyes is fresh synthesis; concept commits fully without retreating to surface quirk. Transformation test fails: swap eyes for compass, orchard for library—arc survives, limiting upper band. Still, risk lies in lyrical anthropomorphism of cracks “singing”; it pays off via numeric translation, earning moderate novelty. A sharper world-rule punishing hubris would push originality higher.</comment>
