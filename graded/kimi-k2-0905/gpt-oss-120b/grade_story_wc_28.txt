<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority is lyrical and consistent; the “gentle radical” label never becomes a lived paradox, so contradiction is asserted rather than dramatized. Micro-choices—kneeling, whispering “Hearthsteel”—are present but feel pre-orded by poetic fiat, not by a visible internal struggle. Retrocognitive entrapment is named repeatedly yet never limits or distorts a present tactic; it functions as mood, not flaw. Still, the voice sustains a believable ideological sensibility and the final stance crystallizes with a palpable, if abstract, cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the mosaic pulse re-stitches the sky and renames the plaza, reconfiguring the city’s emotional economy with undeniable conceptual cost. Causality is lyric/accumulative rather than strict “because/therefore”; pattern is taught early (stone speaks, demands rename) and paid off in the final image. Orientation is secured in the first paragraph; no spatial or temporal drift. The only minor slack is that the exact price (what the radical forfeits) is felt collectively rather than personally, but the reweighting is legible and complete.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Environment is spare yet charged: soot-gray stones, warm-cold air, chipped tessera—each detail filters through post-fire trauma and frames the plaza as crucible. The mosaic stepping-stone is micro-setting at its best; its uneven surface literally guides the rename act and constraints every pilgrim footfall thereafter. Sky fracture and amber slivers evolve with emotional beats, culminating in the final living diagram. No superfluous tourist catalog; every sensory note earns its place and either enables or mirrors choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can empathy survive rebuilt logic?—is declared early and tightened once: the stone demands a syllable that fuses warmth and steel. The rename act is the single decisive turn that forecloses nostalgia and opens the aberrant-mercy era. Pressure is situational/lyric: no antagonist, but cultural grief and cold logic press until the mosaic offers its contract. Cost is collective and conceptual rather than personal, yet visibly alters tactics (pilgrims bring their own chipped stones), satisfying the 8+ threshold.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from image pattern—fire, steel, fracture, stitch—never from thesis statements. “Aberrant mercy” is dramatized as a civic engineering choice, not preached. Final image of children laughing through broken arches reweights the premise: compassion is infrastructure, not sentiment. No moralizing paragraph; resonance is left quietly humming underfoot.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person lyric maintains a consistent perceptual signature: soot-tasting air, warm-cold paradox, tactile stone-whisper. Diction is elevated but anchored in post-crisis sensibility; no filter-verb bloat. Rhythm modulates from long incantatory sentences to the staccato whisper “Hearthsteel,” mirroring the beat of revelation. No dialogue, so voice purity is total; no head-hop or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet breathable; figurative layering serves the accumulative design. No mixed metaphors, no synonym loops. Occasional elevated latinate clusters (“retrocognitively trapped,” “conceptual repricing”) risk register drift, but the diction remains internally consistent with the mythic tone. Final line lands with crystalline concision that recharges every prior motif.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Post-disaster empathy-as-infrastructure is not new, but the fusion of mosaic tessera + syllabic rename + civic pilgrimage feels particular and inevitable in hindsight. Warm-cold paradox, steel-skin breath, and pilgrim chipped-stones are fresh inflections rather than ornament. Concept commits fully: no retreat to cosy humanitarianism; mercy stays aberrant, engineered, and austere. Risk is quiet—lyric essay in story’s clothing—but coherence justifies the gamble.</comment>
