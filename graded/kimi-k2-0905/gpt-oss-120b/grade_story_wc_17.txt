<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Lira’s interiority is textured and embodied; the “ash against her spine” image crystallizes her bodily stake. Yet no contradictory impulse ever splits her; she glides from intent to action without micro-choice that costs her anything on the page, so the arc stays flat. The lineage burden is asserted, not dramatized as a competing pull that complicates her mapping. Still, her perceptual signature is consistent and the final “warm ash” moment gives a felt, if modest, price.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The accumulative pattern (film → diary → negative → soundmap) teaches itself by 25 % and lands a Resonant Reconfiguration: the corridor’s exhale re-weights every prior echo as a living lullaby. Cost is legible in the final line—“she can still hear the faint dream hum”—a persistent auditory obligation she now carries. Orientation is clean within 120 words; no lens ambiguity. Only the late crowd of visiting scholars feels like a soft add-on that slightly dilutes the single-scene pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The ivy, mist, and hearth fire are filtered through Lira’s cartographer ear, so every visual detail doubles as acoustic data. The film negative itself acts as micro-setting, constraining how she can “see” echoes and thus shaping her final map stroke. Spatial choreography is flawless; we track hand, flame, stone, and satchel without drift. Weather is causal, not backdrop—the perpetual rain justifies the hush that lets walls dream.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes are singular: map the walls’ dream. Pressure escalates by accumulation—each artifact adds tonal density until the corridor hums, a meaningful deepening under the Textural lens. The hum is not a reversible triumph; it forecloses her former silence, so cost is present. Yet the beat never tightens through a hard choice or trade-off; the discovery simply arrives as gift, keeping the score shy of the 8.8 gate.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: history is a shared acoustic dream that must be listened into, not owned. The negative’s reprise from ash to lantern reconfigures legacy from burden to communion without moralizing. No character articulates the thesis; the final “warm ash” image lets the reader feel the shift. Ambiguity remains—scholars’ tokens may dilute or enrich the dream—inviting reflection beyond the page.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays latched to Lira’s perceptual filter; syntax lengthens under wonder and contracts under discovery (“for a heartbeat the corridor exhaled”). The diction is archivist-precise yet rain-soaked, a credible hybrid for an echo cartographer. No head-hop, no register drift. The lyric repetitions (“echo,” “dream,” “ash”) are pattern-taught early and payoff in the final cadence, giving rhythmic cohesion.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence. Figurative language is selective—each metaphor (ivy as green-threaded artery, negative as bridge) appears once and earns its keep. Information density is high: one sentence often layers sensory data, historical memory, and tool use. Only a single paraphrase loop (“walls dreamed… walls themselves were living histories”) costs a hairline slip, but it does not touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The premise—“cartographer of echoes who photographs stone dreams”—feels fresh yet inevitable, anchored in tactile process rather than quirk. Climate-shifted rain university is familiar dystopia, but the acoustic archaeology angle transforms it. The half-burned diaries and light-sensitive film negative synthesize analog relic culture with ghost-sound lore in a way I haven’t seen. Risk is present but controlled; the piece never retreats into abstraction, so originality holds.</comment>
