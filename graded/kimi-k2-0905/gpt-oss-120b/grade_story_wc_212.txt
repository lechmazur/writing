<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Mira’s calm-in-crisis temperament is shown through sensorial anchoring (rough-bark acorn, cold perfume), but her contradictory “storm of calm” is stated more than dramatized. The lineage duty is clear, yet no micro-choice visibly risks anything she could lose; the surrender happens in lyrical summary rather than a beat we watch her pay for. The vortex ingestion is passive—she “allows” it—so the cost feels ambient, not personally extracted. Voice stays coherent, but interiority leans poetic-declarative (“quiet hunger,” “wild serenity”) rather than idiosyncratic thought.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: time-texture thickens through returning images (acorn → seed, frost → mist → gears) until meaning reconfigures. Orientation is swift: “icebound atrium under starlight” plus Mira’s mission land before word 50. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—time becomes weaveable “thread” she can plant; the aurora glow is the conceptual cost, making borrowed-time stewardship irrevocable. Causality is loose (vortex mechanics asserted, not tested), yet the pattern teaches itself early and holds through the lyric cadence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setting is the story’s engine: melting-ice walls that sing seed-lullabies physically enable the vortex andmirror the thaw of frozen time. Object-as-setting (copper basin, acorn cap) constrains every beat—its disappearance triggers the clock-turning rain. Sensory hierarchy follows Mira’s seed-saver gaze: bark texture, soil scent, mist temperature. Spatial choreography stays clean; no geography drifts. The starlight refracting into “ribbons of green hope” is an earned final image that reweights the entire atmosphere.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—keep the phoenix frost-fire cycle alive—signals early and tightens when the vortex demands the acorn cap as anchor. The single meaningful intensification is the cap’s surrender; it narrows Mira’s option from guardian to inheritor, but the cost is more luminous than painful. Agency is present (she places the cap, inhales, plants the shadow-seed), yet the external magic does most of the work. No visible price alters later tactics; the “borrowed time” texture is discovered, not paid for.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges via recursive agriculture imagery: time as cultivable soil, seeds as memory, frost as fallow field. Subtext operates in gesture—empty basin, translucent hand—never thesis. The closing plea “Teach me the feel…” invites reader to keep touching temporal fabric rather than delivering a moral. Returned-time cycle avoids tidy aphorism; ambiguity lingers in the cool cheek imprint that feels like sand, not salvation.</answer>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Mira’s perceptual filter: synesthetic cold-perfume, seed-coat shimmer. Syntax lengthens under calm, fragments under vortex swirl, matching emotional weather. Diction (“vortex inheritance,” “furiously tranquil”) coins without jarring; pattern is taught by repetition. No dialogue, so no voice convergence; internal register remains horticulturally precise yet mythic.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm modulates: long breathless coils for spiral light, staccato for “cap vanished.” Figurative language is dense (≈70% of sentences) but patterned and paid off in final crystal-snowflake image. No mixed metaphors; frost-flame fusion stays physically consistent. Occasional elevated latinate diction (“resonant,” “conceptual repricing”) nudges register drift, yet feels minted for this cathedral setting rather than thesaurus show.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: phoenix lore x seed-saving x thermodynamic metaphor (decreasing entropy as garden tending). Time-as-textile is new enough, made specific through tactile bark/sap comparisons. Risk—lyric-heavy, plot-light—pays off because atmosphere is the stakes. Could not swap acorn for any seed; oak’s longevity genome matters to the covenant of centuries.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>8.2</grade></comment>Makes two causal beats—selects the cap as anchor, plants the shadow-seed—and the final image reweights her occupation into temporal stewardship. Removing “seed saver” breaks both logic and closure.</comment>
<question>9 B</question><grade>9.4</grade></comment>Handled in opening placement, mid-vortex surrender, and final planting of its shadow-seed; each return shifts meaning from relic to conduit to thread. Irreplaceable oak lineage ties to centuries-long memory the covenant demands.</comment>
<question>9 C</question><grade>8.0</grade></comment>Concept shapes stakes (transfer of seasonal pulse) and method (entropy decrease); mechanics stay abstract but are repeatedly signaled and linked to the phoenix thaw. Without it, no reason for cap-to-vortex transference.</comment>
<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade></comment>Trait stated early and echoed in “storm of calm,” yet only enacted when she calmly kneels and whispers after the vortex burst—one visible trade-off between internal riot and external poise could be sharper.</comment>
<question>9 E</question><grade>9.1</grade></comment>Reopen-the-covenant is the inciting summons and the decisive action sequence—cap offering → vortex burst → clock reversal. Story collapses without this driver.</comment>
<question>9 F</question><grade>7.5</grade></comment>Method named early (“precise method by decreasing entropy”) and visually enacted as chaos coils back into ordered mist-gear rain; underpins the magical logic, even if physics stay poetic.</comment>
<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade></comment>Ice walls melt inward to fuel vortex, starlight refracts into green ribbons—setting directly powers the climax. Same scene in a meadow would lose the entropy heat-sink the covenant needs.</comment>
<question>9 H</question><grade>6.3</grade></comment>“After the egg hatches” positions the scene and the phoenix arrival, but elapsed time inside the atrium is lyrically elastic; no ticking clock alters tactics, so temporal pressure stays atmospheric.</comment>
<question>9 I</question><grade>8.6</grade></comment>Motivation propels every beat—she wants to taste borrowed time, finally feels it as sap-thread, plants it. Desire is dramatized in tactile discovery and seeds the final image.</comment>
<question>9 J</question><grade>8.2</grade></comment>Tone starts “wild serenity,” modulates through spiral hum, ends in auroral hush; each image recharges the oxymoron rather than flattening it, culminating in the calm-riot of timeless guardianship.</comment>
