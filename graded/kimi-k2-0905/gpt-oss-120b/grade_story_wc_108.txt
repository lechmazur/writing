<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara’s terror/performative bravido contradiction is dramatized in micro-choices (shell lift, decoding moves, final lever step) and body cues (“heart pounded louder than explosions”). The stunt-cipher mechanic links profession to interior stakes, earning the final amber uptake. Still, the emotional turn is slightly front-loaded; later beats re-declare rather than deepen the flaw/need. Meets base 9+ quick test but not the hairline precision for 7.9+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Mara’s “trembling certainty” crystallizes when she drinks amber, foreclosing the old masking self. Cost is felt—“betrayal of the self I had hidden”—and the library’s star-name inversion signals irreversible shift. Causal chain (shell → cipher → lever → amber) holds, but the middle pivot (cipher decoded by stunt-move analogues) is narrated more than tested on-page, muting pressure. Orientation achieved by line 5; lens = Accumulative/Textural; pattern taught early, no ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Rusted library stars, groaning shelves, cracked dome, and shifting constellations act as lived environment that guides choice (lever location, star-map name). Seashell and amber vial serve as micro-setting objects that constrain action. Sensory economy favors sound (sigh, groan) and haptic dust, matching claustrophobic aerial terror. Setting directly charges final image when walls glow post-amber, meeting 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—can Mara transmute fear into power?—tightens once: lever choice risks crushing aisles vs. chance at leviathan courage. Amber price (self-betrayal confession) is legible, paid on-page. Escalation is more emblematic than iterative; single turn suffices for length, but external jeopardy (collapse threat) is announced not experienced, keeping pressure cerebral. Fits Accumulative lens: density/cadence shift reweights cost rather than因果 chain.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme—vulnerability as unsought power—emerges through stunt-cipher metaphor and star-name inversion, never sermonized. Shell’s whisper and amber fragment particularize the abstract. Final image of hovering “edge of the universe” reconfigures prior height phobia without moral. Subtext stays implicit; no thematic echo line. Complexity accepted: terror not erased but weaponized, leaving plausible counter-readings.</comment>

<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>First-person POV stable; no head-hop. Voice carries performer’s kinetic diction (“backflips for circles, rolls for slashes”) and perceptual selectivity for spatial threat. Compression and lyric pattern (“rusted... sighed... stars”) taught in paragraph 1, paid off in luminescent closure. One register lift—“conceptual repricing” zone—but narrator is self-reflective stunt artist, so lexicon tolerated. Rhythm modulates from dense metaphor to short climactic beats, supporting pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>High information density; most sentences dual-task (action + atmosphere). Metaphor strings (“rusted bones,” “second skin”) stay coherent under Accumulative lens; no mixed vehicles. Minor scaffold: “trembling certainty” repeated 3×; final instance charges closure so allowed. No paraphrase loops or filter-verb stacks. End-line propulsion strong; amber pulse / star-name inversion fresh. One homophone risk—“aisle” correct throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Stunt-double with acrophobia decoding cipher via stunt moves is fresh synthesis; library-seashell-constellation combo avoids genre cliché. Transformation of betrayal into beacon feels earned, not gimmick. Risk (lyric accumulative structure) heightens mood without clarity loss. Slight proximity to “fear→courage” trope but personalized through physical profession and cipher mechanic. Does not reach 8.8 due to partial swappability of shell with other mythic object.</comment>
