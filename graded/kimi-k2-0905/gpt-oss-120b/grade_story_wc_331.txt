<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Mara’s calm stewardship is palpable, but her interior contradiction—longing to awaken stories while guarding patrons’ solitude—stays summary; no micro-choice shows her risking or forfeiting anything when the memory-field peaks. The scarf’s hum matters more than any bodily cue from her; the ledger entry at the end is a label, not a cost felt in muscle or breath.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the star-into-lake projection reweights the library’s quiet geometry and the scarf keeps humming, so the cost (continual vigilance) is legible. Causality is soft—hyperbolic algorithm is asserted, not tested—but the accumulative pattern (ripple → projection → ledger) holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Vaulted ceiling, ozone-ink scent, scarf-as-compass create a tactile micro-setting that directly enables the hyperbolic fold; spatial choreography stays coherent as Mara “adjusts” the field. The scientific-poetry shelves could be sharper (what does a Heisenberg sonnet feel like?), but the environment constrains her motion and charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“will dormant memories re-emerge”—is signaled early; pressure tightens when the scarf’s ripple becomes visible to patrons, shifting browsing from solitary to communal. Yet the tightening is external; Mara makes no decisive trade-off, and the cost is ambient rather than personally paid, capping escalation short of high band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme of memory-as-geometry emerges through image (Möbius ceiling, star-lake projection) rather than statement; the final constellations silently reprice the library’s function. Ambiguity lingers—whose memory was it?—but the refrain “where stories truly live” edges toward echo in the last paragraph, slightly over-articulating the mystery.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Mara’s perceptual filter: equations “breathe,” pages “resonate,” scarf “seeks true north.” Syntax lengthens during the fold, then contracts to short clauses for the ledger—rhythmic control mirrors pressure without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies, but occasional stacked modifiers (“quiet rustle of vellum and electronic sighs”) and conceptual loops (“stories truly reside… where stories truly lived”) create micro-scaffold. No mixed metaphors in the climactic projection, yet earlier “lattice of verses and equations” is repeated almost verbatim, dulling immediacy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fusing quantum geometry with library mysticism feels fresh; the scarf-as-tuning-fork objectifies hyperbolic curvature without exposition. Risk lies in the quiet ending—no villain, no rupture—but the concept commits fully; the star-lake memory could belong to any reader, making the miracle communal rather than generic spectacle.</comment>
