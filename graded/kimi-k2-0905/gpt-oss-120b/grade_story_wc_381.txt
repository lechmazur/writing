<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The summoner’s motivation is legible—prevent a coded prophecy—but her interiority drifts into lyric abstraction (“tranquil blaze of purpose”) rather than embodied contradiction. She acts once (places the wing) and endures, yet the cost feels atmospheric, not personal; we see no mistake, flaw, or irreversible loss that stains her. The crane wing, not her psyche, drives the ritual; the character serves the concept more than the concept reveals her.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the sky-rupture is averted via an Earned Stasis—the summoner seals the code inside the wing and accepts perpetual guardianship. Causality is Accumulative/Textural: each pulse of hush layers density until the lattice crystallizes; coincidence never intrudes. Cost is visible—the brook stills, fireflies dim, dawn bleeds—signaling the world now runs on her quiet debt. Orientation is swift; lantern, brook, night are anchored by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The brook-as-mirror, stone-as-launchpad, and wing-as-conduit physically constrain ritual placement; environment is not backdrop but instrumentation. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: pine scent and “moon’s pale grin” filter through a night-ritualist attuned to reflection and shimmer. Spatial choreography is flawless: wing-tip aligned to water, pulses travel outward, golden spill lands on stone then water. Micro-setting objects (stone, wing) charge the final image, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes are declared early—celestial rupture—and tighten when glyphs spiral outward, showing the quiet lattice must hold or sky tears. One meaningful deepening: the wing’s rising glow signifies the firmament is now tethered to her breath; failure would snap that thread. Cost is atmospheric rather than corporeal—still water, dimmed fireflies—so urgency feels muted, not visceral. Agency is present—she chooses the final phrase—but the price is communal calm, not personal forfeiture.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges obliquely: silence as constructive force, mapping absence to avert apocalypse. Subtext lives in mirrored surfaces—brook, wing, night—each reflecting the idea that unseen quiet can rewire destiny. No moral is stated; the brook’s resumed song is the non-literal answer. The crane wing’s reprise as “secret beacon” reweights the opening image from artifact to ark, achieving resonance without assertion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person lyric is stable, with perceptual signature anchored in light-play and hush-seeing: “fireflies traced luminous arcs” reads like no other narrator. Compression is poetic yet legible; patterned repetition (“smoothed hush”) is taught early and paid off at the still-brook image. No dialogue, so voice purity is uncontested. Register stays within a summoner’s ritual lexicon; no academic drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm is hypnotic, sentences lengthening then curtailing to mimic breath-ritual. Metaphors are coherent—water as “molten glass,” sky as “veil”—and never mixed. One scaffold loop: “the quiet unfurled like silk” followed immediately by “spreading across the meadow” reiterates without new pressure. Otherwise density is high; each line layers image or causality. No artifacts touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses origami crane, star-rend prophecy, and cartography-of-silence into a fresh synthesis; the combination feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk lies in pure lyric escalation, yet it pays off in the stellar river image. Avoids genre clichés—no spell words, no antagonist, no cosmic council. Specificity of “silver parchment by monks of the far east” roots the wing in history, not exotic prop. Transformation test fails if relocated, confirming originality.</comment>
