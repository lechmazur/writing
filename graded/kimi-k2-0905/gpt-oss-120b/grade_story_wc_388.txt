<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Mira’s investigative drive is concrete—her “notebook clenched tight,” the bodily act of sorting paper by scent, the micro-choice to inhale while placing the diamond—each beat externalizes her obsession and earns the final stoic renunciation. Interior contradiction is light; she never doubts her mission, so the arc is more discovery than crucible, keeping her just shy of full ambivalence. The “stillpoint as mental state” epiphany is dramatized through perceptual shift rather than lecture, satisfying the earned-insight test. No secondary character pressure on-page, hence relationship bullets N/A; solo performance still compels.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the moment radiation thickens then dissolves under the diamond, the orchard trees shimmer, and Mira whispers gratitude—cost is felt as irreversible guardianship, not exposition. Causal chain holds: each shredded fragment leads to map, map to tree, cradle to stillpoint; no teleporting props. Orientation is anchored by line 3 (“sun hung low over the wasteland orchard”) and never drifts. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of dust/radiation accumulation breaks into sudden stillness—taught early and paid off at final image.</comment>

<comment>The orchard is not backdrop but instrument: phosphorescent fruit, cracked stone cradle, magnetic-stone seal—each object constrains Mira’s tactics and charges the final image. Sensory hierarchy obeys her investigator bias—ink hue, paper grain, ozone scent—never tourist catalogue. Spatial choreography is immaculate; lantern, table, tree, cradle track cleanly across the night-long beat. Environment literally stops the storm at closure, satisfying the 9+ gate that setting must reweight stakes.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Single dominant stake—“find the stillpoint or remain buried in corporate lies”—tightens through each salvaged scrap; every fragment recovered forecloses retreat. The stillpoint’s revelation is both escalation and resolution, a one-turn design permissible at this length; cost is the lifelong guardianship she accepts at dawn. No coincidence resolves; the diamond’s inscription merely crystallizes what the pattern has earned. Agency is pure: without her collage work, no map, no stillpoint, no sanctuary.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the inversion of curse into clarity: “Only in stillness does the truth shine…” is etched, not narrated, letting the image re-weight the premise. Subtext lives in gesture—her smile at the cradle, the whispered thanks—avoiding final-paragraph moralizing. The orchard’s shimmer at dawn offers conceptual repricing: wasteland re-valued as sanctuary without authorial commentary. No motif checklist; dust/diamond recurrence is causal, not decorative.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Mira’s perceptual filter—selective attention to paper grain, ozone, radiation thickness—no head-hop. Diction is lean, investigative: “shredded letters, torn from old corporate memos” mirrors her collage mindset; no filter-verb stacks. Rhythm accelerates during collage scene with short paratactic clauses, then breathes into longer sentences at the stillpoint, echoing the thematic hush. No dialogue, hence dialogue bullets waived; voice remains singular and coherent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is scaffold-free: no paraphrase loops, no synonym churn, no template cadence. Figurative language is sparse and precise—“wounded star” for the diamond—never overwrought. Each sentence at least dual-purpose: “She collected them, sorting fragments by ink hue, paper grain, and the faint scent of ozone” simultaneously reveals method, obsession, and world detail. Opening line anchors stakes, final line (“truth could bloom”) reprises orchard-as-garden image without cliché.</comment>

<question>8</question><question>8.5</question>
<comment>Post-apocalyptic detective trope is refreshed through the collage-map mechanic and the stillpoint as internal state rather than geographical MacGuffin. Corporate-liquidation backstory is sketched in two phrases yet shapes every move, avoiding exposition bloat. The flawed diamond cursed-object trope is inverted—curse becomes contemplative tool—an earned re-pricing. Specificity of “magnetic-stone seal” and “phosphorescent fruit” keeps world from feeling generic wasteland.</comment>
