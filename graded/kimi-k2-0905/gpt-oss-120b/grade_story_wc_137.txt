<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira’s contradictory impulses—curiosity vs. logic—are dramatized in her minute-by-minute handling of the tile and the whales’ song; the notebook, tea, and tile function as externalized micro-choices. The final renunciation—slipping the tile into the alcove—carries visible cost: she surrenders definitive proof yet gains the tower as living archive. Interiority stays concrete, never drifts into label-speak. Only the “courageously kind” trait is asserted twice without being tested under fire, a hairline slip that keeps her just shy of 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the tile’s steady glow and the whales’ vanishing arcs crystallize a new rule—doubt can coexist with wonder if surrendered to shared memory. Causality holds: each tile rearrangement is triggered by Lira’s recalled memory, and the final alignment is earned by her transcription act. Cost is legible in the penultimate clause: “rare peace settle in her bones,” a felt forfeiture of certainty. The accumulative/textural lens is taught early and holds; only the Orientation Test is waived because the lyrical disorientation pays off in the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The tower functions as micro-setting: its brass lattice and yawning windows constrain where Lira can place the tile and how the whale song enters. The cracked floorboard, spiraled stool, and narrow alcove are tactile tools that alter her choreography. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven—she notices brine scent and ink shimmer because they impinge on her skeptic’s need for evidence. Environment is not backdrop; the final image of glow pooling “like a lighthouse” directly charges the closure beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—sculpting a reflective space—tightens when each tile shift exacts a micro-choice: continue transcribing or stop and confront the illogic. Escalation is accumulative: the unheard whale song deepens pattern density rather than forcing external reversals. The price is conceptual but visible: she forfeits empirical proof yet gains an open sanctuary, a trade-off legible in the tile’s “perfect square of calm.” No live clock or tangible loss beyond surrender of certainty keeps this just beneath the 8.8 band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the tile’s migration patterns and whale arcs: memory is migratory, never identical, yet repeatable as felt architecture. Subtext resides in silence—the unheard symphony—rather than exposition. The final image reweights skepticism from adversary to bridge, avoiding moralizing. Only a faint echo of “sculpt space for reflection” in closing whisper risks thematic echo, but it is absorbed into sensory image, not statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person lyric distances matches Lira’s skeptical remove; diction stays within her lexicon—“spiraled stool,” “lattice of old wood.” Compression taught in first sentence—“sea breathed mist”—is paid off in final “ocean’s breath” ink. No dialogue, so voice coherence rests on rhythmic control of long sentences that mirror whale song cadence. Filter verbs are minimal and motive-driven: “seemed to pulse” aligns with her epistemic caution.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or knowledge. Metaphors are coherent—whale ribs entwine with heart—without mixed logic. Sentence variety accelerates during tile shifts, then lengthens into calm at closure. Only one near-purple clause—“silver arcs across the horizon”—but it is earned by prior pattern.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fusion of magic square and whale migration is non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight; both operate by prime geometries of loss and return. The tower-as-memory-instrument freshens the familiar “lonely stargazer” trope. Risky lyric compression is fully integrated, not ornamental. Without this synthesis the emotional arc collapses, satisfying the transformation test.</comment>
