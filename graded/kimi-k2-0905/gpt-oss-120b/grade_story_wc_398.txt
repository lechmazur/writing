<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Sentinel’s solitary ritual is vivid and embodied; the charred edge as “silent confession” shows interiority without label-speak. Motive—bridge fire/earth—stays consistent, but micro-choices under pressure are implied rather than dramatized; no beat forces him to test or revise that motive. Endurance is earned, yet the lack of an opposing force keeps the change incremental rather than costly. Still, the quiet refusal to leave reads as credible renunciation with felt solitude.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens: pattern of parallel-drawing teaches itself by 25 % and holds to quiet CR—“the vineyard pulsed with newly kindled understanding.” Orientation anchored by bus/leaf swirl within 50 words. No causality breaks; the burnt letter’s burial is the visible, irreversible act that reprices the premise: ashes can speak to roots. Cost is conceptual but legible in the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Amber pavilion, ferment scent, and violet sky are selective, sensory, and filtered through sentinel’s patient gaze. Micro-setting is the charred edge itself—handled, planted, dissolved—constraining the final gesture. Spatial choreography is clean; leaves swirl, tendrils curl, no teleporting props. Weather and light evolve with emotional cadence, mirroring without overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: can ash/soil dialogue redeem mismatched love? Pressure deepens through iterative parallels; each echo tightens the sentinel’s commitment to listening rather than fixing. No reversal, but a meaningful cadence shift—glow from the buried edge—signals stakes have been re-weighted. Cost is conceptual (acceptance of mismatch) rather than visceral, keeping it just shy of 8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges from repeated images of mismatch—vine/lover, fire/earth—never stated as thesis. Final image of “quiet harmony” offers resonant, non-moral answer. Subtext lives in gestures: tendrils curl like doomed lovers, sentinel smiles at incompleteness. Avoids final-paragraph sermon, but “passionate subtlety” is named once (−0.3) rather than shown.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person lyric maintains consistent distance and perceptual signature: sentinel notices scent, scars, slow light. Syntax elongates and contracts with seasonal breathing; no filter-verb clutter. Diction stays within pastoral/ferment lexicon. One near-template cadence (“by drawing parallels…”) repeats three times (−0.2) but pattern is taught early and pays off in closure, so allowed. Voice is distinct without mannerism.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong rhythmic control; sentence length varies to mirror seasonal inhale/exhale. Figurative layer is dense but purposeful—every metaphor rooted in vineyard body. No mixed metaphors; “liquid memory” is earned. One minor scaffold: “gentle hush…gently persuasive” proximity loop (−0.2). Information density high; each sentence advances image or interiority. Clean copy, no typos.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Fresh angle: love letter AS fertilizer, not relic. Combines agricultural patience with romance ash without gimmickry. Specificity of ferment scent and vine tendril biology counters generic autumn tropes. Risk is quiet—lyric accumulation rather than twist—so stays sub-8.5. Still, synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight; no derivative template detected.</comment>
