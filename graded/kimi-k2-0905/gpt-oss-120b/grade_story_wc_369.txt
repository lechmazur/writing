<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Eli’s quiet, caretaker-observer persona is consistent; his tactile handling of the sextant and the grid shows embodied emotion. Interiority stays concrete—he “feels the sorrow in his chest ease” rather than labeling it. The final smile is a credible micro-renunciation: he accepts the modest scale of his power. No contradiction or therapy-speak; the only limit is that the trees’ witness remains an untested longing rather than a choice that costs him on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Closure is a textbook Conceptual Repricing: the last filament drifts upward, sorrow becomes “measurable peace,” and the tower inhales—an undeniable reweighting of the premise with felt cost. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: each dream-thread Eli traces incrementally dims the grid until the cadence shift arrives. Causality is intact—moonlight + sextant → filament release → tower exhalation. The squeeze under 9.0 is the late arrival of the true mechanic (dream-mapping) at ~70 %; pattern is legible but taught only then.</comment>

<comment>Stormlit tower, stone slab, cracked shutters, and the oak’s roots are economically re-used anchors that constrain motion—Eli must climb, balance the sextant, feel brass cold. The moonbeam is both atmosphere and tool: it literally mends glass and metaphorically mends grief, charging the final image. Spatial choreography is flawless; no floating props. The micro-setting (sextant, grid filament) doubles as environment that shapes tactics, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—“relieve the labyrinth’s sorrow”—is signaled early and tightens once: each traced dream thins a filament, softening the wind. The price is visible on-page: the last strand dissolves, Eli’s own grief lifts, tower quiets. Accumulative pressure under the chosen lens; no causal reversals needed. Missing a secondary loss (time, tool damage) that could sharpen cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: quantified grief → immeasurable relief via humble attention. No authorial thesis; the final ledger note is action, not sermon. The oak’s rustled approval reweights the earlier “what trees witness” question into quiet answer: they record sighs, then forgive. Ambiguity lingers—will future keepers believe the ledger?—avoiding tidy moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person close stays locked to Eli’s perceptual filter: “lantern a modest glow,” “floorboards groaning like old bones.” Syntax lengthens under calm, shortens under task: “He set the sextant… He placed his palm.” No head-hop; diction (“alidade,” “echo-grid”) stays within his vocational lexicon. Rhythm mirrors the hush—long moonlit clauses, then a final crisp sentence that lets the world breathe.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Lines are dense: “lattice of sorrow, each filament humming with a quantified sorrow” twins the noun for sonic pattern yet avoids paraphrase because the second adds measurability. Metaphors stay physically coherent—moonlight mending brass, filaments floating like sighs. No scaffold loops; paragraph cuts are purposeful. A single register twitch: “mundane miracle” verges on thesis-talk but is earned by prior imagery.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fusing maritime wreckage with labyrinth grief-cartography is fresh; the sextant-as-dream-dowsing-rod grows from folklore rather than trope. Risky lyric accumulation pays off when moonbeam becomes solvent. Specificity—copper jars, oak roots recording storms—prevents allegory drift. Not quite 9+ because the dream-mapping mechanic arrives late and could swap for dowsing-rod or pendulum without breaking armature.</comment>
