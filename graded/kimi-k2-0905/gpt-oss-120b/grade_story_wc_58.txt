<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The traveler’s interior contradiction—chronicling death-in-life while craving healing—is dramatized through the tactile act of threading absent names into a living rose. Embodied micro-choices (kneeling, lifting, projecting) reveal a hierarchy of values where record-keeping is both penance and promise. The final renunciation—slipping the glowing thread away—pays the cost of perpetual solitude, earned by the prior beats of intimate projection.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: each vignette-layer deepens the dominant stake—“mapping the geography of healing”—until the final image reweights it. The rose’s revival is a Conceptual Repricing that makes the cost of endless narration undeniable. Causality holds without leaps; the thread’s return to the satchel forecloses rest, crystallizing Charged Poise.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The garden as micro-setting constrains every tactic: the traveler must kneel on leaves, trace cracked statues, and project onto wilted blooms; the weft-thread functions as portable setting that re-lights the rose. Sensory economy is rigorous—damp amber air, bruised-violet sky—each filtering through the POV’s obituary lens. Spatial choreography is immaculate; no impossible positions.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Pressure accumulates via density of absences; each whispered vignette tightens the stake—how many ungrieved names can one heart carry? The rose’s revival is the visible price: it blooms only because the traveler keeps writing, locking him into perpetual motion. No coincidence resolves the conflict; the final image intensifies rather than releases the load.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: recording absence becomes the only resurrection possible, yet perpetuates the loneliness it seeks to heal. Subtext lives in gesture—the thread glowing “like a dying sun” revalues nostalgia as burden. The final image answers the thematic question wordlessly: the map is endless, the guide is alone, the garden leans closer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyric third-person maintains perceptual signature: rusting mosaics “dimmed by moss,” kings’ faces “cracked like old parchment.” Syntax lengthens in cadence with breath of garden, compresses at “He smiled, a solitary curve.” No head-hop; knowledge stays traveler-bound. Compression taught early (“world seemed to hold its breath”) pays off in final charged poise.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops; each sentence layers job—image, motion, metaphor, forward pull. Rhythm modulates from long leaf-rustle clauses to fragment “He smiled.” Figurative vehicles stay internally coherent: thread as sun, rose as waypoint. Opening and final lines frame voice and re-charge motif. No overwrite; density is earned, not stacked.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Vocation—“obituaries for the living”—flips elegiac trope into living cartography. Projection via carpet thread fuses textile craft with ghost-mapping, avoiding stock necromancy. Risk lies in lyric stasis, but payoff justifies: the map drawn is the traveler’s own exile. Specificity of palace-thread origin prevents generic substitution.</comment>
