<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Mara’s “yearning algorithm” interiority is vivid, but the story never lets her doubt or risk anything; the bell-ringing succeeds exactly as planned, so no consequential choice or visible cost is paid. The glider is described more than steered—no beat where her curiosity collides with fear, fatigue, or irreversible loss. Result: a spirited sprite, not a pressured agent.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Closure is a charming image—the bell’s silent crack dispersing mist—but it reconfirms rather than reweights the premise; we feel no new constraint or forfeiture. Causality is lyrical-accumulative rather than tight: “because/therefore” is replaced by sprightly listing. The lens is Accumulative/Textural; the cadence thickens, yet options never narrow, so the ending lands as tableau, not turn.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Brass ribs, patched sails, acid droplets becoming neon constellations—each detail is filtered through Mara’s inventor gaze and keeps the workshop physically alive. Spatial tracking is clean; the cart glider’s height and the cradle’s warmth are repeatedly re-felt. The setting never blocks or wounds her, so it decorates rather than constrains, preventing 8.8+.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade>
<comment>Stakes are declared—“ring an inaudible bell”—but no counter-force opposes Mara; the sea hisses yet never threatens, the gears merely applaud. Pressure is decorative; escalation consists of prettier lights, not narrowed choices or rising price. Absence of risk flattens the conflict arc.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>Theme of irreverent awe emerges through kaleidoscope rainbows and gears laughing at espresso jokes, but it stays ornamental—no ethical torque or re-pricing of wonder occurs. The bell’s silence-as-punchline is clever, yet the insight feels pre-installed, not wrested from struggle.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Voice is exuberant, brass-and-acid steampunk; diction stays tactile (“hunter’s arrow tip,” “sarcastic philosophers”) and rhythms accelerate with rotor buzz. One POV, steady distance, authorial diction slightly exceeds Mara’s probable lexicon but reads as intentional epic swagger. Clean control earns high-band entry despite minor register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Sentences layer metaphor upon metaphor; at times three consecutive lines each carry a new vehicle (“rebellious kite,” “rusted gears shudder,” “acid vapors crack”) without pattern-payoff, blurring physical logic. Loops of “the ___ sea” and “the ___ gears” create template cadence. Information density is high, but overwriting softens the final image’s punch.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Fusing hunter-arrow bell, cart-glider, and acid sea into a floating forge is fresh synthesis; irreverent awe toward an unaudible bell feels genuinely new. Risk is moderate—concept could collapse into whimsy, yet consistency of tone keeps it aloft. Not quite transformative enough for 9+ because the emotional stakes remain safe.</comment>
