<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mara’s interior tug-of-war—protect the harbor vs. flee it—remains embodied in every beat (cradling crates while whispering the whale-hymn). The scrimshaw’s weight against her palm acts as a tactile reminder of inherited violence, forcing micro-choices that escalate to the altar renunciation. The final stance crystallizes when she releases the bone; cost is the ache of an empty hand now carrying the island’s pulse inside her ribcage. Voice never slips into diagnostic self-help; longing stays salty and calloused.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Mara returns to the same planks, yet the whale’s echo inside her reconfigures the harbor’s meaning from battleground to sanctuary. Lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of sea-pull, bone-pulse, crystal-flare tightens until the last image reweights freedom as internal guardianship rather than escape. Orientation is anchored in first paragraph; no drift. Cost is legible in the cracked scrimshaw and the spirits spiraling away—her inheritance literally fractures to pay the price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>“Sublittoral fringe” and “phosphorescent algae” are not tourism labels; they guide Mara’s footing (slippery dock) and later color the cliff ascension, constraining her path. The whale’s call is rendered as physical vibration in wrist-bone, making environment somatic. Micro-setting (scrimshaw whale-eye) functions as portable horizon that literally unlocks the tower crystal—environment made artifact. Final image of dawn-glistening calm recharges the same sensory palette, now internalized.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—freedom versus guardianship—tightens when the island’s appearance forces Mara to choose: use the bone for personal escape or release ancestral spirits. Escalation is textural: each pulse of sea, bone, and crystal layers pressure until renunciation is the only narrow option left. No coincidence resolves; the whale arrives only after her song detonates the compartment. Cost is the splintered relic and the forever-duty she carries back to the docks.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Theme emerges as “freedom is keeping, not casting off”—the opposite of the legend’s promise. Subtext lives in gesture: spreading arms at dawn replaces any spoken moral. The whale-song-as-key motifies without checklist ornament, reweighted when its echo now protects the harbor she once wanted to flee. Complexity stays: Mara’s tenderness is still combative, but the target shifts from her own restraints to the world’s violence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Mara’s sinews and salt-breath; diction never exceeds a dockworker’s ken (“boots slipping on wet wood” is perfect). Rhythm tightens under pressure—single-sentence lifts like “the sea responded, pulling back the veil” mirror the whale’s inhale. No head-hop; camera fixed to her perception. Internal song is rendered as physical vibration, never abstract therapy.</comment>

<comment>Syntactic variety propels: long tide-like sentences crash into fragments at crystal flare. No filter-verb clusters; “she felt” appears once, justified as tactile bone-pulse. Metaphors stay sea-true (“moon-struck daggers”) without mixed logic. Zero loops or scaffold; each descriptive line also advances choice (slipping boots → need for balance → readiness for flight).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: whale-call as practical skeleton key turns eco-fantasy into emotional archaeology. Disappearing island trope is inverted—it stays visible only when someone refuses to use it for escape. Risk of releasing spirits rather than gaining personal paradise sharpens stakes beyond familiar “find yourself” arc. Specificity of bone-shavings glinting like daggers makes inherited violence corporeal.</comment>
