<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Interiority is lyrically consistent but stays at a meditative register; no contradictory impulses under pressure. The promise to “distill complexity” is declared, yet no micro-choice shows him weighing trade-offs or risking failure—he simply waits and receives the river’s answer. Cost is poetic rather than embodied: the needle cools against his chest, but this is observation, not consequence. Result: a gentle arc of mood, not character.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the gutters fall silent, fog lifts, river mirrors moon—image reweights prior layered metaphor with visible serenity. Causality is accumulative/textural: ambient listening thickens until pattern breaks into silver light; no because/therefore turn, yet cadence shift suffices. Orientation clear by line 4; no lens ambiguity. Cost is conceptual—he accepts that honoring layers is the essence—but felt only faintly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Micro-setting triumph: the yarn needle functions as portable river-altar; its fine tip vibrating in palm supplies tactile anchor that outshines wider geography. Fog, mist, spindrift recur as one mobile texture, never catalogued but filtered through Arlen’s craft-eye (“layers like old manuscripts”). Environment constrains only lightly—visibility narrows, yet no tactical fallout—so misses 9+ gate. Still, sensory economy is exemplary.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—riverside ritual succeeds or fails—signaled early, but pressure stays ambient; no option narrows and no price threatens. Escalation is cadence only: gutters tick, then cease; fog thins. Agency is receptive contemplation; serenity arrives as gift, not earned trade-off. Sufficient for lyric mode, yet too gentle to foreclose paths or raise cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges cleanly: memory is not erased but stitched, honored layer by layer. Palimpsest image migrates from river surface to moral logic without authorial nudge. Final mirror-river image offers non-literal answer—acceptance of layered self. Avoids tidy moral; avoids overt thesis statement; could use one sharper contradiction to deepen resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Poetic free-indirect sustains a hushed, tide-slow cadence that matches fog-bound wait; diction (“spindrift serenity,” “palimpsest promise”) risks ornament yet stays within a coachman-craftsman’s lexicon. Rhythm pulses like distant ticking—long sentences breathe, then shorten at gutter silence. No dialogue to distort voice. Perceptual signature strong: every observation passes through textile metaphor. Elision taught early (“distill complexity into a single stitch”) and paid at mirrored river.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Lyric density flirts with purple, but metaphors stay coherent: river = manuscript, fog = spindrift, needle = stylus. No mixed vehicles; no template cadence runs. Occasional scaffold: “quiet serenity that seemed to percolate…percolate into the mist”—near-paraphrase loop clipped –0.2. Sentence variety excellent; paragraph cuts tidy. Final line earns its propulsion. Within high band, but metaphor crowding keeps it from 9+.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Familiar ingredients—misty river, maternal keepsake, epiphany—made fresh through textile metaphysics: stitching memory rather than conquering it. Conceptual risk: passive protagonist in lyric mode succeeds here because denial of heroic action becomes the point. No derivative phrasing or borrowed set-pieces. Could push further if needle actually pierced fabric or skin to make cost corporeal.</comment>
