<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara’s grief-carving motive is clear and embodied, but her interiority stays poetic-sad rather than contradictory; we see no moment where she almost stops or chooses a different tool. The “hauntingly practical” trait is asserted, never tested against a second option, so her micro-choices feel pre-ordained. The final Charged Poise is earned, yet the cost is ambient (loss already happened) rather than freshly paid on the page. Still, the single-POV widow stance is specific and the carving act tracks her pulse—no head-hop or label-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the lantern crystallizes grief into usable light, cost felt in the softening of the absent roar. Accumulative lens holds—each sensory layer (steam, sap, rust light) thickens the texture until the final image reweights the premise. Causality is internal but coherent: kettle steam → sap softens → glass seals → lantern glows; no teleport or plot amnesia. The tightening is singular yet sufficient for 700-word scope.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Skylight loft, copper roofs, rain beads, and iron gouge are vivid, selective, and filtered through Mara’s circus-widow gaze; none feel touristy. The micro-setting of the carving blank and kettle steams serve as manipulable props that literally constrain her gesture and charge the final lantern image. Spatial choreography is clean—window, table, hearth track logically. Missing 9-band gate because no environmental detail forces a tactical trade-off under pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—convert absence into vessel—signals early and tightens once: sap hardens, foreclosing the option to carve deeper or start over. Agency is present (she presses the glass, lifts the lantern) but the price is conceptual (accepting silence) rather than a live option lost on the page. Pressure grows accumulatively; no coincidence or false cliffhanger. Enough for 8+ eligibility, yet the absence of a second viable path keeps it modest.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of “loss as tool not trap” emerges wholly through image and action—no sermon. The rust-hued peace modulates from mournful to accepting, final lantern image re-pricing the silence without moral cue. Subtext operates in the sap’s amber vault and the rain’s metronome—no need to name grief stages. One minor echo risk: “harvest lessons from loss” edges toward thesis, but it’s buried early and not repeated.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lyric-accumulative voice owns a distinct perceptual signature: rain beads as metronomes, sap as time-capsule, lion’s roar softened to sigh. Rhythm breathes with the kettle’s cadence; no template cadence or register drift. No dialogue, so no voice convergence; single-POV interior diction stays consistent with a circus widow’s lived lexicon. Elision (“circus alchemists once whispered”) is taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies, read-aloud ear test passes; no paraphrase loops or scaffold. Figurative density is high but patterned—each metaphor (steam veins, amber vault, tail-curl steam) recharges the same grief-transmutation axis, so coherence survives. One mixed risk: “rust-hued peace” / “amber blanket” overlap slightly in color space but do not contradict physics. Information density strong; minor filter verbs (“seemed to hold”) do not cluster in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Fresh angle: grief alchemy via sap-sealing into functional lantern, merging circus lore with quiet handicraft. Tropes of widow-loss and attic-healing are subverted by practical act that produces light, not nostalgia artifact. Specificity of circus-town copper roofs and ash wood grain anchors universals. Not 8.5+ because the conceptual twist is incremental rather than riskily structural; still memorable within flash length.</comment>
