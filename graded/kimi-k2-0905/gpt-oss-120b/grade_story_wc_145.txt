<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is concrete—her fingertip trembles as she traces the glass—yet the “dry-witted” trait is only asserted, never spoken or shown. The decision to broadcast is motivated, but the prior beat where she “remembered the falcon” is summary, not simultaneous contradiction. The earned cost is the bell toll and the ice crack, both legible, yet the character’s emotional layering stays thin for 700 words.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the falcon-shadow over the first vein of open water crystallizes the before/after of the thaw, cost felt in the bell clang and boot-cracks. Causality holds: glass condensation → transmitter glyph → bell toll, each because/therefore. The falcon-return rule is taught early and repaid at the last image, so orientation waiver applies; no penalty.</comment>

<comment>The frozen lake, rusted transmitter, and oil-lamp glass all press on choice: the lamp glass becomes the tool that writes the map, the transmitter the only bridge out. Cold, iron-tanged air and crunching ice are filtered through Mara’s map-maker eye—she notices intersecting veins, not tourist vistas. Spatial choreography is clean: desk → pane → antenna → doorstep → ice crack, every move tracked.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—map the river’s origin—signals on page 1 and tightens when the condensation word ‘Kaltwasser’ appears: now the thaw is real, the map must be drawn tonight. One meaningful deepening is sufficient; the bell toll externalizes the cost. No second reversal, but the lens is accumulative/textural; density increase alone is enough.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from recurrence of birth images—ice → water, silence → signal—without moralizing. The final image of the lake singing while the world listens reweights the premise: maps are momentary, rivers remake themselves. Ambiguity lingers: is the broadcast salvation or mere witness? That counter-reading is invited, not resolved.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Mara’s perceptual filter: she sees “metal ribs shivering,” thinks in cartographic metaphor. Syntax flexes with pressure—short fragments when the bell tolls, longer cadences for reflection. No dialogue, so voice distinction bullet waived. Diction stays within her plausible lexicon; “singular convergence” is the only elevated phrase she might actually use.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm is purposeful: variation between sibilant wind lines and clipped toll beats. No loops or synonym churn; “cracked spine cracking” is deliberate sonic echo, not artifact. Information density high—one sentence often does map, body, and weather. Metaphors stay coherent (ice = silence, bell = herald) and do not tangle the closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>The premise—reading river origins in breath-condensation on lamp-glass—is fresh, not a stock trope. Risk is taken with lyric escalation rather than plot reversals, and it pays off in the final sang-ice image. The falcon as seasonal clock and the transmitter as herald fuse myth and tech without gimmickry. Specific detail (dog-ear as “tired ear”) keeps the concept grounded.</comment>
