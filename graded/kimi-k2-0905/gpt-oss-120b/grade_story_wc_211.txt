<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Harel’s contradictory impulses—duty to archive vs. the orchard’s living memory—surface in embodied micro-choices (lifting the cylinder, sealing vellum with his own ink). The final renunciation (recording the prophecy he was never meant to hear) carries visible cost: his ink-blood seals the loop, foreclosing innocence. Interiority stays concrete and language-bound; no diagnostic self-labeling. One slip: the “faint smile” feels externally observed, a rare moment of performed emotion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the accidental prophecy becomes a deliberate promise preserved, reweighting the council’s emotional archive forever. Lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of scent→sound→ink layers—held to the final image. Orientation is anchored by ~100 words; no penalty. The wax shaving’s second use (tone curling through branches) is the tightening beat that reconfigures stakes. Cost is legible: the scribe’s own ink becomes bodily tribute, sealing the loop.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Orchard atop steel is not backdrop but tool: rusted phonograph, pomegranate roots vibrating under Akkadian syllables constrain Harel’s next micro-choice—shaving the cylinder. Sensory hierarchy is language-first, scent-second, reflecting scribe’s vocation. Spatial choreography clean: phonograph → cylinder → vellum → ink drop sequence tracks without drift. Final image of roots humming the city’s future is environment charging closure. No credibility breaks.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—preserve or suppress the accidental prophecy—tightens when the wax shaving releases the city’s sighs; options narrow to record or erase. Agency is attention/renunciation: Harel chooses inscription, paying with his own ink. Escalation is textural density, not causal reversals; pattern break (dead voice in living orchard) reweights stakes. Cost visible: personal ink = blood, sealing archive loop.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</question>
<comment>Theme emerges as memory vs. forecast: archiving emotion becomes prophecy-in-retrospect. Subtext operates through object silence—phonograph’s cracked groove says more than any exposition. Final image (orchard exhaling futures) offers resonant non-literal answer. No thematic echo or moralizing; wisdom stays particular to wax, ink, root.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</question>
<comment>Voice is scribe-specific: diction of “vellum,” “Akkadian,” “emotional palimpsest” stays within professional lexicon. Rhythm modulates—long breathy sentences during immersion, curt Sumerian farewell at end. Perceptual signature is linguistic synesthesia: fruit aroma = dead verbs. No head-hopping; single POV stable. Compression (“velvet disquiet”) taught early and paid off in final breath.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</question>
<comment>Read-aloud cadence: three-beat anaphora (“the orchard… the city… the scribe”) mirrors wax groove loops without mechanical monotony. Figurative language kept sparse; when used (tone curled around branches) it is precise and物理-legible. No filter-verb stacks or scaffold loops. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image. One near-mix: “velvet disquiet” risked abstraction but is re-grounded in orchard’s exhale.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</question>
<comment>Premise splice—dead-language scribe + rooftop orchard + wax oracle—feels inevitable in hindsight. Emotional specificity (children pressing soil, wind pausing at Persian whisper) transforms concept from clever to lived. Risk taken: accumulative lyric structure over plot, yet closure remains legible. Synthesis fresh; no derivative echo of famous scenes.</comment>
