<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Marlowe’s interiority is textured—opal reflections as “his own isolation,” the Edelweis “pulsed against his heart”—and his micro-choices (aligning flower with tide’s longest lull, lighting the lamp) visibly cost him rest and solitude. The alpine/salt contradiction supplies a lived-in flaw, not a label. No second character on stage, so relationship bullet waived. Renunciation of sleep and embrace of lifelong vigil earns Earned Stasis closure under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>2</question>
<grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Single continuous scene, Accumulative/Textural lens taught by ~word 40 (“gaps in the tide’s rhythm”) and held to final image. Closure is Charged Poise: the golden ribbons re-weight memory-oblivion stakes with undeniable cost—he accepts perpetual guardianship. Orientation anchored by word 30; no teleporting props; tide mechanics stay consistent. Cost is legible: “his heart lighter” yet path foreclosed to any life beyond the tower.</comment>

<question>3</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Opal dock surface, mist, nautical twilight, and Edelweiss construe a micro-setting that literally guides his method (gaps match petal spacing). Sensory economy favors touch/vibration over visual catalog. Weather and tide affect timing of lamp lighting. Final image re-uses dock as memory beacon; environment charges closure directly.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“will the stranger be erased?”—is signaled early. Escalation is density/cadence: each tide-gap he maps tightens the obligation until the longest lull forces the flower placement. Agency is observation-as-action; cost is sleepless vigil. No reversals needed under Accumulative lens; one meaningful deepening suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme of memory-as-shelter emerges through tide-gaps → pressed petals → lamp-gold ribbons, never sermonized. Final image offers non-literal answer: remembrance is a living beam, not an archive. Ambiguity accepted—who was the stranger—without equivalence. No echoic thesis line; insight stays implicit.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Marlowe; perceptual signature (“coat frayed like old sea rope,” “bruised lavender”) is consistent and salt-worn. Syntax lengthens under contemplation, shortens under action (“He bent down, fingers trembling”). No dialogue, so dialogue bullets waived. Psychic distance stable; no filter-verb stacks.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; zero paraphrase loops or template cadence. Metaphors (bruised lavender, brittle petals) are controlled—never more than one per high-pressure sentence. Information dense: one sentence often layers tide, emotion, and symbol. No scaffold; opening and closing lines are crisp and propulsive.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Mnemomic tide-reading feels fresh; stranger leaves pressed flower as code is not a trope catalogue. Alpine Edelweiss vs. salt dock creates specific cultural friction. Risk taken with lyric static scene yet closure lands. Could swap alpine bloom for another exotic relic with minor loss, so caps at 8.5.</comment>
