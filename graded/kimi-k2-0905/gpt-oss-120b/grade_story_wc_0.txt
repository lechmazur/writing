<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is vividly concrete early (“she sought to strip needless drama”), but the decisive shift—her embrace of gradualism—rests more on lyrical declaration than on a visible micro-choice that costs her something tangible. The notebook line “The universe preprocesses reality…” is diagnostic self-labeling in the final beat, blunting the emotional payoff.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: dust, cracks, humidity, and vines accrete into a pattern that reweights meaning. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—Mara’s whisper revalues decay—but the cost is only asserted, not dramatized on her body or choice, so the RR never quite stings.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The greenhouse is rendered with sensory economy: “golden ribbons” of light, “soggy fields,” “cool sigh” at night. Crucially, the widening cracks physically constrain Mara’s access and charge the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prove gradual change is observable—tightens once when dust visibly alters humidity gradients. Cost is present (weeks of labor, wooden beams lost) yet feels environmental rather than personal; Mara’s agency is largely recording, not risking.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the accretion of small alterations; the whisper line is the only overt thesis, but it is grounded in the prior dust/crack imagery, so the −0.4 Echo penalty is mild. The refusal of triumph in favor of “relief” lends honest humility.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-limited stays tight; perceptual signature is star-scientist precise (“iridescent scales,” “humidity gradients”). No dialogue to test, but syntax modulates: longer clause-work for contemplation, clipped fragments at “We are all dust…” under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Rhythm breathes with scene tempo; sentences avoid loops. One mixed metaphor—“tomb to a breathing sanctuary”—is minor. Information density is high; each paragraph advances observation or pattern. No filter-verb stacks or template cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Neutron-star mind meeting butterfly dust is fresh synthesis; gradual change as scientific method rather than sentimental trope feels non-obvious. Risk lies in the quiet ending, but coherence holds. No close echoes of famous scenes.</comment>
