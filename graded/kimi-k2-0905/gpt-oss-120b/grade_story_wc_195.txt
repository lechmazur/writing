<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The knight’s interiority is lyrically rendered but abstract; “capture the shape of possibility” is repeated rather than embodied in micro-choices. No contradictory impulse is dramatized under pressure; the armor-melt is passive, not a willed renunciation, so the change feels bestowed rather than earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: pattern of vapor, script, moss, spores layers until the knight’s armor dissolves into living tapestry—an earned stasis with visible cost. Orientation is late (~140 words) but the disorientation pays off in closure, so waiver applies. The script-unfurl beat supplies the decisive reconfiguration; cost is felt in the bodily merger.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Coppered vines, luminescent moss, rusted control panel are tactile and constrain action: the glyphs must be touched, the moss ingests armor. Greenhouse breathes alchemy, but spatial ground holds; every descriptor feeds the accrual that climaxes in the knight’s dissolution. Micro-setting (armor, script) charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“shape of possibility”—is signaled early; pressure intensifies as each alchemical element narrows options toward bodily surrender. No external antagonist, but accretive texture forces stance crystallization: final fusion forecloses solitary wandering. Cost is legible in the armor’s loss; escalation is steady under accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme of loyalty-as-song emerges through vapor bridges, phantom applause, and final murmured pact; no moralizing statement. Allegiance shifts from unseen audience to possibility itself, reweighted by bodily price. Ambiguity lingers: is the knight erased or amplified? Resonance arises from organic image pattern, not thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person lyric voice maintains consistent distance; diction (“shivering bliss,” “midnight alchemy”) is patterned early and paid off. Syntax modulates with pressure—long breathless clauses build to short final whisper. No dialogue, so voice carries all texture; perceptual signature is cold, metallic, then vegetal, tracking knight’s dissolution.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Figurative density is high but purposeful under accumulative design; mixed metaphors (“script unfurled like a living serpent breathing fire”) verge on excess yet serve the climactic reconfiguration. Occasional scaffold (“the night itself seemed…”) is minor; rhythm breathes with escalation. No loops or filter stacks; clarity intact at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Alchemical orchard + marionette theater is a fresh synthesis; knight’s self-dissolution into vegetal stage flips heroic quest trope. Risky bodily merger is fully committed, not hedged. Specificity of coppered vines and frost-kiss pact keeps it from feeling generic fairy-tale. Transformation feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
