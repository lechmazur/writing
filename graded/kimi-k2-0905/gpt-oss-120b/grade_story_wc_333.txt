<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The locksmith’s interiority is lyrically sustained yet abstract; emotions are named rather than embodied (e.g., “impossible longing”). No contradictory impulse is staged in scene—resolve is steady—so the arc leans symbolic, not crucible. The moment he eases the ribbon is decisive, but the cost feels cosmic rather than personal; stakes diffuse. Earned, but at a mythic distance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the freed filament reweights fear/courage for travelers yet to come. Causality is lyric-accumulative; each starlit image thickens texture until the filament’s release reframes the rule-set. Orientation is deliberate dream-logic; waiver applies because disorientation pays off in the final reconfiguration. Cost is cosmic, not character-bound—still legible and resonant.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Starlight, shifting cobbles, and ribbon-glint supply selective, POV-filtered sensory density. The nexus functions as micro-setting that guides the locksmith’s footfalls and attention; the ribbon’s groove is the tactile pivot. No occupational detail demanded; cosmic scale stays consistent. Final filament image recharges the starlit veil, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—liberate an idea from fear—remains coherent. Escalation is textural: star-cues, path-shifts, ribbon-glint tighten the lyric pressure rather than causal reversals. The filament’s release reweights stakes for future travelers, not the locksmith, so cost is conceptual rather than personal. Sufficient intensification for 600-word lyric arc.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through image-pattern—lock, ribbon, filament—rather than statement. Final filament as living bridge reconfigures fear into courage without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers: whose fear, which travelers? That open charge is earned by particulars. No final-paragraph thesis drop; resonance stays imagistic.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person lyric voice sustains a starlit, sighing cadence; diction stays within mythic register. Repetition of “longing,” “starlight,” and “hush” is pattern-taught, paid off in filament image. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk zero. Psychic distance stable; no filter-verb bloat. Rhythm breathes with paragraph swells; final line lands quiet but charged.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Metaphor density is high—almost every sentence—but the cosmic tenor is taught early and held, so −0.3 not −0.7. Mixed metaphors (“tapestry woven from forgotten dreams”) risk purple yet stay within dream-logic. No synonym churn or template cadence; sentence openers vary. Momentum breathes with long phrasal units; filament release line is clear and uncluttered.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Conceptual premise—idea as physical lock freed by hair/ribbon—is fresh synthesis of myth and metaphor. Starlit nexus, shifting path, and living filament feel specific to this piece, not template. Risk is lyric accumulation rather than causal twist; freshness lies in imagistic coherence. Could not swap ribbon for key; the groove-match is irreplaceable.</comment>
