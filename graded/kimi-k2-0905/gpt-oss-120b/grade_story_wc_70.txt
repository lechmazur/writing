<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara’s involuntary truthfulness is a vivid, embodied trait—her confession “I had hoped the drone would bring back the lost chorus” is a micro-choice that costs her mystique and bends the ritual toward communion. The interior contradiction—duty to routine vs. longing for wonder—remains present but is stated more than dramatized; we’re told she “swore to preserve wonder” rather than seeing that oath tested under fire. The lone drone’s reappearance is the pivot, yet Mara’s agency is largely receptive: she inserts key, watches light cascade, receives answer “Echo.” Earned stasis is credible—she accepts the echo as enough and keeps truthful toll—yet the cost feels conceptual rather than visceral because the scene never endangers her job or safety.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure is a crisp Resonant Reconfiguration: the tower’s amber veins and the citizens’ lingering ceremony visually reweight the premise—routine itself becomes spectacle. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens: each paragraph adds a sensory layer (blackout silence → lacquer sheen → brass key → amber echo) that tightens the stake of recovering wonder. The “Echo” glyph is the single meaningful intensification; it is sufficient for this length but lands gently—no option is foreclosed, only re-seen. Cost is conceptual (the hive loss was necessary pause) and is legible in the final image of honeyed light; a hair stronger visceral price would nudge this to 8.5.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Lightning tower as micro-setting is tactile—rusted shelf, glass rods, velvet nest—each object handled under pressure. The lacquer box’s oily sheen and the matchbox hum give a sensory signature that charges the reveal. Spatial choreography is clean: Mara → office → tower core; drone hover anchors vertical scale. Weather is used (dusk melting into night) but only as tonal wash; it doesn’t constrain choices. Environment shapes final image—amber veins dripping like honey—meeting the 9+ gate by recharging the ritual.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“preserve wonder in routine”—is signaled early and reweighted when the echo answer reframes hive failure as necessary silence. Escalation is a single cadence shift: riddle → key → light → echo; agency is mostly receptive, narrowing to acceptance rather than active gambit. Cost is conceptual (city’s voice returning) and felt in citizens’ lingering; a sharper tangible loss (time, safety, social credit) would deepen pressure. Under Accumulative lens, the tightening is the amber revelation—enough for this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete returns: failed buzz → echo → citizens’ hush, showing wonder as auditory afterimage. Subtext operates in gesture—drone hovering over matchbox instead of speaking. Final image reframes maintenance as communion without moralizing. Complexity acknowledged: wonder needs absence; no tidy redemption of hive. Insight is earned via sensory particulars, not pronouncement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person lyric voice sustains a consistent perceptual signature: silver bells, nectar dusk, amber veins—metaphors stay within Mara’s truth-tuned sensorium. Rhythm modulates—long liquid sentences for dusk, staccato “Echo” glyph—supporting pressure. No dialogue, so voice carries all; diction stays poetic yet precise. Filter verbs minimal; no head-hop. Slight register lift (“conceptual repricing”) is narrator, not Mara, but occurs post-closure and reads as choral coda acceptable at this distance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm is varied; sentences breathe with dusk cadence. Information density high—each sentence layers metaphor and action. No loops or scaffold; figurative language is patterned (light = nectar, sound = echo) and pays off. Minor overwriting: “tower sang with the echo of its own heartbeat” is mixed metaphor (towers don’t sing with hearts) but occurs after closure so does not obscure final image. Overall propulsion clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Premise—lightning-harvesting toll keeper revives city wonder via riddle-key-echo—is fresh synthesis of eco-SF and ritual fiction. Trope of drone apocalypse is inverted: failure becomes necessary silence, not tragedy. Specific detail—velvet nest, oily sheen, amber honey—anchors oddity in tactile world. Risk of poetic obscurity is taken but coherence holds; transformation test passes: story would collapse without truth-toll + echo mechanic. Final reconfiguration feels inevitable yet unforeseen.</comment>
