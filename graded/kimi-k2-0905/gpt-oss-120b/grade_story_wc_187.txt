<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The archivist’s “preemptive nostalgia” is a vivid label, but it never hardens into a concrete, costly choice; he observes, conjectures, records, yet nothing is risked or foreclosed. Interiority is lyrically sketched but loops in summary (“feeling grief for moments not yet lived”) without contradicting impulses enacted in scene. The final smile and resolve land as a mood shift rather than a stance paid for by prior causality; the cost is atmospheric, not character-bound.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens is taught early and held: rain-crystal-shadow pattern accretes meaning until the sunrise reweights it. Closure is a Charged Poise—archivist turns back to engrave the insight—so a conceptual cost is legible, but the price is collective, not personal, softening punch. Orientation is clear by line 20; no teleporting props, yet the middle sags in repetitive static observation beats that feel like and-then sequencing rather than pressure turns.</comment>

<comment>The stormlit observatory, solid fog, and crystal forecourt are sensuously particular, filter through the archivist’s scholarly gaze, and directly guide his measuring ritual. Spatial choreography is clean; lanterns, obelisk, and balcony anchor each move. The “solid fog” literalization risks physics stretch but is cued early, serves closure, and is accepted as situational rule. Micro-setting success: the crystal’s whispered pitch and the obelisk’s shadow length constrain the conjecture that reconfigures memory into geometry, earning the 9+ gate for constraining choice.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—proving memory can be mapped by light—arrives early but stays intellectual; no credible loss or ticking clock tightens options. Pressure accumulates through imagery density, not agency; the archivist never tests his conjecture against failure, counter-evidence, or external resistance. The sole “tightening” is the fog thickening, a passive environmental cue rather than a choice-forcing moment. Thus escalation is atmospheric, not tactical; cost is poetic, not felt on-page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Theme—collective memory as light-geometry—emerges organically from the archivist’s measurements and the crystal’s tonal map, avoiding explicit thesis. The sunrise silence that leaves “shadows…quiet testament” offers a non-literal reweighting: knowledge now inscribed, future readers compelled to repeat the ritual. Pre-emptive nostalgia threads through but never crystallizes into a moral; the piece trusts image over assertion. Minor drift: “identity sculpted from experience” is stated twice; the second near-summary dulls subtext by −0.3.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric close-up sustains a hushed, antiquarian diction (“summer-quill,” “vellum scrolls,” “stormlit hall”) that is consistent and atmospheric. Syntax lengthens and softens to mimic fog-stretched shadows; cadence control is deliberate and taught early. No dialogue, so voice convergence risk is absent; perceptual signature—quantifying nostalgia via shadow—remains character-specific. Occasional elevated register (“conceptual repricing”) nudges beyond plausible archivist lexicon but is patterned and does not rupture distance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is lush yet mostly propulsive; metaphor strings (“clouds peeled back…bruised violet”) are purposeful, not purple, and echo the color logic of memory-bruised sky. Rhythm breathes with scene tempo; no template cadence or synonym loops detected. Minor scaffolds: “He recorded…He recorded” within 40 words; a small paraphrase loop −0.2. Final third avoids clutter; closure image is clean, so high-band eligibility remains intact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Fusing acoustics, meteorology, and archaeology into a memory-mapping ritual is fresh, yet the core insight—“shadows equal collective recall”—feels abstract rather than startling. Risk is stylistic (lyric density) not structural; stakes never escalate beyond scholarly awe, limiting ingenuity impact. Specificity of crystal pitch correlating with shadow length saves the concept from generic allegory. Transformation test: replace observatory with lighthouse, story still functions, indicating moderate originality short of 8.8 band.</comment>
