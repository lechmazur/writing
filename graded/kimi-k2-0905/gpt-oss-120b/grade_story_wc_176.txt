<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is lyrically rendered but drifts into self-diagnosis (“after forgiving yourself…”) that flattens contradiction. The “technically gentle” trait is asserted, never tested against a moment where gentleness costs her. Because the rope and cylinder do the active work, her agency feels supervisory; the emotional thaw is vivid but not earned through a visible choice that risks anything. She changes, yet the change is given, not wrested.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the rope’s new luminous map re-weights memory’s value and carries conceptual cost—the sanctum is now a living archive. Causality, however, is soft: the rope’s re-braiding succeeds on the first attempt, no loop snaps, no alternative is foreclosed, so the “before/after” feels gifted rather than fought for. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern and cadence escalate—but the single tightening beat is the same as the final image, so escalation and resolution collapse into one glow. Still, the image itself is legible and charged.</comment>

<comment>Ice, aurora, copper, and sinew are filtered through Mara’s metal-worker eye, giving tactile hierarchy: frost “delicate veins,” copper “inner light.” The sanctum’s cold actively resists and yields—ice softens only after the rope sings—so environment and tool reciprocally constrain action. Spatial choreography is clean; barefoot on frost implies cost yet she never floats. Micro-setting (rope, cylinder) functions as geography, charging the final map of light.</comment>

<comment>Stake—preserve forgotten names—is declared early but never complicated; no name resists transcription, no resource is depleted, no ethical tension surfaces. Pressure is atmospheric, not tactical: the rope glows, names release, sanctum thaws—each escalation is a beneficent amplification without trade-off. The lone traveler’s arrival adds a coda, not a reversal. No option narrows, no price is exacted; the conflict is purely restorative.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Theme—memory as thaw—emerges through recurring melt imagery rather than statement. The final auroral applause is an image, not a moral. Yet the concept stays one-note: forgetting is cold, remembrance is warm; counter-readings are not invited. Subtext is thin because no character resists or misuses the names; the ethical dimension of resurrecting the dead is unraised. Still, the emotional after-effect is coherent and unsentimental.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Third-limited stays tightly fused to Mara’s metal-caster sensorium: “fingertips technically gentle,” “molten metal” memory. Syntax lengthens and softens during thaw, mirroring release; diction remains within artisan lexicon. No head-hop; the traveler is seen only from her stance. Filter verbs are minimal; perception is concrete. Voice is consistent, textured, and purpose-modulated.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Lyric density is high but patterned early—aurora, frost, copper—so it reads as taught texture rather than ornament overload. Mixed metaphors are rare; “snowmelt ardor” is abstract but single-use. Occasional template cadence (“each loop…each name…each syllable”) creates liturgical rhythm that serves theme, not monotony. No paraphrase loops; sentences advance. A few adjectival stacks (“brittle rectangle of paper with tiny perforations”) could trim, but none obscure causality or dull the final image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>The icebound auroral archive feels fresh, yet its core—music box resurrects dead names—is recognizably Orphean. Specificity of lost-wax craft, reindeer-sinew rope, and punched-card encoding transforms the trope into a vernacular Arctic tech that feels discovered, not borrowed. Risk is moderate: the piece chooses lyric restoration over conflict, avoiding darker implications. The synthesis is memorable even if not radically unprecedented.</comment>
