<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is rich—her “affectionate detachment” is embodied in every gesture, especially the final tuck of the empty vial. The contradiction between caring for emotions yet commodifying them is dramatized, not labeled. No second character on-page, so no status crucible, but her micro-choices (rub, inhale, seal) reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost. The only barrier to 9+ is that the renunciation/stance crystallization is subtle rather than wrenching; the cost is felt but not devastating.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the grotto’s whisper and the sealed vial reweight the entire emotional economy, making the commodification of feeling legible and irreversible. Causal lens holds: each step (rub→inhale→seal) is a because/therefore linkage that narrows options. Orientation is anchored by line 3; no debt. Cost is unmistakable in the final image—“the amber glow sealing the static charge inside”—a permanent, sellable scar.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The amber grotto is not backdrop; its static-charged walls literally enable the protagonist’s method and mirror her detachment. The blotter petal functions as micro-setting/object that constrains every tactical move. Sensory detail is selective—taste of old rain, iridescent veins—filtered through Mara’s perfumer lens. One hairline slip: “city lights flickered on” is a touch generic, but the grotto itself is irreplicable.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—harvest a sellable emotion—signaled early. Escalation is accumulative/textural: each static crackle thickens the emotional residue until the vial’s click forecloses the option to stop. Visible price: the grotto retains a “whisper of static,” a permanent loss of secrecy. Could edge higher if a live buyer appeared to raise jeopardy, but the internal pressure is coherent.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: the commodification of empathy turns insight into narcotic illusion. The half-truth motif is lived—every scent is a partial, sellable lie—never lectured. Final image of the empty grotto whispering reweights earlier beauty as complicity. Avoids 9+ only because the moral question is so cleanly distilled it flirts with neatness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is luxuriant yet controlled: “taste of old rain,” “liquid gold,” syntactic variation mirrors the grotto’s shimmer. Perceptual signature is perfumer-sharp—every emotion is noted by olfactory nuance. No dialogue, so no contamination. Under peak stress (“vortex of colors”), diction compresses but never fragments; rhythm stays deliberate, matching measured detachment.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>High information density: one sentence often fuses sensory, emotional, and commercial data. Metaphors are consistent—amber, static, gold, dust—no mixed vehicles. One minor loop: “sealed the vial with a click, the amber glow sealing…” (seal/sealed) could be pruned. No artifacts in closure beat; propulsion carries to final line.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Premise—emotion distillation via static-charged grotto—is fresh, yet emotionally ancient. Combines scent-tech, noir commerce, and lyric ecology in a way that feels inevitable. Risky lyric compression succeeds because pattern is taught early (“walls humming… tasted of old rain”) and paid off in final whisper. Removing Mara’s profession or the grotto would collapse the entire fabric.</comment>
