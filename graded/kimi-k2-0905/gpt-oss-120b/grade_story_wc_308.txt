<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority is richly embodied (“weathered resolve settle into her marrow”); her micro-choices—placing the arrowhead, inhaling the wave, bowing—trace a credible arc from passive listening to earned, motionless navigation. The renunciation of physical departure is foreshadowed and charged with cost (“the canyon’s history settle like dust on her shoulders”). No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene, keeping this just below exceptional.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the instant she turns inward, the lattice of wind/bird/echo is reweighted to an internal compass, cost felt in the extinguishing arrowhead glow and vanished flock. The accumulative lens holds throughout—density of echo, dust, pulse—culminating in the crystallized stance. Orientation is taught early by the basalt niche and skeletal towers, waived penalty. Persistent constraint (motionless navigation) shapes every beat after midpoint.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is not postcard but instrumental: the cracked platform, bone towers, and wind-traced runes physically guide her glide and appraising act. The “towers of bone” and “endless echoes” recur as active agents that vibrate approval, directly constraining her final decision to stay. Micro-setting (arrowhead rim, basalt niche) doubles as tool and map. Sensory hierarchy narrows to tactile pressure waves and internal compass, mirroring her narrowing motion.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“navigate without moving”—is signaled in line 3 and tightens when the arrowhead’s resonance offers the sole means; failure equals eternal wandering. Escalation is accumulative: each echo layer, bird spiral, and glow pulse deepens the cost of stillness. The final stance crystallizes options: internal map vs. physical exit. No coincidence; pressure is coherent under Accumulative lens, but visible price (glowing arrowhead dimming) is subtle, not viscerally paid.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of stillness-as-motion emerges through concrete recurrence of echo, pulse, and lattice; no abstract statement. Final image—starlit inward gaze—reweights earlier bird patterns as internal code without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers: will the pulse later lure her outward? The refusal to leave carries conceptual cost: she trades freedom for custodianship, rendered in dust settling on shoulders—earned wisdom, not platitude.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Voice is lyric-accumulative: syntactic parallelism (“she…she…she”) mirrors the layered echoes, taught by 5% mark and paid off in the final “pulse’s faint whisper.” Perceptual signature is canyon-bound—sound as pressure, history as dust—never ventriloquizing beyond her senses. Diction stays within wind/stone lexicon; no filter-verb stacks. Rhythm breathes with scene: longer clauses during listening, fragment-like she-iteratives under final resolve.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence adds new layer (echo, glow, lattice). Figurative language is patterned and taught—“ancient ribs,” “living compass”—paid off when towers “breathe a sigh of relief.” No mixed metaphors; stone/bird/echo logic stays coherent. Information density high: one sentence often couples sensory detail with mythic register (“channeling the endless echoes that had layered themselves through centuries of dust”).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Freshens familiar mystic-canyon trope by reversing the quest: not exit but internal cartography. Synthesis of ornithomancy + lithic resonance + non-motion navigation feels specific to this world. Risk in motionless climax is taken; coherence retained. Could edge higher if the arrowhead’s runic language had non-generic payoff.</comment>
