<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Mara’s grief-anchored attention and Eli’s quieter mentorship feel lived-in; the coral witness backstory is shown through dawn ritual, not told. Interior contradiction surfaces in her periodic-eternal loop—wanting to read erased paths yet fearing their silence. The final micro-choice to trust the canyon coordinate costs her the safety of ignorance, earned by prior tapping beats. Eli stays secondary; his pressure is ambient, not relational, so relationship-as-crucible doesn’t activate.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the console coordinate crystallizes a new navigable path, reweighting the atlas tear from loss to compass. Causal chain holds: tapping → resonance → canyon match → sea-level confirmation. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (reclaimed pier, dawn, fossil-fuel ban). One minor causal fuzz: how a watermark on paper maps to submerged canyon is asserted not demonstrated, but the lyrical lens absorbs it.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The station’s skeletal hum, steel table, and tide-breath create a micro-setting that literally dictates method (tapping) and final data alignment. Sensory hierarchy is Mara-biased: color-lost coral, salt hush, metronomic steel—every detail filters through her bereaved attention. The atlas fragment evolves from prop to tool to cipher, its tear edge handled twice on-page. Spatial choreography is clean: pier–table–console form one contiguous crucible.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—decode why marine paths vanish—tightens when the watermark-canyon link offers a restorable compass. One meaningful deepening: sea-level rise forecasts echo the old map, fusing archival and future loss. Agency is attentional—assemble, listen, correlate—rather than external action, fitting accumulative lens. Cost is conceptual: the reef’s silence is now legible as navigational amnesia, foreclosing the comfort of mystery.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</question>
<comment>Theme emerges as “extinction is a loss of orientation, not just life.” The atlas tear and coral bleaching mirror each other’s erasure; final image of recalibrating compass fuses restoration with acknowledgment of ongoing rise. No moralizing—resonance is imagistic. Subtext in tapping: human rhythm trying to sync with a pulse that is already receding—cultural and biological metronomes diverging.</question>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Mara’s perceptual filter: “paling reefs that still whispered their loss” is idiosyncratic, not generic eco-grief. Rhythm mimics tidal sway—long sentences drift, then abrupt taps break cadence. No dialogue; therefore no voice convergence risk. Free indirect texture (“She believed…”) is clean, never slips into explanatory omniscience.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and double-tasking: “drifting moored, a calm sway that kept them anchored while thoughts floated like kelp” marries image to psychological state. Metaphors stay marine-coherent; no mixed vehicles. One loop near-miss: “periodically eternal” is repeated thrice—because it is a motif, the pattern justifies itself. Final line cadence mirrors opening, creating circular ear-music without algorithmic monotony.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fusion of coral bleaching with cartographic erasure feels non-obvious; “missing paths” literalized as chemical gradient collapse is fresh science. Tapping ritual turns data table into coral surrogate—organic tech overlap that recharges both stakes and method. Risk is quiet: no villains, no storm, yet climax holds. Specificity anchors universality: this station, this torn page, this lone dawn ritual.</comment>
