<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The conductor’s “mournfully eager” interiority is palpably embodied—trembling palm, wet eyes, sync with hidden heartbeats—yet his contradictory drive (grief vs. healing) stays active in scene. The single micro-choice chain—pull cord → vortex → ash → laughter—earns the closure. No second character, so status/relationship bullets are waived. Still, the flaw is minor: the epiphany risks a hair of therapeutic self-diagnosis (“he realized the power…”) but pays it immediately with the next pull.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the leaf-blower blade stills, the house flickers awake, the conductor vanishes, leaving laughter as undeniable conceptual cost. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each blower-gust thickens sonic density until silence is re-priced as song. Orientation secure by line 3 (“hollow echo chamber tunnel”). No teleporting props; hourglass grain payoff lands exactly where tunnel exhales. The only micro-slip: “vanish” is slightly abstract, but the charged image of wind-backed laughter remains legible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Echo-tunnel is no postcard; its arches, cracked column, and ash-cloud ash actively shape战术—sound macerates silence because stone amplifies. Leaf-blower’s metallic breath and pull-cord click are tactile, auditory micro-settings that constrain every beat. Hourglass and photograph function as body-proximate tools whose final shiver recharges stakes. Meets 9+ gate: the tunnel’s acoustic rule directly charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“restore lost laughter”—is signaled in paragraph 1 and narrows to one irrevocable tactic: keep pulling until silence sings. Escalation is textural: each blower pulse thickens sonic density, reweighting grief into audible joy. The visible price is the conductor’s vanishing (exit from mourning), paid on-page. Coincidence absent; pressure coils under own agency. Sufficient for length, though a second tightening beat could have pushed higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges without sermon: grief is not a void but raw material for song. Repricing occurs when off-key wind becomes laughter’s carrier, reweighting haunting from prison to backdrop. Subtext lives in gesture—the cord cradle returned like a violin in its case. No explicit thesis; final image of wind-backed giggles offers non-literal answer. Minor docking for “true haunting” tag in penultimate clause—slightly overt—but resonance survives.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays tight to conductor’s perceptual bias: every whir, click, ash speck is filtered through his ear-eye-heart. Syntax mirrors breath—“half-sung lullaby, each phrase torn off-key”—creating rhythmic signature under pressure. No head-hop; interior access modest. Diction poetic yet controlled, never purple; elastic enough for “macerate” and “embers” without register drift. Dialogue absent by design; voice coherence excellent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies: long fugue sentences swell, then fracture at cord-click. Metaphors stay coherent—leaf-blower as baton, sound as surgeon’s blade—without mixed logic. No synonym loops; “mournfully eager” recurs twice but reweights at closure. Information density high: one sentence = blower-breath + ash motes + joke-embers. Only micro-slip: “vanish into shadows” is slightly generic; does not dull final image clarity. Well within elite range.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Premise—lone maestro reviving dead laughter with a leaf-blower in echo tunnel—is non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Tropes (haunted house, hourglass, lullaby) are subverted through acoustic alchemy rather than exorcism. Specific detail—rusted blower as baton, ash as punchline dust—anchors freshness. Risk of gimmickry avoided by embodied cost: conductor exits, laughter stays. Transformation test passed: plot collapses if tool becomes generic vacuum.</comment>
