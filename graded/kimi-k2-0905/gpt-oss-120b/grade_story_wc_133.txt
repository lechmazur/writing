<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Mara’s insomniac painter trait is vivid—“endless parade of colors that refused to settle into sleep”—and her motive to “thresh meaning” is repeatedly voiced, but the interior contradiction never surfaces in a visible micro-choice; the brooch exchange happens to her rather than forcing a wrenching decision, so the cost feels inferred, not embodied. The final stance is declared, not dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The piece lands a clean Charged Poise closure: the mist-varnished cliffs and hung-up brooch reconfigure Mara’s palette into “a single, trembling note of hope,” cost visible in the surrendered canvases. Causal chain is lyric-accumulative rather than strict because/therefore, but the rain-trail pattern is taught early and holds to the final image; no orientation drift. Slight over-reliance on declarative summary in the climax keeps it from full 8+.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The tidal island is rendered through tactile mist-catchers, salt-slick basalt, and candle-flicker studios; environment directly shapes access to water and the means of discovery. The brooch-as-micro-setting charges the final image when hung above the easel, satisfying the 9+ gate. Sensory selection stays inside Mara’s painterly bias—colors refusing sleep—so every detail doubles as character filter.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stakes are declared early: canvases vs. convergence. Pressure tightens once when the brooch demands the exchange; however, the escalation is mostly lyrical repetition (“rain trails whispered”) rather than a narrowing of options. The cost is real—paintings surrendered—but because Mara does not resist or bargain, agency reads passive; the turn is atmospheric, not tactical. Still, the final mist-veil makes the trade undeniable, meeting the lens-specific requirement for Accumulative/Textural deepening.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the image-exchange: art as the island’s memory, rain as pigment. The closing ribbon-of-rain image reweights earlier grief without moralizing. One tiny echo of prompt language (“thresh meaning”) is tucked mid-story, not deployed as final thesis, so resonance stays intact. Ambiguity—will the mist truly heal?—lingers credibly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Mara’s painterly sensorium; diction (“bruised sky,” “gutted candles”) is specific and consistent. Syntax grows clipped under pressure—“She lifted the amber brooch”—mirroring breathless awe. No dialogue to test voice distinction, but internal cadence holds. Filter verbs are minimal; perceptual signature remains intact.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is generally clean, with strong nouns and varied rhythm, but figurative runs stack in climactic column—“rain trail seemed to converge…spiraling upward…like a lantern”—creating slight purple swirl that dulls immediacy. One paraphrase loop (“meaning she had long been threshing”) repeats concept within three lines. Closure image itself is sharp, so the −0.4 artifact penalty applies, not deeper.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Post-apocalyptic water-artist is familiar, but the convergence-as-pigment metaphor and mist-catcher ecology feel fresh. The exchange of sleepless canvases for a single breath of rain-threaded stone is a specific, irreplicable turn. Risk is moderate—lyric accumulation over plot—but the synthesis coheres without gimmick. Could edge higher if the sacrifice were more actively resisted.</comment>
