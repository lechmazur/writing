<comment>Interiority is mostly sensory and goal-driven (“he began…examining crack patterns”); the mapkeeper’s etched skin and silver pulses give a vivid bodily anchor. Yet his emotional state stays on a single calm-desire plane; no contradictory impulse ever contests the quest for quiet, so the arc is smooth rather than pressured. The final smile is earned, but the cost is atmospheric, not personal—he never risks or loses anything on-page—so the “visible cost” bar for 9+ isn’t quite cleared.</comment>

<comment>Causal chain is clean: ice-crack map → tunnel opens → stone retrieved → hush blooms → beings dim → repose restored. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the caves’ new quiet is legible, the stone’s steady pulse an audible metronome of peace, and the mapkeeper’s whispered promise shows future vigilance as cost. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“deepest chamber”); no lens ambiguity. Minor slip: “he had been waiting after the energy beings arrive” flattens tense; still, causality holds.</comment>

<comment>The harmonic caves function as a living instrument: every fissure sings, the basalt pedestal hums, the sapphire tunnel glows—the environment literally guides fingertips and later pacifies the energy beings. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: sound and touch dominate, color stays secondary. Spatial choreography is flawless (western mouth → hidden panel → central fissure spine). The echo chamber stone itself serves as micro-setting that charges the final image, meeting the 9+ gate; only the slightest tourist-catalog cadence in “ripple-mark mapkeeper” keeps it shy of 9.0.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—“find the quiet in the storm”—is signaled early and tightens once: the stone must be found and placed before the resonant storm peaks. Agency is present: tracing cracks, lifting stone, aligning it with the spine fissure. Cost is atmospheric (storm dims) rather than a forfeited object or option; pressure coheres under Situational lens but never narrows to a trade-off that hurts the protagonist. Enough for solid 8-band, but lacks a visible price that alters his future tactics.</comment>

<comment>Theme emerges without statement: quiet is not absence but calibrated balance between echo and silence, shown when ice fissures melt into dripping silence. The stone’s glow and the beings’ dimming reweight the idea at the end, offering a Conceptual Repricing. No moralizing, no “lesson”—just the final image of gold-veined charts pulsing with heartbeat. Slight abstraction in “bloom of hush” keeps it from top band.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person POV stays locked to the mapkeeper; perceptual signature is consistent—sound before sight, silver lines as memory skin. Syntax flexes with pressure: long sentences during search, staccato fragments when panel opens (“a soft sigh…slid aside”). No filter-verb clutter; diction stays within plausible cave-keeper lexicon. The lyric repetition of “gently luminous” is patterned early and paid off in the final stone glow—earned, not ornamental.</comment>

<comment>Prose is dense and musical—“low, reverberating tones,” “hammered repose,” “bloom of hush”—yet each phrase advances atmosphere or stakes. No loops, no scaffold, no mixed metaphors; vehicles stay acoustic/ geological. Information often twin-loads: “dripping silence” is both sensory and causal (ice melting signals success). One near-purple phrase—“living auroras”—is acceptable under lyrical license. Closure line breathes cleanly without figurative muddle.</question>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses acoustics and archaeology: a mapkeeper who reads fracture-chords to locate a silence-stone is fresh. The inversion—energy beings soothed not by banishment but by calibrated quiet—reweights familiar “storm vs. sanctuary” trope. Specificity sells it: ripple-mark skin, sapphire tunnel, gold-veined charts. Risk lies in the lyric accumulative structure; it pays off when the final hush lands as felt vacuum. Not quite a 9 because the beings remain generic bright auroras without individuation.</comment>
