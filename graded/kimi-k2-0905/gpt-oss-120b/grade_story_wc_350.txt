<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The librarian’s interiority is lyrical but consistent—her humming, the etching of verses on planks, the gesture of returning the weight all crystallize her empathetic-decisive trait with visible cost (she gives the city her night's labor and her own lullaby). Contradictory impulses (desire to heal vs. fear the silos will refuse) are implied rather than dramatized in-scene, so the psychological tension is poetic rather than raw. No secondary character exerts live pressure, so the "crucible" test is moot. Closure is earned: her body aches, the weight is returned, the city breathes as one—cost is felt.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each chanted language layer thickens the sonic pattern until the final cadence reweights the stakes from isolation to communal song. Closure is a Charged Poise—the tower’s dawn chime crystallizes options (bridges exist, silos now sing) with undeniable conceptual cost: she has spent her archive of voices in one night. Causality is lyric, not mechanical, but the pattern is taught early and paid off in the last line. Orientation is anchored by word 40 ("old city... astronomical clock tower"); no debt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The clock tower functions as micro-setting: its brass balcony, gears, and weight directly constrain her tactics (she must climb, lift, drop). Grain-silo geography is sketched through sound propagation rather than mapped distance, but spatial coherence is maintained—sound travels, workers emerge, bridges span. Sensory hierarchy favors aurality over visual, matching the choral premise. The tower’s stained-glass starlight returns in the final image, recharging the closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—heal the city’s scars through song—tightens once when the first polyglot chime converts elevator drone into chorus; options narrow from solitary librarian vs. silent silos to united civic voice. Cost is legible: she spends her hoarded linguistic weight (brass + languages) in one night, ending with empty hands and a hoarse tower. Agency is accumulative rather than confrontational, fitting the lyric mode. No external antagonist needed; the pressure is the void itself.</answer>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges non-declaratively: bridges built from song literalize the idea that shared art can repair industrial rupture. The cuckoo weight’s return reframes time from mechanical metronome to compassionate heartbeat—Conceptual Repricing with felt cost. No character utters a moral; the final image (city breathing as one) answers the thematic question sensorially. Ambiguity lingers: will the songs survive daylight? Complexity embraced without forced equivalence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person lyric voice sustains a choral cadence—anaphora, synesthetic diction ("grain turned into bread... hands that sang while they sowed")—without losing clarity. No dialogue, so zero dialogue penalties. Psychic distance remains steady, tightening only in the final paragraph when dawn light shifts to internal metaphor. Register stays within the librarian’s imaginative lexicon; no academic intrusion. Rhythm modulates: long breathless sentences mirror nocturnal labor, short final sentence mimics dawn exhale.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</question><comment>Strong read-aloud rhythm, but occasional metaphor stacks ("spiraling citadel of gears and constellations... soft sunrise captured in amber") risk purple overload in opening 120 words. No scaffold loops; each sentence advances image or sound. Filter verbs minimal; verbs are kinetic ("she retrieved", "conducting the echo"). Closing line avoids algorithmic cadence, landing on monosyllabic pulse. Minor paraphrase loop: "borrowed starlight" appears three times—functional echo, not churn.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fusion of astronomical clock tower + multilingual chimes + grain-silo choir is fresh, not checklist. Conceptual risk—industrial infrastructure taught to sing—pays off through sonic specificity (Latin verse, Mandarin lullaby, miners’ chants). Transformation test fails if librarian is renamed or city moved: the whole premise is site- and voice-specific. No close echoes of famous scenes. Earned stasis avoids tidy moral; ambiguity is the point.</comment>
