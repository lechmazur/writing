<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is lyrically present but abstract; her contradictory impulses are asserted rather than embodied in gesture or momentary perception. The “cautiously hopeful” trait is named repeatedly yet never crystallizes into a visible micro-choice that costs her something on the page. No relationship crucible or secondary character pressure tests her stance; she remains the sole active will, flattening status dynamics. Closure is a soft Charged Poise rather than earned renunciation, so the motivational arc feels gently atmospheric rather than personally priced.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the piece layers celestial/sonic imagery until the final shimmer reweights the premise. Anchors who/where/when arrive by line 3, satisfying orientation. The single closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration—the valley-wide subsonic hum—that makes conceptual cost legible (unity after division). Mild causality slippage: the dean’s emergency assembly is narrated as already resolved (“only to find the crowd already humming”), skipping the decisive beat that would show option foreclosure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Radio-station setting is micro-specific: dust-touched charts, flickering lights, console dials. The transmitter and refrigerator hum act as tactile tools that constrain tactics. Sensory hierarchy favors sound over sight, matching POV bias. Spatial choreography stays clean; no ghost props.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preventing societal fracture via sonic interference—is signaled early. Escalation is accumulative: each new broadcast layer thickens the communal hum rather than narrowing live options. The solar-flare false alarm tightens once, but its neutralization is summarized off-stage, blurring visible cost. No tangible resource lost or path foreclosed on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges as “interference as fragile unity,” built through recurrent sonic images rather than thesis statements. Subtext resides in the unheard low frequencies—power felt, not explained. Final shimmer reconfigures prior star-chart material without moralizing. Avoids overt allegory; complexity lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person lyric voice sustains a consistent celestial-technical register. Syntax elongates with commas to mimic waveforms; rhythm modulates between static crackle and steady hum. No dialogue to distort voice. Diction—“ethereal grit,” “star-readers”—remains anchored in POV’s lexicon. Filter verbs are minimal; perceptual signature is star-tinged and sonic.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm pulses, but paraphrase loops recur (“cautiously hopeful” x4, “power plays” x3). Minor scaffold: “the same frequencies could be weaponized…those who thrived on chaos” restates threat. No mixed metaphors; images stay electromagnetic. Information density high; paragraphs advance stakes or texture. No artifacts touch closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Premise fuses campus-budget realism with cosmic trickster lore, a fresh synthesis. Star-chart → waveform translation is specific and non-obvious. Ethereal grit tone avoids tidy YA hopefulness; risk is legible. Transformation test fails: swap radio for campus TV and plot still functions, capping originality just above 8.</comment>
