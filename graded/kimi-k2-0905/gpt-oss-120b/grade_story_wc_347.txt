<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The caretaker’s interiority is concrete—his bargain-born duty and ash-tongued bitterness are shown through gesture (empty hands, reed-tracing). Yet the “graceless beauty” refrain drifts toward diagnostic shorthand; a deeper contradictory impulse in-scene would raise the final renunciation to 9-territory.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of reed-impressions → nut → root-light accretes rather than causal chains. Closure lands with conceptual cost (orchard still cursed, caretaker exits), satisfying CR. One micro-turn—frost retreat at stump—tightens stakes; orientation anchors by line 3. No causality break, though lens shift to causal at frost-moment is momentarily ambiguous.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Cliff-labyrinth, mechanical birds, and hollow stump are sensory-filtered through caretaker bias; each object constrains tactic (reed, nut) or charges final image (root-light). Diction like “amber eyes clicking with pulse” fuses body/tool/place. Micro-setting fulfills 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—guiding travelers—signaled early; night-frost clock tightens once. Escalation is accretive: each reed trace thickens pattern until nut-glow reverses frost. Cost is conceptual: orchard remains cursed, caretaker’s exile renewed. Agency sits in the placing of nut; pressure coherent under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of cursed caretaking as wound-care emerges from image-chain (ash-fruit, reed-whorls, graceless light). No final moral—ending image of “wound that will never heal” reweights earlier orchard sighs. Subtext in birds’ indifferent gaze crystallizes cost without statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>First-person voice maintains perceptual signature: caretaker thinks in tactile absences, hears “mournful lullaby” in gear pitch. Syntax compresses under frost deadline—“night frost forms” triple-stress mimics pulse. Reed, nut, birds recur with shifted valence; no head-hop. Distinctive without overwriting.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Rhythm breathes with stakes—long sentence for orchard sigh, fragment at nut-glow. High density: “ash on my tongue” does sensory triple-duty. One mixed metaphor “dragon” for frost is minor. No loops or filter stacks; closure image clear. Achieves 9-territory control save for single figurative muddle.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Cursed orchard-as-labyrinth, blueprint-inside-nut, and mechanical birds synthesize into fresh mythic engine. Final “wound that will never heal” reconfigures redemption trope into cyclical sacrifice. Risky lyric structure taught early and paid off; not a template echo.</comment>
