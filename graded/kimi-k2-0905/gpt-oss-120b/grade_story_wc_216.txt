<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Mara’s “texture-of-time” craving is vivid in her body (“felt the texture she craved…thin silk”), but her only consequential choice is placing the urn fragment; everything else is observation or ledger reading, so the agency-to-cost ratio feels thin. The interior contradiction is asserted (“borrowed-time timekeeper”) rather than dramatized in a micro-choice that could fail. Closure relies on external luminescence rather than a renunciation or charged stance that would foreclose a path with visible personal cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each garage-sale relic thickens the pattern until the map of memory-threads reweights the valley’s time. The urn-as-key turn is crisp, but the capsule’s “intentional damage” is told post-fact, blunting the causal bite of the final click. Cost is scenic (villagers receive notes) rather than personally paid by Mara, so the closure is resonant but not decisive under the strict cost test.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>The emerald silo’s metal panes and the hourglass beneath the foundation are tactile, choice-guiding objects that charge the final map-image; environment literally intersects with action (“threads traced a path that intersected with the silo’s emerald walls”). Selective sensory hierarchy—“dust-laden valley,” “ceramic skin chipped”—keeps description lean yet atmospheric. Spatial choreography stays clean as Mara brushes dust and clicks fragment into groove.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Stakes are declared early (“rediscover the capsule’s purpose before the last grain”), tightened when the urn fragment proves to be the key, and paid off when the valley’s memories become visible threads; the tightening is single but legible. Agency is reactive—Mara finds rather than risks—so escalation is pattern-deepening, not option-narrowing. Cost is communal (villagers’ memories exposed) rather than personal, keeping pressure coherent but not acute.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the garage-sale cipher motif: memory hides in mundane detritus and is rewoven into shared time. The final image—sky stitched with silver-sand constellations—offers a conceptual repricing that makes the capsule’s damage feel inevitable, not moralized. No character articulates a thesis; the urn’s transformation from ash-holder to time-key carries the subtext. Ambiguity lingers about whose memories are whose, inviting re-reading without confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Mara’s perceptual filter; diction (“ticking relics,” “texture of minutes stretching like thin silk”) is consistent and character-specific. Rhythm modulates from languid catalog sentences to the staccato of discovery beats. No dialogue to test, but narrative voice avoids filter-verb stacks and maintains tactile immediacy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening structure; no template cadence or synonym loops detected. Figurative language is selective (“liquid glass,” “sky stitched with constellations”) and never clusters in high-pressure beats. Information density is high—each garage-sale item does double duty as clue and emotional anchor. Opening and closing lines are image-driven, propulsive, and free of scaffolding.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The garage-sale cipher-as-coordinates trope is refreshed by cremation urn fragment and hourglass pairing; the emerald silo-as-antenna literalizes time-as-signal without sci-fi exposition. Synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight because every thrift relic later threads into the memory-map. Risk is moderate—lyric accumulation rather than twist—but coherence remains intact. Specificity of valley dust and 1970s poster anchors the concept in lived texture.</comment>
