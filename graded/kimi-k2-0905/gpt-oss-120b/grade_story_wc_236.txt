<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Lena’s anosmia and tactile faith are vivid, but the piece never lets her make a risky micro-choice that could fail; the repair proceeds without setback or contradiction, so the “miracle” feels pre-assured rather than earned. The interiority is lush yet curiously static—no moment where her mapped terrain collides with an unexpected resistance that would cost her something on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a gentle CR—sunrise lifts fog, the screw now “humming,” Lena re-pricing her scentless world—yet the cost is only asserted (“tremor of purpose”) rather than paid through a visible forfeiture or narrowed option. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: fog thins, water rises, light returns, all re-weighting the stake without causal reversals, but the absence of a tangible price keeps it shy of the 9-band.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Brass gears, frost-paned light, and the clamp-screw’s ridges are rendered through Lena’s fingertip cartography, turning the bench into a micro-setting that constrains her movements and charges the final silver line. The shop’s measured drip synchronizes with her breath, anchoring time and supplying the cadence that the ending reconfigures—an exemplary fusion of body, tool, and atmosphere.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—can Lena re-enchant a fragment of birth?—is signaled early, but pressure never tightens; each lyrical beat merely re-states the same affirmation. Without a mid-course obstacle or trade-off, escalation plateaus; the sunrise coincidence provides uplift rather than a narrowing of options, so the requisite felt price never materializes on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: scentless touch can still midwife wonder. The final image of the clamp “humming” reweights every prior tactile beat, yet the piece drifts toward explicit thesis (“ordinary miracles”) in the closing whispers, slightly diluting resonance. Still, the particulars of fog, gear-oil, and newborn cries keep the insight anchored in lived detail.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays tight to Lena’s fingertip perception; syntax lengthens and softens to mimic pendulum breath, then contracts at sunrise—an audible rhythmic arc. No head-hopping or register drift; the elevated diction remains justified by her meditative precision. The voice is distinct and sustained under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Figurative layering is dense—fog, breath, gear-oil, heartbeat—but the pattern is taught early and pays off in the final silver line, so it avoids artifact penalties. Occasional paraphrase loops (“tremor of purpose… calm exterior… trembling calm”) create micro-scaffold, trimming immediacy, yet never obscure causality or dull the closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>The anosmic aromatherapist restoring a midwife’s clamp inside a water-clock shop is a fresh constellation; no trope checklist here. Risk lies in the lyric stillness, but the piece commits fully, letting tactile synesthesia replace scent-based lore. While the emotional arc is quiet, the conceptual re-enchantment of industrial detritus feels specific and inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
