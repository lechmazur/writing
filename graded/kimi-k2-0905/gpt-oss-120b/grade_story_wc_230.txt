<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Mara’s “involuntary truthfulness” is asserted, not dramatized; we never see her forced to blurt anything costly in-scene. The interior rationale for hiding the eye is paraphrased rather than pressured; her decision to install it as communal mirror arrives as an abstract pivot, not a micro-choice with visible stakes. The smugglers remain silhouettes, so status/relationship crucible is absent. Still, the truffle-forager occupation is woven into action and the final stewardship role gives her a credible after-stance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Causal spine holds: because Mara cannot lie, she confesses the eye’s power → therefore the smugglers recoil → she seizes the moment to plant the eye as mirror. Orientation is clean inside 120 words; the hanging orchard, storm, and eye are stably anchored. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: “we learned that psychological safety grows…from the courage to reflect it together” reweights the premise with social cost. The eye’s mechanics (how reflection actually works) is elided, a minor softness but not a break.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The ravine-orchard is rendered through motion—roots on cliffs, storm-slapped leaves, slick bark under boots—so setting constrains footing and hiding tactics. Sensory hierarchy respects the forager’s gaze: moss caps, truffle shapes, brine on ground. Weather is not backdrop but immediate threat that justifies the moss-seal trick. Spatial choreography stays coherent across the single clearing; no floating bodies.</answer>

<comment>Dominant stake—can Mara install the eye as communal mirror without being killed or exposed—signalled early. Escalation is one-step: confession → smugglers freeze → she plants eye; no further tightening, but the lens is causal and the moment reweights options. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral: loss of secrecy, exposure of greed. A second beat of push-back would have lifted tension into high band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through the glass-eye mirror conceit: shared vulnerability beats isolated guarding of pain. No explicit thesis until final sentence, and even there the phrasing is imagistic, not sermonic. Subtext operates in the smugglers’ sudden silence—greed confronted by its own reflection. The “fractured grace” tonality keeps sentimentality at bay; sorrow is acknowledged but not cured.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>First-person voice carries truffle-forager perceptual signature: mycelial metaphors, root-level attention to texture, methodical calm as “prayer.” Rhythm tightens under storm pressure—short clauses echo thunder—then widens for the covenant moment. No dialogue to test speech differentiation, but internal diction stays within ranger-class lexicon. Filter verbs minimal; elision (“the eye could cure any wound if read…”) is taught early and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm varies strategically; opening lyrical cascade gives way to leaner motion beats. No synonym loops or template cadence. Metaphors are dense (“broken cathedral of fruit”) but consistent with arboreal imagery and do not obtrude during climax. One mixed vehicle—“cathedral of fruit whose roots hung on sheer cliffs”—is forgiven for vividness. Scaffolding almost absent; each paragraph advances knowledge or stance.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Fusion of post-empathy-virus world + truffle forager + reflective glass eye feels idiosyncratic yet organic; no trope checklist atmosphere. Storm-whipped hanging orchard is fresh spatial twist on smuggler meet. The “communal mirror” resolution reweights discredited-textbook MacGuffin into social ritual. Risk is moderate—conceptual rather than plot twist—but specificity of occupation and setting keeps it memorable.</comment>
