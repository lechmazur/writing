<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>“expectantly resigned” is a vivid contradiction that motivates the opening beat; it lands as interior summary rather than embodied moment. She never struggles against that contradiction in-scene—no hesitation, trembling, or visible cost—so the trait flattens into label. The children and veteran arrive too late to test her under pressure; her final “quiet thrill” is asserted, not dramatized. The renunciation (accepting gradual cultural loss) is legible, but because we never see her pay a concrete price, the arc feels gently observed rather than earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of vanishing songs → silence → tentative return, tightened by cadenced refrain of “subtracting noise.” Closure lands as Charged Poise: the glowing rosette reweights the premise that art can survive erasure; cost is felt—she keeps losing songs faster than she can save them. Orientation is clean within 120 w, one shard only. Causality is soft: the crowd’s conversion is lyrical accumulation, not consequence chain; therefore the ending resonates but does not foreclose a path with visible personal cost to her.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Velvet library, zither rosette, and autumn leaves form a single micro-setting that physically shapes the method—“subtracting noise” from the air. Rosette glimmer and leaf shadows are returned in the final image, charging the Charged Poise. Spatial choreography is light but coherent: podium, desk, curtains track cleanly. Weather is kept off-stage, appropriate to an interior crucible; sensory hierarchy favors hearing and sight, matching musical stakes.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: salvage vanishing songs from final silence. Escalation is textural—each chord strips ambient noise, tension loosens shoulders; no causal reversal, but the deepening is legible. Cost is collective, not personal: the town’s hatred erodes, yet teacher’s private loss (world still “losing songs faster than seasons turn”) persists—visible conceptual cost. Agency is gentle—she invites, plays, endures—enough for Accumulative design but not a high-stakes crucible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through refrains of subtraction, silence, and braiding: no moral is stated. Final rosette glow offers non-literal answer—art survives by embedding in new voices, not objects. Subtext lives in gestures: loosened shoulders, small hands tracing rosette. Expectant resignation complicates hope with fatalism, resisting tidy uplift. The vanishing-arts motif recurs with shifting weight, satisfying the “return with difference” test.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lyrical third-person hovers just above the teacher’s sensorium, matching autumn-library hush. Diction—“velvet shadows,” “captured sunrise”—stays within poetic register without purple drift. Rhythm clusters sibilants that mimic hushed choir: “shelves that smelled of old paper and rain…whispers…silence could be sharpened.” No dialogue, so voice distinctness defaults to internal texture—consistent, unshowy, controlled. No head-hop, distance stable.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is generally clean, with purposeful metaphor chains (music/silence) that accumulate rather than stall. Two mild scaffold spots: “each a fragment of a vanishing art that once filled festivals and battlefields alike” adds encyclopedic flourish; “across unlearning hatred” pre-positions an abstraction before scene earns it. No loop artifacts in final third; rosette image lands uncluttered. Strong auditory specificity—“breath that seemed to pull autumn leaves into dance”—keeps momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Familiar premise (music heals community) is refreshed by “subtracting noise” inversion and rosette as micro-canvas. Risk is quiet—no antagonist, no body count—yet coherence holds. Specificity of velvet-library hush and broken-voiced child keeps it from generic. Could swap seasons or instrument with minor edits, so not indispensable, but the synthesis feels deliberate rather than template.</comment>
