<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The peacekeeper’s calmly intuitive nature is shown through micro-choices—placing the shard, whispering intention—yet the interior contradiction between duty and doubt never surfaces in scene. Emotions stay atmospheric (“felt the weight of unspoken hopes”) rather than embodied and specific under pressure. The final crystallization reads as serene acceptance rather than a costly renunciation; no path is visibly foreclosed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the re-lit orchard reconfigures meaning with undeniable conceptual cost—“anomalies become ordinary once shared.” The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each mirror glimpse thickens the pattern until the golden aura reweights the stake. Causality is soft—why vintage mirrors reconstitute crystal is asserted, not motivated—but the pattern is taught early and paid off in the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The lighthouse orchard above ice floes is sensually vivid—frosted roots, amber flare, shifting colors—and the mirrored van interior supplies a micro-setting that constrains the decisive act. Spatial choreography stays clean across the grove-to-van move. The environment’s cold/light duality subtly mirrors internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Stakes are signaled early—“refuse to surrender its purpose to the cold silence”—and tighten as each mirror glimpse forecloses futures until the golden aura locks in renewal. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral; no tool, stamina, or relationship is lost. The protagonist’s agency is present but friction-free; the shard essentially reassembles itself once the ritual is performed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: shared attention transforms anomaly into ordinariness, light into communal guide. The final image of blossoming green reweights prior material without moralizing. Subtext resides in silence and mirror-ripples rather than articulated insight, inviting reflection on empathy as collective refraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person lyric voice maintains consistent atmospheric distance; diction stays within calm/intuitive register (“shadow-laced,” “weighted breath”). Sentence rhythm modulates between long breath-invoking clauses and short pulse-like fragments, mirroring lighthouse inhale/exhale. No dialogue appears; therefore voice distinction and status dynamics are N/A.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm is musical, but stacked abstract metaphors (“tickling metronome against the hull of distant icebergs”) risk purple overgrowth. Information density dips where setting description repeats the same cold/light binaries. No paraphrase loops or filter-verb stacks; closure image remains clear.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: lighthouse orchard, vintage mirror divination, and ice-spirit council reframe familiar restoration quest. The shard’s refusal to stay broken becomes a quiet manifesto for communal empathy. Specificity of “tarnished mirrors salvaged from forgotten shops” anchors the fantastical in tactile detail.</comment>
