<comment>Selene’s curiosity-as-trait is clear, but interiority slips into thematic commentary (“universal riddle she was determined to decode”) rather than embodied contradiction. The shell-cello nexus gives her one tactile micro-choice that reweights her goal, yet we get no visible flaw or cost—her smile remains untroubled. Mentor echo is a useful haunt, but it is narrated, not dramatized, so the emotional stakes flatten. Earned stasis is implied; still, the absence of a visible trade-off caps credibility.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the compass is revealed as living melody, reweighting her myth-busting project into stewardship of wonder. Causal chain is loose—shell → hum → ledger → insight—yet the accumulative/textural pattern is taught early and paid off in the final chord. Orientation is anchored by 120 words; the single transition (attic → cliff descent) is legible. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral, acceptable under the lyric lens.</comment>

<comment>Observatory, cello, and shell function as micro-settings that constrain action: the shell must touch the cello to unlock the ledger, the dome funnels sound seaward. Sensory selection favors sound over sight, matching the acoustic stakes; salt-air taste is implied through gull cries. Spatial choreography is clean—no impossible moves from attic to telescope to steps. Weather shift (cloud-part → gold slit) mirrors internal turn without overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—decode the riddle of myth-permanence—is signaled early. One meaningful tightening occurs when the ledger’s question-marks force her to accept retelling as answer, narrowing her old destroy-the-myth stance. Pressure is situational/lyric rather than antagonistic; no credible loss is dramatized. Coincidence (shell glow points straight to ledger) is allowed under situational lens but limits escalation bandwidth.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through acoustic recursion: myths survive because art re-sounds them. Subtext resides in the shell-to-cello transduction rather than exposition. Final image—melody drifting over cliff—repackages the thesis as sensory aftereffect, avoiding moralizing. Ambiguity is preserved: she still walks toward sunrise, new riddles inbound.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person intimate maintains consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature is acoustical—“hum,” “sigh,” “echo”—rather than visual. No dialogue, so voice texture rests on lyrical syntax and rhythmic anaphora (“She…”) which risks templating yet sustains incantatory fit. Diction stays within a myth-buster’s range, though “epistemic compass” edges academic. Filter verbs cluster slightly but serve lyric pulse, not detachment.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm modulates with pressure—short beats at climax, longer coils during reflection. Metaphor chain (shell=key, cello=compass, dome=page) remains coherent because vehicles stay acoustic. Minor scaffold: “resonant hum” is repeated four times without new inflection; one instance could be cut. No mixed metaphor or register drift; closure image is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Fusion of seashell and half-built cello as epistemic engine is fresh, grounding abstract quest in tactile objet d’art. Myth-buster who ends as myth-keeper offers a flipped arc, though the turn is interior rather than action-based. Accumulative/textural structure is non-obvious for flash length yet pays off. Risk is moderate—lyric over causal—but coherence holds.</comment>
