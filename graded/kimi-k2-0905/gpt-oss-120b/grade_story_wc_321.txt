<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lio’s “resiliently positive grin” is declared, not dramatized; the interior contradiction between duty and timeline-merging obsession is only asserted. The moment he whispers to the hourglass is the single visible micro-choice that charges the climax, but it arrives after pages of lyrical paraphrase rather than embodied tension. Cost is abstract (“the weight of nothing”) rather than felt; we never see him risk or lose anything corporeal. Still, his stance crystallizes into an Earned Stasis that forecloses further ferry vanishings, giving the arc credible closure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story teaches an Accumulative/Textural lens early—images of mist, ribbons of time, phosphorescent threads—and holds it to the Charged Poise ending where the hourglass floats above the helm. Causality is lyric rather than strict: the radio tone “stitches” reality, sand rises instead of falls, passengers materialize; the logic is dream-pattern, not because/therefore. Orientation is waived because disorientation (clocks run sideways, ferry slips between worlds) is the taught pattern that pays off at closure. Cost is conceptual—the cosmos re-aligned—but legible in the final image of the floating hourglass, so closure qualifies.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The spectral grotto’s starlit mist, silver-coin moon, and phosphorescent sound-lattice are vivid, selective, and thematically coherent; the water’s swirl literally guides Lio’s steering choice at the end, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography stays clean across the single continuous scene. Sensory hierarchy filters through Lio’s ardent-deckhand bias—he notices tide, planks, radio dial—rather than tourist catalog. The setting’s rule-set (time can curl back) is taught early and never broken. Micro-setting hourglass becomes the final compass, charging the closing image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prevent future ferry disappearances—is signaled late (paragraph 4) and remains abstract; the tightening is the visual of sand rising, but Lio’s agency is passive (whispering wish, not executing a risky tactic). Pressure is situational-lyric: atmosphere compounds rather than narrows options. Escalation is decorative—more glow, more mist—without visible price or trade-off. Closure reweights the world but not the protagonist’s live options; hence barely clears the 7.0 floor.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: intention as cosmic needle, sound as thread. The empty hourglass reprises as a re-weighted symbol—emptiness becomes compass—avoiding explicit moral. Subtext resides in image (sand defying gravity) rather than sermon. Final image answers the core question—can one person mend ruptured time?—with a wordless visual that feels earned yet avoids tidy profundity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-limited stays locked to Lio; perceptual signature is maritime-lyric (“boots echo against planks that seemed both ancient and brand new”). Syntax lengthens under wonder, shortens under action; diction stays within a deckhand’s lexicon except the intentional elevated cadence of “lattice of sound that glimmered.” No dialogue, so voice carries all subtext successfully. Patterned repetition (“spectral grotto under starlight”) is taught early and pays off in final line, justifying lyric compression.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Rhythm varies from hymnal parallelism to tight maritime beats; information density is high—each sentence layers image, stakes, and world-rule. However, figurative language stacks in nearly every sentence of the climax (“silver coin,” “phosphorescent threads,” “vein of water”) without pattern-teaching differentiation, triggering −0.6. Occasional scaffold near-duplicates (“the ferry vanished… the ferry never vanished again”) dull momentum. No grammar or pronoun drift; spatial tracking clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The vanishing-ferry trope is retooled through sonic sewing, an hourglass that runs upward, and a deckhand who treats cosmic repair as routine maintenance—fresh, specific synthesis. Risk-taking (lyric causal logic) heightens wonder without obscuring clarity. Transformation test passes: the maritime-time-mending fusion would collapse if Lio were recast as, say, a banker. Closest echo is “Dark Water” trope, but inversion of sound-over-matter feels non-obvious and inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
