<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Mara’s blindness is never allowed to become a gimmick; every tactile micro-choice (feeling wing curvature, reading light through water) is specific, character-bound, and costly. The interior contradiction—yearning to guide a ship she will never see—remains alive in the final whispered “Feel the lift,” earning Earned Stasis with visible forfeit of her own horizon.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: closure is a Charged Poise where the hummingbird’s hover crystallizes Mara’s invisible navigation into a conceptual cost—her precision forever ships out while she stays. Anchor triad (who/where/when) locked by line 3; no orientation debt. Persistent constraint—her blindness—shapes every tactic and charges the final image of the drone leaving the depot without her.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The mist, refracting basin, and carbon-fiber wing function as micro-setting that literally constrains the repair action; without the water-light tool the patch would fail. Final image of droplets scattering lantern light reweights the earlier “magnetic calm” into quiet bereavement, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will the drone fly true and carry her unseen vision onto the ship?—tightens once: the tear either seals or grounds the scout. Agency is renunciation rather than confrontation; the cost is her exclusion from the voyage she enables. Coincidence (anchor lifts at exact repair completion) complicates without resolving, keeping pressure coherent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of invisible craftsmanship as surrogate sight emerges through refracted light patterns and the drone’s eventual departure; no explicit thesis stated. Final prismatic droplets non-literally answer the implicit question—what is a maker’s vision worth?—by showing it shipped outward while she remains, a resonant reconfiguration without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays welded to Mara’s tactile synesthesia; perceptual signature is unmistakable (“magnetic calm,” “magnetic calm settle over her” refrains echo like a heartbeat). Syntax breathes with repair tempo—long clauses while she studies ripples, staccato fragments at patch adhesion. No head-hopping; every noticed detail passes through her non-visual filters.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High-density lines (“droplets catching the lantern light and scattering it like tiny prisms”) do double duty: sensory texture + thematic refraction. Zero loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors; figurative language peaks at closure without muddling causality. Read-aloud rhythm modulates from depot rumble to drone whisper, mirroring departure cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Blind engineer decoding flight through water-light refraction feels fresh and inevitable; trope of disabled genius is re-anchored in material process rather than mystical insight. Risk of quiet ending pays off: renunciation becomes the charged poise. Transformation test fails if Mara is sighted—entire tactile epistemology collapses.</comment>
