<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Interiority remains poetic but abstract; the fisher’s “cool-headed” trait is asserted rather than embodied in contradictory micro-choices. No visible cost or relational crucible on-page; the final acceptance reads as tranquil epiphany rather than earned renunciation. Emotion is stated (“longing,” “yearning”) without bodily contradiction or stakes scaled to 700 words.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: cadence of sound-garden pulses reweights stakes. Closure lands as Charged Poise—spike skyward, echo accepted—but cost is conceptual, not felt; no persistent constraint forecloses future action. Orientation clear by 120 words; causality soft, leaning on resonance rather than because/therefore linkage.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Sound-wave garden, rail spike, and moon-tide satisfy micro-setting rule: spike charges the final image and constrains the veil-piercing act. Sensory selection favors hush, vibration, silver light—economical and POV-filtered. Spatial choreography is tracked; no impossible shifts. Meets 9+ gate for environment-as-constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“catch the echo of a goddess”—is signaled early but remains metaphorical; no concrete narrowing of options or visible forfeiture. Escalation is textural: density of nocturnal images intensifies rather than tactical choices. Agency is receptive (listen, trace, accept) without trade-off or price on-page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme—art as receptive vessel, not capture—emerges through image chain: spike as stylus, echo as song, net for firefly-notes. Subtext avoids moralizing; final smile encodes the answer. Resonant reprise of “feral lullaby” reweights prior material with quiet ambiguity. Could ascend higher if echo carried social or relational cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</question><comment>Third-person lyric voice sustains perceptual signature: water-notes, reed-chords, star-threads. Diction stays within fisher’s mythic register; no filter-verb stacks. Rhythm modulates with long breathy sentences that mirror slow constellation drift. Head-hopping absent; POV stable and texture-driven.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Read-aloud cadence varied; sentences avoid template churn. Metaphors occasionally layer three-deep (“wounded bird” spiraling into constellations) but do not obscure closure. Information density high; most lines twin atmosphere + motion. Minor paraphrase loops (“hum,” “sing,” “echo” synonyms) dampen peak intensity −0.3.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Premise fuses sound-garden + sleepwalking constellations + emotion-transliterating fisher— fresh synthesis, not stock template. Risk is lyric-structural: story banks on cumulative resonance rather than causal turns, paid off in legible Charged Poise. Specificity of rusted rail spike as stylus-tool prevents generic swap. Transformation test passes: narrative collapses without sonic-veil logic.</comment>
