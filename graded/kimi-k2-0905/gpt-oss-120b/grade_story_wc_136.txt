<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Interiority is lyrically consistent but stays at atmospheric register; no contradictory impulse is dramatized in-scene. The decisive moment—placing the punch beside the ledger—reads as ritual surrender rather than a cost-carrying choice, so the arc feels observed, not earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: each sensory layer deepens the archive’s weight rather than causing next events. Closure lands via Conceptual Repricing—the city’s unspoken maps now route through her—visible in the final image of cracks realigning; cost is the lifelong guardianship she accepts in silence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Starlit mist, breathing ivy, and the ticket-shaped lock are tactile micro-settings that constrain passage; the constellations on the vault wall literally overwrite her notebook, fusing external setting to internal tool. Environment is not backdrop but keyhole, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—access to hidden truths—tightens once: the phantom punch’s glow shifts from clue to key, foreclosing retreat. Pressure is textural, not causal; the price (perpetual nightly returns) is declared, not yet felt, keeping escalation just shy of top band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of cartographing silence emerges through concrete recursion: surface cracks → ledger lines → star maps. Final promise to “paint every silent song” reconfigures the city itself as co-author, avoiding explicit moral and letting image carry resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays tightly filtered through the mapper’s compass-eye; diction (“skeletal fingers,” “phantom energy”) is patterned early and paid off. Rhythm modulates—long breaths in mist, clipped steps on spiral stairs—without losing control, satisfying 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Figurative layering is dense but purposeful; only one mixed vehicle (“vault opened like a colossal eye” beside “walls inscribed with constellations”) momentarily blurs physical logic. No loops or scaffold; high information density carries reader down the staircase beat by beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Merging urban way-finding with archival mysticism feels fresh; the phantom ticket punch repurposes a transit relic as archival key. Risk lies in the quiet, non-causal structure itself—if the lyric pattern failed, the piece would collapse—yet it coheres, meriting the +0.3 risk bonus.</comment>
