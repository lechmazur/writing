<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Interiority is lyrical and consistent, but the visionary’s contradictory impulses are described rather than dramatized; no micro-choice shows her curiosity colliding with fear. The final acceptance of covenant is foreshadowed but still reads as an inevitable epiphany rather than a costly decision. Label-free embodiment is mostly achieved, yet the emotional crescendo is slightly smoothed by abstraction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory scrap adds density until the silver clipping ignites a conceptual repricing. Closure is legible—portal opens, beacon ignites, scars heal—visible cost is the visionary’s binding to collective memory. Orientation is swift; the glade, dusk, and maze are anchored within 50 words. One minor causality waver: “the world had lately slipped…” is told, not shown, but it is not pivotal to the final beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Cobalt hue, violet light, moon-metal clipping—each sensory hook recurs and constrains the final image. The glade’s shimmer guides her gaze to the hedge scars; the clipping’s weight is felt before it becomes the beacon’s filament. Micro-setting (the clipping in her palm) charges the closure, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible moves.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—harvest collective longing into a beacon—is signaled early and tightens when the maze parts only after she maps scars. Escalation is textural: each hedge memory thickens the air until the portal offers a single path. Cost is conceptual—she binds herself to every forgotten grief—visible in the ground tremor and scar fade. No option is foreclosed, but the trade-off is felt.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: dream-duty fusion is enacted, not preached. The covenant’s shift from power-pact to promise-of-service is repriced in the final cobalt pulse. Ambiguity is preserved—will the beacon consume her?—earned by the image of healed hedges. No moralizing, no tidy epigraph; resonance lingers in the scent of rain-kissed pine.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lush, incantatory cadence mirrors the visionary’s vine-tangled mind; diction stays botanical-mythic without purple drift. Elision is taught early (“unspoken promises”) and paid off in the chant. No head-hopping; perceptual signature remains consistent—she sees sky as filament, scars as maps. Filter verbs are rare; immediacy holds even in lyric compression.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Rhythm breathes with scene needs—long sentences for dusk shimmer, staccato pulses at portal threshold. Information density is high; one line can layer color, scent, and myth. Minor scaffold: “anxious elation” is reused twice; the second could be cut. No mixed metaphor; moon-metal and violet light coexist within dream logic. Read-aloud ear test passes.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Familiar mythic ingredients—maze, eclipse, covenant—are re-sewn into a botanical dream-text. The clipping-as-beacon is a fresh inflection; its moon-metal edge feels inevitable yet unforeseen. Risk in lyric accumulation pays off when scars heal in cadence with her pulse. The visionary’s root-bound metaphor is particular enough to resist trope drift.</comment>
