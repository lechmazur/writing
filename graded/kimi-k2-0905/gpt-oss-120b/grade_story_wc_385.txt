<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Interiority is lush and bias-rich (“reed-blown melancholy” POV filter), but the only micro-choice that costs her anything is the final merge of shells; prior beats are observational. The arc lands, yet the emotional price is more ambient than embodied—she walks away lighter, not scarred.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/lyric lens holds: each echo-layer thickens texture until the final conjoining reweights “untold stories” as the conceptual cost. Orientation is never in doubt; the serpentine path is spatially tracked. Closure is a Charged Poise—the lattice void reconfigures meaning without a physical sacrifice on her part.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The canyon body functions as micro-setting: stone walls absorb/re-release song, constraining her route and pacing. Starlight, petrichor, quartz light are filtered through singer’s synesthetic ear, never tourist-catalog. Final image of “echo as bridge” is charged by the cavern’s lattice, meeting 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“why do people echo?”—is declared early; pressure escalates via cumulative reveal of unfinished promises. No live option is foreclosed; the cost is conceptual rather than tactical, so tension plateaus rather than tightens. Still, the lattice projection is a visible price that reframes prior echoes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</question>
<comment>Theme emerges from accreted images: half-shell, lattice, void—each reweights “echo” from sound to living memory. No moralizing; the final hymn is an earned image, not a thesis. Ambiguity lingers—she carries the whole shell, but the canyon still holds untold stories, inviting reflection beyond the page.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</question>
<comment>Voice is singular: synesthetic, musical, reed-tinged syntax (“threading the night with a wistful sigh”). Compression and patterned elision (“serpentine nexus,” “star-spattered sky”) are taught early and paid off in the lattice void. No head-hop; perceptual signature remains consistent under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</question>
<comment>Read-aloud cadence varies; long breathy sentences mirror singer’s legato phrases, then tighten at merge. Metaphors stay coherent—shell, quartz, reed form one sonic ecosystem. One paraphrase loop (“echoed long after their bodies fade” / “lingering reverberations”) but it does not touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</question>
<comment>Familiar trope—seeker in mythic landscape—made specific through synesthetic song-craft and acoustical geology. Shell-as-memory-vessel is old, yet the lattice projection of “every life that ever sang here” provides fresh visual reconfiguration. Risk is lyric density, but coherence holds.</comment>
