<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is textured—her “quiet turbulence” and the candle-wind image feel embodied—but the moment of shedding her own “preconceived judgments” is narrated rather than dramatized, so the cost of change is only asserted. The chameleon’s approving pulse is charming yet anthropomorphic, blurring the creature’s agency and hers. Still, her micro-choices (placing the vial on the warm stone, laying out shards) track a credible arc from shaken to steadied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: each layer of debris absorbed by the mist reweights trust. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—tail-tip reattached, colors re-harmonized—yet the cost is more atmospheric than visceral; the “scars will remain” line states rather than shows the price. Orientation is swift (who/where/when anchored by word 60), transitions are smooth, and the single deepening beat satisfies scope.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The workshop’s “humming tools,” warm stone, and drifting mist are selectively sketched and filtered through Mara’s tactile priorities. The chameleon’s shifting skin functions as micro-setting that constrains her method—she must match its hue with honesty—charging the final merged color. Spatial choreography is clean; no floating props. While the hillside beyond is generic, the immediate bench-stone-vial triad carries the scene.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—rebuilding trust after a con—is signaled early and narrowed to the single tail-tip. Pressure escalates texturally: each discarded fragment absorbed by mist tightens the moral space. The protagonist’s agency is present (she decides to return the tip), but the tightening is more symbolic than tactical; no live option is foreclosed with a price we can feel in the body.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: reconstruction through self-exposure, balance as tended river. The chameleon’s re-attached tail becomes a non-literal answer—wholeness requires shedding, not adding. No final moralizing; the journal line is earned aphorism. Ambiguity lingers in the “whispers” carried off by mist, inviting reflection without confusion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Third-limited stays close to Mara’s perceptual filter—“quietly vivid,” “shimmering stillness”—with rhythmic, slightly lyric compression that matches the accumulative design. No dialogue, so no voice contamination. Psychic distance modulates nicely from external description to interior pulse. The occasional elevated phrase (“tableau of shimmering stillness”) is consistent with her reflective stance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; figurative language is selective. Minor scaffold: “layers of mistrust… layers of deception” restates without new pressure. No mixed metaphors or filter-verb stacks. Final third avoids artifacts, allowing high-band eligibility.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>The chameleon-tail as trust-barometer is a fresh inflection on the broken-healer trope. Risk is quiet—lyric accretion rather than twist—but coherence justifies the choice. Specificity of color-shifting biology anchors the metaphor, resisting generic substitution. Not radically novel, yet the synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
