<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The servant’s “affectionate detachment” is shown rather than named—his gentle micro-choices (lifting the goggles, sealing the diary, whispering the promise) embody it. Motivation remains steady: seek joy beneath anguish. No internal contradiction or flaw complicates him, so the arc is flat, but the stance is credibly maintained. Cost is present yet soft: he carries the jars’ warmth upward, a felt but not forceful price.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each floor adds luminous density until the goggles unlock the diary, then the descent re-weights the same light. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—he restores the goggles and seals the diary, leaving the joy circulating. Cost is legible: he relinquishes exclusive possession of the laughter, accepting perpetual service. Causality is loose but coherent under the lyric pattern.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The spire’s frost, amber glow, and narrow elevator act as tactile instruments: the glowing walls cue the goggles, the helix stair guides descent. Micro-setting—the brass chest on a ceiling ledge—forces a stretch upward, a literal reach toward memory. Environment constrains every move; without the frost-etched windows the scattered light fails. Final image of thinner air yet fuller heart re-weights the altitude as emotional space.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</question><comment>Dominant stake is recovery of stored joy; pressure intensifies as light thickens per floor. One meaningful tightening: goggles decoded → diary opens → descent required. No option is foreclosed; rather, access widens, so cost feels gentle. Escalation is textural, not causal, but remains legible under the chosen lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme—joy persisting beneath frozen sorrow—emerges through shifting light, not exposition. The diary’s color-map of emotions and the crystal-jarred laughter are particulars that reweight the premise. Final whispered promise offers quiet conceptual repricing: service itself becomes the vessel for joy. No moral is stated; resonance lingers in the returning amber glow.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Third-person lyric voice sustains a cool, star-lit diction (“prismatic shards,” “frozen helix”) that matches the servant’s detached warmth. Perceptual signature is consistent: he notices light, vibration, heartbeat—never abstract self-analysis. Syntax lengthens during descent, mirroring spiral motion, then tightens back upward. No head-hopping; POV distance remains steady.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is rhythmically controlled, sentences vary, no scaffold loops. Figurative language is dense (“sun trapped inside the stone”) yet patterned—light imagery taught early and paid off. No mixed metaphors or register drift. Opening and closing lines anchor and re-charge the motif. Minor near-repetition of “scattered light” but it functions as refrain, not artifact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Frozen lighthouse spire storing laughter in crystal jars is a fresh synthesis; the goggles-as-translation-device repurposes steampunk tech for interior archaeology. Conceptual risk—joy as stored physical substance—commits fully and follows implications. The servant’s endurance rather than conquest offers quiet subversion of hero template. Specificity of compass-rose etchings and amber windows prevents generic feel.</comment>
