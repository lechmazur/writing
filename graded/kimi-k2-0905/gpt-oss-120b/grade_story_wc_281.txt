<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Mara’s affectionate skepticism is embodied early: “convinced that hidden geometry could translate human intention into color” while still “humming a quiet tune.” Internal contradiction surfaces only once (static shock memory), then yields to smooth competence; no visible misstep compounds. Final “surge of purpose” is foreshadowed, but the cost is vicarious (future scientists) rather than personal, so the renunciation feels gentle, not crucible-forged.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each light-pulse layer adds density until the final “whisper of another mind” reweights the premise. Orientation clear by 70 words; no teleporting props. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the studio’s “willowglass dream” crystallizes options—she will share the map, not hoard it—felt cost is the exposure of her once-private nervous system to peer review.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Studio, body, and geode form one micro-setting that constrains every choice; LED arrays and cracked windowpanes return to charge the ending image. Sensory hierarchy skews visual, but that is vocation-accurate. Spatial choreography remains coherent as she “traces its internal fractures with light” onto her own skin. Weather analogue (“sun-dappled” vs. “neon ribbons”) mirrors her skeptical-to-wonder arc without overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: can she trigger telepathic recall without the pill? Pressure tightens through successive light-pulse iterations; each failure risks another static shock. The final “faint whisper” is not luck but the culmination of her fractal trials; options narrow to publish or suppress, and she chooses exposure—cost is the loss of sole ownership of her neural pattern. One meaningful escalation suffices; no external antagonist required.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the tension between measurement and miracle; the willowglass image reconfigures skepticism into transparent trust without moralizing. Subtext lives in gesture—touching cool geode to hot skin—rather than declaration. Final line’s “promise that understanding could be beautiful” is earned by the sensory dialogue she has just staged. No platitudes; the conceptual repricing is the professional risk of sharing un-peer-reviewed data.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Third-person centered on Mara maintains consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature skews to optic, tactile, and fractal diction—“phosphor particles danced,” “opalescent veins.” No dialogue, so voice contamination risk zero. Compression in final paragraph (“studio seemed to breathe”) is purposeful, not filter-verb drift. Tense and modality stable; lyric swell at closure is justified by accumulative design.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Rhythm varies; sentence openings avoid template cadence. Density high—“fractally precise intervals,” “somatic markers as conduit”—but figurative load is patterned early and pays off. One scaffold loop: “light…light…light” triplet within 40 words, but it echoes LED strobe, so functional. No mixed metaphor; “willowglass” recurs with consistent glass-light semantics. Pronouns clean; no typos.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Freshest synthesis: telepathy pill recall re-coded as crystalline geometry + somatic feedback—no drug required. Risk is high—neuroscience jargon could alienate—but specificity of muscovite veins and LED timing keeps it grounded. Not a near-echo of any canonical scene. Conceptual integrity holds: the premise is followed to its social cost (publication). Transformation test passed; swap geode for quartz and the physics collapse.</comment>
