<comment>Liora’s interiority is vivid—her tattoos flickering in response to the grotto’s call is a sharp micro-choice—but her motives stay abstract (“to bind forgotten combinations” never collides with a lived fear or desire). The latent blaze never mutates under pressure; it only intensifies, so the climactic alignment feels inevitable rather than costly. She does not misstep or relinquish anything; the library gains lamps, she gains certainty—no path is foreclosed.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the seedlings become living lamps, a visible re-weighting of the library’s future. Causality holds—doodle → grotto → glyph → seedlings—yet the hour of inverted gravity is announced, not earned, and the threshold mechanics remain hand-waved “according to the chronicle.” The cost is institutionally ornamental (new décor) rather than personally levied on Liora, softening the final punch.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>City Library, serpentine grotto, and the prism of her skin are cleanly tracked; spatial choreography survives the gravity flip without jarring slips. Sensory economy is strong—vapor “glittered like shattered glass” filters through her archivist gaze. The grotto’s upward-swirling water is the one detail that constrains her timing, anchoring the climax; micro-setting succeeds.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Single dominant stake—recover forgotten combinations—is declared early and reiterated, but never complicated by rival desire or risk. Escalation is purely spectacular (floating columns, glyph flare) rather than tactical; no option is narrowed for Liora, only revealed. The hourglass of inverted gravity supplies urgency, yet she never races or improvises—just witnesses.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Vigilance as cultivated fire emerges inductively from seedlings‐into-lamps, avoiding overt thesis statements. The prism motif quietly refracts knowledge into “many hues,” but the spiral/eye doodle never acquires new symbolic weight, so theme stays pleasingly single-track rather than resonant. Final image avoids moralizing, letting the soft lamp-glow reprice the library’s eternal watch.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays tight to Liora’s perceptual filter—she “feels a latent blaze,” traces curvature, inhales before stepping—creating a rhythmic, archivist-precision cadence. No dialogue means no voice contamination; diction (“threshold effects,” “combinations”) remains within her scholarly lexicon. The accumulative, incantatory sentence stack near the end mirrors her prism-mind without losing clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm is musical, but several sentences sprawl with stacked participles (“the stone arches pulsed with a rhythmic light, echoing the seeds of vigilance she felt within”). Metaphors stay consistent—light, seeds, prisms—yet occasional abstraction creep (“language of reality itself”) leans toward pseudo-profundity. No loops or paraphrase drift, but tighter cuts would sharpen propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Inverting gravity as cataloguing window is an inventive reframing of archive fever; the grotto-as-card-catalog feels fresh. The prism-mind archivist is a memorable POV gadget, and the living-lamp closure avoids typical treasure-haul payoff. Still, the core quest—“forgotten combinations”—leans abstract, and the doodle-to-glyph reveal is more pattern recognition than conceptual twist, keeping ingenuity just shy of the top band.</comment>
