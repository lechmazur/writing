<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>The guard’s dreamlessness is a vivid, embodied absence—his pulse tugged by a lullaby he cannot hear—and the micro-choice to lift the clock and whisper the charm turns interior contradiction into costly action. The only drag is a touch of diagnostic self-awareness—“a reminder that even the most barren souls can be kindled”—that briefly flattens the emotional texture.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the reversed ticking clock releases visible waves that reconfigure the ruined world, and the cost—his lifelong dreamlessness now confronted by warmth—radiates through the final image of light-formed trees. Causality is lyric-accumulative rather than tight because/thereor, but the pattern is taught early and holds to the luminous final cadence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The glowing dune, chess clock, and frozen terminal function as micro-settings that physically constrain action: the dune’s lattice must be charmed to unlock the archive, the clock’s frozen hands must be aligned, and the ash-blanketed horizon supplies the only temporal cue. Sensory selection stays urgent—violet petals, amber scar, cold metal pulse—each charging the final image of azure sand learning to breathe.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—can anything grow after the last burn?—tightens when the chant aligns the clock and the archive blooms: the guard forfeits his shield of dreamlessness as seeds of light fall. Escalation is accumulative-textural rather than causal-reversal, but the cadence shift from frozen stasis to reverse-ticking waves makes the cost unmistakable.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the inversion of archive and forest: forgotten possibilities are replanted as living light, refusing the moral that ashes must stay dead. The fractured lullaby—burning-leaf sighs harmonized with new growth—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without sermonizing, though a final-line “reminder” nudges toward overtness.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice carries a hypnotic, chant-like cadence whose patterned repetition (“metronome of sighs,” “fractured lullaby”) is taught early and paid off in the harmonized hum at closure. Perceptual signature is starkly character-bound: a man who has never dreamed notices the world through pulse, metal temperature, and sand color—never through abstract nouns—maintaining POV modesty throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Rhythm modulates from long incantatory sentences to clipped fragments (“He lifted the chess clock”) that mirror the first tick. Metaphors stay physically coherent—sand petals, clock heart—and propel rather than stall. Minor template echoes (“the guard whispered… the dunes responded”) are too brief to obscure the luminous closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of quantum-archive, dreamless protagonist, and reverse-running chess clock feels fresh yet inevitable; no familiar trope is left untransformed. Conceptual risk—the lyric-accumulative structure—heightens rather than softens stakes, delivering a final image whose light-forests could not exist without this exact alchemy of elements.</comment>
