<comment>Mira’s “spirited driftwood sculptor” label is repeated but never dramatized—no tool in hand, no splinter under fingernail, no trade-off between vision and wood. Interiority drifts into generic wisdom-speak (“each scar a chapter”) rather than concrete, contradictory impulses. Her final decision to build a “layered tableau” arrives as a narrated epiphany without micro-visible cost; we never see her refuse or sacrifice anything on the page. The learning trait stays ornamental, not operational.</comment>

<comment>The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: storm, slide, arch, and wood accrue meaning until a charged poise crystallizes. Closure lands as a Charged Poise—the driftwood compass sculpture and the crowd’s “unseen pull” reconfigure Mira’s stance—but the cost is only implied (“mission fulfilled”) rather than felt on-page. Orientation is clear by 120 words (storm arch, failed GPS, lantern slide). Causality remains loose: the slide’s visions do not narrow options so much as decorate the arch; escalation is atmospheric, not consequential.</comment>

<comment>Sensory selection is biased to Mira’s sculptor eye: salt-smelling palms, wood grain likened to stone, turbine hum as lullaby. The arch-as-throat metaphor is sustained, guiding spatial choreography without contradiction. Weather and turbines integrate into rhythm, mirroring internal state without overt symbolism. While no prop constrains a final tactical choice, the driftwood shards’ “natural scars” subtly charge the closing compass image, satisfying the micro-setting gate for 9-.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—turning splinters into bridges—remains abstract; no concrete price is risked or paid. Pressure intensifies atmospherically (storm softens, lantern glows brighter) but does not foreclose an option or force a trade-off. Mira’s agency is contemplative rather than consequential; the crowd’s “unseen pull” is an effect, not a decision she confronts. Escalation is textural density, not narrowing choice under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<comment>Theme emerges implicitly: art as vessel for communal memory, wood as time’s archive. The lantern’s projected ropes and the final child-self image reweight the premise without moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture—lifting the slide, feeling the arch “breathe”—but insight never sharpens into contradiction or loss. The closing lullaby affirms continuity rather than complicating it, leaving resonance pleasant, not urgent.</comment>

<comment>Third-person lyric sustains a consistent perceptual signature: sculptor’s tactile diction (“grain of a driftwood log under a carving blade”), wind-as-blade metaphors, turbine pulse as heartbeat. Rhythm modulates with pressure—short clauses during storm, longer cadences during contemplation—without monotony. No dialogue to test voice distinction; internal idiom remains concrete and sea-salted. Occasional elevated phrasing (“timewoven alliances echo”) edges toward pseudo-profundity but stays within lyrical tolerance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm is deliberate; sentence openings vary, paragraph lengths breathe. Figurative density is high—storm-arch-throat, lantern-breath, rope-threads—yet pattern holds because metaphor family (sea, carving, breath) is taught early. A few paraphrase loops (“layered meanings” repeated; “turbine-hum reverie” thrice) mildly dull momentum. No mixed metaphors confuse spatial logic; closure image remains clear.</comment>

<comment>Fresh angle: GPS failure plus magic lantern turns nautical ruin into living gallery; driftwood sculpture as time-compass feels specific. Conceptual risk is moderate—lyric accumulation instead of plotted reversal—but execution commits fully. Proximity check reveals no lifted lines; sea-carving lexicon is individualized. Could transpose to another coastal ruin with minimal loss, limiting upper band.</comment>
