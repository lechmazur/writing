<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is vivid and body-bound—her “trembling finger,” the bow drawn across swollen wood—yet her contradictory impulse (preserve vs. unlock the ghost’s silence) stays mostly asserted, not dramatized in-scene. The final chord is earned, but the cost is atmospheric rather than personal; we feel the hall exhale more than Mara lose something legible. Still, her perceptual filter is distinct and consistent.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the sustained note reconfigures meaning, the lanterns steady, the program dries—undeniable conceptual cost under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Pattern is taught early (water droplets = staff lines) and lands cleanly. No orientation debt; space, time, and POV anchor by line 3. Causality is mythic but internally coherent.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The flooded opera house is not backdrop; its leaking roof literally writes the score Mara must play. Micro-setting (warped program, swollen violin) constrains tactile choice. Every sensory pick is filtered through Mara's musician bias—she sees staff lines in water damage, hears breath in lantern flicker—charging the final image. Spatial choreography is immaculate; we never lose her body in the pit.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“unravel the ghost’s silence”—is signaled early and tightens once: the watery staff lines demand a single note that bridges worlds. The price is atmospheric (the hall still floods; the ghost merely smiles), so the tightening feels aesthetic rather than tactical. Still, agency is hers; coincidence complicates but does not resolve. Sufficient for this lyric mode.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme—music lives in the silences between—emerges through concrete pattern: marginal gaps = rest symbols = ghost’s withheld aria. No moralizing; the final drying of the program is a silent rebuttal to any need for fuller statement. Ambiguity is purposeful and charged. The concept integrates with every image rather than sitting atop them.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Mara’s musician ear: “unplayed notes hung like ghosts,” “sigh that seemed to echo the ghost’s own breath.” Syntax lengthens and compresses with bow pressure; no filter-verb clutter. Elision (“lately inspired”) is taught early and paid off. Voice never breaks POV contract.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm pulses like slow adagio; no template cadence or mixed metaphor. Information density is high—“vellum pages warped and stained” does triple descriptor duty. The single allowed figurative cluster (“amber light trembling like breath on wet wood”) is earned and pattern-central. No loops, no scaffold, no artifact in closing beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Flooded opera-house-as-etched-manuscript is a fresh synthesis; the ghost’s silence coded in water damage feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Risk—letting climax be a single sustained note—pays off because the story teaches its mythic causality early. No derivative echo of familiar Phantom tropes; the chandelier collapse is backstory, not set-piece.</comment>
