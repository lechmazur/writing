<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Lira’s curiosity is shown through embodied micro-choices—tracing chalk, whispering foreign words—that escalate to the luminous payoff; the “diligently curious” trait is dramatized, not labelled. Interiority stays concrete and sensorial, though the emotional contradiction layer is thin: we see no moment where curiosity threatens the ship or her standing, so the cost feels aesthetic rather than personal. Motivation is consistent and character-bound, but the final pride is slightly performative because the stakes never imperil her. Still, she is an individual, not a trope, and her voice-of-attention is specific enough for immediate publication.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the deck halo crystallizes a new resource with undeniable conceptual cost—the ship now glows with borrowed sky-light, life-force implicitly taxed. Causality is accumulative/textural: each phrasebook scrap + hopscotch square adds density until the cadence shift (silver vines wrapping copper) reweights stakes. Orientation is anchored by word 60; lens holds. Minor slack: the “life-force” price is named but not dramatized in a beat of fatigue or flickering lamp, so the cost is felt more than visible—still legible under lyric mode.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Airship brass, starling murmurations, and the hopscotch board as micro-setting all constrain tactics: the chalk grid literally routes the luminance through copper veins. Sensory hierarchy skews visual, but selectivity is POV-driven—Lira’s cartographer eye notices angles of lantern glow, not touristy vistas. Spatial choreography is flawless; the deck, board, and engine pipes track cleanly. Environment charges the final image: same deck, now halo-wrapped, reconfigures meaning—passing the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“harness stranded luminance without draining life-force”—is signaled early; escalation is the stepwise chalking of squares that progressively tightens risk. Agency is creative, not combative; each new phrase and chalk line narrows options toward the final sync. Cost is implied rather than visceral: engine hum steadies but no lamp dims or crewmember staggers, keeping pressure lyrical rather than lethal. Still, the tightening pattern under the Accumulative lens is coherent and sufficient for this word count.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: the ethics of borrowing sky-light from living constellations (starlings) to chart human paths. No moral is stated; the final halo asks whether导航值得偷天火. Subtext whispers through silence—no crew dialogue, only engine and bird cries—leaving reader to weigh wonder against implicit drain. Ambiguity is purposeful and haunting.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited holds tight focalization; perceptual signature—“brass hull humming with age,” “vellum whispering stories”—is cartographer-poetic without register drift. Syntax mirrors attention: long, diagonal clauses when tracing chalk; clipped Latinate fragments during climax. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk zero. The slight lift toward lyric oratory is earned by the accumulative design and pays off in the final choral hum.</comment>

<comment>Prose is dense yet breathable; sentences carry double duty—e.g., “starling murmurations…like living constellations” layers metaphor without stalling motion. No loops, scaffold, or synonym churn; metaphors stay coherent (sky-light / bird / copper circuit). One mild purple puff—“amber breath” of lantern—does not obscure causality. Rhythm modulates: longer cadence for drift, staccato as chalk snaps to final square, supporting escalation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Fusion of hopscotch board + polyglot scraps + starling murmuration feels freshly synesthetic: child’s game becomes cosmic circuit. The premise flips classic “find the beacon” into “grow the beacon from stolen living light,” a non-obvious moral calculus. Specific brass-and-vellum airship culture is built in glimpses, not dumps. Risk in lyric compression heightens coherence without gimmickry, satisfying transformation test.</comment>
