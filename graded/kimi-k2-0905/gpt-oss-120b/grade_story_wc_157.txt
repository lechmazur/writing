<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lysander’s “spark of defiance” is stated repeatedly but never dramatized as an internal contradiction; his micro-choices (scattering seed, whispering) are atmospheric, not crucible-level. Dr. Mirabel’s late alignment is a clean external pivot yet lacks prior textual friction. No embodied contradiction under pressure keeps him from the 8-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the greenhouse becomes a living cipher, cost felt in the shift from private rebellion to shared network. Causal chain is lyric-accumulative; each seedling spiral reweights knowledge rather than narrows physical options. Orientation is clean by 50 words; no lens ambiguity. Lacks one persistent constraint that would push it to 9.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Greenhouse glass, insect hum, and cracked gourd seed recur as tactile micro-setting; the seed’s drum-like husk charges the final auditory image. Spatial choreography stays locked to Lysander’s hand-level perspective; no floating props. Meets 9+ gate: the seed’s resonance constrains the closing cadence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—untaxed thought—remains conceptual; escalation is pattern-dense spirals rather than narrowing options. The warp is atmospheric, not a tactic-altering turn. Cost is conceptual (garden now speakable only in riddles) and legible; still, one visible forfeiture would sharpen the pressure.</question>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges via vegetal cipher vs. taxable language; no final moralizing. The gourd seed’s rattle re-prices thought as percussion, not commodity. Subtext lives in seedling angles and insect silence—quiet but resonant. Avoids tidy binaries; ambiguity lingers cleanly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person lyric compresses perception through Lysander’s synesthetic bias; diction stays botanic-sonic (“tiny ribs promising a rhythm”). No head-hopping; POV distance stable. Rhythm mirrors insect pulse without template cadence. Distinctive, not yet hairline-perfect.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Read-aloud cadence flexes with seed-crackle and spiral verbs; no loops. A few stacked modifiers (“kaleidoscope of fragrant, humming possibilities”) flirt with purple but serve the warp. High density; each line seeds image or sound. Minor figurative muddle keeps it sub-8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Treats thought-tax as fait accompli then literalizes resistance into gardening cryptography—fresh synthesis. Gourd rattle as subversive drum is non-obvious and inevitable in hindsight. Tropes (rogue scholar, secret club) are re-rooted in soil pattern rather than spy cliché. Risk raises stakes without clarity loss.</comment>
