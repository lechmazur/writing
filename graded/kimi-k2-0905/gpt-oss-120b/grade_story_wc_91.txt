<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is lush and embodied—her feet sinking in “warm volcanic grit,” the jar trembling under volcanic breeze—yet her contradictory motives (exhausted giver vs. curious tracker of transformation) remain stated rather than dramatized in a single pressured choice. The final smile-and-walk settles for emotional shorthand instead of a micro-choice that costs her anything visible. Still, her perceptual signature is consistent and specific enough to lift the score above mid-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the freed fireflies stitching a “luminous tapestry” re-weight her earlier charitable wanderings into destiny, and the cost—her prior exhaustion and the jar’s loss—remains legible. Lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of glow (bugs → sand → sky) intensifies until meaning, not plot, pivots. Orientation is anchored by line 3; no causal gaps. Meets the 9+ quick test except the cost is more conceptual than visceral.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Black-sand beach, warm grit, volcanic breeze, and glowing jar form a micro-setting that literally guides the final release; the volcano’s heartbeat is felt underfoot. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven—Mara notices heat, salt-ash taste, insect light—never catalog. The “luminous carpet” charges the closure image, satisfying the 9+ gate. One hairline slip: “distant star cracked open” drifts toward grand abstract without tactile cue.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—does captured transformation stay bottled or escape?—is signaled early and tightens when the glass trembles and shatters, narrowing her option to control. Escalation is textural: each new glow layer (jar → sand → sky) raises the stakes for meaning. Cost is present (loss of control, jar, old identity) but feels diffuse because Mara never actively decides to break the vessel; the wind does it for her. Still, the pattern-driven intensification cleanly meets the lens.</comment>

<comment>Theme emerges without statement: generosity as accidental prophecy, transformation as something you cannot hoard. The firefly tapestry reprises earlier images and re-weights charity from depletion to cosmic alignment. Ambiguity is preserved—no moral is preached. Final image offers quiet conceptual repricing rather than sentimental uplift.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric voice maintains consistent perceptual signature: selective, synesthetic, slightly mythic. Syntax swells and contracts with the glowing beats; no head-hop. Diction stays within Mara’s plausible lexicon while reaching for the numinous. One template cadence repetition (“every ripple…every flicker…”) is brief and pattern-serving, not penalized.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>High information density: each sentence layers sensory, metaphoric, and emotional work. Rhythm modulates from long breathy clauses to short pulses (“The glass trembled”). No loops or scaffold; metaphors stay internally coherent. Minor overwrite: “smoldering amber” + “velvet black” in same sentence flirts with purple, but it’s contained within a single beat and doesn’t obscure closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: destitute philanthropist + bottled lightning bugs + volcanic black sand = specific mythic ecology. Prophecy fulfilled accidentally sidesteps chosen-one cliché by making generosity the engine, not destiny itself. Risk is moderate—lyric accumulative structure rather than plotted reversal—but execution commits fully. Concept feels inevitable in hindsight yet not overtly borrowed.</comment>
