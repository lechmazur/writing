<comment>Mara’s claustrophobia is named but never embodied in the moment; she slides through rusted doors and phase folds without a constricted breath or panic beat. The interior contradiction we need—fear of tight space vs pull of codex—stays abstract, so her final “heart at ease” feels asserted rather than earned. Micro-choices (aligning codex, whispering return) are goal-efficient but don’t reveal a hierarchy of values under visible cost. Still, her occupation-derived attentiveness to invisible passages gives the arc a credible spine.

<comment>Closure lands: Mara re-enters daylight having sealed the invisible map, cost paid by the burial of the codex itself—Conceptual Repricing with tangible forfeiture. Causal chain is thin (phase transition mechanics arrive late and work because the tide is high) but coherent under Accumulative/Textural lens: tide ⇄ cable hum ⇄ codex pulse pattern holds. Orientation is cleanly anchored inside the vestibule by line 3; no debt applied. One meaningful tightening only, but it reweights stakes acceptably for 740-word span.

<comment>The rusted facility, cable coils, and salt-corroded console are filtered through spelunker attention to texture and space; every tactile detail (wet vellum, phosphorescent ink, serpent-fiber loops) constrains her小心 handling of the codex. Phase-shimmer turning walls “translucent like jellyfish bellies” charges the final image with living fragility. Spatial choreography stays consistent as she steps from vestibule to console to cavernous core. Environment never overwhelms beat progression; it guides grip and footfall choices throughout.

<comment>Dominant stake—“stand by the unremembered” via codex map—is signaled early; pressure tightens once when phase arrays awaken and misstep threatens void crush. Agency is present: she aligns book, whispers protocol, activates return, buries codex—each action forecloses safer options. Cost is the permanent burial, visible on page, satisfying the lens. No second reversal, but single deepening suffices at this length; escalation is steady if not fierce.

<comment>Theme of remembrance-as-responsibility emerges through the codex’s glowing amber strands and the sea-foam names of dead scientists; no explicit thesis stated. Burial of the golden map reweights the premise: tracking invisible things now means protecting them from exploitation. Final image answers the thematic question non-literally—quiet triumph felt in receding tide. Ambiguity lingers (who will listen next?) without confusion, sustaining resonance beyond the plot.

<comment>Third-person limited clings to Mara’s tactile, limestone-trained perception: “rusted steel doors… thick with salt and old circuitry.” Syntax lengthens during phase fold to mimic disorientation, then contracts on exit—a taught pattern. No dialogue, so voice purity stays intact. Diction remains within her plausible lexicon; occasional lyric uplift (“veil of pressure that tasted of brine”) is earned by prior sensory grounding.

<comment>Prose is dense and varied—“hulking mouth that swallowed daylight” does double atmospheric work. Only scattered filter verbs (“she felt”) and one mixed metaphor crash (“phase fields shimmered… concrete walls translucent”); clarity endures. No loops or template cadence; paragraphs advance knowledge or charge. Rhythm modulates with tide pulse, supporting momentum without overwrite in peak beat. Final sentence lands clean, echoing “crashing hush” opener.

<comment>Fusing claustrophobic spelunker, undersea cable farm, and dimension-phase codex yields a fresh configuration; not a trope cocktail we’ve seen. The invisible-data-tracking metaphor converts cold tech into haunted oceanic memory, then seals it underground—an inevitable yet non-obvious end. Risk of experimental tech is taken seriously; no late rule patch. Specificity of gold-fleck vellum and sea-foam etchings anchors the concept in sensory life rather than gimmick.
