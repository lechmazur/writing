<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Maren’s survivor-guilt motive is vivid, but interiority drifts into lyrical abstraction (“promise to translate each wound”) that tells emotion already shown. No secondary character appears, so status/relationship bullets are N/A. The ending’s shift from penance to communal gifting is credible, though the moment of renunciation is summarized, not dramatized. Embodied contradiction is present—tender handling of a cracked lethal box—yet the micro-choice hierarchy is blurred by poetic paraphrase.</question>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the box’s light reframes “pain into a universal language” before the crowd, cost felt in her scarred skin and public exposure. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—moon, ash, and porcelain shards accrete meaning until the final image reweights stakes. Orientation is clear by word 40; no penalty. Causality is soft—hikers’ rescue is back-story ellipsis—but the bargain still governs present conduct; legitimacy holds under lyric-mosaic mode. The final image satisfies cost; earlier beats lean on atmospheric recurrence rather than because/therefore links.</answer>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The moonlit ridge and smoldering valley are economically sketched through Maren’s fire-forged perception; ash whispering tree names is a sharp sensory hook. Porcelain box functions as micro-setting, its fracture lines literally steering the moonlight that powers the climax. Spatial choreography is ghost-clean—no impossible positions. Setting never constrains a tactical choice, so 9-band gate fails; capped at 8.8 eligibility line.</question>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</question><comment>Dominant stake—redeem bargained innocence via public enlightenment—signals early and tightens once when she decides to open the box in the square. Pressure is situational: night, village anticipation, and her own burn scars; no antagonist. One meaningful deepening occurs at the altar stone where ash voices name the dead, forcing her to proceed. Cost is felt (public exposure of grief) yet not persistent; no future constraint is dramatized, holding score below 8.0.</question>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</question><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: scars as lanterns, pain as shared grammar. Subtext resides in silent gesture—lifting the cracked box rather than speaking redemption. No overt thesis statement; final paragraph avoids moralizing. The reweighting of “bargain” from private guilt to communal gift is elegantly implicit, earning after-effect resonance without sentimentality.</question>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</question><comment>Lyric third-person channels Maren’s fire-scarred perceptual lens: pine needles applaud, ash murmurs names, moonlight stitches sky to ridge—consistent synesthetic bias. Syntax lengthens and contracts with ascent/descent rhythm. No dialogue, so dialogue bullets N/A. Filter-verb count is low; immediacy intact. Register stays within plausible range for a contemplative firefighter; no academic drift. Patterned repetition (“hard softness”) is intentional and paid off in final line.</question>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</question><comment>Prose is lush but disciplined; metaphor density peaks at altar scene yet remains legible under accumulative lens. One paraphrase loop detected: “bargain of innocence itself was breathing” echoes prior innocence phrasing within three sentences (−0.2). No template cadence or mixed metaphors. Opening and closing lines are razor-sharp. Rhythm breathes with climb-rest-climb structure, sustaining momentum despite lyric load.</question>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</question><comment>Fresher angle: wildfire scar tissue converted into communal optics device. Porcelain fracture-as-lens is a specific, non-obvious synthesis. Celestial “slow dance” and ash-whisper voices avoid stock firefighter tropes. Risky lyric density is earned through consistent pattern taught in paragraph 1. Transformation test fails if Maren is swapped out—her burn-knowledge is integral. Conceptual integrity holds: no late rule inventions.</question>
