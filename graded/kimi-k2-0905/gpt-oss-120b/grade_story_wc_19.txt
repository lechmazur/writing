<comment>Lio’s hunger to “taste” silence is palpable and idiosyncratic, driving every beat; the moment he inhales the filaments and feels fear dissolve is an embodied micro-choice that visibly re-prioritizes his hierarchy of needs. Interiority stays concrete (“his chest a rubber band nearing its limit”) rather than diagnostic. The porcelain doll is never handled in a second, contrasting beat, so the object-relationship stagnates, capping the arc just short of exceptional. Still, the ending’s Earned Stasis—he accepts perpetual bunker life but now carries an internal sky—pays a felt cost and is rooted in prior causality.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: gravity snaps back, filaments dissolve, and Lio re-enters the bunker carrying an internalized “gilded hush,” re-weighting the premise with undeniable conceptual cost. Causal lens holds: because he limits exposure, each silence stays pure; therefore he gains an portable sky inside stone. Orientation is clean by line 3; no teleporting props. The single shard design meets Track A defaults. Minor knock: the doll’s earlier utility is summarized (“his mother told him”) rather than dramatized, a micro-setup softness that keeps it from the 8.8 tier.</comment>

<comment>Compressed lyric setting inside a ventilation shaft and swaying trellis taught by 120 words, with selective sensory hierarchy—clouds “like cool silk,” vines “humming.” The xenial trellis acts as a micro-setting that literally supplies the only vantage point for harvesting; without it, no tactic exists, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography is flawless: gravity inversion tracked through tactile shifts (“stone seemed to float”). Detail is balanced across senses but prioritizes touch and sound to mirror claustrophobic POV bias.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—acquire silence flavors—tightens neatly: each inversion minute narrows to one breath per silence, foregrounding the cost of over-exposure. Agency stays frontal: Lio decides to climb, decides when to stop inhaling, decides to descend. The hourglass mechanic is legible and alters tactics in real time. The absence of an external antagonist is fitting; pressure is situational and still coherent. Cost is visible yet modest (loss of filaments at snap-back); a sharper forfeiture—say, permanent vertigo or porcelain fracture—would have pushed it into the 8.5+ band.</comment>

<comment>Theme emerges organically: the vastness of experience is compressible into the smallest vessel if attention is disciplined. Subtext operates through image rather than assertion—doll as portable cosmos, trellis as externalized lung. Final image reweights prior claustrophobia without moralizing. No motif checklist abuse; “gilded hush” recurs only when it crystallizes choice. Complexity acknowledged: the silence flavors remain fugitive, resisting ownership; Lio gains wonder but not escape, embracing ambiguity.</comment>

<comment>Third-person limited maintains consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature is unmistakably claustrophobic—air is “trapped sigh,” sky a “rumor.” Syntax elongates then contracts to mimic breathing under inversion. Diction stays within Lio’s plausible lexicon; no filter-verb bloat. Rhythm modulates: lyrical coils for ascent, staccato for gravity snap-back. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk is zero. One hairline slip: “intangibly tangible” is abstract inside a peak beat, a micro-elevation of register that momentarily nudges us out of his skin, preventing 9.0.</comment>

<comment>Prose is dense, musical, and propulsive; most sentences carry double duty (image + interior shift). No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Mixed-metaphor watch: “molten gold” sun and “gilded hush” share semantic field, so coherence holds. One metaphor contradiction: “weightless and heavy” is deliberate paradox, not artifact. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line offers image-based resolution. Micro-registry drift noted above is the only line-level flaw touching a peak beat, holding it shy of 8.5.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fusion of silence-as-substance, gravity inversion as harvest window, and porcelain doll as capture device is non-obvious and internally coherent. Claustrophobia inverted into expansiveness via perceptual discipline feels fresh. Specifics are unexportable—trellis vines humming in negative gravity could not be swapped for any generic bridge. Risk is high but clarity intact; the lyric compression teaches its own rules early. Hindsight test passes: every beat foreshadows the final “universe of silence” humming inside the bunker. Only the slight conceptual abstraction at the inversion snap keeps it from 9.2.</comment>
