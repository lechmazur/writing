<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority—“the tug in her bones,” lantern flame fed by reclaimed memories—grounds her obsession in sensory body-knowledge; the final smile is credible renunciation. Yet her contradictory impulses are stated rather than dramatized in-scene; we are told she is haunted, not shown a moment where she almost flees the chamber. The micro-choice to exhume is present but solitary; a second waver or risk would have pushed this to 9+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: spiral pattern taught in coffee ground → salt wall → wildflower key. Closure is a Charged Poise—lantern now carries whale-song and deleted memories with felt conceptual cost (“weight of each reclaimed fragment”). Causality stays intact; no teleporting props; orientation anchors within 120 words. Persistent constraint—the lantern’s new cargo—shapes any future night she lights the dark.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dock, tide-breath crystals, gravity pockets, and lantern brass are filtered through Mara’s professional attention; each detail later constrains action (boots dragged, wildflower pressed into spiral lock). Salt chamber micro-setting doubles as body-tool hybrid that charges the final image. No white-room gaps; spatial choreography clean from pier to fissure. Meets 9+ gate: lantern-tool recurs and reweights the closing glow.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—retrieving deleted memories—tightens once: spiral match triggers slab sigh and memory release; options narrow to “lift or leave.” Cost is conceptual (memories now ride her lantern), visible in brighter flame. Escalation is single but meaningful under Accumulative lens. Could reach 8.8+ if a second gravity fluctuation had threatened to scatter the fragments, sharpening risk.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particular repetitions: pressed flowers ↔ flattened memories, gravity pockets ↔ compression of forgetting. Final image reweights prior material—lantern’s glow now stores whale-song, making deletion reversible yet portable. Ambiguity lingers: who decides what returns? No explicit moral; resonance carried by salt-tinged silence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person lyric voice maintains perceptual signature: “lantern lighter,” “salt kiss,” “shy tides of force.” Diction stays within Mara’s plausible lexicon; rhythm breathes with her exhalations. Patterned spiral repetition taught early and paid off at closure. No dialogue to test, but interior texture stays distinct and coherent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High information density: single sentences perform triple duty—“The sand fell away like sifted dreams, revealing a smooth slab etched with symbols that shimmered under the lantern's glow” advances action, setting, and metaphor cleanly. No synonym loops or template cadence; figurative language sparse except where pattern-taught (spiral, salt). Read-aloud rhythm pulses like quiet tide; paragraph cuts purposeful.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fusion of memory retrieval, fluctuating gravity, and coffee-ground divination feels fresh; whale-beach and salt crystal chamber refract familiar eco-grief through surreal lens. Spiral as both lock and memory-map is inevitable in hindsight. Risk in conceptual premise pays off: closure stays legible under Accumulative lens. Specific detail (flattened wildflowers, brass lighter) prevents abstraction.</comment>
