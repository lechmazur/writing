<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The arsonist’s contradictory impulses—burning to preserve—are dramatized in the scorched-circle discovery; his tactile tracing of the tapestry keeps emotion embodied. Yet the three-year ellipsis and sudden mentor promise feel retro-fitted, so the final renunciation, while visible, lacks a prior cost that was dramatized on-page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the mural glows amber, sealing the archive with felt tenderness. Causal chain is clear—portrait→trail→phoenix tapestry→scroll—but the mentor’s promise arrives as a late parcel, not earned by prior tension; the lens is Accumulative/Textural and holds.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The sandstone archive, scorched circle, and bronze box are sketched with sensory economy; the tapestry acts as micro-setting that charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible moves. The environment constrains choice—only fire can reveal the hidden niche—satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—rescue the promise—signals early. One meaningful tightening: pressing the tapestry slides the stone, foreclosing retreat. Cost is present (his prior identity as arsonist is abandoned), but the price is declared rather than dramatized within the closing beat, keeping it just below the 7.0 threshold.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme of redemptive creation emerges through fire-as-illumination rather than statement; the phoenix image re-weights without moralizing. Subtext in the vandalized portrait (self-judgment) is effective. Sentimentality is avoided, but the mentor’s promise edges toward explicit thesis, capping lift.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice carries a lyrical-archival texture—“silent equations of color and pattern”—consistent with analytically intuitive arsonist. Syntax flexes under emotional pressure; no head-hopping. Filter verbs are sparse; diction stays within plausible lexicon. Distinct perceptual signature is sustained, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong density—each sentence advances image or stakes. Metaphors (“lava, bright and tender”) stay coherent and tied to fire motif. One paraphrase loop: “volcanic tenderness” is repeated without new charge in closing paragraph, a −0.2 scaffold hit that keeps the category sub-8.0.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Arsonist-turned-muralist is fresh; fire as reveal-not-destroy inverts expectation. Phoenix tapestry and glyphs feel specific rather than checklist symbols. Risk taken with accumulative structure pays off. Could edge higher with more lived detail on how archive lore alters his fire-craft.</comment>
