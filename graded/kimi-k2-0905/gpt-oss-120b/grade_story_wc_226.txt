<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Mara’s defiance is vivid in her chalk-sketches and whispered cues, but her interior contradiction—innocent mischief vs. sacrificial resolve—remains stated rather than dramatized in a single pressured choice. The moment she lifts the final brushstroke carries cost, yet the leap from playful instigator to self-offering feels telescoped; one more micro-choice under duress would have let the trait sharpen the stakes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the sky-written “We are the echo” refracts into communal absolution, the price accepted. Causality is lyric-accumulative rather than strict because/therefore; pattern holds, but the forged-hush rule is taught only by repetition, not by early concrete cue, so the lens crystallizes late.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Bone towers, chalk dust, and refracted sunrise shards are tactile and omnipresent; the canyon’s echo literally bends the verses that seal forgiveness. Micro-setting (Mara’s paint-smeared fingertips, the glowing mural) constrains her final gesture, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography stays clean across the communal circle.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Single dominant stake—communal absolution via artistic ransom—tightens when each added stanza makes withdrawal impossible without silencing the entire canyon. Escalation is accumulative: density of refracted voices, not external opposition. Cost is legible in Mara’s shoulder-settling dust and the glowing mural that consumes her pigment, but the pressure plateaus rather than spikes in a final beat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Forgiveness-as-debt emerges from bone-memory imagery and the spire’s cold shards, avoiding overt thesis. Final image—“We are the echo”—offers resonant non-literal answer, reweighting earlier refrains. A hairline slip into thematic echo-recitation in the wind-whisper line is cushioned by its choral dispersal.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays tight to Mara’s perceptual filter; diction (“forged hush,” “frozen finger”) is character-specific without purple drift. Rhythm modulates: long breathless clauses during refraction, then a short declarative final line—clean cadence control. No dialogue, so voice convergence risk waived.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>High figurative density is justified by pattern-taught refractive motif; mixed metaphors (“wounded beast… bone towers… frozen finger”) cohere under optic/sonic refraction theme. Occasional scaffold near-duplicates (“refracted… refracting”) create micro-loop; not severe enough to dull the final image. Clause variation and sensory specificity keep propulsion alive.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Forgiveness priced via participatory art-etiquette in a canyon ossuary feels fresh; the refracted-poetry mechanic rescues the ritual from generic sacrifice. Risk-taking lies in lyric-accumulative structure; payoff lands, but premise edges close to “art saves” trope without full inversion. Specificity of chalk, bone, dawn-silver shards prevents template drift.</comment>
