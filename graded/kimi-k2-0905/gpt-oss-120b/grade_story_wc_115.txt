<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mara’s “reckless explorer” tag is shown more than told—he alone descends, keeps his senses “half-closed yet razor-sharp,” and the final renunciation feels earned. Interiority is concrete (“the weight…settle into his own ribs”), but the religious skepticism never visibly alters an on-page choice; it is asserted rather than dramatized. No second character appears, so relationship crucible is N/A. The micro-choice to leave the wheel is credible and carries visible cost, satisfying the 9+ quick test for Earned Stasis.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Charged Poise: Mara’s refusal lets the swallowed truth stay buried while the tunnel “breathes” and the ghost shift withdraws—cost is felt in the transferred weight to his ribs. Causality under an Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the numeric pattern derived from radio fragments tightens the stake and reweights the valve’s meaning without requiring external plot turns. Orientation is anchored by line 3 (“rusted artery…beneath the moon”) and never clouds. One soft spot: the foreman’s live-radio confession is backstory delivered in a late reflective block; because it never limits present options, the reveal feels convenient rather than earned by prior scene pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The tunnel is not wallpaper; its “rusted artery” anatomy and resonant air guide Mara’s breathing and literally constrain his exit. The beaded valve wheel operates as micro-setting—handled, weighed, and left behind—its oscillation charging the final image. Sensory economy favors sound (echo, hum, crackle) which mirrors the drowsy-alert tone. Spatial choreography is flawless; no impossible body or prop positions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“quantify the swallowed truth”—is signaled early and tightens when the numeric pattern resolves into “emotional tonnage,” foreclosing the option to haul the wheel out. Cost is legible in the transferred weight to his ribs. Under Accumulative lens, escalation is a density increase rather than causal reversal; the pattern break is sufficient. No credible resource loss (time, tool, stamina) is dramatized, keeping it below 8.5.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: industrial guilt as measurable mass, the ethics of leaving buried sins buried. The valve’s beads reframed as “frozen syllables” and the rib-weight image avoid abstract statement. Final image of tunnel “breathing” offers non-literal resonance—no moralizing sentence appended. Ambiguity is meaningful: reader must decide whether Mara’s renunciation is courage or complicity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays stable and filters every perception through Mara’s diction (“drowsy alertness,” “religious skepticism” as internal label). Rhythm self-modulates under pressure—long, humid sentences early, then shorter pulses as the wheel is appraised. No dialogue appears, so dialogue bullets are N/A. One minor filter-verb cluster (“he felt…he listened…he realized”) but it occurs in a low-pressure beat and does not blunt immediacy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Ear test passes: sentence openings vary, paragraph lengths breathe with scene cadence. Figurative language is selective—“rusted artery,” “frozen syllables”—and never stacks in high-pressure beats. One paraphrase loop (“weight…weight…weight” across two adjacent sentences) knocks 0.2. No scaffolding, no template cadence, no mixed metaphors. Information density is high; each sentence advances setting, character, or concept.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: haunted-industrial as quantifiable mass, ghost shift reframed as late-night radio static. The valve-as-balance-beam is a specific, non-obvious object that cannot be swapped out without breaking the numeric-pattern reveal. Risk—lyric accumulative structure—pays off in a legible Charged Poise. Minor proximity to “industrial haunting” trope is offset by the forensic, metrological angle.</comment>
