<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Mara’s sensibly eccentric trait is shown through her obsessive cataloguing of rain-scent and her calm descent into a water-stair, but interiority is largely poetic rather than contradictory-under-pressure. The final “quiet surrender” arrives as a conceptual beat rather than a visibly costly renunciation, so the change feels more observed than earned. Still, her actions align with her vocation and the compass psychometry gives her a tactile, character-specific way to perceive stakes. No secondary character appears, so status/relationship crucible is N/A.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each sensory layer (petrichor, compass pulse, water-stair) deepens the density of the “resonant hush” until Mara’s stance crystallizes in wordless surrender. Closure is a Charged Poise: the vortex ingests the compass and re-weights meaning—explanations are abdicated, not solved—so cost is conceptual but legible. Orientation is clear by line 8; no causal reversals are required under this lens. One minor scald: the lagoon’s physics (walkable water) is sprung without prior rule-teach, but the lyric pattern absorbs it without causality break.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Quarry, rusted gate, limestone, bioluminescent algae, and the black-glass lagoon are selectively filtered through Mara’s petrichor-trained attention; every detail serves mood and stakes. Spatial choreography is clean: she slips through gate → tunnel → shore → water-stair, no floating bodies. The compass-on-stone and water-stair act as micro-setting objects that constrain her path and charge the final image. Factory remains off-stage silhouette, but its silence partners the lagoon song, so off-page setting still earns tonal weight.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—reach the place where explanations fail—is signaled early and tightens through each sensory intensification rather than external opposition. No antagonist or reversal is required under Accumulative lens; pressure mounts as each new threshold (tunnel → lagoon → crystal vortex) narrows options toward wordless surrender. Cost is conceptual rather than bodily, but the compass’s ingestion and the world-tilt make the price visible. Could wish for one earlier material risk (air supply, fall hazard) to raise visceral stakes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: explanatory hunger dissolves into sensory surrender—epiphany seeded in the first sentence’s “slow, breathing sigh.” The repeating “hinged awakenings” image reweights at closure when the water-stair literally hinges open, avoiding abstract sermon. Ambiguity is preserved: surrender is neither triumph nor failure, just a stance crystallized. No final-paragraph thesis statement; the storm on the horizon extends the question rather than answering it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays pinned to Mara’s perceptual bias: every noun is rain- or mineral-scented, every verb is a hush or tremor. Syntax waxes lyrical but remains consistent, mirroring her eccentric sensorium under pressure. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk is zero. One filter-verb cluster (“she felt… she realized… she understood”) near climax dulls immediacy slightly but pattern is taught and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Metaphor density is high yet coherent (petrified guardians, star-water) because each vehicle extends the central “resonant hush.” No mixed metaphors or contradictory physics beyond the untaught water-stair, accepted under lyric contract. Rhythm modulates: long breathless sentences in descent, then clipped fragments at crystal chime. Only minor scaffold: “the lagoon accepted her weight” → “the surface rippled outward” restate the same beat without new pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Fusion of petrichor geek + psychometric compass + walkable water-stair feels fresh and specific to this voice. “Hinged awakening” as a literal limestone door re-energizes the trope of mystical threshold. Surrender-as-insight avoids hero’s-journey cliché. Risk is moderate—lyric accretion could have slid into purple—but compression keeps it under 800 words, so gamble pays off without dilution.</comment>
