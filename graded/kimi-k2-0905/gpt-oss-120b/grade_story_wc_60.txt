<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara’s luminous skepticism is shown through her tactile tracing of symbols and the quiet refusal to accept myth at face value; interiority is concrete (“she inhaled the hush”). The internal contradiction—doubt vs. need to believe—peaks when she whispers names to the box, a micro-choice that costs her composure. Patient endurance is earned by prior star-taught stillness, and the final smile shows a credibly paid shift. Voice remains coherent, though the prose occasionally drifts into lyric shorthand that blurs embodied emotion.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of breadcrumb glyphs → geese pause → glass spill forms mirror-constellation. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the sky-new constellation re-weights memory from prison to shared sky, cost felt in the box’s now-empty weight. Orientation anchors by line 3; spatial logic holds. One minor causality wobble: “sidereal patience” is named before we see it tested, but the lyric contract is taught early enough to waive penalty.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Setting is micro-specific: cracked basin, petrichor, moss-draped alley; each fountain stone is touched, not catalogued. The violet dusk and migrating geese function as clock and compass, directly constraining when/where Mara acts. Final image—constellation reflected in sky—recharges the cracked marble arch, proving environment can shift from ruin to mirror. One nip: “realistically imaginative spirit” is asserted of symbols rather than shown through Mara’s filtering senses.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—liberate trapped memories—tightens when hinges resist and glass sticks; the pause of geese is the live clock that narrows the moment. Escalation is textural: each breadcrumb adds density until the spill of lights reweights cost from private burden to public constellation. No visible price (blood, loss) but the empty box’s suddenly lighter weight signals forfeiture of her protective skepticism. Sufficient for 800-word lyric arc, though a sharper physical cost could punch higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges without thesis: memory’s value is re-priced from sealed grief to shared sky-light. Subtext in “defiant hush” implies political refusal to let city forget itself. Final constellation image offers non-literal answer—liberation means re-seeing ruin as map. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in whether citizens will drink the light.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Mara’s perceptual filter: “eyes glowing faintly with curiosity” is literalized, not cliché. Syntax lengthens during patient wait, contracts at “deft twist,” mirroring breath control. No dialogue, hence no voice contamination. Filter verbs (“seemed to echo”) are few and motivated by dusk uncertainty. Final cadence—“city exhaled”—earns mythic lift without violating POV modesty.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Ear-test rhythm: paragraph lengths swell and contract like breath; no template cadence. Figurative density is high yet patterned (light = memory = firefly = star), taught early and paid off. One mixed metaphor: “sidereal patience stretched beyond earthly clocks” is abstract, but rescued by concrete inhalation of silence. No loops, no scaffold, no clarity artifacts at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fusing star-time with goose migration as temporal key feels non-obvious yet inevitable; urban-memory constellation is fresh visual synthesis. Transformation test fails if Mara is swapped out—her skepticism is the necessary counterweight to lyric myth. Risk in lyric overload is embraced and controlled; no retreat to safer realism. Specificity of silver spiral glyph vs. blue river breadcrumb anchors invention in tactile detail.</comment>
