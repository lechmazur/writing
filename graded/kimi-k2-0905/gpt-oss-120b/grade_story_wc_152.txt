<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Lone protagonist’s motive—“listen for unheard stories”—is cleanly dramatized through micro-choices (each stitch = hypothesis, pause = question). Interiority stays concrete; embodied emotion shows in heat traveling through silk and the final smile. No contradiction or therapy-speak. Cost is conceptual yet felt: ember spent, map released, path foreclosed. The absence of any second character means relationship/status bullets are N/A; headcount clarity is perfect.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Track A single-scene arc lands a Resonant Reconfiguration: the stitched chart leaves the observatory, irreversibly exposing the coup. Causal lattice holds—every ember flicker maps to a conspirator step, tightening knowledge until the courier departs. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) appear within 60 words and recapitulate at courier hand-off. Cost is legible in the final image: “the ember, now a memory, faded into ash.” Meets 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Cobalt observatory, brass domes, glass roof, dormant telescope, autumn wind, and eternal candle are selectively filtered through the embroiderer’s task-driven attention. Environment constrains her method—loom placement beside the flame, heat as code reader—directly shaping tactics. Spatial choreography is immaculate; no geography drift. The telescope-as-mirror micro-setting charges the final image. No 9.0 because the city streets remain off-page abstractions.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“truth vs. coup”—is signaled early and tightens once: the ledger pouch beat narrows options to act now or lose the city. Agency is attention and renunciation: she spends the irreplicable flame and relinquishes control of the map. Escalation is causal under inferred lens; coincidence complicates (wind code) but does not resolve. Visible price: ember consumed, anonymity forfeited, exposure irreversible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete particulars: suppressed voices → star-silk → courier receipt. Final ash image reweights the candle’s earlier “eternal” promise into spent sacrifice. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers—will the map arrive in time? Subtext lives in gesture (whisper to flame, smile at dawn). Lacks the extra frisson that would push to 9.0 but sustains complexity without tidy closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays locked to the embroiderer’s perceptual signature: “sky bruised with dying stars,” “heat travel through silk like a secret signal.” Syntax lengthens during contemplation, shortens at courier moment, mirroring pulse. No head-hopping; diction remains within her artisan lexicon. Dialogue absent by design; voice sustains subtext through image and rhythm. One clause drifts slightly academic (“adjacent possibilities”)—minor.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no algorithmic cadence. Density high—single lines fuse sensory, symbolic, and causal work (“wind shifted … pattern that matched the rustle”). Mixed metaphors avoided; vehicles stay coherent. One paraphrase loop (“echoed silence … humming with promise”) costs −0.2. Otherwise clean of scaffold, filter verbs, or purple excess. Final ash line lands with crisp resonance.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Combines star-mapping, textile craft, and espionage in a synthesis that feels inevitable yet fresh. Eternal candle as archive of untold stories reframes familiar “light of truth” trope without gimmickry. Risk is taken in lyric, almost mythic tone; payoff is the ash-stitch contrast. Could swap names but not the specific sensory logic; hence not 9.5. Transformation evident, no close echoes of canonical scenes.</comment>
