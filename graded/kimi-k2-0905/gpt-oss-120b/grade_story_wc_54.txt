<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The intern’s functional-creative trait is stated repeatedly but never tested by failure or trade-off; every calculation succeeds without visible struggle, so the “earned” resurrection feels gift-wrapped rather than paid for. No contradictory impulse or embodied emotion appears under pressure; she never doubts, tires, or weighs ethical cost. The final smile is unanchored from any forfeiture, so the arc lands as competent but not transformed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure is legible: the terminal breathes again and faintly signals the towns, a Decisive Change with conceptual cost—the revived machine could be misused. Causal chain holds: sextant angle → power reroute → life-support surge → beacon. However, the Orientation Test applies: “echo of departing carnival lights still faint in the dust” leaves time/place ambiguous past 120 words and the effect does not sharpen the final image, so −0.3 is taken here, capping Q3 at 7.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Spatial anchors (dusty hull, cracked panel, main conduit) are vivid and guide her rerouting moves, satisfying the micro-setting gate. The sextant’s brass glint is returned in the final light, charging the closure image. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered; no world-rule inconsistency. Penalty cap from Q2 keeps score ≤7.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—resurrect hope via equations—is signaled early and tightens once when she discovers the hidden schematic, forcing a fresh ethical calculus. However, no visible price (injury, energy drain, social risk) is dramatized; the power surge costs her nothing and the beacon’s possible consequences remain abstract. Escalation is present but weightless, so the beat fails the 8+ cost gate.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: reclamation of abandoned systems as an act of quiet stewardship. The sextant’s evolution from sea-tool to ethical compass reweights the motif without explicit statement. Final image of stars saluting the terminal offers resonant, non-moralizing closure. Minor abstraction around “sentiment that had fled” keeps it from the 8-band.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays close to her engineer perception; diction favors concrete vectors, conduits, voltage. Syntax lengthens during calm calculation, then compresses at power surge, mirroring pulse. No head-hop or register drift; occasional elevated phrasing (“vaulted ceiling”) reads as intern’s awe rather than narrator intrusion. Distinct texture sustained.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Strong information density—most sentences perform dual duty of image and engineering logic. No mixed metaphors or synonym loops. However, three near-adjacent “dormant” repeats and a scaffold clause (“the abandoned spaceport hummed quietly, its revived pulse echoing the promise of hope she had engineered”) dull the final beat. Artifact touches closure-adjacent line, disallowing 9+.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>The hydro-reclamation parallel repurposed for a derelict starport feels fresh and specific; sextant-as-ethical-compass twist grows naturally from the premise. Risk is present but modest—no formal experimentation or moral abyss. While beats are foreseeable, the synthesis of carnival aftermath with revived beacon carries memorable afterglow.</comment>
