<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The violinist’s interiority is lyric but vague—no contradictory impulse is dramatized on the page; her single micro-choice (playing to “lift the hush”) is gentle, not costly. No tension between want/fear or flaw/price is staged; she merely observes and responds. The bowl’s hum and villagers’ awe substitute for visible personal stakes or renunciation. Earned stasis is hinted but not paid for by prior causality.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of echo, ash, and un-binding is taught early; closure lands as Charged Poise—the final reframing of “unfinished” as canvas carries undeniable conceptual cost under the dominant stake. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) is delivered by line 3; no teleport or amnesia. One meaningful tightening: the bowl’s chord reweights silence into hum, foreclosing the option of absolute quiet. Cost is legible in the final image of stars reflected in still-humming copper.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Glass greenhouse flickering with embers, ship-timber resonance, and copper bowl glints are selective, POV-filtered, and return to charge the final image. Spatial choreography is clean: bowl at fire-edge, vines swaying, violinist walking away. Environment constrains the only real choice—she plays because the hush is literally structural. Micro-setting (the bowl) functions as charged object that alters the sonic field.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“find beauty in the unfinished”—is signaled early; pressure is ambient, not tactical. No visible price or option foreclosure occurs; escalation is a gradual thickening of sonic texture rather than a decisive turn. Agency is expressive, not adaptive; she could walk away without loss. Cost is conceptual (world remains unfinished) but not viscerally felt by character.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through iterative image chain: ash → seed → echo → unfinished canvas; no explicit thesis. Final re-pricing—“unfinished was a canvas of endless light”—offers resonant non-literal answer. Subtext resides in silence as living medium rather than absence. Ambiguity is purposeful: decay becomes generative, no moral is stated.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Lyric third-person omniscient stays stable; perceptual signature is sonic, wave-like, matching violinist’s trait. Syntax swells and fades in imitation of bow strokes; no head-hop. Diction within plausible fairy-tale register; no filter-verb clutter. Final image crystallizes without narrator intrusion.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with scene: long sentences for lagoon hush, staccato sparks at fire. Some metaphor stacks verge on excess (“charcoal roots,” “skeletal guardians,” “tide seeking hidden shore”) but pattern is taught early and sustains mood. No scaffold loops; nouns specific, verbs strong. Closure line is clean, no artifact.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Premise—post-burn rainforest orchard inside wrecked ships—offers fresh ecological fable angle. Transformation: familiar “music heals ruin” trope is inverted; ruin persists, music merely re-tunes its silence. Specificity of echo-harbor acoustics keeps concept from abstraction. Risk lies in lyric density but coherence holds.</comment>
