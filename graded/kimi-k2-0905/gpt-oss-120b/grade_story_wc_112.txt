<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lira’s interiority is textured through tactile, mechanically-warmed hands and the quiet obsession with sideways time; the paradoxical pulse of “icy warmth” embodies her. One micro-choice—pulling the glyph-lever—carries the entire causal load and lands with visible cost as the vines shimmer and the birds ascend, earning her quiet smile. No secondary characters apply; her obliging nature is shown via meticulous turbine tending and the whispered promise to the birds at close. The 9+ quick test is met: contradictory impulses (scientist vs. mechanic, linear vs. sideways time) act in scene and the final stance is earned with cost felt in the station’s altered breath.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the sideways nudge of time reweights the station’s reality and Lira’s worldview, cost legible in the “icy warmth that seeped into every conduit.” Causal chain holds: twilight nexus → holographic lattice → lever pull → amber arcs → flora bloom + bird ascent. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 5; no penalty. One meaningful tightening: the stillness of the aviary crystallizes the moment of sideways slip. Lens is Causal, held without wobble to the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The magnetic nexus and glyph-lever function as micro-setting that literally bends time; their physical presence constrains every tactical move. Sensory hierarchy obeys Lira’s mechanic gaze—she notices turbine hum, steel beams, circuitry arcs—never touristic. Spatial choreography is flawless: turbine core → maintenance hatch → aviary → console. The “icy warmth” reappears at closure, re-charged by the sideways time event, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prove time can move sideways—is signaled in paragraph 2 and tested by the lever act. Escalation is single but decisive: the hush of wings at rest → amber cascade → flora unfurl → birds ascend; each beat tightens the uncanny. Cost is felt in the station-wide “icy warmth” that chills and comforts, foreclosing linear time. Agency is Lira’s alone; no coincidence resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges sideways: time’s elasticity mirrors the mechanic’s gentle persistence. No moral is stated; the final whispered promise to the birds reweights the premise without sermon. Subtext resides in the aviary’s stillness—life acknowledging a non-linear moment. The icy-warm paradox carries emotional aftereffect without sentimentality.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is dense, lyrical, mechanic-precise: “mechanically warm,” “holographic lattice,” “ violin bow on frozen strings.” Perceptual signature is Lira’s—every metaphor is filtered through turbine logic and alien flora. No dialogue; hence no voice convergence risk. Patterned repetition (“icy warmth,” “magnetic nexus at twilight”) is taught early and reprised at closure, legible under Causal lens.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Line-level craft is exemplary: zero paraphrase loops, no scaffold, high density—“the air turned to icy warmth, a paradoxical breath that seemed to both freeze and soothe the steel beams” does three jobs at once. Rhythm modulates from long breathy sentences to staccato “She pulled.” Metaphors stay coherent within physics of station and never muddle causality. Opening and closing lines anchor and recharge the motif.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: xenobiology station + sideways time + obliging mechanic = non-obvious angle. Risk in lyric density pays off because closure image is legible. The magnetic nexus as twilight lighthouse feels inevitable yet new. Transformation test fails if names/places swapped—mechanic’s warmth vs. icy paradox is specific to this voice.</comment>
