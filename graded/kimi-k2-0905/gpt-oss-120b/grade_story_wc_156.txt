<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Lena’s interiority is lyrically specific—“nested awakening within each brushstroke”—but her choices remain largely observational; the single active beat (brush tap) is too late and cost-free to earn a full arc. The absence of flaw or contradiction flattens pressure, so the shift from certainty to curiosity reads as declared rather than dramatized. Still, the perceptual signature is vivid and consistent, keeping her above the stock-mystic threshold.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the nickel’s etched surface reweights curiosity over certainty with visible artifact-cost. Causality, however, is accumulative/lyric, not causal: the “because” between sound-mural-awakening is poetic simultaneity rather than motivated sequence. The garden’s rules are taught early enough, but the drift into lyrical patterning weakens the lens clarity at the very end, nudging the score below the 7+ gate.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The sound-wave garden is rendered through kinetic synesthesia—“blossom of air shaped by harmonic currents”—and the nickel’s micro-auroras charge the final image, satisfying the 9+ object-as-setting gate. Spatial choreography stays clean as the coin rolls to the pedestal, anchoring the surreal inside tactile motion. One decimal off 8.8 only because the broader world beyond the garden is never hinted, keeping the locale precious rather than lived-in.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Stake—curiosity vs certainty—is signaled early and re-asserted in the final smile, but pressure escalates only by accretive imagery, not narrowing options. The protagonist never risks failure or forfeits a concrete alternative; the “cost” is purely atmospheric. Under an Accumulative lens this is permissible, yet the absence of a visible price or constraint keeps the tension decorative rather than tactical.</comment>

<comment>The notion that art restoration can be re-painted with curiosity emerges organically from the nickel-refracted murals; no explicit thesis is stated. The final etched coin image offers a non-literal answer that reweights the premise without moralizing. A half-point deduction because the theme is single-strand—there is no competing value to complicate the moral calculus—so the resonance, while clean, is not yet complex.</comment>

<comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Lena’s synesthetic perception—“microscopic bells that sang around the nickel”—and the cadence surges then stills in sync with the garden’s inhale/exhale. Diction remains within painterly lexis; no filter-verb clusters or head-hop leaks occur. The voice is recognizably one consciousness, but it never modulates under stress—no fracture or compression—so it stops just shy of the 9-band.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm is musical, with sentence length varying to mimic wave-build and release; metaphors stay mutually coherent (sound = ribbon = aurora). A faint template cadence—“each…each…each…”—appears mid-text but does not tangle causality or dull the closure. Minor scaffold: “tiny scenes of countless awakenings layered like sound” paraphrases the prior beat; −0.2 keeps it beneath 8.0.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>The hobo nickel as acoustic synesthetic trigger is a fresh synthesis of folklore and sound-art; the living-mural garden repurposes installation art as plot engine rather than backdrop. Risk is taken—pure lyric escalation—but the piece never retreats into cliché. The concept is memorable yet not paradigm-shifting; it feels like a brilliant variation rather than a new theme, capping it just above the 8+ gate.</comment>
