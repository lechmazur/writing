<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>The calligrapher’s refusal to write the loyalty proclamation and her subsequent decision to piece together the map are both concrete, motivated choices that visibly cost her (the plate’s graying, the risky descent). Interiority stays sensuous—“ink shimmered like sunrise on metal”—rather than diagnostic. A second beat of internally contradictory emotion would have lifted this into the 9-band; the moment she uncorks the first bottle is affectively flat, not layered with fear or guilt. Still, her through-line of “candor in small moments” drives every tactical move, fulfilling the 9+ quick test.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the final whispered truth reconfigures both sky and social fabric, cost paid in the same sentence the vent surges. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—each re-reading adds density until the cadence shift of the healed sky—and the pattern is taught early via the fragment’s color changes. Orientation is anchored by line 4 (“After the oasis dried…”) well inside the 120-word window. Only a hairline slip keeps this from 9+: the conduit-to-sky beat is a single leap, not strictly prepared, so the causality is slightly lucky rather than earned.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Greenhouse glass, crystal cavern, and the postal plate all constrain tactical choices (she must speak truth to keep the fragment lit; she must enter the cavern to retrieve lost voices). The toxic sky is not just backdrop—it actively tightens lungs and forces the final vent act. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true—she notices ink shimmer and vine scent before civic slogans. Spatial choreography holds: the workshop, hidden doorway, vent exit track cleanly without impossible geography.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—“truth vs. societal dishonesty”—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens exactly once when the council demand arrives. The plate’s graying makes the cost visceral, but the escalation is singular; no second reversal tests her commitment deeper. Agency is present (she descends, whispers), yet the final conduit image feels slightly convenient rather than a forced narrowing of options. Sufficient for the 600-word frame, but another mid-story trade-off would have nudged this into 8.5+ territory.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges entirely through images—plate color, bottled voices, unfurling vines—never once named as “truth.” Final image of the sky healing reweights every prior “small moment” without moralizing. Subtext in the bottled conversations (price and hope) lets the reader feel civic despair without exposition. A hairline deduction for the quasi-allegorical convenience of the sky-vent, but the emotional aftereffect is undeniable.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to the calligrapher; no head-hop. Diction—“vaulted hall of parchment, vines, and a lone zinc-etched postal plate fragment”—is lush yet syntactically controlled, mirroring her artisanal eye. Rhythm accelerates naturally at the tunnel ascent, short sentences matching breath under toxic air. No dialogue to judge; internal monologue avoids filter verbs.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops, no mixed metaphors, high density: “the wind carried the taste of rust” does image double-duty (weather + decay). Each sentence either advances discovery or tightens atmosphere. Figurative language peaks only once, at the sky-vent beat, and the pattern has been ear-trained by earlier fragment glows, so the heightened metaphor feels earned. Opening and closing lines are crystalline, anchoring voice and resonance respectively.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fusing calligraphy, bottled lost speech, and a truth-powered postal relic is a fresh synthesis; the greenhouse city under toxic sky re-energizes eco-dystopia without exposition dumps. Conceptual integrity holds: every world rule (plate reacts to lies, vent reacts to truths) is demonstrated in-scene before the climax relies on it. Risk is moderate—lyric eco-fantasy is busy territory—but specificity of craft detail and the earned stasis ending keep it from feeling gimmicky.</comment>
