<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is lyrically sustained—her grip on the star-stamped ticket registers as pulse, not symbol—but the “unused courage” motive is stated more than dramatized until the cave moment. The ferry guides remain scenic chorus; their silver eyes never harden into choice or risk, so relationship-pressure is absent. Earned stasis is implied yet the cost (what she forfeits by leaving) stays off-page. Voice is coherent and emotionally particular; still, the climax leans on abstract map-tracing rather than a contradictory micro-choice that forces loss.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the ticket punch clicks open the chest, re-weighting earlier motifs into a visible conceptual re-pricing—“courage, unused, lay dormant.” Accumulative/textural lens holds: each indirect curl of the ferry deposits another image-layer until the final sunrise reconfigures the stakes. Causality is lyric rather than tight—why the cave opens now, or why Mira alone may enter, is quietly finessed—but the pattern is taught early and paid off. Cost is felt in the “weight of trust” line; absence of a sharper external price keeps the score shy of 8.8.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Sea-mist, pebble pier, and lantern weave a hush that is both spatial and sonic; the shoreline lullaby is heard as texture, not soundtrack. Micro-setting (ticket punch in palm, surf-sucked leash) substitutes for wide geography without ever floating the scene. Weather and tide act—moon-shy turning, sunrise gilding—but do not constrain tactical choice. The veiled ridgeway remains evocative more than obstacle; stronger physical impediment would have lifted the 9-gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reclaiming dormant courage—signals early and tightens only imagistically; no live option is foreclosed until she steps into the cave. Escalation is accumulative: each inlet deviation adds lyric density rather than narrowing practical choices. Visible price is present yet mild—she gives up the dog-leash tether and accepts an undefined future. The pattern is coherent under Accumulative lens; a single moment where refusal carried palpable loss would have pushed 8+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges as the re-pricing of courage from heroic virtue to seed-like latency—an insight earned through tactile map, not maxim. Subtext is carried by object handling: ticket click, chest glow, sunrise brush. No explanatory sentence moralizes; final whispered gratitude lets image speak. The concept stays modest and coherent, resisting grand pronouncements, hence strong resonance without 9-level surprise.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person lyric achieves a consistent lull-cadence; syntax lengthens and softens like tidal breath, mirroring Mira’s coastal ear. Perceptual signature is sharp—she hears rope fray “fall into surf,” feels star stamp as pulse—without filter-verb glut. No dialogue appears, so voice purity is unbroken. Psychic distance hovers at dreamy mid-range; a single zoom to bodily panic or elation could have crowned 9.</comment>

<comment>Read-aloud rhythm is purposeful: clause-layered sentences swell then ebb, matching mist-rolls. Figurative density is high but patterned early—“dreaming clouds,” “heartbeat lighthouse”—so it reads as texture, not purple overload. No loops, scaffold, or synonym churn detected; each image advances mood or motif. Occasional elevated diction (“conceptual re-pricing”) sits slightly above Mira’s fisher lexicon, a hairline slip that keeps 9 at bay.</comment>

<comment>Ferry-to-cave quest for inner courage is familiar arc; freshness lies in the accumulative shoreline lullaby structure and star-stamp ticket as literal key.Transformation is present: the ridgeway is not a maze but a melodic sequence of coves, turning geography into music. Yet core emotional engine—loss of dog-as-leash—could transplant to any coastal girl without altering beats.Risk is lyrical rather than structural; hence mid-7 originality holds.</comment>
