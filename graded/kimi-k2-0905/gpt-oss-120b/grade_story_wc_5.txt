<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The alchemist’s interiority is vivid—her trembling hands, the pulse in her ears, the glacier-pace of her fingers—yet the “heartbeat-into-map” motive stays lyrically asserted rather than dramatized as a hard choice under pressure. No contradictory impulse is staged in-scene; the risk she bears is cosmic-poetic, not personal or social, so the promised covenant feels abstract despite lush embodiment. Still, the final smile and inhaled orchard give a credible renunciation: she will return forever, paying with seasonal labor. That Earned Stasis lands cleanly and justifies the elevated score.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single-scene, single-POV, accumulative design: each spiral placement adds density until the flare crystallizes a Charged Poise—starlight maps that will guide “wandering souls.” Cost is legible in the closing covenant of endless tending; the orchard’s future inhale reweights the prior stillness. Orientation is anchored within 30 words; no lens ambiguity. The piece teaches its lyric pattern early and pays it off with the final snowfall image, satisfying the Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Subarctic crater orchard is more than backdrop: the frost-kissed roots force slow motion, the ash mound supplies contrast for copper flare, dead branches become the parchment onto which light-veins are drawn. Every discarded shard’s position is tactile, spatial, and consequential—glass, wire, vellum are placed, not catalogued. Weather (the night’s held breath) functions as shared suspense with the world outside. Micro-setting = plate and ash pile—constrain her exact gestures and timing; the final inhale/exhale of trees recharges the initial frozen stillness.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake: can she bind starlight into a living map without losing it—or herself? Pressure escalates through each placement beat; the harmless sunrise flare is the visible tightening that forecloses failure—if the light scatters, the covenant dies. No outside antagonist needed; the conflict is patience vs. entropy, rendered as physical craft. The price is lifelong service, shown in the closing promise; cost is conceptual but undeniable, meeting the 8-band threshold.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the conceit: maps of feeling, not roads. Subtext lives in gesture—spiral pattern = pulse, lighthouse shards = guidance for the unseen—never sermonized. Final image of snowfall-as-promise reweights earlier “moving stillness” without moralizing; ambiguity lingers: who will dare listen? The orchard’s inhale affirms her craft yet hints at future solitude. No echoic thesis line; resonance is imagistic and earned.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person lyric, distance held close to sensory surface; perceptual signature is glacier-slow motion, starlight dust, breath-sync. Syntax elongates then compresses—“flash-paper between her palms flared”—mirroring tension-release. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk zero; diction stays within alchemist’s poetic lexicon. Compression and elision (“years collecting”) are taught early and paid off, maintaining legibility under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Lyric density is high yet purposeful; no mixed metaphors or template cadence. Each sentence layers job: “Each discarded shard she arranged in spirals, mimicking the pulse of a heart” = action, metaphor, stakes. Opens with anchoring concrete triad: who/where/when. Final line “awaiting the next heartbeat to map” supplies resonant cadence without overwriting. Minor scaffolding—“she felt” filter appears twice—drops score from 9.0.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Starlight cartography via trash-spirals is a fresh synthesis; the flash-paper alchemist archetype is invented, not borrowed. Risky lyric stagnation is embraced yet counterbalanced by tactile craft beats, avoiding prettiness for its own sake. Transformation test fails if relocated—crater cold, discarded junk, and flash-paper chemistry are inseparable. Final snowfall reprise feels inevitable in hindsight, a quiet reconfiguration rather than twist. Bold stillness-as-action choice elevates stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
