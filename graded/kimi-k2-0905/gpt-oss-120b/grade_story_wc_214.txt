<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The janitor’s interiority is lush—contradictory impulses swirl around loss, caretaking, cosmic scale—but no on-page micro-choice actually alters his tactics or forecloses a path. Empathy is asserted, not dramatized as a costly decision. Closure is a lyrical stasis, not an earned renunciation with visible price. For 700 words this is still compelling, yet the missing visible cost caps the arc below excellence.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each traced star adds density, the lantern’s glow reweights meaning until the final ribbon binds sky and stone. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Charged Poise in the amber wash—cost is felt as “dawn arrived within,” a conceptual but undeniable shift. Orientation is clear by line 4; no causality breaks. One soft spot: the ground tremor response is told, not shown, blunting the decisive beat by a hair.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Weathered stone, copper tubes, and cracked floor function as micro-setting that literally reflects star-stories; the lantern acts as portable environment that constrains every move. Sensory hierarchy is janitor-centric—hums, cracks, phosphorescent pulse—never tourist-catalog. Spatial choreography is clean; no white-room syndrome. Final amber wash across cracks is the image that recharges prior motif, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is the necessity to honor fallen stars through compassionate witness; pressure accumulates with each traced trajectory. No external antagonist, but the cosmos’ indifference tightens via stillness. One meaningful deepening: the tremor response crystallizes vulnerability-turned-strength. Cost is conceptual—internal dawn—visible in the final ribbon, sufficient for this length and lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of flourishing stillness emerges from concrete pattern—silent station, lantern glow, cracked floor—never sermonized. Final image reweights silence as fertile ground, achieving Conceptual Repricing without moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture: fingertip arcs, ribbon curl. Ambiguity lingers—strength is quiet, not triumphant—avoiding tidy closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person lyric achieves a distinct rhythmic signature: stacked clauses, pulse-like commas, amber repetitions that mimic lantern flicker. Perceptual signature is janitor-bound—ancient algorithms whisper, bedrock feels pulse—never committee voice. Filter verbs are voice-motivated (“sensed,” “felt”) and paid off in final chord. No head-hopping; distance remains steady. One hairline slip: “spiritually curious mind” drifts toward diagnostic label, but is instantly re-embodied in lantern use.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm is deliberate and hypnotic; sentence variety supports the accumulative arc. Figurative language is patterned—star/death/light cycles—never crowding a single beat. No synonym churn or template cadence. One mixed metaphor (“polished by invisible hands”) is minor and does not touch closure. Information density is high; every clause advances texture or stakes.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Cosmos-as-janitorial premise is fresh, but “lonely star-custodian with magic lantern” leans on familiar lyric-fantasy tropes. Specificity of ancient algorithms and cracked-floor star-maps provides transformative detail, resisting generic swap. Final reconfiguration of stillness into strength is non-obvious in hindsight. Risk level is moderate; concept could push further into existential stakes.</comment>
