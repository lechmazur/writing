<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The philanthropist’s contradictory impulses—profit-driven drought-maker vs. secret sentimental preservationist—are dramatized in the single decisive act of releasing the egg. His micro-choice (wire-touch, quartz sigh, egg fracture) externalizes the internal split with visible cost: the thunder-lullWindow = 0, so the act is irreversible and self-implicating. The tear of “sand and redemption” at the end embodies the contradiction without tidy resolution, satisfying Earned Stasis. No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible n/a; headcount default met.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the salt-flat amplifier captures the extinct wing-beat echo, reconfiguring the philanthropist’s cruelty into a lasting spectral artwork. Causal chain holds: engineered drought → cracked map → brine amplifier → egg release → preserved echo; each step tightens options. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) delivered by line 3: “stood alone on the cracked salt flat as the sky bruised...” Cost is legible in the final image—he walks away having seeded an immortal guilt/artifact. No lens ambiguity; pattern is taught early and paid off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The salt flat is not backdrop but instrument: its acoustic property (brine amplifier) directly enables the climax, satisfying 9+ gate. Micro-setting object—the quartz case—functions as extension of setting, constraining handling of the egg until the precise resonant moment. Sensory hierarchy is POV-filtered: philanthropist notices “lattice of white fissures” as map, not tourist catalog. Spatial choreography is clean: boots vanish, egg lowered, vibration spirals upward—no impossible positions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled in paragraph 1: preserve extinct voice via manufactured drought. One meaningful tightening occurs when the thunder lull creates a one-shot window; failure = lost echo forever. Agency is present: his hand releases the egg, not luck. Cost is conceptual but undeniable: the same drought that killed the species becomes the resonant stage that preserves its ghost—moral burden crystallizes without soft reset.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: engineered annihilation can coincidentally birth immortal memory—no authorial thesis stated. Subtext resides in the salt flat’s double role: graveyard and transmitter. Final image of “broken glass that somehow felt whole” reweights prior cruelty into uneasy grace. No final-paragraph moralizing; tear tastes of sand, not sermon.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lush, cadenced third-person limited stays inside philanthropist’s perceptual bias: he reads cracks as map, tastes tear as sand. No head-hopping; distance stable. Syntax mirrors emotional plateau—long lyrical sentences until egg fracture, then shorter clauses (“fractured grace”). No filter-verb stacks; metaphors (“sky bruised”, “unfinished map”) remain consistent with POV’s educated aesthetic. Dialogue absent, so no voice contamination.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>High information density: each sentence layers drought-engineering, map-reading, egg-casing, acoustic lore without scaffold. Rhythm breathes with beats—thunder lull = syntactic pause before wire-click. No paraphrase loops; “cracked” repeats only twice and gains new charge. Metaphors stay physically coherent (glass → salt sheet) and do not muddle closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Synthesis feels inevitable: drought-as-amp + extinct-egg-as-voice + salt-as-storage creates a conceptually fresh eco-haunt. Risk-taking (lyric accumulative structure, no antagonist, no dialogue) heightens resonance without obscuring clarity. Transformation test fails—swap egg for seed or coin and the entire acoustic logic collapses. No stock tropes; philanthropist is neither mad scientist nor redeemed sinner but both in one breath.</comment>
