<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elara’s “logically emotional” trait is announced early and surfaces in the copper-drum adjustment, but the interior contradiction is told rather than embodied; we get labels (“wrestled with the paradox”) instead of moment-by-moment friction. The final tear is earned, yet the arc is more competent than perilous—no visible mistake compounds—so the cost feels moderate.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the vault opens, the artifact is secured, and the lighthouse beam crystallizes a Resonant Reconfiguration with felt custodial cost. Causal links hold (432 Hz × amplitude → lock sings), but the middle contains mild telescoping: three beats of “set-up drum → strike once → success” compress tension rather than tighten options.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Drift-ice marina is vivid and specific—cracked timber, copper coils, floes humming back—yet only the copper cradle finally constrains choice; the larger ice scape stays atmospheric. Sensory hierarchy reflects Elara’s engineer gaze, and spatial tracking is clean; still, environment never seriously jeopardizes the plan, so pressure remains decorative.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Stakes (“protect from weaponization”) are declared early and repeated, but the only on-page obstacle is the lock’s frequency puzzle, solved on the first attempt; no active seeker appears, so escalation is intellectual, not adversarial. Tightening exists—must match heartbeat to key—but the cost is time-and-sweat, not a foreclosed option.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of redemptive sound versus analytical control emerges through action (spectrometer + copper drum) without sermon. Final image of beam merging with crystal hum reweights earlier motifs, yet the absolution delivered to Elara feels solitary; world-scale grief remains abstract, yielding a pleasing but not haunting resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays anchored in Elara’s perceptual filter—storm-tossed coat, tide sigh, tool heft—syntax waxes and wanes with sonic subject. No head-hop, no register drift; free-indirect discipline is solid. Voice is distinctive enough to carry the piece, though a few adjective stacks (“fleshly ethereal glow”) flirt with purple.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose is musical—varied rhythm, strong verbs—but figurative density clusters heavily in every sentence of the climax, slightly muffling causal beats. One paraphrase loop (“the sea’s sigh now a lullaby of redemption” echoing earlier “tide’s own sigh”) and occasional template cadence (“she… she… she…”) keep it from top-tier compression.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Sonic absolution via vibrational lock is a fresh fusion of hard-SF gadgetry with lyrical redemption; trope feels non-obvious and internally consistent. Risk level is moderate—no structural gymnastics—but specificity of 432 Hz calibration and copper-coil drum transmute cliché lighthouse tale into memorable artifact-guardian vignette.</comment>
