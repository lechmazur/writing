<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The prophet’s precognitive amnesia is embodied in every line—he forgets tomorrow while carving driftwood runes. Interior contradiction pulses: clinging to echoes while accepting forgetting as tide. Micro-choices (chalk pressed to monolith, dust spread at dawn) externalize the internal arc. Endurance closure costs him the very future he seeks to record—felt, irreversible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: repetitive cadence of mist, tide, echo thickens until chalk line reweights aging itself. Closure lands as Charged Poise—chalk dust on slab makes the sound of growing older undeniable. Cost is legible: he forfeits the memory he tried to trap. Pattern taught early (“precognitively forgetful”) pays off in final dispersal.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fog garden is not backdrop but living medium—mist exhales, shifts, accepts chalk inscription. Driftwood markers and rusted tire double as micro-setting that steers steps. Environment literally supports the final act: fog holds the chalk line, slab warms under sunrise to release the recorded hum. Spatial choreography survives despite lyric compression; no impossible moves.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—capture aging’s sound—announced early. Pressure escalates texturally: each driftwood arrow, each forgotten vision tightens the loop of loss. Chalk-to-monolith moment deepens the stake by making forgetting audible. Cost is the sound itself—once recorded, it keeps eroding him; tactics altered by the need to externalize before total amnesia.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: chalk as ephemeral archive, fog as memory-storage that refuses permanence. Final image reweights premise—dispersed dust is not defeat but necessary release. Subtext in gesture: pressing chalk to stone is an embrace of impermanence. Avoids moralizing; resonance floats like the horn of a ghost ship—heard, not explained.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Voice is prophet-colored: syntactic tide, salt-cracked diction, cyclic anaphora mimic forgetting. No head-hop; single POV holds. Perceptual signature—“half-remembered songs,” “vinyl grinding to stop”—remains distinct under pressure. Rhythm accelerates toward chalk contact, then exhales with dawn light; modulation tracks emotional arc without losing coherence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Lyric density is purposeful; metaphors (sea-foam breath, ghost-ship horn) stay within fog-tide logic. Occasional modifier stacks (“mist-laden paths,” “translucent monolith”) flirt with overwrite but serve atmosphere. No paraphrase loops; each image advances texture. Final two sentences crystallize without clutter—ear-test passes.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: junkyard mystic + precognitive amnesia turns standard elegy into active archaeology of forgetting. Driftwood runes as memory-GPS feels inevitable yet new. Risk in lyric accumulative structure heightens coherence rather than gimmick. Could swap fog garden for any misty venue, but prophet’s paradox is irreplaceable.</comment>
