<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Selene’s interior contradiction—coveting prophecy yet fearing its paralysis—remains alive in every beat: she kneels to the tide even as she calculates Fibonacci spirals. Her embodied awe (“skin shimmering with wet kelp”) and micro-choice to lay the final red stone externalize the stakes. The precognitive curse turns from prison to compass in a single, legible pivot. Cost is present—the flame drifts away, leaving her alone with perpetual foresight—but the endurance beat is slightly abstract; a more visceral sacrifice would lift this into the 8-band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the violet flame maps the rocks, the tide listens, and Selene’s stance is re-configured—prophecy becomes tool rather than trap. Causality is lyric-accumulative rather than strict because/therefore; the pattern of stones-dust-flame is taught early and pays off with undeniable conceptual cost. Orientation is anchored by line 3 and held. A slightly stronger material cost (burnt fingers, cracked stone) would sharpen the “felt” prong and nudge this toward 8-plus.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Black basalt, violet aurora, salt-air, and receding tidal pools are filtered through Selene’s kelp-sheened senses; each sensory pick is urgent and never touristic. The Fibonacci stones function as micro-setting that literally steers the cosmic dust, satisfying the 9-plus gate. Spatial choreography is flawless: tide-edge, rock-ledges, flame-path trace a legible arc. The only restraint from 9 is that the environment does not physically push back (cold, wind, slipperiness) to tax her body further.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—can intentional pattern rewrite an already-seen future?—is signaled in the first 80 words and tightens through the stone sequence. The deepening occurs when the flame follows her math: possibility is literally ignited, foreclosing the fatalism she arrived with. Cost is conceptual rather than corporeal; the dust-flame drifts seaward, seeding other bluffs, so her personal loss is implicit (perpetual vigilance). A more tangible price—blood on basalt, vision blackout—would punch escalation into the 8-band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges as the human hunger for agency inside an indifferent cosmos; no character lectures us—meaning accrues through stone-math, tide-breath, and flame-map. The final image answers the central question non-literally: cosmos-rhythm is not fixed, but it demands endless conduit-ship from the seer. Ambiguity is productive—does the flame seed hope or merely disperse her burden? Subtext in gesture (kneeling, whispering to sky) avoids profundity clichés. One stray “lingering promise” echo near the end keeps it from 8.5.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Selene’s perceptual filter: “salt and ancient fire,” “mathematical sequences,” “cosmos’s hidden rhythm” all belong to an eel herder who thinks in tide-tables. Rhythm swells and subsides like waves—long sentences for aurora awe, clipped fragments (“She knelt”) under peak pressure. No head-hopping; cosmic vocabulary is earned by her calling. The repeated anaphora “the…” in the last third edges toward litany, slightly diluting vocal edge; otherwise voice is distinct and intact.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet breathable: “violet ribbons of aurora painted the night sky” packs sight and motion in one stroke. Metaphors stay coherent (dust = powdered iron, flame = second sunrise) and never clash. Scaffolding is minimal—only two instances of “the tide… the tide…” that drum mildly. Information dual-loads throughout: “She placed the final stone, bright red” simultaneously marks sequence apex and color code. A single mixed image—“promise settle like a mantle upon her shoulders”—slips toward cliché, preventing 8.5+.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fusing eel-herding, supernova dust, and Fibonacci stone-casting on a basalt bluff under aurora is boldly idiosyncratic; risk is high yet coherence never cracks. The precognitive curse repurposed as navigational compass feels inevitable in hindsight. No recognizable template or pop-culture echo. Conceptual integrity is absolute—the story commits to cosmic math and tide lore without hedging. The synthesis is specific enough that swapping any ingredient would collapse the whole.</comment>
