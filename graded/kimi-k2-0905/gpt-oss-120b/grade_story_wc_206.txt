<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Alder’s interiority stays concrete—his tactile, rhythmic mending and the amber glow threading through the rust give embodied emotion. Yet the promised flaw (tendency toward passivity) never surfaces; the covenant tests his honesty only in abstract, so the Earned Stasis feels inherited rather than individually paid. The “reclaim the light” motive is signaled early but does not visibly clash with other wants, so the hierarchy of values stays flat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens is taught by patterned sound motifs and holds to closure: density of rust, brass, ticking increases until the lattice brightens. One meaningful deepening occurs when the chip’s silver threads visibly re-price the covenant’s meaning on-page. Cost is legible in the final “soft sigh” and the tower’s new audible hum, but the mayor’s early exposition of the honesty rule is never tested in scene, so the change feels narratively rather than causally earned.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Micro-setting—the resonance chamber’s iron vines and gear teeth—functions as both obstacle and tool, constraining every micro-alignment Alder makes. Fog, dusk, and cobblestone lanterns are sketched economically; spatial choreography of Alder circling the gear tracks cleanly. The amber lattice in the final image reweights the covenant and is inseparable from the re-lit town, qualifying for 9+ gate, but the world rule that “truth is a fragile filament” is asserted not dramatized, so the environment does not fully charge the closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preventing the town’s sonic drowning—remains abstract; no on-page consequence of failure (cracking walls, fleeing villagers) is shown, so pressure stays intellectual. Escalation arrives as density of description rather than narrowing options; the only live narrowing is the off-stage ticking toward midnight, which Alder cannot hasten or delay. Visible price is limited to the chip’s glow; the townsfolk’s relief is reported, not felt, keeping cost conceptual.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme of truth-tempered renewal emerges through rust-to-lattice imagery rather than authorial statement. The covenant’s wilting near dishonesty is asserted but never dramatized, so the thematic question stalls at abstraction. The final amber lattice re-weights prior rust imagery, offering quiet resonance, yet the absence of a tested lie leaves ambiguity toothless.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays fixed on Alder; perceptual signature is tactile-musical—“tinkersong,” “low brass tones,” “lullaby that mirrored the ticking of sunrise.” Syntax modulates from long breathing sentences to staccato micro-alignments under rising pressure. No dialogue appears; narrative diction stays within Alder’s craft lexicon without register drift. The only POV modesty lapse is the omniscient tag “legend whispered,” quickly corrected by in-scene perception.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet rhythmic; figurative chains (rust-garden, iron-vines) remain consistent with metallurgic logic. No paraphrase loops or scaffold sentences; each sentence advances texture or action. Occasional elevated diction—“resonant pulse,” “conceptual repricing”—fits the mythic register taught early. The final lattice image is crisp, but “tinkersong wonder” recurs four times without new inflection, a minor cadence artifact that keeps the score below 9.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>The “covenant of rust” fuses metallurgy, music, and moral physics into a fresh angle on the humble repairman tale. Specificity of gear-tooth alignment and amber-thread binding prevents the concept from feeling abstract. Risk is taken in lyric accumulative structure, but payoff is quiet; the story retreats from testing its own honesty rule, muting conceptual payoff. While imaginative, the core tension could transfer to another decay-prone craft without structural loss, limiting inevitability.</comment>
