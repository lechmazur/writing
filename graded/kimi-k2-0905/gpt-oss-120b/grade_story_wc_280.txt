<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The ghost’s yearning is palpable, yet his interiority stays abstract—colors hum but the ache stays lyrically generic. His single decisive act—singing under the orchard—earns the closure bridge, but we are told, not shown, how the echo-method alters his essence. No contradictory impulse complicates the ascent; he glides from despair to transcendence without micro-choices that cost him anything on the page. The shopkeeper enters as a vessel, not a crucible, so status/relationship pressure is absent.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: the orchard’s synesthetic density reweights the ghost’s stale applause into living promise. Orientation is swift—twilight theater, backstage, cracked floorboard—within 60 words. Causality is soft: why the coin activates only under apple-scented song is asserted, not motivated; the orchard’s appearance is pure invitation. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the apples fall in luminous chime, the timeline re-brightens, the ghost releases the echo—cost is felt in the audible hush that follows.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The velvet curtains, copper coin, and lantern-apples are tactile, selective, and POV-filtered through the ghost’s synesthetic ears/eyes. Spatial choreography remains airy—no fixed distances—but the translucent stage under the canopy functions as micro-setting that charges the final image. Weather is the rising nostalgia itself, a scent-temperature that modulates with each chord. Environment does not constrain tactics, so 8.8 gate is not cleared.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>One dominant stake—mend the fractured timeline through echo-performance—is signaled early and never diluted. Escalation is lyrical, not causal: density of color-sound thickens until apples burst into notes; options narrow only in the sense that the ghost must surrender the last echo. The shopkeeper’s wish supplies the external hinge, but agency remains the ghost’s release of song. Price is atmospheric—his essence diffuses into the orchard’s hum—felt but not tangibly lost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges cleanly: abandoned artistry can seed future possibility if offered as gift. The coin’s shift from Tower to sunrise image reconfigures meaning without verbal moralizing. Subtext resides in scent and chime, not exposition. The final apple-fall reprises curtain-call applause, letting readers reprice “closed” as prelude.</question>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited ghost POV sustains synesthetic perceptual signature—colors hum, violin sighs, cinnamon thickens—without filter-verb clutter. Syntax swells into long breathless phrases during the song, then relaxes into single chiming falls, mirroring emotional arc. No dialogue, so no register clash; narration stays inside plausible ghost lexicon of theater and hue. Compressed lyric elision is taught early (“synesthetically blessed”) and paid off in the color-rippled sky.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is thickly figurative yet never loops; each metaphor advances atmosphere or stakes. No synonym churn or template cadence detected. Mixed metaphors are intentional (“rusted brass and liquid violet”) and coherent within synesthetic rule-set. Minor scaffold: “the orchard answered” anthropomorphizes without set-up, but the figural slip is brief and does not touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fusing tarot, synesthetic ghost, and post-closing orchard into a lyric timeline-mending ritual feels fresh, yet the core move—artist sacrifices self to inspire stranger—recycles familiar template. Specificity of hand-painted coin and apple-notes keeps it from abstraction. Risky compression succeeds: 700-word single-movement crescendo without exposition dump. Fresh enough for publication, not yet paradigm-bending.</comment>
