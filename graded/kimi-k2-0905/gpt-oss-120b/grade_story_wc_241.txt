<question>1</question>
<grade>6.2</grade>
<comment>Mara’s inheritance of gambling compulsion collides with her academic rigor in scene-embedded micro-choices—placing the coin, tracing the 7:11 ratio—so the interior contradiction is live. Yet the mother’s death is summarized rather than felt in body or choice, blunting the promised emotional cost. Still, the final ledger entry shows credible renunciation with visible price, satisfying the 600-word closure bar.</comment>

<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Causal chain holds: coin-click therefore stairwell therefore fluorescent map therefore ledger rewrite. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—the new theorem reweights her life-rules with undeniable epistemic cost. Mid-text orientation drags slightly—library geography vs. subway level blur until the phosphorescent map teaches the rule—but the final image repairs the blur, so waiver applies.</comment>

<grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>The candle-lantern’s mica pane doubles as micro-setting: its prism refraction literally steers her path when “flame kisses mica,” translating abstract probability into bodily move. Rain-washed library smell of “old paper and distant thunder” is selective and POV-biased, anchoring without catalogue. Subway tunnels inherit the library’s paper scent, maintaining sensory continuity across shards.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—can probability theory embrace true chance?—is signaled early and tightened when the subway map forces her to walk random intersections that mirror ½^i series. One visible cost: the sputtering flame at exit signals finite life, foreclosing infinite gambles. Escalation is single but sufficient for length; coincidence (seat clicks) complicates rather than rescues.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically from the equation on the seat: the sum of diminishing halves equals unity, imaging her need to integrate loss (mother) and risk (gamble). No moralizing—final theorem is an action, not statement. Clover melancholy tone recurs in caretaker’s hum and rain residue, reweighting at closure when lantern gutters against ledger—quiet answer larger than plot.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person POV clings tightly to Mara’s perceptual filter: she notices odds, ratios, lantern refractions, not décor. Syntax flexes with stress—sentence fragments when stairwell opens, then calms for theorem drafting. No head-hops; diction stays within a mathematician’s lexicon without jargon dump. Voice cadence mirrors gamble breath: quickened when coin drops, lengthened at final stasis.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Strong density—each sentence layers sensory, symbolic, and causal work. Only minor scaffold: “the promise of new insight urged her onward” could be cut without loss. Metaphors stay consistent (books as veins, lantern as compass) and physically coherent. Read-aloud rhythm accelerates down tunnel then exhales at desk—sentence length modulation supports pressure without drumbeat repetition.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Fusion of gambling memoir with secret-subway myth feels fresh; probability equation as physical key is delightful literalization. The mother-death motive is familiar, but its integration with mathematical inheritance avoids stock grief arc. Risk taken: lyric compression over dramatized scene works because closure image reconfigures premise. Not fully transformative, but angle and detail resist genre cloning.</comment>
