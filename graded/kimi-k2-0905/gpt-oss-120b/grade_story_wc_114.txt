<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Mirela’s interiority is concrete—fever’s “auroral sorrow,” the swallowed stone—but the oracle’s “fault-tolerant” trait is asserted, not dramatized; no system fault tests her. The moment of smudging the ink is a visible micro-choice, yet her decision to adjust the barometer arrives as declarative summary without contradictory impulse or cost. Relationship/status crucible absent; solo POV. The arc—delirium → calibration → outward resolve—is credible but muted because the swallowed truth’s mass is told, not struggled against in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly under an Accumulative/Textural lens: the smudged illustration reweights meaning and the stone’s weight is conceptually repriced when the console number matches it—felt cost is legible. Structure is single-scene, single POV, within word count; orientation (who/where/when) is anchored by line 3. One meaningful deepening—humidity lines emerging from smudge—tightens the stake. No causal reversals, but pattern holds; minor slack: “she adjusted the station’s barometer by a fraction” is told, not shown, blunting the final beat’s causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Mountain station is tactile—“rusted panels,” “hiss of the old heater,” antennae swaying like vine stems—every sense filtered through Mirela’s post-fever attention. The botanical illustration acts as micro-setting: its margins physically constrain her action and charge the final image when inked veins glow. Weather and tool details (barometer needle, humidity gradient) directly enable the truth-measuring beat. Idiom consistent, no geography drift. Only 600-800 words, yet environment alters tactics and supplies the closure image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—externalize the swallowed truth—signaled early. Pressure escalates via accumulative density: fever memory → smudge → barometer micro-tweak → console number; each layer reweights the stone’s mass. No antagonist; tension is situational/coherent. Cost is conceptual (she will carry the weight outward) rather than visceral; visible price could be sharper. Single meaningful tightening sufficient for length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme—certainty’s brittleness and truth’s measurability—emerges through ink, humidity, and barometer rather than statement. Final image of glowing veins reconfigures the premise without moralizing. Subtext in silence: the heater’s “mournful sigh” mirrors internal sorrow. Invites reflection on knowledge systems that ignore peripheral data; avoids tidy takeaway.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person POV clings tightly to Mirela’s perceptual signature—“hesitant thoughts,” “thin veil of auroral sorrow.” Rhythm modulates: long lyrical clauses for fever aftermath, staccato fragments when needle trembles. No head-hopping; distance stable. Diction stays within her plausible lexicon; no filter-verb stacks. Syntax mirrors mental state without drumbeat monotony.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High information density: one sentence often layers sensory detail, metaphor, and plot advancement—“ink bled, faint lines of humidity and pressure emerged, echoing the station’s own pulse.” Mixed-metaphor risk—“brittle leaf” vs. “feather caught in a gale”—but internal logic holds. Minor scaffold: “the weight she sought seemed to lift” repeats the lifting conceit. Otherwise crisp, concrete verbs; no synonym churn. Closure image unobscured.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Fusing oracle-protocol language with post-fever lyricism feels fresh; “fault-tolerant oracle” could slide into gimmick but stays grounded via tactile console work. Botanical illustration as data sheet is specific, not quirky. Synthesis of meteorology and memory offers non-obvious angle on truth’s measurability. Risk taken with accumulative structure pays off in final reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>9 A</question><grade>3.8</question><grade>“Fault-tolerant” is label-only; no system fault occurs to test the trait. Her calibration choices are human, not algorithmic resilience. Setup present, no development or payoff under pressure.</question>
<question>9 B</question><grade>8.7</question><grade>Illustration seeded early, handled in two beats (smudge, fold-and-trace), returns in final glowing reprise that reweights the stone’s mass. Irreplaceable: only chlorophyll ink reveals humidity gradient.</question>
<question>9 C</question><grade>6.1</question><grade>“Swaying certainties” frames theme and recurs in antennae metaphor; concept shapes her refusal to treat truth as fixed, but does not alter tactical options—more tonal than causal.</question>
<question>9 D</question><grade>5.4</question><grade>“Peripherally aware” appears in oracle algorithms and humidity data; enables discovery of hidden lines, but no visible cost or tradeoff tied to the trait itself.</question>
<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</question><grade>Smudge is the pivotal action that reveals pressure/humidity lines and allows barometer tweak; without it, no data to match stone’s weight. Two beats, direct closure linkage.</question>
<question>9 F</question><grade>4.2</question><grade>“Occupying margins” is named only at smudge moment; mechanics (heat from hand) are clear but method does not recur or constrain later attempts. Single-use, late signal.</question>
<question>9 G</question><grade>7.0</question><grade>Station provides barometer, heater hiss, antenna sway—tools and ambience that enable truth-measurement beat. Without mountain air and console, climax fails. Present across beats.</question>
<question>9 H</question><grade>6.8</question><grade>“After fever breaks” is anchoring timestamp and emotional shift; fever’s end primes clarity, but no ticking clock or deadline pressures subsequent choices—more state than timer.</question>
<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</question><grade>Swallowed stone desire drives every action; friction appears in sorrow’s weight versus outward resolve. Cost is conceptual rather than dramatized in scene, so short of full 8+.</question>
<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</question><grade>“Auroral sorrow” tones opening/close; modulates from mournful heater-hiss to quiet resolve. Final aurora image recharges theme, but middle remains static rather than shifting with beats.</question>
