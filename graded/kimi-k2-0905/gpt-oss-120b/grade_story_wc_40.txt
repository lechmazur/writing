<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara’s quiet resolve is credibly grounded in her marginal-scholar backstory; the notebook micro-choices show a hierarchy of values. Yet her interior contradiction stays general—“weathered innocence” is asserted more than dramatized in body or gesture. The final offering is motivated, but the cost feels symbolic rather than viscerally forfeited. Still, the arc from reticence to resolve is legible and earned under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the folded page reweights the premise—dictionaries end, but living testimony persists. The crystal’s pattern is taught early and repaid in the final image; cost is the scholar’s acceptance of unprintable knowledge. Orientation is anchored by word 80 (“edge of the city… heavy doors”). One continuous scene, single POV, no causality breaks; escalation is textural density tightening rather than causal reversal, coherent with chosen lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Library, crystal, and dawn light are filtered through Mara’s scholar gaze; every sensory pick is purposive—must, marble, fractured beams—guiding her attention to the crystal. Spatial choreography is clean: table-center-crystal-notebook sequence tracks without drift. The crystal functions as micro-setting that constrains the final gesture; environment charges the closure image. No exposition dumps; detail economy is exemplary for 700-word scope.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—decode language growth—is signaled in paragraph 3 and deepens when the crystal’s memory-rings foreclose the option of ever capturing it in print. One meaningful textural tightening: scattered glints cohere into legible lattice, narrowing her possible actions to testimony-by-page. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral, but legible under Accumulative lens. No external antagonist needed; pressure is epistemic and sufficient for length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: the irreducibility of living language to fixed archives. Subtext resides in the crystal’s refusal to be catalogued—its sonic glow answers only to witness, not inscription. Final image of the folded page as “delicate prayer” reweights prior dictionary-death premise without moralizing. Ambiguity is purposeful: future readers may or may not hear the echo, leaving complexity intact.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person POV stays tight to Mara’s perceptual signature—selective attention to etymology, light spectra, marginalia. Syntax is lyrical yet controlled; cadence swells with dawn light then subsides as crystal dims, mirroring her resolve. No head-hopping; diction remains within scholar lexicon. Filter verbs are minimal and voice-motivated; rhythmic compression under peak light-crescendo is intentional and taught.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; sentence lengths contract around light-crescendo, then lengthen into quiet echo. Figurative language is selective—no mixed metaphors; “sonically reflective” is patterned early and paid off. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image, knowledge, or stakes. One minor filter cluster (“she realized… she could trace…”) but occurs pre-closure and does not dull final image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Premise—library crystal as living linguistic memory—is fresh yet grounded in material detail. Combines epistemic stake with lyric object without slipping into allegory. Risk of preciousness is averted by concrete notebook gestures and the conceptual cost of unprintability. Synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight; no close echoes of canonical scenes.</comment>
