<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The artist’s motive—rediscover lost joy—is declared repeatedly but never tested by contradiction or cost; she paints, the wall glows, people smile, end. No interior contradiction, no embodied emotion beyond “she smiled,” no micro-choice that risks anything. The fresco fragment glows, but she never hesitates, doubts, or sacrifices; the beat sequence is purely additive. Earned stasis fails because nothing is foreclosed—she simply walks on to the next wall.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Closure is a soft Charged Poise: the fragment dissolves into starlight while the orchard “breathes.” The cost is conceptual (she gives up the last relic) but not felt—no tactile beat of loss, no ripple in the network. Accumulative lens holds: each brushstroke layers luminosity until the fog thins. Yet the escalation is weightless; nothing narrows or breaks, so the reconfiguration feels decorative rather than decisive.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The fog-bound orchard is evoked with selective sensory strokes—mist-softened laughter, trees “trembling like chandeliers”—and the mural’s glow is made legible through reflected light on bark. Spatial anchors remain stable; the fragment’s placement at the “heart of the wall” tracks. Micro-setting qualifies: the glowing pigment on stone directly enables the final image. Only the late invocation of “starlight” drifts from the grounded orchard frame, keeping it under 8.8.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Stakes are declared—“share lost joy”—but never sharpened: no opposition, no dwindling paint, no doubting spectator, no ticking dusk. Pressure plateaus at “passersby stopped”; the mural grows, the fog lifts, but nothing is risked or foreclosed. A single meaningful tightening is required; instead we get iterative affirmation. The orchard’s rebirth is gifted, not earned through trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Theme—art as communal memory—emerges through the luminous mural and the shared laughter, but the text can’t resist spelling it out: “the true power…was not merely to illuminate walls, but to illuminate hearts.” That final-sentence sermon clips subtext. The fresco fragment’s dissolution offers a conceptual reprice, yet the absence of felt cost keeps the resonance polite rather than piercing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays tight to the artist’s perceptual filter: “photon-kissed pigment,” “fold of a daydream.” Syntax flexes with emotional swell—long breathless clauses during painting, then clipped cadence at twilight. No head-hop, no filter-verb clutter. Voice modulation is present but never breaks into idiosyncrasy that would justify 9+.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Prose is lush yet disciplined: each sentence layers light or fog without synonym churn. Occasional soft abstracts—“luminous optimism,” “pensive mirth”—slip in, but metaphor vehicles stay coherent. No loops or template cadence; paragraph cuts are clean. The final line’s imperative whisper edges toward poetic overstatement, keeping it shy of 8.0.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Painting-with-light in a fog-sealed ruin is fresh enough, but the narrative arc is a straight ascent: gloom → glow → collective smile. No inversion, no hidden cost, no twist on the trope. The knowledge-network idea flickers once and vanishes. Risk is decorative, not structural; the piece chooses the safe middle of its concept.</comment>
