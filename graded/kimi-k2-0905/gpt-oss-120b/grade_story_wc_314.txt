<grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Selene’s secret sentimentality is shown through her tactile handling of the crystal and the childhood firefly memory that surges at the payoff, giving her a credible interior contradiction. The motivations (harmonize logic/intuition, reach wonder) stay consistent and escalate to the final shard-kiss, but the prose occasionally tells her yearning in abstract labels (“coveted,” “sought the touch of wonder”) rather than dramatizing new micro-choices under each rising beat. Still, she tracks as an individual, her alchemist precision visible in how she arrays shards in a spiral mimicking starlings, and the ending renunciation—accepting awe over pure reason—carries visible emotional cost. No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible is N/A; headcount stays within scope.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the “quiet, everlasting sunrise” reweights the premise, sealing logic-intuition harmony with felt cost (she yields her scholarly detachment). Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens: each beat layers sensory density—crystal thaw, amber hiss, fresco reveal—until the final spiral and shard-kiss crystallize the new stance. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are taught by line 5 and never break; the orchard’s rules remain consistent. One meaningful tightening occurs when the crystal explodes, forcing her to gather shards and complete the spiral—no reversals needed for this length.</comment>

<comment>The kaleidoscopic waterfall and singing moss stones are sharply sensed and filter through Selene’s scholarly-wondering gaze; detail is selective, never touristic. Setting constrains her method: only here can dawn-thawed crystal shards catch starling rhythm and fit into the oak heart, making the orchard indispensable to the payoff. Spatial choreography stays coherent as she moves from stone circle to alcove to oak. Micro-setting (the spiral of shards on soil) literally charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—bind reason to reverence—signals early and deepens when each sensory layer (crystal hiss, fresco revelation, shard scatter) tightens the cost of failure: lifelong aloofness. Agency is cumulative-textural rather than causal-plot: she endures each intensifying image, then acts by arranging the spiral and kissing the shard, foreclosing pure rationalism. The price is visible—she tearlessly accepts sentimental awe, a stance shift with social cost for an alchemist. One escalation beat suffices for 700-word scope; coincidence plays no role.</comment>

<comment>Theme emerges organically: the integration of logic and awe is enacted, not sermonized, through the crystal-flame-starling chain. Subtext lives in gesture—her trembling finger on the shard edge concedes more than any interior monologue. Final image of the orchard breathing at sunrise offers a non-literal answer without moralizing. No thematic echo penalties; insight is earned through sensory particulars.</comment>

<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Selene with consistent perceptual signature: she notices algorithms in birdsong, alchemical hues in flame, childhood synapses in snow-like shards. Syntax swells and contracts with breath-rhythm, mirroring her mounting wonder without purple overload. No head-hopping; diction stays within her scholarly yet lyrical lexicon. Dialogue is absent, so voice evaluation is narrative-only—and succeeds.</comment>

<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm is musical, sentence openings varied; no template cadence or paraphrase loops detected. Figurative language is dense yet purposeful—each metaphor (phosphorescent snow, heartbeat flame) pays off in the final spiral. Information density high: one sentence often layers sensory data, emotional shift, and world rule. Copy-clean; no mixed metaphors or coherence breaks at closure.</comment>

<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: alchemy + murmuration + frozen dew as catalyst for inner harmonics feels non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Tropes of hidden glades and wise trees are re-inflected through precise scientific diction and the starling-algorithm conceit. Risk in lyric accumulative structure heightens resonance without obscuring clarity. Specific detail (sapphire smokeless flame, amber hiss) keeps the concept from drifting into generic wonder-story.</comment>
