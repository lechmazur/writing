<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Lira’s “quiet rebellion” is only label until the drumming begins; once she taps the crystal leaves the embodied emotion arrives and motives crystallise. The interior shift from passive defiance to deliberate conduit is legible, but the prior paragraphs lean on abstract emotional tags (“shared dream,” “longing they could not name”) rather than specific contradiction under pressure. The final endurance—continuing to drum softly after the cosmos exhales—earns a modest stasis with cost, yet the story summarises rather than dramatizes the staff’s protocol change, so the ultimate consequence is felt at second-hand.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Closure is a lyrical Earned Stasis: Lira keeps drumming, sorrow transmutes to quiet hope, and the garden’s pulse becomes the new protocol; the cost is the eternal vigil implied by “night after night.” Causality is soft-accumulative rather than tight because the institutional turn happens off-stage in a single clause, but the lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds: each beat thickens the ambient texture until meaning reweights. Orientation is clear by line 30, well inside the 120-word guardrail. The ending’s conceptual price—perpetual caretaking of collective grief—is legible even though the bureaucratic pivot is reported, not shown.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The sound-wave garden is never catalogued; instead, details (“crystal leaves,” “bronze stones,” “lily that pulsed”) emerge only as Lira interacts with them, so environment constrains every beat of her drumming. The auric lagoon doubles as micro-setting and reflective tool, its surface literally mirroring forgotten lives and forcing her stance shift. Spatial choreography stays clean across the single platform/pond. Selective sensory economy—fragrance of vibrating blossoms, auroral hues—keeps description tethered to her perceptual bias rather than tourist spectacle.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—transform sterile lab sorrow into shared living song—arrives early and tightens through pattern intensification: each drumbeat literally brightens blossoms and lifts memories into firefly orbs. Agency is present yet gentle; Lira’s percussion is the causal engine, but the final institutional shift is relayed summarily, blunting the visible price. One clear deepening occurs when the sky answers her crescendo with funereal yet renewing aurora, foreclosing escape and locking her into caretaker role. Cost is present (perpetual drumming, sorrow absorbed), but because the staff’s conversion is off-page, the escalation feels slightly vicarious.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as sorrow can birth communal light if someone volunteers to carry the rhythm indefinitely; no character articulates this thesis. The returned memories shift from pathology to gift, reweighting the lab’s premise without moralising. Final image of steadily glowing lagoon offers quiet conceptual repricing: grief becomes usable energy. Subtext rests in silence—the staff never speak—so the institutional change is read entirely through environmental echo, an elegant restraint that avoids preachiness.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays tightly tied to Lira’s rodent-scale sensorium: “tiny paws,” “whiskered cheek,” no anthropomorphic interior monologue. Sentence rhythm mimics drumming—clusters of light stressed nouns and comma pulses—without falling into mechanical cadence. Diction (“auric,” “entangled,” “auroral”) feels legitimately non-human, more wave-length than human lexicon. No dialogue, so no voice contamination; perceptual signature is distinct and maintained under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet breathable: most sentences perform double duty (sound + image, motion + theme). Occasional soft scaffold shows up—“each ripple sang a note of sorrow, auroral in hue”—where the appositive repeats the sorrow-aurora link already implicit, but the beat is brief and doesn’t recur in the closure third. Mixed-metaphor risk in “funeral veil” + “promise of renewal” is justified by the thematic tension. No filter-verb stacks, no synonym churn; punctuation and clause control stay precise, supporting the musical pacing.</comment>

<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The guinea-pig-as-shaman conceit is fresh, not quirky: her small scale lets sound become architecture. Synthesising particle-physics diction (“entangled memories,” “sound-wave garden”) with pastoral elegy yields a concept that feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk—lyric accumulation instead of causal plot—pays off through the final cosmic inhale, a bold structural choice that stays coherent. The tale’s specificity (rodent percussion as institutional intervention) reskins a familiar rescue narrative without retreating into allegory.</comment>
