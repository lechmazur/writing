<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is lyrical but coherent—her trembling voice, the vial as extension of will, the tear-glint all embody intent. The only fully dramatized choice is releasing the cork; the earlier “whisper promise” is summary, so the cost feels soft. No secondary character applies pressure, so relationship crucible is N/A. Earned stasis qualifies: she stays on the balcony, path foreclosed by the sea’s sigh, but the tightening beat wants more micro-choice.

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the cracked cork catching dawn-light crystallizes the before/after of purified intent, cost felt in her synced heartbeat. Causal chain is light—garden scent as amplifier is asserted, not demonstrated—but the Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each repetition of “whisper” and “hum” densifies the stake until the final chord. Orientation is anchored by word 60: cobalt lighthouse, dawn, balcony, Mara. No lens ambiguity or off-stage resolution; the fisherman’s turn is coincidental yet complicating, not resolving, so allowed.

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Environment is immaculately filtered through Mara: “cool as moonlit water” is her perceptual scale, not tourist gush. The brass lantern, stone balcony, and cracked cork are micro-settings that constrain her reach; the cork’s final glint literally refracts the beam, charging the closure image. Weather (post-heat-wave warmth) hums against skin and steams the jasmine, guiding the scent plume. Spatial choreography is crisp: edge-of-balcony, rudder turn, boat anchoring at cliff foot—all legible.

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“whispers travel farther than shouts”—is signaled in paragraph 1 and deepens through each pulse of intent. One meaningful tightening: cracking the vial seal purifies the air and forecloses retreat; the visible price is the emptied, light-spilling cork. Escalation is Accumulative: each sensory layer (scent, vibration, light) reweights the same stake rather than narrows options causally. Cost is conceptual but legible: the sea’s sigh wraps the tower like a lover, affirming her softness as viable force.

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: tenderness as technology—soft intent can steer the world. The cork’s cracked face in dawn-light reprises the “pulse” motif, repricing whispers as seaworthy. No moralizing; the fisherman’s murmured gratitude is implication enough. Ambiguity lingers: did the garden scent truly amplify, or did Mara simply will coincidence into myth? Either reading is supported, giving thematic depth.

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is lush yet disciplined: long breathless sentences mirror rising vibration; fragments (“A low, resonant sigh”) punctuate release. Perceptual signature is Mara’s—synesthetic blur of scent into sound into light. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk is zero. Register stays within her lexicon; “luminous thread,” “screaming tenderness” feel earned by the lighthouse keeper who thinks in beams and tides.

<comment>High information density: every sentence layers scent, sound, or light without paraphrase loops. Rhythm climbs with repetition of “pulse,” “whisper,” “vibration,” then exhales in the single-sentence final paragraph. Metaphors stay coherent (garden scent = tide; cork = heart valve) and physically trackable. Only hairline slip: “bright cascade of light spilled into the sea” edges toward purple, but the image is literalized by droplets humming, so forgiven.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Premise—lighthouse keeper using scent-amplified intent to guide ships—is fresh, avoiding stock sea-tales. The vial cork as intention purifier is a novel talisman, its cracked shell becoming the final lens. Risk is stylistic: lyric accumulation could have drowned in perfume, but the piece commits fully. Transformation test passes: swap cork for compass and the emotional arc collapses.</comment>
