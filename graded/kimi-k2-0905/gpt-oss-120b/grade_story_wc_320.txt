<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Selin’s motives (map-making survival via starlight) stay consistent and anchor every micro-choice; the interior contradiction—scientist vs. believer in wonder—is dramatized in her whispered intention, not declared. Embodied emotion is sparse but precise (“serenely electric glow” calming her breath). The climactic act of lowering the shard back carries visible renunciation cost: she forfeits possession to seed tomorrow’s signal, an earned stasis under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: the chord’s emergence is a pattern break that reweights the stake from salvage to communal rebirth. Closure lands as Charged Poise—Selin stands in dawn light having foreclosed personal claim on the shard; the tower’s awakening cables are the visible cost/constraint. Orientation is clear by line 3; causal linkage is lyric accumulation, not because/therefore, and holds without contradiction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>City-as-machine body—rusted towers, humming cables, crystal slot—constrains every move: only this antenna can cradle the shard. The gorge hollows echo the chord back, locking Selin’s broadcast path. Vivid specificity anchors without tourist sprawl; “silver lantern” moon reflection in the final image recharges the opening “broken harp.” Meets 9+ gate: environment shapes tactics and charges closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prove decay can birth signal—tightens once: static hiss → melodic chord. No antagonist; pressure is lunar perigee + city entropy. Cost is visible: Selin relinquishes the fragment, tower relinquishes dormancy, villages relinquish shadow. Agency is attention/renunciation under Accumulative lens; escalation is density surge, not causal turn, satisfying one meaningful intensification.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme—endings are raw material for beginnings—emerges through image (shard lowered at dawn) not thesis. Subtext lives in the hush: silence is not vacancy but unstruck note. Moral complexity kept: city remains rusted, rebirth is sonic, not utopian. Final chord reframes earlier “forgotten frequencies” without moralizing, delivering resonant reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays tightly focalized through Selin’s signal-tuned perception; diction (“quantum coil,” “syntax rewrite”) stays within her lexicon. Rhythm modulates: long breathless clauses for climb, staccato clauses for chord release. Pattern-taught elision (“shard of hush” never over-defined) pays off when villagers simply thank her—reader fills acoustic blank. No head-hopping; voice is singular, textured, and stable.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High information density: each sentence layers sensory, technical, and emotional data. Mixed metaphors avoided—harp/city, comet/stairwell, lantern/moon stay coherent. One minor loop: “serenely electric glow” repeated near opening and close; distance blunts echo. Otherwise rhythm breathes with escalation, no filler, no filter stacks, clean grammar; closure line (“Genesis in Echo”) is crisp kicker.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: post-apocalyptic radio romance meets starlight cartography. Hollywood fragment as cosmic phonograph needle is non-obvious yet inevitable. Risk—cosmic hush as practical tool—heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Tropes (rust city, lunar boost) are retooled through signal-engineering specifics, not ornament.</comment>
