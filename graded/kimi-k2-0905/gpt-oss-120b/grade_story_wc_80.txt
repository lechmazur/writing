<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Mara’s interior contradiction—stoic mask vs. trembling heart—is rendered through bodily detail (boots on moss, ink- warmed brass) rather than labels. The micro-choice to hide then retrieve the inkwell crystallizes her vow; the cost is the river’s slow erasure of every note she leaves. One slip: “archeologist of abandoned dreams” is self-diagnosis, not dramatized want, blunting motive edge.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the lifted drawbridge and inkwell glint re-weight the pavilion’s absence into her ongoing task, cost legible in the river’s sigh. Causality holds—each note placed because the last one was—under an Accumulative lens. Orientation is clean within 120 words (who, when, where). No meaningful tightening beyond the single vow; a second beat of risk would have pushed higher.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The submerged pavilion’s marble fingers and algae scent are filtered through Mara’s surveyor eye, constraining her footing and dictating where notes can be wedged. The inkwell’s brass body acts as micro-setting, its warmth a portable hearth against cold water. Final image—moonlight catching brass—recharges the pavilion’s interlaced absence, proving environment charges closure. One minor bob: “amber glow” appears twice without re-coloring.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Single dominant stake—rescue memory from oblivion—is signaled early. Escalation is textural: each note deepens the pattern of loss rather than narrows options; the river’s slow swallow is the tightening. Cost is felt ink bleed staining vellum, but no live option is foreclosed—she can still return tomorrow. Sufficient for length, but lacks a tactical loss that would sharpen the final oath.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme of memory vs. erasure emerges through concrete ritual (notes in cracks) rather than assertion. The interlaced absence motif accrues meaning as each column’s hollow becomes a shelf for confession. Final image of moonlit brass offers resonant re-pricing: artifacts outlast stone. Quiet ending avoids moral; only drift is “abandoned dreams” phrase echoing prompt too baldly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is unmistakably surveyor-poet: “measuring each line of coastline while feeling the pulse of every missing tide.” Syntax stretches without breaking—“interlaced absence marking every missing arch”—and contracts under pressure—“She waded.” No dialogue, so focus stays on perceptual signature. Brass inkwell’s map etchings extend her gaze, keeping diction anchored to maritime lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet lyrical; no filter-verb clusters or paraphrase loops. Metaphors stay physically coherent—“skeletal fingers,” “cloak of flame.” Information density high: one sentence often layers sensory data, historical echo, and bodily risk. Rhythm breathes—long sentence of pavilion description followed by clipped “She waded.” Only micro-slip: “hushed blaze” used twice; second instance could vary.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Premise—surveyor cataloguing drowned architecture with ink confessions—feels fresh yet inevitable. Tropes (abandoned ruin, antique object) are re-animated through tactile ritual rather than Gothic nostalgia. Risk lies in lyric stillness over plot, but cohesion justifies choice. Could edge higher if one architectural detail were wholly unexpected; marble columns are familiar signifiers.</comment>
