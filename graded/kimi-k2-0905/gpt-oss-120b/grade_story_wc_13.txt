<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is lyrically particular—“sketches could coax the soul from a fossil”—but her decisions are largely reactive: she drifts, listens, watches, then releases the pendant without a prior beat of conscious renunciation or cost. The final renunciation feels pre-ordained rather than wrested; no contradictory impulse is dramatized in-scene. Emotional embodiment is vivid (“pendant warm against her skin”) yet never complicates or endangers her. Closure image is resonant but the earned cost is only implicit; the story lands in Charged Poise without showing the price she pays for becoming the echo.</comment>

<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each image layer (canal-veins, giant’s nap, luminous echoes) thickens the texture until the final cadence stabilizes. Orientation anchors arrive by line 3; no penalty. Closure is a legitimate Charged Poise: Mira walks away across silver water, the city’s rhythm restored, her personal cost legible as perpetual service to time’s sculpture. Persistent constraint (she is now the echo, sketching forever) shapes the final image, satisfying the 9+ quick test for cost; kept below 8.8 because the renunciation beat is slightly abstract rather than enacted.</comment>

<comment>Rooftop canal system is not postcard scenery; it actively lifts her skiff, brightens under the pendant’s violet pulse, and ultimately turns silver—environmental state changes that mirror stakes. The infinity pendant functions as micro-setting: its loops climb towers like vines, literally re-sculpting the skyline. Spatial choreography remains coherent across the light-bridge walk and spiral descent. Final image recharges the opening mirrored-ribbons, satisfying the 9+ gate that setting constrains and charges closure.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—restore the city’s interrupted heartbeat—arrives early and tightens through cadence repetition; each “falter-resume” pulse escalates texturally rather than causally. One meaningful deepening: when she steps onto the ribbon of borrowed time, the option to retreat is foreclosed; cost is visible—she descends alone into the cavern. Agency is observational (she “whispers a prayer,” “presses pendant,” “releases”) rather than wrestle; escalation is atmospheric, not tactical. Still, the final cadence shift from falter to steady rhythm is legible payoff under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: time as sculptable medium, echo as identity. Motif of interrupted cadence migrates from rumor to city heartbeat to Mira’s own pulse, reweighted when she becomes the echo. Final image—her sketchbook “filled with the sound of time itself”—offers non-literal resonance, conceptual repricing of her art. Avoids moralizing; complexity lingers in the eternal obligation she accepts.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric voice sustains perceptual signature: Mira notices light “fractured on the ripples,” hears whispers “carving a new second from the void.” Syntax flexes with pressure—long breathless sentences during vortex, then clipped “She understood.” No head-hop; distance remains close. Diction stays within her illustrator’s lexicon; no corporate drift. Filter verbs are minimal and voice-motivated. Final cadence mirrors the restored heartbeat, proving rhythmic control.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>High information density: one sentence often layers metaphor, action, and world rule (“luminous ribbon unfurled… sketching a new hour”). Figurative language is dense but patterned early (“lattice of stone ribs”) so payoff at closure feels taught, not overwrought. No synonym loops or template cadence detected. Minor scaffold: “the notion of a sleeping giant felt literal” could compress, but does not obscure causality. Closure image is crisp and propulsive.</comment>

<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Familiar tropes—sleeping giant, infinity pendant, city of canals—are welded into a fresh accumulative myth: time is marble to be carved by sound. The “interrupted cadence” concept supplies a non-obvious engine: rhythm as sculpting chisel. Risk in lyric abstraction pays off because closure keeps the reconfigured cadence legible. Transformation test fails only in that Mira’s personal arc is slight; could swap names, but the city’s biomechanical heartbeat is specific enough to resist full generic swap.</comment>
