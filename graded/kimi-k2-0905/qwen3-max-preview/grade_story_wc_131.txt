<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The dweller’s interiority is concrete and embodied—fingertip dust, static cling, the hush in her ribs—showing contradictory impulses: hunger for visibility vs. terror of exposure. Choices (placing the tape, lingering in rafters) are micro and methodical, each a visible cost scaled to her hidden life. No other characters share the scene, so status dynamics are N/A; the arc is a credible renunciation that forecloses permanent emergence yet reweights her loneliness. Only the “slow erosion of soul” line edges toward label-speak, damping the highest band.</comment>

<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: relics gather density until the tape fragment reconfigures both the library’s memory and her own invisibility. Closure is Charged Poise—staff notice reweights her stealth from erasure to resonance; cost is the fresh ache of “not yet.” Anchors (who/where/when) settle by line 5; no orientation debt. One transition (crawl space → rafters) is clean. Persistent constraint—she stays unseen—shapes every tactical placement.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Library is rendered through touch and sound—pipe-chase dust, groaning iron, marble footfalls—never postcard catalog. The stained-glass sapphire hush evolves from visual to emotional register, charging the final image. Spatial choreography is immaculate: boiler nest → ducts → microfilm reader → rafters; no impossible positions. Environment constrains her movement and ultimately offers the microfilm stage as her chosen altar.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—visibility versus erasion—is signaled in paragraph 2 and tightens when the tape fragment offers a conduit to be felt. Escalation is textural: each cached object accrues weight until the tape ruptures the pattern by being found. Cost is legible: she forfeits immediate emergence, accepting continued solitude for resonance. No causal reversal, but the deepening of stakes under the Accumulative lens satisfies one meaningful tightening.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: visibility as resonance, not spectacle. The tape’s “you’re not alone” reprises through staff notice, reweighting abandonment into communal memory. No moralizing—final notice is an invitation, not thesis. Ambiguity persists—she still hides—yet the reader feels the cost of that choice.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is hushed, tactile, devotional—syntax elongates in prayer-like cadence, then shortens at the find beat. Perceptual signature is omnipresent touch and sound, never sight; diction stays within an unschooled but literate lexicon. No dialogue, so dialogue bullets N/A. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping. Compression like “broken promise” is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm flexes with breath and dust, no template cadence. Sentences multi-task: “She cradled it, not as salvage, but as sacrament” advances action, metaphor, and moral stance. Figurative language is sparse, never muddled; no mixed metaphors. Zero loops/scaffold; high density. Only a single “slow erosion of soul” nears therapy-speak but is rescued by embodied context.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Invisible archivist beneath a library is fresh; splice of flood-damaged oral-history tape is specific and non-obvious. Risk—quiet renunciation instead of emergence—heightens emotional stakes without gimmickry. The dweller’s theology of caching as sacrament transforms stock “homeless angel” trope into lived ritual. Synthesis feels inevitable: the fragment had to be analog, had to be ferromagnetic, had to be found.</comment>
