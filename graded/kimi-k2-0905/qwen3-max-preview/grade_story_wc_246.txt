<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interiority is rich and specific—“unbent… the rigid syntax of her assumptions”—but the emotional arc plateaus; she exits with the same confident-uncertainty she entered with, so no new internal contradiction is forced. The micro-choices (traced glyph, whisper to the void) are present yet feel symbolic rather than costly; no lasting flaw or price is internalized. Still, the voice-driven self-portrait is vivid enough to earn strong band placement.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the final whisper reweights the premise—history as wet clay—and the starlight-filled nib images a Conceptual Repricing with felt cost. Causal chain holds: each small edit emerges from her invitation, not fiat, satisfying the Accumulative/Textural lens. Minor slack: the “planted wrong seeds” backstory is abstract and pays off only as metaphor, softening the decisive change a hair.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Gravitational anomaly is not postcard scenery; it actively pulls narrative threads, warps boots, and supplies the membrane that accepts the glyph—setting as tooling. The dried-up pen evolves from prop to reservoir of starlight, making tool-as-micro-setting charge the final image. Sensory economy is high—“light bent in lazy spirals” compresses visual and physical distortion in five words. Spatial choreography remains lucid across the single continuous scene.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—thresh meaning from regret—stays legible; pressure escalates via accumulating micro-edits that collectively loosen the timeline shoelace, a valid Accumulative/Textural tightening. Cost is present yet diffuse: the edits are small and almost “perceptible,” so the price feels aesthetic rather than visceral. Still, the sense of options reconfiguring satisfies the required turn.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges phraselessly: history is grammar we can dance with. The final image of wet-clay time reweights every prior metaphor without moralizing. Subtext resides in silence—the hush inside the pen barrel, the sigh that replaces a scream—inviting reader re-grammar. No thematic echo is spoken; insight stays embodied.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is irreducibly specific—“entropy’s cruel editing,” “kiln of now”—with rhythmic variance matching tidal anomaly pulses. POV remains stable in confident-uncertainty; no head-hop. Compression like “spacetime hiccup” teaches the pattern early and pays off at closure. Lexicon stays within interpreter’s metaphysical trade idiom, never drifting into generic lyricism.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm modulates from long spiral clauses to staccato breaths—“She smiled. Not because things were fixed…”—mirroring anomaly tides. Figurative density is high but patterned; “wet clay” reprises earlier “seeds,” avoiding churn. No loops or scaffold; each image advances story or theme. One mixed vehicle—“warped crust of spacetime” (crust implies solidity vs. fluid anomaly)—is minor enough to leave clarity intact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Core premise—cosmic copy-editor rewriting regret via gravitational grammar—is non-obvious yet internally inevitable. Tropes of time-revision are transformed through linguistic/typographic metaphor rather than technological gimmick. Risk of abstraction is embraced and paid off by concrete final image. The synthesis feels singular; remove any paragraph and the whole unravels.</comment>
