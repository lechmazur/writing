<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elara’s soft-caretaker persona is consistent, but interiority drifts into abstract “magic” talk; no contradictory impulse is dramatized under pressure. The curl hand-off is tender yet reads as gesture rather than forced choice with cost. Motive stays static—no new risk or self-revelation—so the arc is flat. Voice is distinct, but emotional stakes remain safely therapeutic, never tested by genuine loss or error.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: imagery and hush density build toward the eclipse hush. Closure lands as Charged Poise—the curl passed, wonder seeded—cost is conceptual (society’s silence) rather than personal, felt but light. Orientation clear by 120 w. No causal tightening beyond crowd drift; eclipse is pure external gift, not driven by Elara’s agency. Transitions smooth, one scene, no lens break.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Sage Ridge is evoked with succinct, multi-sensory strokes; lichen runes and crushed-sage air anchor POV attention. Micro-setting of pocket-objects (curl, pegs, sachet) constrains the final gesture, meeting 9+ gate. Spatial tracking clean; bodies encircle without drift. Weather/eclipse used as mirror, not mere backdrop.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Stake—“keep wonder alive”—is declared early yet stays abstract; no visible price or forfeiture is attached to Elara. Eclipse provides situational spectacle but does not tighten her options; she remains passive conduit. No resource lost, no path foreclosed. Pressure is ambient, not protagonist-driven; escalation is coincidence, not agency.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of quiet wonder emerges through imagery rather than lecture; final image of curl glowing “with intention” reweights earlier motif. Subtext in children’s silent sit is effective. No moralizing line, but concept risks preciousness; ambiguity modest. Emotional aftereffect gentle but lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Lyrical third-person stays close to Elara’s synesthetic perception; diction (“slow tides,” “honeyed chord”) is patterned and consistent. Rhythm modulates with scene breath, no head-hop. Filter verbs minimal; metaphors coherent. Dialogue sparse and child-simple, fitting. Voice distinct without striving; modest 9+ reach.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose is lush yet disciplined; sentences carry dual duty (image + motion). Minor metaphor clustering in opening 100 w but pattern is taught and paid off. No loops, no scaffold, no register drift. Read-aloud cadence varies; closing hush lands cleanly. Information density high for word count.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Eclipse-as-revelation is familiar, but framing it through “ordinary magic” and therapist-led quiet is fresh inflection. Curl transfer ritualizes memory without cliché. Risk level modest—safe pastoral uplift—but specificity of place and profession lifts it above generic eco-epiphany. No bold formal gamble; freshness resides in tonal restraint.</comment>
