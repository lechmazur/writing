<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The historian’s wonder-driven interiority is concrete and embodied in her regulator-bubbles and trembling gloved fingers; the statue’s contradictory impulse—to preserve yet dissolve—peaks when it guides her hand to its own cracked knee, a micro-choice that forecloses its marble stasis. Cost is felt: the statue liquefies, she surfaces burdened with mutable truth. Minor slip: “incisively kind” drifts toward diagnostic label in the climax, trimming full integration.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the violet light cascade reweights every prior “fall” image to “threshold” with undeniable conceptual cost. Accumulative lens taught early (layered murals, ampoule, foxglove dye) and held to final dissolve. The hairline fracture in the knee—a structural weakness introduced at midpoint—pays off as the literal break that releases light, satisfying causality with elegant circularity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Kelp ankle-wrap, snail-silted plinth, and bioluminescent parchment are selective, sensorily cross-wired details that constrain retrieval choices and charge the final light-spiral. Spatial choreography keeps diver, statue, and fracture tracked without drift. Garden environment evolves from static ruin to breathing afterlife, mirroring the thematic shift from monument to fluidity. Slight over-reliance on visual over other senses keeps it from 9+.</question>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</question>
<comment>Dominant stake—will certainty be cracked open?—tightens when the ampoule empties yet demands fracture against stone. One meaningful escalation: historian’s single narrative vs. cascading truths; cost legible in her tear-salted mask and new burden of mutable testimony. Agency remains hers to shatter, not luck. Could use one earlier obstacle beat to push score higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without sermon: mosaic truth vs. monolith is enacted by the shattering act, not stated. Subtext lives in statue’s silence and the garden’s shift from grave to garden. Final image of dissolving toe reweights hubris into evolution with conceptual cost. Avoids thematic echo; only hairline slip is the parchment aphorism, barely forgivable because glyphs physically shift.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</question>
<comment>Third-person omniscient telepathy is stable, patterned early, and paid off in the whisper into bones. Diction stays within marine-archival lexicon; rhythmic propulsion mirrors tidal surge without algorithmic repetition. Distinct perceptual signature: historian’s clumsy human thought vs. cool-hearth statue voice. No head-hop; compression taught and legible.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>High information density: “foxglove-stained glass ampoule” packs dye, fragility, toxicity in four words. Zero loops or scaffold; mixed metaphors kept coherent (“scalpel dipped in honey” unites sharp/gentle telepathy). Sentence rhythm swells and retreats like surf. Only micro-slip: “animate lifelessness” appears twice in closing paragraph; second use could be cut for 9+ purity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fusion of living statue, underwater garden, and anti-dogma inoculation feels singular and inevitable. Risky choice to dissolve citizens into coral is grounded in prior mural reveals, not gimmick. Fresh inflection: structural weakness of knee as philosophical flaw. No close echoes; concept commits fully without retreat.</comment>
