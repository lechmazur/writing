<comment>The protagonist’s contradictory impulses—loving the father who taught her fire’s language while devoting her life to stopping it—are kept alive in every beat. Her micro-choice to thread the coin onto the obsidian wrist is visible, embodied, and freighted with cost: she binds herself to monitor a legacy she can’t excise. Interiority stays concrete (“safety without shame” felt as kelp-drift) and avoids diagnostic labels. The only slight undercharge is that the “wild love refined” distinction is asserted more than dramatized in the present scene; nevertheless, the stance crystallizes with felt price.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the red cord tied around an obsidian wrist reconfigures her inheritance into an ongoing vigil. Cost is unmistakable—she commits to daily return, radio already pulling her toward the next blaze. Causal linkage holds: because she inherited both match and hose, therefore she grafts memory onto redemption instead of burying it. Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, the lagoon’s harmonic wave is the density shift that reweights stakes; no contradiction or soft reset appears.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Black sand, obsidian lagoon, and copper coin each constrain movement and meaning: sand clings like a blessing, lagoon’s glass surface mirrors and distorts, coin’s drilled hole turns it into a tuning fork. Details are filtered through firefighter perception—she notes “no sirens, no smoke” before anything else. Spatial choreography is clean: boots sink, knees gritty, thread taut across water. The final image of coin glinting beneath surface fuses setting with thematic reweighting, passing the 9+ gate.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—how to carry an arsonist’s legacy inside a firefighter’s skin—tightens once: the coin’s dip literally threads water and memory together, foreclosing denial. Pressure is accumulative; each sensory layer (salt air, obsidian shards, whale-song resonance) deepens the cost of vigilance. Price is visible on-page: she accepts perpetual return, radio already pulling her away. No external antagonist needed; internal combustion is sufficient and coherent under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges solely through particulars: fire as both destroyer and savior, scars as singers. The closing harmonic ripple is the non-literal answer—no moral stated, only a new tonal register installed in her body. Subtext operates in gesture: coin lowered, wrist bound, silence sung. “Scars can sing” is seeded by father, tested by her lifesaving, and re-priced by the lagoon’s chord; no echo feels contrived.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Lyric compression is taught early—“tide-pulled kelp,” “salt-laced air”—and held to the last line. No head-hopping; single POV remains tightly anchored to her professional eye. Perceptual signature is distinct: she catalogs absence first (no sirens, no smoke) and reads texture for survival. Minor register drift in “frequency of her unyielding compassion” is the only academic intrusion, but it is brief and does not recur under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm mimics breath: long tidal rolls for lagoon calm, staccato “En route.” for dispatch. Metaphors stay mutually consistent—kelp, glass, tide—avoiding mixed vehicles. Information density is high: one sentence can marry sensory cue, backstory shard, and future obligation (“black sand clings… blessing”). A single paraphrase loop (“not to fix, not to bury, but to listen”) is forgiven because it cadences the closure; no artifact touches the final image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The arsonist-daughter-firefighter triad is fresh synthesis; the graft ritual via drilled coin is a specific invention that could not swap with generic pendant. Risk-taking in lyric accumulative structure pays off: the lagoon’s whale-song chord is earned, not imported. Familiar motifs—fire legacy, atonement—are re-inflected through obsidian water and harmonic resonance. Final reconfiguration feels inevitable yet non-obvious in hindsight.</comment>
