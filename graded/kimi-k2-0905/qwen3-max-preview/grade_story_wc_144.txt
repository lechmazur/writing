<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is rich—her “listening” through palms and temples is a vivid, embodied signature. The contradiction between her blindness and hyper-attentive perception is lived, not declared. The only drag is the near-perfect calm: she never mis-senses or doubts under deadline, so the struggle feels pre-ordained rather than truly risky.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the drone’s flight reweights every prior fracture into “flight path.” The anchor-lifting clock creates visible cost—failure means orchids die and research lost—so the ticking feels causal, not decorative. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The depot’s mist, copper basin, and prism form a micro-setting triad that literally guides the repair; each tool-choice is spatially tracked. Light refracting through glycerin doubles as both diagnostics and atmospheric mirror, charging the final lift-off image. Slight over-romancing of “salt-tinged sky” but not enough to fog causality.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—pollination or ten-year research loss—is signaled early and tightened by each wing click. One meaningful escalation: the anchor’s groan shifts from ambience to countdown, forcing the final exhale jump-start. Cost is visible—if the drone stalls, flowers die—so the pressure stays concrete.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges as “fracture ≠ end but vector”; the hummingbird’s cracked wing literalizes the idea, then reprises as flight map. No overt thesis statements; the botanist’s gasp at orchids responding to machine frequencies supplies the resonant reconfiguration. Final image answers the thematic question without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays tightly focalized through Elara’s non-visual senses; perceptual signature is consistent (“fine hairs on her wrists”). Rhythm modulates—long breathy sentences for calm, staccato bursts for gyro recalibration. No head-hop; diction stays within artisanal lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High information density: one sentence often layers sensory cue, tool action, and time cue (“anchor’s groan…pooled beneath her bare feet”). No scaffold loops; metaphors stay coherent (light as tide). Minor perfume in “iron bones slick with dew” but it’s earned by POV bias.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Blind mechanic who “sees” via lighthouse prism and glycerin optics is fresh without gimmickry. The notion of “mending trajectories” reframes repair as existential redirection, not nostalgia. Risk—lyric calm under deadline—pays off because the cost (orchids, voyage) stays external and real.</comment>
