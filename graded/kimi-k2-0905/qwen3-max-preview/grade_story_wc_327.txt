<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The copper-veined storyteller’s interior contradiction—feeding the diamond noise to extract texture—drives every beat; her quietly-articulate trait is embodied in micro-choices (whispered syllables, precise wrist tilt) that cost her physical strain and social solitude. The final endurance of speaking the mother tongue until the canyon answers is earned by this exact calibrated patience, visible cost in her shimmering veins and hoarse cadence. No secondary character appears, so relationship bullets are waived; the single-POV interiority remains specific and sensorily grounded. Flaw: the absence of any observable misstep or blind spot makes her feel slightly super-heroic, blunting full human messiness.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the canyon’s forward-echo of her final word re-prices silence itself, with conceptual cost unmistakable. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of echo, pattern of flock, texture of tongue—tightening once when the diamond’s vacuum distills pure signal. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are taught by line 3 and payoff at closure, so no penalty. No causal turns are required; the cadence shift from hush to living syntax satisfies the lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Bone towers, copper veins, and the diamond form a micro-setting triad that literally conducts her final articulation; removing any pole collapses the climax. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven—she notices acoustic grain before color—keeping detail purposeful. Spatial choreography is immaculate: palm, sky, canyon mouth remain trackable across the single continuous scene. Weather and scale evolve with the beat (dusk arrival, wing-wind rush) rather than decorate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—resurrect a language—signals in paragraph 4 and tightens once: the diamond must be sated so texture can escape, foreclosing the option to hoard silence. Visible price is the diamond’s temporary dormancy and her bodily depletion (shimmering veins), legible on the page. Escalation is textural density, not causal reversal; the flock’s glyphs braid into audible syntax, reweighting the stake under the Accumulative lens. No antagonist needed; pressure is the canyon’s appetite and her own precision.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the inverse ratio: the more sound is devoured, the more meaning is released, offering a non-moral answer—voice is not preserved but continuously paid for. Subtext lives in gesture: the diamond’s hunger = colonial silence; her copper veins = conductive memory. No final-paragraph moralizing; the forward-echo is the statement. Complexity is honored—language returns but only at the price of eternal echo, not ownership.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Third-person lyric voice maintains psychic distance tight to her perceptual filter: consonants dissolve “like salt in rain” is a mind-specific simile. Syntax compresses under pressure—“She did not sing. / She articulated.”—teaching rhythmic pattern early and paying it off in the spare final line. No dialogue, so those bullets waived. Diction stays within her plausible lexicon (timbre, glottal stop) without jargon drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image, sound, or stake. Metaphors are coherent—diamond flaws as “trapped screams”—and physically sustained. Read-aloud rhythm modulates: long breathy clauses for canyon layers, staccato fragments for articulation beats. Opening and closing lines anchor and release the acoustic motif with mirror precision.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade>
<comment>The fusion of linguistics, acoustics, and ornithomancy feels inevitable yet uncatalogued; no prior story combines flock-syntax, cursed resonance-filter, and language-extinction in this vector. Risk—using a vacuum rather than a vocal cords to speak—heightens stakes without gimmickry because the physics is taught early and paid at closure. Specific detail (copper veins as conductive tissue, bone towers as cathedral-ruins) prevents abstract anywhere-setting. Transformation test fails if any ingredient is swapped: only a canyon that folds time can return a language already dead.</comment>
