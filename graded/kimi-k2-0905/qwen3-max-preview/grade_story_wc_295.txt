<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The chronicler’s contradictory motives—redemptive hunger vs. fear of hoarding grief—are staged inside the lucid dream, forcing her to sing the burden rather than archive it. Interiority stays concrete (“ink-stained fingers tracing constellations that pulsed like living veins”) and culminates in a visceral micro-choice: open her mouth to star-sorrow, knowing she will carry its weight forward. The cost is felt in the final beat—she presses a fresh daylily, accepting tomorrow’s grief—earning the renunciation of solitary witness.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the act of singing redistributes rather than records sorrow, reversing the temple logic. Causal chain holds—telegram summons → charts aligned → lucid dream choice → song disperses burden—each because/therefore link tightening options until only communal absorption remains. The persistent constraint is explicit: she must keep writing poems “offered to variable stars,” a lifelong price legible on the last page.</comment>

<comment>The observatory dome’s “glass eye,” the telegram’s “twilight-colored wax,” and the pressed daylily’s “memory of summer dusk” are not ornaments; each returns to constrain or charge the closure. The daylily becomes the covenant object she re-presses, crystallizing the new distribution method. Micro-setting (journal page, ink, petals) functions as crucible for the final micro-choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—will she accept perpetual burden-transfer?—is signaled early (“quiet redemption”) and tightens when the telegram announces the last guardian’s death, collapsing her observer role into participant. The single deepening occurs in-dream: guardian’s plea forces her from deciphering to singing, a visible price paid as stars brighten and her throat becomes the conduit. Agency is hers; coincidence only alerts, does not solve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as the inversion of archive into redistribution; no moral is stated, only enacted. The daylily’s reprise embodies the conceptual shift—from ephemeral capture to perpetual re-gifting—rendering the final image a non-literal answer: grief becomes meteor showers of mercy. Subtext resides in silence after the song; the reader feels the open-ended communal contract rather than being told it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric-oracular yet grounded in tactile detail (“ink-stained fingers,” “astral dust”). Syntax elongates during star-description, then fragments at the song-beat, mirroring breath management. No head-hopping; the chronicler’s perceptual signature—stars as living veins, grief as transferable cargo—remains exclusive and consistent. Register never drifts; elevated diction is motivated by celestial vocation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but controlled; metaphor clusters serve the accumulative design without obscuring causality. Rhythm modulates from contemplative star-catalogue to urgent song-crescendo, then settles into covenant cadence. One paraphrase loop (“burden… weight… sorrow”) appears mid-text but is absorbed by the thematic pattern, not artifactual. Final line is crisp, propulsive, loop-free.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses lucid-dreaming, astral data-storage, and grief-philately into an inevitable synthesis: stars as communal hard-drive for human sorrow. The risk—treating variability curves as receipts—pays off conceptually and emotionally. Specificity (Zeta Cygni’s pulse, daylily taxonomy) prevents abstract allegory; the chronicler’s song feels like the only possible ending once invented.</comment>
