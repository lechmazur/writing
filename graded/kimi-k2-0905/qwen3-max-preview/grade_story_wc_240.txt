<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Aris’s interiority is concrete—her spatial gift manifests in tactile beats (soil glow, button click)—and her final micro-choice (offering the diode, not pointing) crystallizes her arc. The letting-go motive stays legible, yet the mother-stranger figure remains a passive projection, never exerting live status pressure, so relationship-as-crucible doesn’t ignite. Still, the earned renunciation carries visible cost in the diode’s demotion from relic to key. One contradictory impulse short of 9-band purity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the diode’s click reweights the premise—no light, only permission—under Accumulative/Textural lens. Pattern taught early (button as memory tether) pays off when its dead diode becomes the release trigger; spatial choreography of the dissolve is legible. Cost is felt in the farm’s pulse dimming, a concrete environmental price. One beat more of causal tightening would tip to 9+.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Bioluminescent mushrooms function as micro-setting: their color-shift anchors constrain Aris’s interpretation of breaches and charge the final image when the motes sink back into caps. Orientation is clean—who/where/when anchored by word 60. Texture favors selective luminescence over tourist catalog, and the farm’s quantum soil rules stay consistent. Tool (diode) and environment together constrain the final gesture, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—how to let go without collapse—tightens once when Aris chooses to offer the diode rather than clutch it; this narrows her options from detection to release. Escalation is internal but legible under Accumulative lens: each pulsing cap deepens emotional density until the harmonic click reweights cost. No external antagonist needed; coincidence absent. Missing a second, sharper trade-off keeps it sub-8.5.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of permeable grief emerges through fungal anchors and diode re-pricing, never sermonized. Final image—motes feeding mycelium—offers non-literal answer: letting go is expansion, not loss. Ambiguity lingers (will Aris still detect breaches?), yet complexity is honored. One cliché shard—“world still held its breath”—softens punch.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice carries perceptual signature: Aris notices curvature of non-existent rooms, weights of invisible doors. Syntax breathes with pre-dawn hush—fragments mimic indigo silence—then compresses at the harmonic click. No head-hopping; psychic distance stable. Occasional elevated register (“conceptual repricing”-adjacent diction) nicks authenticity but stays within spatial-gift lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose shows high density: one sentence can layer glow, root system, and quantum particulates without surplus modifiers. Rhythm accelerates into the dissolve, then exhales into birdsong. No paraphrase loops; only one mixed metaphor (“blurred like chalk on wet pavement”) and it clarifies. Closure line avoids scaffold, ends on luminous unknown.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: quantum-tuned fungi as dimensional IDS anchors is new, and the dead diode repurposed as acoustic key subverts gadget cliché. Risky lyric escalation—stranger dissolving into edible light—pays off emotionally. Concept commits fully; no retreat to technobabble. Specificity makes premise inseparable from Aris’s arc.</comment>
