<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Arlen’s trait of diligent curiosity is shown through embodied, character-specific actions: chalk-dust study, starling watch, muttered phrasebook fragments. His interiority stays concrete (“Excitement prickled his scalp”) and his final smile crystallizes earned fluency. No label-speak; decisions hinge on tangible micro-choices that foreclose the orphanage past and commit him to sky-mapping. Flaws remain visible—he still mutters, still risks—but the cost is the blank page he now confronts, a credible endurance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural; closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the chalk hopscotch reweights the world’s blank spaces. Causality links each beat: dog-ear proverb → chalk observation → starling response → luminance beacon; no teleporting info. Cost is legible in the final blank dog-ear he now must fill. Orientation is clean by line 3; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Airship’s brass groans, balloon silk, spilled lamp oil, and chalk grit are tactile, choice-guiding micro-settings. The hopscotch board operates as a tool that literally steers luminance nodes—setting constrains tactics and charges the final beam. Sensory hierarchy obeys Arlen’s map-maker eye: wind currents before décor. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from cargo hold to main deck to balloon seam.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—map the next discovery—tightens through each hop that re-tunes living light. One meaningful deepening: hop “9” fires a league-wide beam, foreclosing anonymity and inviting pursuit. Agency is continuous: every chalk scuff is Arlen’s call; no coincidence resolves. Visible price: the open, watchful sky now demands future answers from him, not just the world.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme—knowledge as collaborative conversation with the world—emerges via hopscotch, starlings, and blank page rather than thesis. Subtext in Captain Veyra’s eyebrow and “Explain” carries respect-won-from-skepticism. Final image reweights earlier lullaby whispers into active dialogue without moralizing. Complexity lingers: beam invites both wonder and threat, unresolved.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is perceptually specific to a map-apprentice: “wind currents no instrument could measure,” “miniature dunes along certain lines,” numeric hop-boxes. Rhythmic control in long breathless sentences mirrors starling spirals; shorter beats under Captain’s gaze tighten focus. No head-hopping; distance stable. Diction stays within salvage-child lexicon: “weak tea,” “grease-stained,” not academic.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>High information density: single sentences layer chalk physics, starling response, and emotional charge. Metaphors are consistent—light as lute strings, birds as inkblots—and paid off in final beam. No loops or scaffold; paragraph cuts test clean. Opening and closing lines anchor and recharge motifs. Minor over-modification (“stranded luminance” repeated) but does not stall closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fusion of hopscotch, phrasebook marginalia, and airborne ornithology is non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Tropes—stowaway kids, orphan genius—are re-inked through luminous-silk aerostat and bird-conducting choreography. Specific detail (“dog-ear softened by anxious flipping”) prevents swap with generic equivalents. Risk in lyric accumulative structure heightens awe without losing clarity.</comment>
