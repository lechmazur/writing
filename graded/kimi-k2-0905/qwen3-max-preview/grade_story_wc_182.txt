<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elira’s linguist identity is vivid—she senses “linguistic strata” instead of reading titles, and her diary records “semantic blooms.” Interior contradiction shows when she chooses listening over force, yet her calm never cracks; more bodily cost under the mountain’s syrupy air would deepen stakes. Kael’s chrono-fracture flickers his pupils between centuries, a sharp externalized flaw. The final handshake is a credible micro-choice that forecloses extraction in favor of reconciliation, paying the concept cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the lexicon’s sentence “rescue is not removal, but reconciliation” reweights the rescue premise with undeniable conceptual cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density rises as books “grow like vines” and letters bloom into light—culminating in the mountain’s exhale that reconfigures gravity and Kael’s core. Elira’s earlier diary sketch of verb-roots primes the final renegotiation, satisfying pattern-teach. Cost is legible in the shelves’ groan and the new petals pressing themselves into her diary—knowledge now physically claims her.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The mountain-bookstore is sensory and causal: stone shelves spiral into “shadowed vaults above and below,” and gravity “stutter[s]” to resist Kael’s rise. The hollow shaped like an open codex functions as micro-setting that constrains the final choice—only Elira’s blank page fits. Ozone and old paper scent the air like a live circuit, anchoring chronal fracture. Spatial choreography stays clean as they walk “past aisles where books grew like vines,” the setting evolving with the decision it enables.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</question><grade><comment>Dominant stake—retrieve or renegotiate the lexicon—tightens when Elira realizes extraction equals erasure. One meaningful deepening suffices: the discovery that the library waits “to be misread” shifts tactics from rescue to conversation. The price is visible—Kael’s chrono-core steadies only after surrendering the extraction gear, shelves realigning as payment. Agency remains Elira’s throughout; coincidence merely complicates, never resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><question>8.8</question><grade><comment>Theme emerges without thesis: rescue colonizes, listening liberates. The botanical metaphor—meanings “root, branch, and sometimes wilt”—gains irony when living lexicon teaches the mountain to forget, proving even flora can choose decay. Subtext whispers in Kael’s rasp “you’re not supposed to be here,” a colonial echo. Final image of petals pressing themselves into the diary reweights knowledge as symbiotic, not collectible.</comment>

<question>6</question><question>9.0</question><question></question><grade><comment>Voice is perceptual and linguist-specific: Elira notices “syntax that bent causality” and smells “linguistic strata.” Rhythm tightens under pressure—“air thickened around him, resisting like syrup”—mirroring Kael’s temporal stammer. Elliptical compression (“Neither are you, but the mountain collects strays”) teaches the reader to parse by cadence, paid off when the mountain exhales. No head-hopping; Kael’s flickering pupils stay external, preserving POV modesty.</comment>

<question>7</question><question>8.7</question><question></question><grade><comment>Prose is dense yet limber: “footnote fruit” and “semantic blooms” do double duty as image and concept. One template cadence—“She…; Kael…; The mountain…”—recurs twice but serves accumulative design, pattern-taught. No mixed metaphors; “tuning fork struck wrong” stays sonic, matching chronal hum. Final line “the library…turned a page” resolves by action, no scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><question>8.9</question><question></question><grade><comment>The rescue-quest flips into anti-extraction ethics, a fresh angle on time-travel tropes. The sentient lexicon that teaches forgetting weaponizes archival love into critique. Specificity—silverleaf script, subjunctive branches—grounds the conceptual twist. Risk-taking (grammar as physics) heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable once the diary enters the hollow.</comment>
