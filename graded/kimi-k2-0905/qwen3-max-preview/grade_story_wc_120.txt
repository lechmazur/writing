<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Interiority is lush and embodied (“her bones aching for a time”), but the arc is pure endurance: no contradictory impulse or fresh micro-choice after the first third; the shell-touch reprise merely repeats the opening stance. The “conductor” desire is vivid yet never tested by an alternative path, so the closing smile feels like relief, not renunciation with on-page cost. Still, the specificity of memory-music keeps her singular and credible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the horizon splits under the final chord, reweighting the rule that music must be heard—cost is the cracked lake and the spent candle. Lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern of memory-to-sound layering is taught early and tightens to cadence. Orientation is clean by line 4; no causal reversals are required. Minor waver: the “before exhaustion hits” clock is announced twice but never tightens tactics mid-piece.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Frozen lake, glass floor frosting in fractal lace, mirrored horizon constraining every reflection—the setting is the instrument she plays. Micro-setting triumph: the nautilus’s spiral is tactile, chilled, and dictating the spatial choreography of memory projections. Sensory economy is strict; every visual returns as acoustic resonance. 9+ gate met: environment charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“will the symphony rupture silence before her body fails?”—is signaled early and deepens through each memory-layer. Escalation is density-driven: each recalled sound thickens the chord until the lake cracks; one meaningful tightening suffices. Cost is visible in the split horizon and snuffed candle. Agency is present in the final crescendo choice, though the external world responds perhaps too conveniently.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: memory as score, silence as auditorium. Subtext lives in gesture—palm to shell, frost feathering like notation. Final image reweights premise: music needs no ears, only conductor and seam. No moralizing, only crystallized paradox.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Lyric second-person compression is taught in line 1 and sustained: “chronologically homesick” is instantly legible. Syntax spirals like the nautilus—layered clauses mimic recursive memory. No head-hopping; distance stays interior-close. Rhythm accelerates with clause pile-up at crescendo, then cuts to two-word sentence: “She smiled.” Distinct perceptual signature throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud ear is musical; sentence length modulates like dynamics. No loops or scaffold; each metaphor is single-use and precise: “stars like trapped breath.” Information density is high—every line carries image + motion + emotional valence. Minor purple flourish “upturned hush” is forgiven because the piece teaches its own diction. Closure image untouched by artifact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Concept—memory as unheard symphony conducted inside a glass instrument—is non-obvious and fully committed. Risk of lyric second-person pays off: intimacy amplifies the acoustic interior. Nautilus-as-score and horizon-as-seam feel inevitable in hindsight. No trope recycling; even “frozen lake” becomes active timpani skin.</comment>
