<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The blind mapmaker’s interiority is vividly sensorial—languages “climbing her arm,” ribs “swelling” with sorrow—yet her contradictory impulses (absorb pain vs. remain self-contained) are stated more than simultaneous. The final renunciation—placing the ring, accepting silence—pays off prior causality with visible cost, but the micro-choices inside the stillpoint are summarized, not dramatized, blunting the hinge moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the stillpoint’s silence reweights grief/joy as harmonics, ring-glow signals cost, and “quiet blaze of her own pulse” crystallizes stance. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern of musical notes tightens to choral convergence, then abrupt silence—though causality is lyric rather than because/therefore. Orientation anchors (who/when/where) taught by tactile cues within 120 words; waiver applies.</comment>

<comment>Ultrasonic forest, moss that “chimes like glass bells,” and the hollow sphere of silence function as micro-setting that constrains choice: sound-based navigation becomes impossible inside the stillpoint, forcing the renunciation of the ring. Sensory hierarchy skews proprioceptive and sonic, true to a blind cartographer. Spatial choreography stays coherent—ring placed at moss edge, constellations resume drift overhead.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—map emotional depths or be swallowed—signaled early and tightened when forest memories (mother’s goodbye, brother’s static laugh) surge as sonic bait. The stillpoint entrance forecloses retreat; silence absorbs all notes, exacting the cost of external guidance (ring abandoned). Agency is attention/renunciation under Accumulative lens; no false escalation, one meaningful deepening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: grief and joy as harmonics of one note, revealed through the shift from absorbing languages to composing them. Subtext lives in tactile metaphor—ring’s glow equals earned silence; final whispered vowel-consonant word is the first original “song,” reweighting prior absorption. No moralizing; resonance is imagistic and earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric-accumulative, syntax mimicking sonic layering—fragments build to choral crescendo then cut to stark simple sentences inside the sphere. Perceptual signature is synesthetic, blind POV privileges vibration, temperature, breath. No filter-verb clutter; diction stays within plausible lexicon of a tactile linguist. Rhythm accelerates into glade, stops dead in silence, mirroring pulse.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet breathable; figurative language is patterned and paid off (notes → chorus → silence). One loop risk: “languages through skin” is reprised almost verbatim; otherwise no synonym churn. Final image “quiet blaze of her own pulse” is precise, not purple. Clean grammar, no scaffold, no mixed metaphors.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Premise—blind cartographer of emotional linguistics—feels fresh; ultrasonic forest and stillpoint-as-silence-sphere synthesize fantasy with somatic truth. Risky lyric structure holds coherence; silence as positive space reverses typical quest object. Specificity of Mandarin on silk, Icelandic in shipwrecked log anchors concept in sensory memory rather than abstraction.</comment>
