<comment>The luminous skeptic’s interior contradiction—empirical rigor vs. pilgrim hunger—is vivid in every micro-choice (setting the amber as “coordinate,” not offering). Embodied emotion is precise: “boots sinking slightly,” “marrow” feeling the bronze quiet. The final renunciation—leaving the amber, carrying “density”—earns its cost because the prior beats have linked data failure to bodily surrender. No secondary character on stage, so relationship crucible is N/A; headcount stays within default.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a textbook Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the tower absorbs, she walks away, options foreclosed—“she had become part of the reaction.” Causal chain holds: ghost transmission → hypothesis → pilgrimage → data refusal → convergence. Orientation is anchored by line 3 (who, where, when); no drift. Cost is legible in the final image: the amber abandoned, steps rinsed behind her—permanent forfeiture.</comment>

<comment>The rainwashed tower is not backdrop but catalyst: lichen equations, concentric knee-rings, stone that turns longing to limestone. Micro-setting is the amber itself—handled, placed, abandoned—its fossilized wingbeat mirroring her suspended arrival. Environment constrains the final choice: only by leaving the control sample can she exit the reaction chamber. Sensory hierarchy stays POV-bound (petrichor, iron, mother’s soap), never touristic.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—can memory be mapped—is signaled in paragraph 2; tightening occurs when the spectometer registers “only ambient humidity,” collapsing her hypothesis. Agency: she chooses to leave the amber, renouncing quantification for embodied convergence. No coincidence; pressure is internal epistemic failure. Cost is the forfeiture of data and the adoption of an unquantifiable “density.” One meaningful turn is sufficient at this length.</comment>

<comment>Theme—knowledge is emergent from convergence, not isolation—arises from the amber’s fate and the tower’s absorption, never preached. Final image reweights “chemistry” from molecular to metaphorical without moralizing. Ambiguity is preserved: misunderstanding is “the point.” No thematic echo penalty; no final-paragraph thesis. Subtext lives in the fly’s frozen transit mirroring her own.</comment>

<comment>Third-person lyric compresses into a distinct perceptual signature: “bronze quiet,” “grammar of solitude.” Syntax mirrors cognitive slide—long hypotactic coils loosen into fragmentary staccato at descent. No dialogue, so voice purity is maintained. Register stays within scientist-poet lexicon without academic leakage. Patterned repetition (“bronze quiet”) is taught early and repaid in the benediction line.</comment>

<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers job—image, motion, concept—without scaffold. No synonym loops or template cadence. Metaphors are internally consistent (quiet = bronze, tower = sentinel). Opening and closing lines are crystalline anchors. Minor overwrought flecks (“grammar of solitude”) flirt with purple but serve tone; do not touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: hard-science epistemology framed as medieval pilgrimage. Fly-amber as control sample is a brilliant, non-obvious twist on “souvenir.” Risk—quiet ending with no data payoff—pays off because the tower’s absorption is foreshadowed. Could not swap names without erasing the scientist-poet voice. Not derivative; no famous scene echo.</comment>
