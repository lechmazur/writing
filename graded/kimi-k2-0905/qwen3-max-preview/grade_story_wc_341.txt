<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is lush and embodied; the grief-logic of naming clouds by emotion is consistent and particular. The micro-choice to log Altocumulus #112 as “release” crystallizes her hierarchy of values. No contradictory impulse is dramatized in-scene, so the final smile feels more accumulated than earned; that keeps her just shy of 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each cloud entry layers density until the final dissolution reweights the stake. Closure is a Charged Poise—she smiles because the sky has accepted her ledger, not because pain vanishes; the cost is the ongoing silence she will keep descending into. Causality is internal but legible: the act of naming becomes the because/therefore that lets her stay aloft. No orientation debt; pattern taught by word 50.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The brass telescope and wicker floor function as micro-setting: their tactile warmth and creak constrain her pacing and focal length. Starlight “clings like powdered memory” charges the final image when the same dust is scattered by retreating vapor. Spatial choreography is immaculate; gondola sway tracks with every emotional beat. Meets 9+ gate: telescope constrains the final optical choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prove emptiness remembers—is signaled in paragraph 3 and tightens when the cloud actually dissolves while she watches. One meaningful deepening: the shift from cataloguing to letting #112 scatter is the first time she permits loss to exit the ledger. Cost is felt but not externally durable; no tool breaks, no cable frays tonight, so the price is conceptual rather than tactical. Sufficient for 8-band, not 9.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges solely through image and act: the ledger’s salt rings and the scent of pine in the dissolving cloud argue that memory resides in what vanishes. No explicit thesis; final smile is an image, not a moral. The concept of “spooled wholeness” is repriced when the spool is shown to be the sky itself, not her book. Resonant ambiguity lingers: did the cloud remember, or did she forgive?</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person intimate maintains consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature is aviation-meteorological yet lyric—“vapor’s shadow,” “ozone and awe.” No head-hopping; diction stays within her plausible lexicon. Rhythm modulates: longer sentences for hovering clouds, fragments when she snaps the pencil. Filter verbs serve voice (“she believed”) rather than dilute. Distinctive syntax in “quietly explosive” earns idiom status.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High information density: one sentence often does three jobs—e.g., “She’d classified Stratocumulus #47 as ‘resigned acceptance’ after watching it hover for three dawns, unmoving, as if waiting for permission to dissolve” advances lore, stakes, and metaphor. No loops or scaffold; “string broke” recurs only to anchor backstory. Figurative layer is patterned early and paid off at closure. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with gondola sway.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: grief-processing via cloud taxonomy converts professional tool into private liturgy. “Spooled wholeness” is a coinage that feels inevitable in hindsight yet was not obvious at entry. Risk of lyrical overload is embraced and survived because the physics of gondola and telescope stay concrete. The concept that absence is vessel, not void, reweights the entire sky rather than the character alone—conceptual originality at length.</comment>
