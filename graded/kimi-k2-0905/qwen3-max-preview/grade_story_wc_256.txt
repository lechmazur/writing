<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elira’s interiority is vivid—her fingers brushing fossilized silence, her tear of recognition—but the “artificial pilgrimage” motive stays abstract; no concrete micro-choice (e.g., risking the lens) crystallizes until the final breath. The cost is felt, yet the path to it is more contemplative than pressured, so the renunciation reads as gentle rather than wrenching.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory layer (tube hum, floorboard sigh) tightens the mood until the prismatic burst reweights silence itself. Closure is a Charged Poise—silence becomes golden shadow—whose conceptual cost (she leaves with a cracked lens now glowing) is unmistakable in the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The “laboratory of lost sounds” is not backdrop but instrument: vacuum tubes whisper lullabies, wire harps tremble under Elira’s vowel, the cracked lens refracts choirs onto her skin. Setting literally bends sound into color, constraining her tactic of listening-through-light and charging the final prismatic projection.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recovering textured connection—tightens via density, not plot reversals: each hue carries a visceral texture (cobalt longing, amber comfort) that escalates the emotional cost of listening. The single meaningful deepening is the moment prismatic color becomes tactile on her skin, foreclosing the option to remain merely an observer.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges as an audible after-image: connection is not data but residue that clings like braille. The final “golden shadows” reprice silence as saturated with human grain, offering no moral, only an irreversible sensory re-calibration that lingers beyond the page.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lyric third-person hovers at intimate distance, its syntax breathing with Elira’s sustained vowel; perceptual signature is consistent—“echoes fossilized into silence,” “grain beneath the gloss”—and the cracked lens returns as charged refrain. No head-hop; voice modulates from hush to shimmer without register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Rhythm swells and ebbs like the tuning-fork wave; sentences vary from spartan to luminous without purple overload. One mixed metaphor—“silence…layered, like sediment holding the bones of forgotten conversations”—survives because it pays off when literal sediment-colored light falls on her skin. No loops, no scaffold, high information density.</comment>

<comment>Familiar tech-angst is inverted: machine-worship becomes reverent acoustic archaeology. The prism-song bell ringer, miner’s lens, and artificial pilgrimage synthesize into a fresh acoustical mythology whose payoff feels inevitable once the fork sings. Risky lyric structure heightens rather than obscures clarity.</comment>
