<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The embroiderer’s quiet, rhythmic surrender to the candle’s pulse gives her interiority a consistent, almost musical signature; her refusal to flee when the flame shudders crystallizes a hierarchy of values without therapy-speak. The “madwoman” mask is shown through the courtiers’ scorn and her own deliberate decorative sabotage, not told. The final smile with eyes closed is a credibly flawed, tacit acceptance of permanent outsider status—an earned stasis that costs her recognition. No contradictory impulse is dramatized in-scene, so the top band’s “impulses in scene” test is only partly met.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the cobalt flame steadies, the observatory becomes a “sanctuary of stitched truth,” and the surviving court bows—cost is the lifelong burden of being still labeled a fool. Causality holds: every sabotage thread is pre-figured by the candle’s tremor and her mirror-stitching in the adjacent layer. Orientation is clear by line 40; no teleporting props. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—pressure rises through pattern repetition rather than because/therefore turns—and that lens is taught early and held to the last image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The cobalt domes “glazed blue by autumn’s thinning light” and the eternal candle whose wick is “drawn from collapsed stars” are irreplaceable micro-settings that constrain tactics: only here can she read the flame’s dimensional tremor. The body-as-setting is equally precise: her fingers “moved with the rhythm of tides,” anchoring scale to pulse. Spatial choreography stays clean when she “rose, silent as a shadow slipping between shelves of brass instruments.” The final image recharges the cobalt walls as sanctuary, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prevent the coup via stitched deception—is signaled in paragraph 4. Escalation is textural: each new knot tightens the pattern of possible futures until the silver filament knot literally ties Ursa Minor to Cassiopeia, foreclosing royal death. Cost is visible: she collapses “cheek pressed to silk,” lungs scorched by cobalt flame. One micro-turn—stepping perceptually into the adjacent layer—changes knowledge, not territory, fitting the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the inversion of sight: maps that can’t be seen through telescopes save the kingdom, while visible stars mislead traitors. The final image reweights “fool” from insult to covert sovereign. No explicit moral is stated; the closing smile is an earned, ambiguous acceptance. Subtext lives in gesture—needle flashing like a comet’s tail—linking craft to cosmic violence without commentary.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is lyric, compressed, and pattern-taught: participial openers (“Stitching not for beauty…”) create a loom-like cadence that mirrors textile rhythm. Diction stays inside the POV’s plausible lexicon—she names constellations, not academic jargon. No head-hopping; single POV holds. The one-line courtiers’ laughter is reported, not voiced, so dialogue mechanics are bypassed cleanly. Under peak stress, sentence fragments (“She did not gasp, did not flee; instead, she leaned closer…”) accelerate without breaking syntax.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm is loom-steady yet varied; paragraph lengths visually echo tapestry bands. No filter-verb stacks; “she stitched” is active, never “she began to stitch.” One mixed metaphor—“shadows clawed up the cobalt walls”—is earned by flame distortion. No paraphrase loops; each sentence adds new sensory or causal information. Information density is high: one sentence often layers celestial reference + emotional state + plot cue.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of embroidery, quantum adjacency, and coup thriller is non-obvious yet internally coherent. The eternal candle as star-breath detector is a fresh inflection that reshapes familiar “seer” tropes. Risk—lyric accumulative structure rather than causal thriller—pays off by making the final stillness feel inevitable. Specificity of materials (silk, aurora strands, silver wick) prevents swap-out generic fantasy.</comment>
