<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elias’s contradictory motives—guard vs. cryptic composer—stay active; “transposing life into a new key” is dramatized through fortune choices that visibly cost him anonymity and draw the analyst ashore. Micro-choices (timing ferry drops, lens sweep) embody the motive; final recruitment shows earned stasis with cost rather than tidy epiphany. Interiority is salted, not therapeutic: “salt-crusted windows,” “groaning iron stairs” carry his fatigue. Only flaw: late-first name slip for the analyst slightly blurs status shift; still, hierarchy legible in dish-duty assignment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: fortunes accrue pattern until the “conductor” beat crystallizes Charged Poise. Closure lands with undeniable conceptual cost—the analyst’s tears reweight Elias’s anonymity and the island’s complicity; “the map is not the shore” reframes prior tide metaphors. Orientation clean by line 4 (lighthouse, night, mainland pub); transitions (widow, teen shards) are legible, taught early. One micro-turn: stranger arrival, not off-stage rescue, keeps agency with Elias.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lighthouse beam as conductor’s baton, kelp whispers, diesel cough—selective sensory triad anchors every beat and constrains timing choices. Micro-objects: cookie slips handled, folded, traded; tide charts physically marked. Final image of sweeping beam recharging earlier “sheet-music” conceit: environment directly charges closure. Spatial choreography flawless across jagged rocks, ferry dock, lantern room.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: can Elias keep orchestrating without becoming the spectacle? Escalation via mounting village dependence and external scrutiny; analyst arrival tightens options to recruit or be exposed. Cost visible: anonymity forfeited, dishes handed over. Agency remains orchestration—no deus ex machina.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>“Open secrets” theme emerges from tangible ritual (cookies, offerings) rather than thesis; final analyst tears enact the theme—knowledge felt, not confessed. Ambiguity lingers: is Elias conductor or conduit? Avoids moral binary; island complicity implied. No closing maxim—image of beam “indifferent to authorship” reweights premise with conceptual cost. Only micro-deduction: “familiar enigma” stated once, quickly subsumed by scene.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lyrical third-person hovers at Elias’s perceptual altitude: salt, rust, typewriter clacks shape rhythmic DNA. No head-hop; analyst stays opaque, seen through Elias’s amused filter. Compression taught early (“microdot grids”) and paid off in cookie concision. Syntax modulates: long tide-sentence vs clipped “He smiled.”</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud cadence varied; paragraph cuts tight. Figurative control: “beam slicing dark like conductor’s baton” extends without mixed-metaphor spill. Zero loops, no synonym churn. Occasional elevated diction (“existentially”) fits Elias’s outsider bard persona; no register drift under peak beat. Clean grammar, no typos.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: lighthouse keeper × microdot compression × cookie fortune = new metaphor for invisible influence. Conceptual risk (quiet orchestration, no villain) paid off by Charged Poise closure. Tropes (mysterious hermit, oracle trope) re-coded through spy-craft granularity. “Transposing life into a new key” rendered literal in narrative mechanics rather than metaphoric sticker.</comment>
