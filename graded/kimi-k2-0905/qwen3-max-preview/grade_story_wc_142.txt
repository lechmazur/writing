<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lira’s interiority is vivid—her orderly mind maps chaos, the stone’s warmth pulses against her thigh—but the “dual allegiance” stays declarative; we never feel her designing a zoning overlay or taste the concrete guilt. Micro-choices (painting phoenix wings from eviction notices, redirecting foot traffic) embody the trait, yet the pivot from corporate architect to graffiti saboteur is summarized, not dramatized with a visible cost. The ending renunciation lands as Charged Poise, but the emotional price is collective, not personal, keeping the arc just shy of 9.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the collective paint-in rewrites privatization into postponed uncertainty, cost felt in the developers’ graffitied blueprints. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each mural adds density until the final map-image crystallizes meaning. The orientation anchor (Midway Promenade, barefoot Lira) appears by line 4, well inside the 120-word window. No lens ambiguity, no teleporting props; only minor slack is the off-stage pivot of Lira’s own corporate past.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The raft city is lived-in: salt-stained wood, fried-dough monsoon taste, eviction notices hammered to lampposts. Sensory hierarchy follows Lira’s tactical gaze—wind direction dictates cotton-candy placement, rusted railings whisper structural strain. The setting constrains choice: pontoons creak under rent pressure, carnival arteries reroute crowds toward survival. Final mural-map recharges every prior glyph, making the city itself the charged object that forecloses privatization.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—prevent carnival’s gentrification—signals early and tightens through each graffiti intervention; each mural raises visibility hence risk. Escalation is accumulative: density of coded images peaks when corporate scouts photograph “quaint decay” blind to the arrows beneath. Cost is felt in postponed contracts and the city’s continued creak, not in Lira’s personal loss; a sharper individual price would push higher. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens; one meaningful deepening suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without sermon: commodification vs. communal memory, coded in carnival ephemera—popcorn phoenix, lease-agreement clown. Subtext lives in graffiti silences: developers miss the arrows, elders nod at coordinates. Final image reweights premise: “THIS FLOATS TOGETHER” drowns luxury models in glitter, a conceptual repricing that feels inevitable. No tidy moral, only the stubborn refusal to let joy be zoned into extinction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is compressed, lyrical, pattern-taught: neon fireflies, salt-sugar wind, “hopeful desperation” mantra. Syntax mirrors Lira’s mapping mind—parallel clauses stack like carnival stalls. No head-hopping; perceptual signature stays tight to her barefoot gaze. Diction stays within carnival worker lexicon; corporate starch enters only as scent on antagonists.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Rhythmic variation propels: long breathless sentences for crowd flow, staccato fragments for evictions. Metaphors are coherent—Ferris wheel morphing into logo—no mixed vehicles. High information density: one sentence can layer wind direction, stall placement, and social cue. Only micro-loop: “reorganizes…reorganize” in adjacent sentences; minor, does not touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Floating carnival as gentrification battleground is fresh; graffiti-as-code that reroutes crowds transforms familiar protest trope into tactical poetry. Phoenix from popcorn kernels, mermaid weeping lease-pearls—specific, unexportable images. Risk-taking in structure—accumulative mural beats—pays off in final collective act. Synthesis feels inevitable, not gimmicky.</comment>
