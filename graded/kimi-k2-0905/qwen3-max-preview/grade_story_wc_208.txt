<comment>Elara’s interiority is concrete—“salt-crusted boots,” “fingers calloused from coaxing stories”—and her contradiction (commerce vs. communion) is active in every beat. The carving act visibly renounces the monetized path, foreclosing it with felt cost when she walks inland without the sculpture. Perpetual-learning trait is not label-only: it drives her to kneel and carve instead of clinging to failed tech. Micro-choices under storm pressure reveal hierarchy of values with embodied emotion, no therapy-speak.

<comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the projected arch of clasped hands reweights the premise—“simplicity is architecture”—with undeniable conceptual cost. Lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern of lantern-slide reprise plus layered wood carving teaches the cadence early, deepens once through storm-carve-project sequence. No orientation debt; who/where/when anchored by line 3. Persistent constraint (no GPS, no map) shapes tactics and final renunciation. Cost is legible in the leaving: she abandons the artifact she once hoped to sell.

<comment>Storm-tossed archway is not backdrop; stone ribs vibrate in molars, wind tugs sleeves, wet sand resists knife—environment constrains every carve-stroke. Micro-setting (driftwood plank) functions as tool and canvas; its grain dictates negative-space silhouettes, charging final image. Sensory hierarchy obeys crisis: narrowed attention to wood resistance, rain needles scalp, turbine-hum inside bones. Spatial choreography clean: lantern-slide, projector, cliff face alignment tracked without drift.

<comment>Dominant stake—art as shared shelter vs. sellable product—tightens when storm strips away commerce infrastructure (GPS, deadline). One meaningful escalation: the slide’s living tableau forces her to reimagine alliance, translating into carve-project act that forecloses monetization path. Agency is renunciation/creation, not passive revelation; cost is the sculpture left to weather, her departure without payment. Pressure coherent under Accumulative lens: each slide vision adds sedimentary weight until carving-projector fusion crystallizes new stance.

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from repeated gesture (hand-clasp across eras) reweighted by final projection: alliance as architecture, not treaty. No moralizing; whispered line *“Simplicity is not absence…”* is conceptual repricing, not sermon. Subtext in negative-space silhouettes—absence becomes bridge. Ambiguity lingers: villagers add offerings, children trace shadows—theme stays open, reader invited to continue circuit of trust.

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Distinct perceptual signature: sculptor’s synesthetic attention—wind “turbine-hum reverie” inside molars, wood “yielding when listened to.” Rhythm modulates with pressure: long clause-stacks pre-carve, then clipped noun-phrases during carve. No head-hopping; single-POV stable. Lantern-slide imagery taught early, paid off in projected dance. Compression/elision (“She packed… walked inland”) is strategic, propels without scaffold.

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image, pressure, or motion. Metaphors precise—signal “like salt in seawater” obeys marine physics; no mixed vehicles. High density: “storm lantern glow trembling against gale” does three jobs (light, motion, vulnerability). Opening anchors voice & stakes; final line resolves by image that recharges motif. No register drift; diction remains within artisanal POV lexicon.

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: GPS fragility + magic lantern slide → critique of satellite arrogance via tactile driftwood epistemology. Timewoven alliance concept non-obvious; not time-travel but layered trust sediment. Risk of leaving sculpture unpunished pays off—living archive idea feels inevitable in hindsight. Specificity (salt-crusted boots, turbine-hum) anchors universals without quirky ornament. Conceptual integrity maintained; no retreat to safe tech resolution.
