<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lior’s interiority is specific—his refusal to “calibrate” magic, the tactile warmth of the keystone against his heartbeat—and his final renunciation is earned. The only drag is a touch of therapeutic self-diagnosis (“he’d spent his life chasing grandeur when grace lived in crooked runes”) that softens the climax; still, the cost is felt when he returns empty-handed yet luminous.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Causal lens holds: keystone pulse → mist path → cloud-tree → keystone left as gift → Lior retooled. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: he forfeits institutional greatness for micro-charms, a visible forfeiture signaled by “its warmth lived in his palms now.” Cost is legible in the final image of him “glowing when someone felt alone”—a staked life-choice.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The spire’s frost-glow, moonstone warmth, and cloud-soil are tactile and POV-filtered; the keystone functions as micro-setting that alters gravity and bloom, directly constraining his final decision to leave it. Every descriptor is selective—no weather clichés—and the final image of “brilliant dimness” reweights the locale as a broadcast tower for small kindnesses.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Stakes tighten from exile → irrelevance → obliteration of self-definition. One meaningful escalation: the mist-walk forces an irreversible choice—step or stay—and the apple-tree doors foreclose his old definition of magic. Cost is visible: he gives up the keystone, forfeiting future mist-walks; the tightening is singular but sufficient for this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: automation sterilizes wonder, and wonder survives only in handmade, flawed offerings. The keystone-tree sequence reconfigures “sacred” from spectacle to off-key lullaby, a non-literal answer embedded in the final image of windowsill charms. No moralizing—just the re-pricing of magic itself.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise—“gravity softened nearby,” “brilliant dimness”—with rhythmic control that accelerates during mist-walk and quiets at the tree. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is consistent: Lior notices temperature, taste, and ghost-light, never sliding into expositional omniscience. Filter verbs are minimal and earned.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet breathable: one sentence often does three jobs (world-fact + metaphor + emotional state). No loops, no mixed metaphors; opening and closing lines anchor voice and re-charge motif. Variation in sentence length mirrors thermal expansion/contraction of wonder, a deliberate drumbeat only when the mist pulses.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The “automated magic” world is familiar, yet the keystone as memory-storage for pre-protocol wonder is a fresh mechanic, and mist-walking is restored via failure, not triumph. Risky choice to end with tiny anonymous charms instead of heroic rebellion pays off: conceptual repricing feels inevitable, not gimmicky. Specificity of “off-key lullaby” bans generic template.</comment>
