<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority remains concrete and particular—her “grip reality loosely” stance is dramatized through tactile beats (tapping the parasol tip, climbing the floe). The final renunciation is earned: the shift from resenting reprieves to humming on the ice costs her the safety she once rejected. Minor slip: the three voided waivers are told in summary and never complicate a present choice, so motivation feels one-note rather than contradictory under live pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of listening beats thickens until the parasol’s “wet chime” crystallizes the glacier’s collapse; cost is palpable when marina vanishes. Closure is a Charged Poise—she drifts, “full,” the parasol tip vibrating with memory—threshold reweighted, path foreclosed. Orientation anchored by line 4; transitions legible within single shard. No meaningful escalation break; tightening is the synchronized hush itself.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Drift-ice marina is not postcard scenery: black ice underfoot causes the slip that triggers revelation; floe becomes literal raft that swallows the old world. Parasol tip functions as micro-setting, constraining final stance when it vibrates against pulse. Weather and spatial choreography remain coherent across the single continuous scene. Gate satisfied: tool charges final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“learn the sound of approaching endings”—is signaled in paragraph 5 and tightens when the parasol’s chime collapses distance between listener and glacier. Protagonist agency: she walks toward the shearing shelf, foreclosing rescue; cost is the swallowed marina and her half-frozen body. One meaningful deepening suffices; no reversal required under Accumulative lens. Cost is visible, but secondary losses (volunteer relationships) stay abstract, keeping score below 8.5.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: endings are not events but acoustic thresholds one can learn to inhabit. The parasol’s transformation—sunshade → tuning fork → pulse-against-throat—reweights “lace unraveling” into lullaby, not despair. Final image answers the central question non-literally: hum of patience folded into windborne solace. No moralizing or thematic echo in final paragraph.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person lyric voice sustains a perceptual signature: Arctic brine, salt-surrender wind, “hush before collapse” are idiosyncratic metaphor clusters that never repeat verbatim. Compression taught early (“soul rinsed in Arctic brine”) and paid off in final hum. No dialogue, so no voice contamination. Filter verbs are voice-motivated (“she heard it: the sound…”) and remain legible.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Rhythm modulates from long liquid sentences to the clipped “She froze. / Around her, the marina fell still…” mirroring cardiac syncope. No synonym loops; each sensory image is net-new. One mixed metaphor—“hung to dry on the rigging of forgotten ships”—but it occurs early, before peak pressure, and does not tinge closure. Information density high: one sentence often layers sensory cue, backstory shard, and emotional tilt.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: euthanasia tourist seeks not death but the timbre of ending, revealed through acoustic ice-music. Transformation test fails if relocated to temperate coast; glacier shearing and parasol tip resonance are inseparable. Risk—lyric drift onto floe—heightens stakes without gimmickry because causality (slip → chime → shelf collapse) is intact. One minor echo of “surrender” salt-wind trope, but diction elsewhere is particular.</comment>
