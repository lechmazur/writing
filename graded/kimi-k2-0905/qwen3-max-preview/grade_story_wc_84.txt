<comment>Interiority is lush and sensorially anchored (“tears tracing paths through dust”); micro-choice of aligning star-trails to activate the chip shows values hierarchy. Interior contradiction is present—awe vs operational vigilance—but the epiphanic shift relies on a外部的 harmonic device rather than a prior flaw compounding cost; still, the renunciation of perpetual scanning lands as credible Earned Stasis. Voice specificity wavers in a few stock phrases (“never flinched,” “second skin”) but overall reads as an individual professional sensibility under pressure.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the protagonist abandons the search frequency for internal resonance, cost legible in her deliberate stillness. Causal linkage is loose—chip activation is externally prompted by star-map alignment rather than a prior mistake or desire creating the necessity; luck governs the turn. Orientation anchors who/where/when within 120 words; no spatial drift. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: accruing sensory memories reweight belonging; pattern holds through final image.</comment>

<comment>Observatory stones, drone beam, and chip each return with shifting thematic charge; the broken celestial dial physically constrains access and later mirrors internal fracture/repair. Dust, amber twilight, and drone shadow create tactile spatial hierarchy; spatial choreography remains coherent as she pries stone and activates ceiling projection. Weather and light actively pressure visibility and mood; environment is handled, not backdrop. Final image of “brilliant dimness” reweights earlier dusk motif, satisfying 9+ quick test.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—decode belonging frequency—signaled early; escalation is atmospheric rather than tactical: harmonic visions intensify internal stakes until external search is abandoned. One meaningful tightening: visions force recognition that missing pieces are internal, foreclosing further signal hunt; cost is conceptual—loss of external certainty. Protagonist agency resides in attentional renunciation rather than overcoming antagonist; still a visible forfeiture of former identity. No coincidental rescue; closure stays internally generated.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of belonging-as-internal-resonance emerges through concrete imagery (chip synced to heartbeat, star-alignment as self-alignment) rather than abstractions. Subtext operates in pilgrim’s silence and drone light flicker; no final moralizing. Final image crystallizes theme non-literally: “she wasn’t scanning… simply present” reweights all prior sensor language. Ambiguity lingers—pilgrim’s nature, chip’s origin—inviting reflection without confusion.</comment>

<comment>Third-person lyric close-attention distances matches pilot’s thermal-scan perceptual signature: noticing micron-deviations, amber rays, velvet-lined obsidian. Syntax compresses under awe (“breath catching”) and elongates with cadenced listing of visions, showing rhythmic control. No dialogue to distort voice. Filter verbs are few and motivated; diction stays within character’s technical lexicon. Free indirect thought is clean; no head-hop. Pilgrim’s single line carries mythic resonance without stealing focalization.</comment>

<comment>Prose is textured, high-density; figurative language is selective (“glyphs shimmered like trapped constellations”) and tied to POV perception. Rhythm varies naturally; only minor template cadence in tripled participial openers early on (“kneeling…tracing… scanning”) but pattern is taught and fits observational tempo. No mixed metaphors; no synonym loops. Opening/final lines anchor and recharge motif of listening vs scanning. Occasional elevated phrasing (“brilliant dimness”) reads intentional to theme; does not obscure causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Merges solarpunk tech (drone, chip) with archaic astronomy site to create fresh texture; belonging-as-frequency is familiar but interiorized via star-map interface feels novel. Specificity of observatory glyphs and micro-pry tool differentiates from generic relic hunt. Transformation test passes: emotional arc depends on pilot’s sensory discipline and renunciation unique to her profession. Risk in lyric pacing pays off with resonant closure. Minor point-off for quasi-mystical pilgrim trope, slightly under-customized.</comment>
