<comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses—grief for vanished reefs and compulsive tactile listening—are dramatized in every micro-choice (tapping surfaces, peeling fused pages, choosing submersion). The final renunciation of “searching for vanished paths” is earned through a causal chain of discoveries that visibly cost her solitude and professional safety. Interiority stays concrete (“salt-crusted and silent”) rather than diagnostic. No stock phrases; even the AI’s chime is filtered through her newly rewired perception.</comment>

<comment>The 17-second delay functions as a Decisive Change with conceptual cost: the reef’s slow-time existence rewrites her scientific paradigm and her life’s mission. Closure lands under Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern-break (tapping ⇄ coral pulse) reweights stakes from loss to co-existence. Cost is felt when she pins the old atlas into a new, deeper cartography—she forfeits the authority of satellites for the humility of knuckle-listening. Lens holds without ambiguity; no因果 gaps.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Station, submersible, and journal are handled in tactile motion; each object changes state (CALYPSO’s lag, fused pages, glowing coral) and constrains next moves. Salt-crust, mildew scent, bioluminescent spirals are filtered through Elara’s marine-biologist eye, never tourist catalog. Spatial choreography is immaculate: ankle-deep brine → generator housing → descending hull. The final image of “depth, rhythm, patience” fuses environment with moral stance.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—why paths disappear—tightens when 17-second lag proves the paths merely slowed. Agency is continuous: she tests surfaces, excavates code, chooses descent. Each beat forfeits a layer of empirical certainty, paying with rising solitude and professional risk. The glowing coral garden is not luck; it responds to her tapped summoning, crystallizing cost under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the percussion of loss and persistence: metamorphosis instead of extinction. No explicit thesis; meaning accrues through recurrent tapping that shifts from superstition to communion. Final image—“depth, rhythm, patience”—re-weights the fossil-fuel-ban era’s moral math: salvation through listening, not legislation. Ambiguity remains: humanity must slow to a 17-second metabolism, a price left resonant, not resolved.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Voice is marine-biologist-poet: precise (“spectral graphs of dissolved oxygen”) yet lyric (“metal bones groaning like an old sailor”). Syntax mirrors tidal surge—long clauses that suddenly pull back into monosyllables (“She surfaced… salt-crusted and silent”). No head-hopping; CALYPSO’s chime stays external, filtered through Elara’s transformed ear. Compression is taught early (“three taps for loss…”) and paid off in every rhythmic return.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances knowledge or image. Metaphors are controlled: “frayed like nerve endings” is brief, physically apt. Opening line anchors voice and stakes in one breath. Final line crystallizes without flourish. No filter-verb stacks; immediacy stays intact even under water.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The 17-second coral heartbeat is a fresh, non-obvious rebuttal to bleaching narratives; it weaponizes slowness as survival. Tapping-as-sonar transforms grief ritual into scientific instrument—risky, specific, inevitable in hindsight. Atlas page torn decades ago becomes tactile time-capsule, not MacGuffin. Synthesis of climate grief and deep-time wonder feels singular, not stitched.</comment>
