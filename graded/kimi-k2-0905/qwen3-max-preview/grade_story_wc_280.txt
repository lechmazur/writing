<comment>The ghost’s monologue-interiority is rich, synesthetic, and embodied (“the laugh was cerulean with flecks of brass”). Her final renunciation—rooting herself into the sapling—pays off prior causality and costs her spectral form; the micro-choice to whisper “Grow” crystallizes values. No contradictory impulse is dramatized on page, but the depth of sensory interiority and the visible cost of dissolution earn the high band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Closure is a textbook Resonant Reconfiguration: the tarot coin’s sink into possibility re-weights the rule-set, germinating a silver sapling that continues the ghost’s work. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens: each echo-thread (woman, teen, old man) is braided by the seven-note lullaby, then rooted in lived futures. The image carries undeniable conceptual cost—the ghost’s extinction—rendered in oneiric logic rather than physical mechanics.</comment>

<comment>The orchard-fountain micro-setting is inseparable from the closure image: the upward-flowing water catches moonlight like “scattered spotlights,” then receives the coin that births the sapling. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven—sound-as-color, scent-as-music—guiding the ghost’s choice of which echo to nurture. Spatial choreography is dream-solid yet trackable; the sapling’s emergence is anchored to the fountain’s basin, charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—luring possibility from despair—tightens when the coin’s hover selects three living echoes; the ghost’s agency is to sing the lullaby that braids them, paying with her form. Escalation is Accumulative: density of temporal blossoms, upward water, chime-notes increase until the sapling ruptures the timeline. Cost is legible—her translucence thins to watercolor—meeting the 8.8 gate.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the motif of echo-as-seed: art’s afterlife is not performance but contagion of courage. The final sapling is a non-literal answer—nostalgia repurposed into forward growth—avoiding moralizing. Subtext resides in sensory cross-talk (scent of wet pavement + cinnamon) rather than thesis statements; the reader leaves with the after-image of ringing petals, not a slogan.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Lyric third-person hovers at consistent psychic distance; synesthetic diction (“grief into lilac mist”) is sustained without register drift. Purposeful ellipsis—no dialogue, only choral echoes—teaches its pattern early and pays off in the seven-note lullaby. Rhythm modulates from long breathless cadences to the single spare imperative “Grow,” mirroring the ghost’s fade into vegetal stillness.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry triple duty: sensory data, metaphoric leap, and causality (“droplets catching moonlight like scattered spotlights” advances both image and the stage-light rule). Zero paraphrase loops; each noun is specific (rigging, marquee, triangle). One mixed metaphor—“timelines like eggshells”—is fleeting and does not touch the closure beat, keeping the 9-band intact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>The fusion of synesthetic ghost + tarot coin + orchard-as-theater is a fresh synthesis; risk lies in the non-causal lyric engine, yet it pays off in the sapling’s conceptual repricing. Familiar tropes (burned opera house, guardian spirit) are re-cast through sensory cross-modality and vegetal encore. The inevitable-in-hindsight test passes: only this ghost could seed a sound-tree that rings future auditions.</comment>
