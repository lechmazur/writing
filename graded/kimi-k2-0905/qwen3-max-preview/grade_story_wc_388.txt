<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The debunker’s drive to “excavate truth from comfortable lies” is the only motive we ever see; it is stated repeatedly but never dramatized as an interior contradiction or tested against a competing desire. Her moment-to-moment decisions (pressing the diamond into soil, turning east) flow from that single stated goal, so the arc is coherent, yet the absence of any micro-choice that costs her something keeps the characterization just shy of the 9-band. No second character appears, so the relationship crucible is N/A. The final smile-into-the-storm image shows earned endurance, but the cost is asserted rather than felt on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/lyric lens: each image-layer (glowing petals, growth rings aligned to storms, diamond pulsing) adds density until the final moment reweights the whole pattern—radiation-as-nourishment becomes a lived conceptual repricing. Closure is the charged poise of her stepping beyond the orchard while the stillpoint hums inside her ribs; the cost is the sorrow she names for every buried orchard, a conceptual loss made legible in the final paragraph. Causality is associative, not sequential, but the pattern is taught by line 4 and held without lapse. No orientation debt; who-where-when lands by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The wasteland orchard is not backdrop; its engineered anomalies (roots humming storm cycles, fruit swelling under gamma winds) directly constrain her epistemic method—she intuits pattern because the setting forces pattern. The diamond and plaque are micro-settings that charge the final image: their glint and engraved coordinates become the literal map she sketches, so environment shapes the closing tactic. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true—petal tremor before wind howl, bark scar before embassy ash—never tourist catalog. Spatial coherence is perfect: soil pressed, dust repelled, ten-foot radius cleared, all tracked in continuous action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake is epistemic: prove the stillpoint network exists. Pressure escalates by density accretion—each found artifact (letters, diamond, plaque) tightens the pattern rather than opening new external threats. The one meaningful deepening is the plaque reveal that spatializes the stillpoints; it forecloses the option that this orchard is unique and forces her next walk. Cost is conceptual (sorrow for buried orchards) rather than viscerally felt, keeping the score below 8.8.</question>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges as the inverse of scarcity mythology: the lie of curse disguises a gift of sustenance. Subtext is carried in glints, pulses, and growth rings—never sermonized. The final image of the diamond beating “like a second heart” reweights the Stillborn Star from devourer to life-anchor without moralizing. One hairline slip: the phrase “comfortable lies tasted like safety” edges toward thesis statement, but it is buried mid-story and instantly re-grounded in soil action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Third-person lyric stays tight to the debunker’s perceptual grammar—“petal’s tremor whispering data,” “ fractured warnings”—a diction no other character could own. Rhythm flexes from long breathless accumulations to the staccato “She walked on… She would keep digging.” No dialogue, so voice contamination risk is zero. Filter verbs are absent; perception is raw (“boots crunching,” “diamond pulsed”). The single POV never slips; unreliable hints (curse as cover story) are paid off in-world.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sentences do double duty: “roots drinking poisoned earth, fruit swelling sweet despite gamma winds” packs world-rule, sensory body, and contradiction into one line. No scaffold, loops, or paraphrase; each image is net-new. Metaphors stay coherent—diamond as tuning fork, stillpoint as silence-zone—without vehicle clash. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image that recharges “rooted” motif. Only micro-flaw: “fiercely, stubbornly, uncursed” adverb stack is redundant but occurs post-closure and does not obscure the exit image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The post-apocalyptic orchard that metabolizes radiation via a flawed tuning-fork diamond is a fresh synthesis; trope sources (Road, Chernobyl, crystal healing) are transformed through specific botanic-engineering logic. Growth rings aligned to storm cycles rather than seasons is a verifiable particular that could not be swapped out. The stillpoint network reframes survivalist fiction as epistemic quest rather than resource scramble. Risk is taken and paid off: lyric accumulation replaces conventional causal reversals yet achieves coherent closure.</comment>
