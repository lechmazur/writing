<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The fisher’s calm, analytic stance under cosmic pressure is embodied in every micro-choice—barefoot calibration, silence-sculpting, spike strike—so her final transliterated vowel feels earned. Interiority never drifts into label-speak; instead, emotions are sonar, tooth-ache lullabies, iron resonance. Contradictory impulses (cool reason vs. maternal fury channeling) coexist in-scene, and the renunciation—letting the echo pass through her—costs the spike and her sonic compass. Voice stays singular, faultlessly consistent.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the spike cracks, echo migrates to constellations, garden settles—cost is the tool and the fisher’s monopoly on navigation lost. Causal linkage holds throughout: each silence-carved hollow directly enables the spike’s heating and the goddess-release. Lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of sonic imagery tightens until pattern inverts sky/floor—final image reweights all prior vibration. No orientation debt; who/where/when anchored by line three and paid off in the shrine orbit.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Sound-wave garden, rail spike, and sleepwalking constellations are not backdrop but tactical terrain: every step must avoid snapping sonic vines, spike conducts buried bass note, constellations absorb the released echo. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true—fisher notices vibration temperature, phoneme edges, iron resonance ahead of visual data. Environment literally guides footfall and tool-use; final image of golden orbiting lights is inseparable from the closing beat. Micro-setting—the spike’s remains—becomes shrine, charging closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—catch the goddess echo—tightens once: the feral lullaby narrows options to “match pitch or fail.” Agency is continuous: every silence-sculpt alters the sonic soil and heats the spike, culminating in the conducting strike. Cost is visible—spike fractures, echo departs, constellations repurpose her tool—foreclosing future hunts. Escalation is textural density under Accumulative lens; no reversal needed, only the invert-moment that reweights sky/floor.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from sonic particulars: grief as tide that drowns logic, transliteration as survival, echoes as pilgrim light. No thematic statement—meaning accrues through spike’s migration from lure to shrine and the vowel “Aaaaah” that releases ownership. Final image offers non-literal answer: orbit of once-sleepwalkers around cracked iron reconfigures grief into caretaking. Avoids sentimentality; emotional aftereffect is awe, not comfort.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Voice is cool, precise, mythic—syntax stretches into kelp-like clauses then cuts short with “She didn’t flinch.” Perceptual signature is acoustic-fisher: every noun is a vibration measurement (“tones bloomed,” “negative space she sculpted”). No dialogue, so rhythm and diction carry all subtext; spike’s temperature and constellation lullaby are the only “speech” needed. Compression taught early—“sound wave garden”—paid off in legible closure without head-hop.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud cadence mirrors sonic subject: spondaic clusters (“barefoot,” “rail spike,” “cherry-red”) then long open vowels in “Aaaaah.” No loops, no scaffold; each sentence layers fresh sensory job. Figurative language is sparse, precise—metaphors are acoustic physics, never mixed. Final line shards/whisper/satchel propels off the page without trailing exposition.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade>
<comment>Fisher who hunts goddess echoes with rail-spike tuning fork is fresh synthesis; sleepwalking constellations as grieving memory clusters risks gimmick but earns weight through sonic cost. Concept commits fully—garden inverts sky/floor without late rule change. Risky second-person echo-VOICE remains legible under Accumulative lens. Specificity makes trope transformation irreversible; swap any element and the resonance collapses.</comment>
