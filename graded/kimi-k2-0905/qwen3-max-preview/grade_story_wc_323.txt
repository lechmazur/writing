<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elira’s “balancedly curious” trait is shown through calm classroom control and the anchor-link mnemonic, but interior contradiction is only asserted, never dramatized in a moment where curiosity collides with fear or doubt; the final pedagogical triumph feels earned yet costs her nothing on-page, keeping her just below the 9-band where a visible personal price is required.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the anchor silhouette over starfield reconfigures meaning—chain rigidity becomes navigable flexibility—under an Accumulative/Textural lens; causality is intact, yet the cost is conceptual (human identity shift) rather than a tangible loss felt by Elira herself, so the beat stops just short of the sharper personal price the 9+ gate prefers.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Bioluminescent towers, braille star-charts, and the iron anchor create tactile specificity; the benthic dome constrains pedagogy and is re-imaged in the final holo-overlay, satisfying the 9-band test of environment charging closure; only the faintest hint of sensory monotropy (over-reliance on visual holograms) keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stakes—“will humanity re-learn navigation?”—tighten as students fail, then succeed; the semester climax is a meaningful deepening under Accumulative lens, but pressure is intellectual, not existential; no live risk (lost ship, dying settler) makes the cost abstract, capping escalation below the 8.8 threshold where a felt price must alter tactics on-page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme—adaptability as survival—emerges through anchor-to-constellation reconfiguration, never sermonized; the somber marvel tone lets awe coexist with loss, inviting reflection without moralizing; only a hairline slip of overt thesis in “we are not weights meant to stay put” keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Elira’s perceptual filter—starlight as grammar, anchor as mnemonic; syntax is controlled, with rhythmic repetition (“edge geometry”) that pays off in final image; no head-hop or register drift, though voice could risk one more idiosyncratic tic to reach 9-band distinctiveness.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, high-density; metaphor chains (“invisible lace across spacetime”) are purposeful and sparse; no loops, scaffold, or mixed vehicles; one clause (“conceptually upward”) momentarily strains phrasing but does not blur causality or dull the closure image, holding the line at 8.5.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Post-alien non-Euclidean celestial navigation taught in a deep-sea braille planetarium feels inevitable yet fresh; the rusted anchor link repurposed as compass for folded space is a specific, non-obvious synthesis that transforms familiar maritime imagery; risk-taking (no villain, pure concept arc) heightens meaning without gimmickry, meriting the 9-band.</comment>
