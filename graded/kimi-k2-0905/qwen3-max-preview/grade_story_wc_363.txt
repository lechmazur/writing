<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The spinner’s yearning is embodied in every tactile beat—fingers tracing dull threads, tying the amber bead to the beam—so her choice to self-unravel feels earned. Interiority stays concrete (“tears would unravel the weave”) and the final absence lands as credible renunciation. The only minor gap: we never see her hesitate or test a less total sacrifice, so the leap feels absolute rather than ambivalent. Still, the hierarchy of values—message over self—is dramatized, not declared.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the empty chair and hovering bead make the cost of her disappearance legible under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality holds—each shuttle pass literally dissolves her—so the final image reweights the premise without exposition. The puzzle-box arrival is coincidence, but it complicates rather than resolves, satisfying Situational pressure rules. Orientation is anchored early by loom, orchard, and vanished courier; no debt applied.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Bamboo stillness, upward-falling plum blossoms, and the amber micro-sun constrain the ritual’s tempo and supply the final beacon. Weather and grove react causally to the weaving—leaves curl, blossoms invert—so environment is not backdrop but active resistor/accelerant. Spatial choreography stays clean: puzzle assembled on warp beam, bead tied to crossbeam, body dissolving into the weave. The orchard’s forgotten status heightens the stakes of impossible distance without needing exposition.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—deliver the indigo-silver message—tightens when the only route is self-sacrifice; the solstice night provides the single meaningful intensification required at this length. Agency remains hers: she dismantles the loom, threads twilight, and chooses the final throw. Cost is visible on-page—memories transmuted into glyphs, body gone—so the trade-off is felt, not abstract. No reversal is needed; the deepening of silence into expectant breath suffices for Accumulative escalation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as the price of transmission across entropy: love demands material sacrifice from the messenger. The amber bead’s ghost-firefly and the upward blossoms reprice the ordinary into the uncanny without authorial comment. No moral is stated; the closing warmth in the glass city lets the reader reweight the earlier loss. Ambiguity lingers—was erasure the only path?—inviting reflection rather than verdict.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays tightly filtered through the spinner’s perceptual signature—threads “that no longer shimmer,” silence “raveling like moss.” Syntax lengthens and contracts with ritual tempo; short imperative fragments (“She began.”) mark the fatal plunge. No head-hopping; the distant man’s POV appears only as a receiver’s shimmer, keeping focalization pure. The lullaby refrain threads voice across beats without lapsing into chorus-like repetition.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet breathable: “plum blossoms fell upward” packs motion and inversion in five words. Mixed metaphors are avoided; vehicles (tapestry, loom, weave) stay coherent. Minor scaffold appears in the repeated “raveling silence” phrase, but it functions as accumulative drumbeat rather than loop. One filter-verb cluster (“she felt the weight”) is forgivable at the necklace beat and does not touch the closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The constellation-puzzle-as-threshold-map is a fresh synthesis of portal fantasy and textile magic; the loom rebuilt around jigsaw edges feels inevitable, not gimmicky. Sacrificial dissolution into one’s own art reverses the Pygmalion trope without echoing familiar scenes. Risk—lyric ellipsis, single-character focus—heightens intimacy and pays off in the resonant final image. Transformation test fails if names change, confirming the concept’s specificity.</comment>
