<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>A strong interior arc: the shift from vector-thinking to tide-feeling is dramatized through micro-choices (naming poles, pocketing the washer, turning back to the kayak). The mutiny/backstory is kept off-stage, so the cost is more conceptual than visceral, but the final stroke shows earned alignment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/lyric lens: the patterned pole-naming and compass refrains tighten into a resonant reconfiguration—she becomes her own pole star. Closure lands with visible cost: she relinquishes certainty and inherited charts. The washer talisman and “compass as witness” crystallize the new stance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Coastal launch, salt wind, boot-licking tide, and crooked poles are filtered through a navigator’s trained eye, grounding every move. The poles function as micro-setting that literally steers her inland trek; the kayak hull’s gleam returns as the launch point for the final choice, charging the image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—align heart/action—tightens when each pole forces a named reckoning. The backlash of regrets complicates rather than resolves; the final narrowing is the choice to paddle without a named course, paying the price of surrendered control.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the pole imagery: navigation persists after precision dies. The closing laugh scatters like terns—an earned, non-literal answer that reweights “true north” as internal resonance rather than external fixed point. No moralizing, only charged poise.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Second-person lyric compression (“she’d come here not to paddle, but to pause”) stays inside the navigator’s idiom. Rhythm swells and contracts with surf-like cadence; diction marries nautical tech (“astronomical compass”) to bruised twilight poetry without register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density: every sentence layers image and motion. Occasional metaphor stacking (“salt wind tangling her hair like unresolved equations”) flirts with overwrite but stays pattern-taught. No loops or scaffold; final third is clean, allowing the laugh line to snap.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fresh inversion: forsaking stars for power-line silhouettes transforms a familiar recovery tale. The washer-from-crow moment risks whimsy yet feels inevitable within the story’s magnetized world. Specificity of nautical grief keeps it from generic “redemption on the water.”</comment>
