<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Interiority is richly voiced—“geometry of grief, lattices of longing”—and every micro-choice (kneel, place shell, whisper vow) is tethered to the archival motive. Contradictory impulses (dread vs. steady breath) coexist in-scene, not in summary. The renunciation of healing for sovereignty is earned through the causal chain of resonance-mapping; the cost—letting the shell go—lands with visible price. Voice stays singular, flaw-present, never diagnostic.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the vow “I archive you” crystallizes stance and forecloses retrieval, with the shell’s silence as undeniable conceptual cost. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory layer (salt breeze, fading star) tightens the same stake—translate or lose—until the final harmonic surge reweights meaning. Orientation is anchored by line 3 (“velvet garden at twilight”); no teleporting props. Persistent constraint: the shell must be released to complete the archive, shaping the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Garden, shell, and body function as micro-setting: vines curl like “old friends,” constraining her ankles and delaying exit; shell temperature guides the beat-to-beat pacing. Sensory hierarchy obeys POV—she notices ozone, not species names. The weeping willow root-cave is spatially tracked as the quarantine zone; shell placement there is tactically irreversible. Final image of moss cradling the shell reuses the same node, charging closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—translate isolation before dawn—signals early; pressure escalates via the accretive fading of stars, a cadence shift that narrows temporal options. Protagonist agency is the deliberate act of archiving each memory node; no coincidence resolves. Cost is the shell’s silence and the irrevocable release—tactics altered because she can no longer re-listen. One meaningful tightening suffices; no reversals required.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the iterative act: fragility as first draft of resilience is never stated outright but demonstrated through the shell’s offer and her refusal to seek healing. Subtext resides in the shell’s warmth—an unspoken plea she answers with autonomy. Final image reprices the concept: archive is not burial but compass, a conceptual reweighting paid for by relinquishment. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers on who next will kneel.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is unmistakable—“stars winking out keeping time with her pulse”—syntax lengthens and breathes with harmonic metaphors. Filter verbs are voice-motivated (“she felt” appears once to calibrate interior distance). Rhythm modulates: short declaratives at vow beat (“You are not lost. You are archived.”) crystallize stance. No head-hopping; diction stays within her contemplative lexicon; compression taught early (“resonance structures inside her mind”) and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Sentence variety is high; no template cadence or synonym loops. Figurative density serves pattern—each spiral image re-encodes grief—yet never muddles causality. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image. One passive clause (“memories were safe”) is strategic, emphasizing stasis after release. No scaffolding; every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><question>8.6</question><comment>Synthesis of neuroscience metaphor (“resonance structures”) with lyric elegy feels fresh and inevitable. The archival refusal of conventional healing plots a non-obvious independence arc. Velvet garden as memory quarantine is a risk that pays off through spatial coherence. Shell node system could become gimmick but grows from character choice rather than late rule patch.</comment>
