<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority is rich and particular—her coat-pocket ritual, the scarf-as-cipher, the logarithm-lullaby—yet the decisive shift into the tessellation is powered by a single spoken axiom rather than a visible micro-choice that costs her something right then. The grandmother-hem inscription functions as inherited knowledge, not as present-tactic friction. Still, the embodied eccentricity is vivid and the stance crystallization (“she hadn’t come to retrieve…”) is earned; only the activation moment lacks a palpable sacrifice.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the amphitheater reveal re-weights every prior shelf and orb as living, not archived, and the cost is the librarian’s irreversible integration into that field—she exits humming, visibly altered, scarf now resonant. Causal chain holds: scarf → scroll → axiom → fold → amphitheater → reawakening, each beat because/therefore. No orientation debt; anchors (who/where/when) land by line 4. The only hairline slip is the off-page grandmother rule-dump, but it is paid back immediately in the activation beat.</comment>

<comment>Scientific poetry library is no postcard: shelves labeled “Non-Euclidean Lullabies,” chalk-dust tang, rustle of equation-laden pages—all filter through the librarian’s selective, physicist-born attention. The scarf-as-micro-setting constrains the final activation: its frayed threads become the only conduit that can knit the hyperbolic glyphs, so object-state alters tactics. Spatial choreography is immaculate; patrons’ frozen murmur tracks cleanly beneath the fold. Environment literally curves into the amphitheater, charging the closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—stories must be reawakened or remain dormant—signaled in paragraph 5. Pressure tightens once: the scroll shivers, scarf glows, and the world folds, foreclosing the option to remain mere curator. Cost is visible—she returns humming, scarf now ghost-lit, her solitude deepened. Agency is librarian-initiated throughout; no coincidence resolves. Only one tightening beat, but it is decisive and irreversible under the causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: analog memory as sanctuary versus digital collapse, love as differential inscription, curvature as infinite holding. Subtext lives in gesture—thumb tracing equations, scarf knitting symbols—never explicated. Final image (patrons feeling pages “warmer, heavier”) reweights the entire opening catalogue as resuscitated flesh. No moralizing; the emotional after-effect is tenderness touched by loss.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Perceptual signature is laser-specific: “alphabetizing by emotional resonance,” “humming Poincaré conjectures while dusting metaphors.” Syntax flexes with stress—compression into equation-fragments at activation, then soft exhalation back in the coda. No head-hopping; POV stays latched to librarian. Diction never exceeds her inherited physicist lexicon. Rhythm mirrors hyperbolic widening: long sentences spiral, then snap into single-line folds.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops; each sentence advances image or causality. Metaphors are coherent—hyperbolic geometry as “language wide enough” sustains across paragraphs. No register drift; “tattered silk scarf—once vibrant indigo, now ghostly lavender” is precise, not purple. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line (“humming softly, sanely eccentric, utterly satisfied”) resolves with cadence shift that recharges “sanely eccentric” motif.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade>
<comment>Premise—narrative topology as literal geography—is non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Scarf-as-cipher + hyperbolic tessellation = fresh synthesis of memory, math, and love. Risk of overt abstraction is taken and paid off through sensory embodiment (scent of old glue, chalk-dust tang). No template echo; the Great Data Collapse is sketched in two lines yet feels lived. Bold choice to make the climax a fold into pure geometry without losing emotional stake.</comment>
