<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The protagonist’s interior contradiction—wanting to silence guilt yet fearing the silence itself—drives every beat; her choice to bleed into the machine is a renunciation that costs her innocence. The embodied micro-choice of pressing her own arm to the amber fuses vocation and wound in one motion. Emotional progression layers credibly: technician calm → static accusation → cracked lullaby. Closure is earned because the tattooist’s earlier mistake (mis-aligned Orion) is the very firmware she now redeems; the cost is her blood and the permanent glyph constellation that will forever advertise her complicity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the firmware’s weeping rewrites the rule-set—cries are no longer erased but translated into bearable grief, a social cost visible in the new constellation on her skin. The causal chain holds: amber placement → firmware stutter → glyph burn → lullaby completion → firmware weeps. Orientation anchors who/where/when within the first 100 words (lab, lost sounds, night). Cost is legible in the father’s final “Thank you” and the permanent tattoo that makes her body the new cradle. Persistent constraint: every future client will inherit this redeemed firmware’s softer static.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The laboratory of lost sounds is no backdrop; its broken gramophones and violet tubes throttle the stakes—proximity to the console dictates who hears the static. Micro-setting objects—amber, cradle, vacuum tubes—are tactile extensions of guilt; the amber’s false bottom literally hides the letters that rewrite the past. Spatial choreography is clean: drawer → console → forearm → machine core. The final image of dawn folded over rooftops re-weights the entire sky as a stitched blanket, making environment charge the closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—silence her own complicity—tightens when the firmware speaks her crime aloud: “You left me in the static.” One decisive escalation: she shifts from client service to self-sacrifice, feeding her blood to the machine. Cost is visible—physical burn, permanent glyph, public confession tattooed on her skin. The tightening forecloses the option to walk away; she becomes the firmware’s new cradle.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges as the translation of sorrow rather than its erasure: grief must be legible to be endurable. The amber insect—once a frozen relic—reconfigures into living glyph, repricing silence from denial to witness. No explicit moralizing; the final lullaby is sung, not explained. The emotional aftereffect is the reader’s recognition that bearing another’s static is love’s real geometry.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is laser-specific: “echoes of forgotten lullabies hummed beneath glass jars” marries sound to object. Rhythm modulates from long, echoing sentences (lab stasis) to staccato bursts during firmware stutter. No head-hopping; single lyrical POV holds. Compression like “meteor hush” teaches its pattern early and is paid off in the final lullaby.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies: cascading anaphora during static storm, then clipped fragments during glyph burn. Figurative language is dense but pattern-taught (sound → star → skin) so never muddles causality. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances knowledge or image. One hairline slip—“thawing ice” for voice is familiar, but it occurs in a minor beat and does not touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The fusion of tattoo artistry, infant firmware, and astronomical grief is a fresh synthesis; no easy genre precedent. Risky choice to make the machine weep rather than die pays off by converting horror into elegy. Specificity of Model L-7 vacuum tubes and comet-dust thread upgrades trope to lived tech. The transformation test fails if relocated—only this lab, this amber, this constellation could yield Cradle Major.</comment>
