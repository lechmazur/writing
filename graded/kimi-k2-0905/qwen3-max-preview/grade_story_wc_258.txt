<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The cartomancer’s curiosity is steady but never tested by contradiction; she observes, maps, and nods without a visible cost or renunciation. No micro-choice tightens or forecloses a path; the visitor’s single line supplies the only shift, not hers. Interiority is atmospheric rather than conflicted, so the closure feels observational, not earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: each shard adds density until the final map crystallizes a Resonant Reconfiguration—“remembering forward” reweights all prior cards. Orientation is immediate; transitions are legible under Track B mosaic. Cost is conceptual (the old grammar is gone) and felt in the tape’s worn edge, satisfying closure with price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Rain-beaded skylight glass, ink-stained fingers, and the coiled tape create a tactile micro-setting that constrains the cartomancer’s slow, methodical gestures. Weather and city glow filter every perception; the loft’s corkboard cathedral supplies the only geography needed. Specificity is selective, never touristic, and the final pin in the map charges the accumulated atmosphere.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—can a new cultural syntax be read before it dissolves—remains abstract; pressure is atmospheric, not tactical. No option is foreclosed; the tape is unspooled again without weariness or risk. Escalation is a gentle density curve rather than a tightening; the visitor’s recognition supplies the single reweighting, not the protagonist’s agency.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: post-collapse meaning is re-composed, not discovered. The phoenix-QR and chalk-meal equations particularize the idea; the visitor’s “remembering forward” offers a resonant, non-literal answer. No moral is stated; ambiguity lingers about whether the map changes anything. Subtext lives in the slow measuring of graffiti migrations—gesture as grammar.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays tight to the cartomancer’s perceptual filter: pigment darker than obsidian, tape tongue like a dormant serpent. Syntax lengthens and breathes with her deliberate tempo; rain drumming mirrors impatient fingers without head-hopping. Voice is consistent, textured, and unmuddled by generic loft-poetic diction. Dialogue is minimal but distinctively hers: “Tell me what you see” invites, not tests.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: each sentence layers image or information without scaffold. Metaphors (liquid runes, forgotten bassline) stay coherent and purposeful; no mixed vehicles or synonym loops. Rhythm modulates from slow glyphs to impatient rain drumming, mirroring thematic recomposition. Only hairline slip: “cultural fragments—advertisements, protest chants...” edges toward list, but the dash localizes it.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Post-crypto-collapse cartomancy using a measuring tape as epistemic tool is a fresh synthesis; the QR-phoenix and chalk-meal equations feel inevitable yet unforeseen. Risk lies in the quiet accumulative structure, but it pays off in the final pin. The story could not survive relocation or renaming; its specificity is irreplaceable. No template echo or fad ornamentation detected.</comment>
