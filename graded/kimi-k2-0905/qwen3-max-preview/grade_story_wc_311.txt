<comment>The reaper's interior contradiction—duty-bound yet grieving—remains vivid, but his "heart-carrier" shift is declared more than dramatized; the final smile feels slightly abstract because no micro-choice on this page shows him renouncing an actual alternative action. Emotions stay embodied ("echoes clung to his ribs like frost"), avoiding label-speak. One more visible, costly renunciation on-stage would have secured the 9-band.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: naming the beasts crystallizes grief into beacons, reconfiguring his eternal task with undeniable conceptual cost—"so others might carry less weight." The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout; each naming adds density until the atlas itself glows. Causality is internal but causal nonetheless—because he listens, because he names, the fear is repurposed. Cost is legible in the final line: he is no longer heartbroken but condemned to carry, a stasis that forecloses return to prior detachment.</comment>

<comment>The observatory’s cracked dome and prism shards act as micro-setting that literally refracts the Atlas into crystalline memory; environment constrains the only possible method—scattered light. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: a reaper notices dusk, marble, copper, starlight—materials that outlast flesh. Spatial choreography stays clean as he moves balcony → table → balcony. The setting quietly mirrors his fracture while supplying the exact apparatus required; no postcard tourism.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—transform private grief into shared balm—tightens once: the naming sequence converts abstract sorrow into concrete beacons, foreclosing his earlier detachment. Pressure is accumulative: each beast named adds visible crystal, making the cost legible. Agency is renunciation rather than confrontation; the price is lifelong stewardship of others’ fear. No external antagonist is needed; the conflict is interior and sufficiently escalated under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<comment>Theme emerges without statement:命名剥夺匿名性，从而削弱恐怖—naming defangs terror by making it specific and shared. Subtext operates in the act of renaming "Whirlpool-Eyed Horror" into "Mira, who swallowed screams so others might sleep," turning predator into protector. Final image answers the thematic question—how to live with unending grief—by reframing service to others as the only viable stasis. No moral is declared; resonance is purely imagistic and earned.</comment>

<comment>Voice is lyric-omniscient yet remains anchored to the reaper’s perceptual signature: time is geological, emotion is tidal, light is workable matter. Syntax swells and contracts like breath—“the wind tugged gently at its corners” vs. “He wept then, quietly.” No head-hopping; camera stays tight to his sensorium. Patterned repetition (“echoes forgotten phrases”) is taught early and paid off in the lullaby-hum at exit, justifying the liturgical cadence.</comment>

<comment>Prose density is high—“cloak whispering like regret,” “ink faded into ghosts of leviathans”—yet every metaphor serves atmosphere or theme; no purple drift. Rhythm modulates: long anaphoric sentences for ritual naming, then a short clause “He smiled, just a little” that lands the emotional release. Zero loops or scaffold; no synonym churn. Minor −0.1 for two adjacent “crystal” uses within four lines, not enough to dull closure.</comment>

<comment>Fresh synthesis: grief-management through folkloric re-naming of sea-horrors, a concept not seen in slush. The reaper-as-curator angle inverts the usual harvester trope. Specificity is irreplaceable—only sea monsters+atlas+prism+dusk could enable this exact alchemy. Risk in lyrical accumulative structure pays off: closure earns its uplift without sentimental cheat. Transforms familiar grief-topography into luminous, shareable beacons.</comment>
