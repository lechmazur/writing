<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Interiority is lush, embodied, and specific—her “fingertips brushing the edge of a starlit pool” fuses sensation with metaphysics. The jade cicada anchors a contradictory impulse: to freeze time yet allow transition, dramatized when she pockets it again “its weight now a comfort, a compass.” Micro-choices—dip fingers, offer silence, withhold decision—externalize a hierarchy that values presence over declaration; the final shared pause costs them both forward momentum, paid on-page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each sensory shard layers density until the final “tide turned” reweights earlier images with felt cost. Anchors clear by line 3; grotto, night, alone. Closure is Charged Poise: silence shared, migration tabled, cicada returned—options narrowed, cost legible in exhaled echo. No causal gaps; every beat is perception adding pressure until stance crystallizes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Grotto breathes—stalactite metronome, minor-chord wind in molars—micro-setting becomes body. Starlight on jade cicada charges final image; pool surface mirrors both cosmos and fracture of memory, constraining her theory of granular time. Spatial choreography flawless: footprints lead in, tidal-pool edge, cicada placement tracked without drift. Sensory economy favors touch and sound over visual spectacle, matching her haptic epistemology.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: can love survive migration? Externalized as suspended speech inside grotto heartbeat. Escalation is textural—each droplet, crab scuttle, salt scent accretes until shared exhale forecloses immediate leave-taking. Cost is the conversation’s continued pause; agency lies in choosing not to decide, a stance crystallization paid with future uncertainty.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through motif cluster: tide cycles, cicada metamorphosis, starlight shards—each image of transition re-priced in final “tide turned.” No explicit thesis; meaning accrues via sensory particulars. Subtext in silence: his slumped shoulders = fear of losing her; her smile = acceptance of flux. Final image answers thematic question non-literally: love survives not by solution but by shared threshold vigil.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays close to her sensory filter; diction “starlit pool fractured like memory shards” is both metaphor and perceptual signature. Rhythm modulates—long cadence for retreating foam, clipped when cicada pulses. No head-hopping; companion’s interiority inferred only through posture, maintaining POV modesty. Experimental compression (“Images flickered—not visions, but impressions”) is pattern-taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence layers new sensory angle or metaphoric extension. Figurative language avoids mixed metaphors—“moonlight fractured across its surface like memory shards” remains optically coherent. High information density: one sentence couples tide breath, barnacle tremor, salt scent. Read-aloud rhythm accelerates toward final exhale, then cadence releases with “The tide turned,” mirroring emotional unclenching.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Fusion of marine biology notebook with metaphysical inquiry feels fresh; “texture of time” pursued via barnacle valves rather than clock hands. Cicada relic transformed from cliché into tactile compass. Risk: quiet ending without verbal resolution—yet coherence holds because pressure accumulates inside silence itself. Slight proximity to familiar coastal epiphany template; specificity of “jade cicada mid-chirp” and “molared minor chord” rescues it.</comment>
