<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied (“palms slick against the rust,” “heart hammering”); the filial shame and need to unsilence the disbelieved are dramatized through the lattice insertion and kneeling confession. One micro-choice—wedging the lattice into the lens—carries the entire inherited mistrust and converts it to public witness; the cost (exhaustion, possible madness, eternal guardianship) is felt. No contradictory impulses are shown in-scene; the arc is single-track resolve, so the 9+ bar is missed by a hair.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the beam now carries unassailable testimony, reframing the regional rule-set (“the lighthouse never lies”). Causality is tight: because no one believes the bloodline, he weaponizes the confessional lattice to fuse spectral proof into the light itself. Orientation is anchored by line 3 (“lighthouse prison,” “jagged reef,” dusk), well under the 120-word threshold. Cost is legible in the final slump and the smile that accepts permanent exile from credibility.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Copperlight repose, salt-crusted stones, barnacle and brine—details are filtered through the boy’s tactile urgency and charge every action. The lattice and lens housing act as micro-settings that literally constrain the final mechanical act. Spatial choreography is clean: gate → narrow door → third landing → lantern room → reef below; no impossible jumps. Environment forecloses escape routes (storm-scoured tower, rising tide of ghosts), satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“before they find the bodies”—is signaled in paragraph 2 and tightens with each climb. The single decisive turn (lattice into lens) escalates from personal redemption to public revelation, narrowing options to irreversible fusion of truth and light. Pressure is accumulative/textural: each ghost’s arrival thickens air and bends light, reweighting the stake from secrecy to collective vindication. Cost is visible in the boy’s spent collapse and the perpetual haunting of the beam.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: inherited mistrust can only be dissolved by weaponizing the very medium of disbelief into a perpetual witness. The lattice—once a container for private guilt—becomes a broadcast antenna for collective truth, reconfiguring the moral calculus without a stated moral. Final image (“the lighthouse never lies”) offers a resonant, non-literal answer: truth needs no believers when it is baked into the world’s machinery. No thematic echo or sermonizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to the boy; perceptual signature is maritime-gothic (“wind gnawed,” “copperlight repose,” “brine and candle wax”). Rhythm accelerates with parataxis during ascent, then slows into luminous cadence as the beam folds. No head-hopping; unreliability is hinted but never confirmed, keeping distance clean. Voice is distinct, sustained, and modulates with physiological stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Sentences vary from short gasps to long, light-laden clauses; no template cadence or synonym loops. Figurative language is dense yet coherent—metaphors of origami, shroud, breath—each serving the transformation of light into testimony. No mixed metaphors in the climactic beat. Minor scaffold: “the lattice… the lattice…” twice in close succession costs a tenth. Otherwise high-density, propulsive, and clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Inverts the cry-wolf parable into a ghost-engineered truth-machine; the fresh inflection is using a confessional lattice as optical firmware for collective memory. Specificity of place (storm-ruined lighthouse prison) and object (warped booth lattice) makes the fantastical feel inevitable. Risk—merging spectral testimony into navigational light—pays off thematically and visually. No close echoes; the synthesis feels singular.</comment>
