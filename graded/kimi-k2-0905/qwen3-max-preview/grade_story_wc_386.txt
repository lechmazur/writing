<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The ghost-whisperer’s interior contradiction—needing truth yet fearing its shatter—peaks when she palms the warm globe and chooses to set it in ice; the haptic micro-choice costs her the comfort of keeping the echo, earning a credible renunciation. Embodied emotion stays concrete (breath curling like incense, palms flat to ice), but “truth, when mishandled, shatters” drifts toward aphorism, blunting full specificity. The child’s cameo-logic is felt only off-page; because the sole on-page agent is the woman, the relational crucible and secondary-pressure bullets are N/A, capping the arc just below 8.8.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each dream shard layers density until the globe’s placement in the ice-window crystallizes a Charged Poise that reconfigures meaning with undeniable conceptual cost—strangers’ dreams will fade, the echo now irreversibly housed in glacier. Anchor who/where/when is taught by line 3; the 120-word test is met without penalty. The closure beat (“a sigh…not wind, not voice, but release”) lands the RR with cost, satisfying 9+ quick test, but the causal chain between dream-cataloguing and the sigh is implied rather than dramatized, keeping the score below 8.8.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Setting charges the final image: the ice-window recess literally shapes the globe’s placement, making glacier ice the frame that reweights the echo. Sensory economy is tight—candle-flame trapped in ice-lampposts, unnerving warmth against glacial chill—mirroring internal release without overt symbolism. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible positions. The shrine’s rules stay consistent, learned through action, anchoring the fantastical in tactile cold.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Single dominant stake—salvage uncorrupted echo—tightens when the whisperer realizes the child only wants delivery, not return, narrowing her option from keeper to relinquisher. Escalation is textural: dream shards accumulate until the globe’s ice-window placement forecloses possession. Cost is felt (she smiles faintly, leaves the shrine empty-handed), but the tightening is narrated rather than dramatized in scene, capping high-band entry.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: salvage as tender stewardship, not extraction, reframed when the globe becomes a window for others’ repair. The ending’s ripple-dreams (fisherman calling daughter, widow scattering ashes) offer a Conceptual Repricing that reweights the premise—salvage propagates outward, unpaid. Subtext lives in gesture (globe cradled, then released). No moral is declared; resonance lingers in borrowed starlight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person lyric voice sustains a glacial cadence—long breath-unit sentences that mirror suspended ice-time—without drum-beat monotony. Perceptual signature is particular: “breath curling like incense,” “borrowed starlight,” filtering through a disciplined mystic lexis. No dialogue appears; voice avoids explaining what images already show. Register remains within POV ken, but “windows of connection” as coined term edges close to thematic label-speak, preventing 9.0.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence layers new image or pressure. Metaphors stay coherent—glass softened by pressure/time, miniature town a slumped smear—without mixed-vehicle clutter. Information density is high; one line can do three jobs (“She weaves truth carefully, this woman who speaks to the drowned and the dreaming…”). Opening and closing lines precisely bracket voice and re-charge motif. A single near-purple phrase (“dawn bleeds violet”) is earned by accumulated chill, not intrusive.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fusion of wreck-diver, ghost-whisperer, and dream-cartographer in a glacier shrine is non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Risky second-person–tinged lyric compression (“you’ll be safe”) pays off by crystallizing the child’s voice inside external narration. Specificity of cameo-mapping across Reykjavik/Kyoto/Lisbon prevents template abstraction. The premise commits fully; no retreat into safe metaphor. Fresh inflection: salvage as propagation, not possession—an angle not seen in maritime ghost lore.</comment>
