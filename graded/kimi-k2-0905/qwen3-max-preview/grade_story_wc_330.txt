<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The carpenter’s silence is convincingly rooted in vocation, not gimmick; his “interpret silence as possibility” motive is dramatized through sanding, carving, and the final wordless song. Interiority stays concrete—hands rough, breath rhythm, bone hum—avoiding label-speak. The only reason he stops short of 9 is that the renunciation (speech forever forsaken) is assumed rather than tested in a moment of temptation; the cost is felt but not crystallized in a single, legible beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each sensory layer (mist, dust, halo glow, wind-bell chime) thickens the hush until the carousel’s resurrection reweights the stake. Closure is a Charged Poise—the halo-crowned carousel turns in silence—whose conceptual cost (he will remain forever voice-outside-the-world) is unmistakable. Orientation is secured by line 3; the clown-signpost misstep is the causal pivot that teaches the pattern. No loops or causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Environment is not backdrop but tool: the moss-swallowed wheels, caramel-ghost air, and constellations on the ceiling directly constrain what can be restored and how. The halo fragment functions as micro-setting—its cold curve determines the carousel pole’s fit and final crown. Sensory hierarchy obeys POV: a carpenter notices grain, gleam, wood scent, not tourist vistas. Minor slip: “misting hush” is repeated adjectivally without fresh sensory twist near the end, keeping it just beneath the 9-band gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake: beauty left incomplete is a wound; pressure escalates as each restored horse narrows the possibility of turning back—by dusk the carousel must spin or the wound gapes. The carpenter’s agency is continuous—every chisel stroke forecloses rest or speech. Cost is visible: splinters in skin, dawn-thinned mist, and the irreversible commitment implied when the first horse circles. One hairline slip: the “no map dared claim” phrase over-intensifies without on-page cartographic consequence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from action, not aphorism: silence as generative medium, finished beauty as secular sacrament. The final image of the halo crown spinning above wooden beasts reconfigures “salvation” from religious to artisanal. No tidy moral—readers may read triumph or tragic exile. Subtext lives in gesture: the single smile is the only overt emotional signal, making it resonate like a bell after wordless pages.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited adheres to the carpenter’s perceptual palette—grain, gleam, chime—without leaking omniscience. Rhythm modulates: long syrup sentences during dream approach, staccato “He worked” clauses under dawn pressure. Non-standard grammar (“time slowed like syrup”) is voice-motivated and consistent. No dialogue to distort cadence; wind-bell chimes substitute for spoken counterpoint.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; clause lengths mimic breath of sanding, turning, singing. Metaphors stay concrete (halo as “captured star exhaling”) and internally coherent. A single scaffold loop—“the misting hush outside thickened / the hush remained, deeper now”—is allowable as pattern reinforcement. No mixed metaphors or register drift; every sentence advances image or pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Silent carousel-carpenter resurrects abandoned circus train via wordless song: the synthesis feels inevitable yet non-obvious. The halo fragment’s repurposing as crown converts relic into tool, avoiding preciousness. Risk—entire story hinging on a wordless protagonist—heightens rather than obscures stakes. Fresh inflection: beauty as wound, silence as suture, carousel as cathedral—none exist in prior templates.</comment>
