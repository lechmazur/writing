<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Ripple-mark’s barefoot “reading” of the cave and her refusal to flee give embodied, specific interiority; the final renunciation—handing over the stone—carries visible cost. Yet she remains slightly mythic; no interior contradiction or flaw complicates her calm, so the arc is more fable than crucible. Still, her silence-as-architecture credo drives every beat and the ending stance is earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of gathering quiet → release. Orientation anchored by word 50; closure is a Charged Poise—the being curls around the stone, dawn-mist light reweights “storm tuned, not banished.” Cost is the stone’s spent glow and her onward solitude; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The harmonic caves are not backdrop but instrument: limestone throats, glacial seams, thermal vents all dictate how hush can be harvested. Micro-setting (echo stone, ice fractures) literally constrains her method and charges the final image. Spatial choreography is immaculate; no description is tourism—every detail either amplifies or absorbs frequency.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“find the quiet”—is signaled in paragraph 2; escalation is textural: each absorption brightens the stone and softens a being, tightening the sonic stakes. The central choice (offer the stone) forecloses her stored silence; price is legible as the stone dims and she walks on. No reversal, but the pattern deepens once meaningfully.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the inversion of storm = noise, silence = architecture; no authorial statement, only the image of lightning turned candle-glow. Final image re-weights prior motifs without moral: caves “breathed… balanced.” Subtext rests in the stone’s spent light—quiet as gift, not conquest. Complexity holds; no tidy maxim.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays tight to Ripple-mark’s perceptual filter: “bare feet reading the floor like braille.” Syntax mirrors sonic cadence—long vowels for hums, clipped beats for fractures. No head-hop; diction stays within cave-and-cartography lexicon. Compression (“storm hadn’t been banished; it had been tuned”) is pattern-taught and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with scene pressure—clause lengthening under hum, fragment bursts under crack release. Metaphors are sustained (ice as score, limestone as throat) without mixed-vehicle clash. No filler, no synonym loops; information is double-layered (sonic + emotional). Final line is propulsive yet open. Only hairline slip: “hammered repose” leans toward badge.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Silence-as-weapon via geode is fresh; fracture-pattern score and barefoot cartographic skin feel idiosyncratic, not quirky. Premise follows声学 logic without late rule patches. Risk—lyric accumulation instead of battle—heightens stakes and pays off. Could swap caves for deep-forest, but sonic specificity roots it. Synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
