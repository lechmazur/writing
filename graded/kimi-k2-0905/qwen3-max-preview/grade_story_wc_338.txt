<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The protagonist’s quiet, attentive agency—kneeling, brushing, aligning footage—feels lived-in and specific; her childhood memory of drowned villages anchors the obsession without explanatory bulk. Interior contradiction is present but thin: she “weeps, not from sorrow, but from recognition,” a label that grazes rather than pierces. The final act (leaving yarrow) crystallizes her stance, yet the cost is more conceptual than visceral; we feel awe, not forfeiture. Still, the character’s perceptual signature is strong enough to lift the beat into high-band territory.</comment>

<comment>The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: shadow-shifts accrue across reels until the spiral pattern reweights the stake—silence as vessel, not void. Closure is a Charged Poise: the projected chapel silhouette, pooled in dusk, reconfigures meaning without rebuilding stone; the tear in the map becomes an invitation, paid for by years of solitary frame-work. Cost is legible in the final image—“she packed her gear with shielded openness”—a bodily acknowledgment that the witness will carry the hush outward. No causality break; ellipsis is motivated, pattern taught early, payoff on the last line.</comment>

<comment>The vault’s condensation droplets, vellum fray, and yarrow sprig are not garnish—they dictate tempo and tool use. The henge’s menhir functions as pivot and projector; its western face becomes the screen where shadow-chapel materializes, so environment literally delivers the image that reweights the premise. Micro-setting (torn map edge) constrains her tripod placement, aligning lens with rupture, stitching unknown to known. Weather-softened fresco pigment offers tactile grip for fingertips, grounding scale and era without catalog excess.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—prove that erased silence can still testify—tightens when spiral path emerges; each reel comparison forecloses the possibility of random shadow drift. Agency is attention itself: she chooses to sit and wait for dusk rather than excavate, narrowing her options to witness, not intervene. The single meaningful deepening occurs when software traces the organic spiral, converting archival noise into choreography; this reweights silence from absence to presence with conceptual cost—she will leave without ever touching brick. No external antagonist needed; pressure is temporal and epistemic.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as negative-space preservation: what is removed continues to shape terrain. The torn map, erased chapel, and evaporated pigment are particulars that generalize into meditation on cultural erasure without sermon. Subtext operates in light gradients—shadow lengthening is the only “speech” the chapel can utter. Final image (yarrow on stone) offers non-literal answer: testimony is an offering, not a structure; resonance lingers because the particulars never dissolve into maxim.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays close to her skin: “fingertips brushing,” “heart unarmored yet guarded by awe.” Perceptual signature is cartographic—she notices alignment, fray, pigment bleed—never generic awe. Syntax lengthens under contemplation, then tightens into single-word fragments (“It wasn’t erosion. / It wasn’t trick of light.”) to mimic frame-by-frame cuts. No dialogue, so voice compression is achieved through rhythmic caesurae that echo 16mm splice marks.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Density is high: each sentence performs witness-work—advancing spiral, staining stone, or reweighting silence. Figurative control keeps vehicles meteorological (“arches wept condensation”) and geological (“map tears”), never mixing planes. No loops, no scaffold; even repeated “not” denials serve percussive negation that accrues into proof. Final line cadence—“invisibly, audibly, eternally”—triples adverbs yet lands because prior particulars have earned the abstraction.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fusion of archival forensics with prehistoric henge as projector feels non-obvious yet inevitable. Risk in structure—lyric accumulative shards without dialogue—pays off when shadow-chapel materializes as literal projection. Familiar trope of lost chapel is transformed through negative-space choreography and refusal to excavate; testimony replaces relic. Specificity of 1953 botanist reels vs 2019 drone scans roots freshness in verifiable tech rather than gimmick.</comment>
