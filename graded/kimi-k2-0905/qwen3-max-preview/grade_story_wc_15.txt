<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The weaver’s contradictory impulses—reverence vs. defiance, silence vs. song—surface in the embodied act of stitching fractures; needle-scars and salt-taste make motive visceral. The final choice to keep mending, not erasing, is earned by ancestral weight and the immediate warmth of the plate. Cost is legible: she forfeits guild safety and accepts sleepless return. Voice stays singular, though the lyric register occasionally abstracts interiority.

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the plate pulses, child and storm re-animated, canyon walls unfurl ghost tapestries—an undeniable before/after under the Accumulative/Textural lens. Each lyrical return tightens the pattern rather than resetting; the final overlap in her sleep-map is the decisive cadence shift. Causality is lyrical but coherent: because she stitches memory, therefore the labyrinth exhales trapped song. Orientation is taught early via barefoot dust and moon-pale intuition; no debt.

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Red canyon walls curve like cupped palms, plate warms into velvet heartbeat—environment and object constrain every stitch she chooses. Spatial choreography is clean: kneel, rise, deeper spiral, star-loom above. Sensory hierarchy obeys dream-logic, narrowing to salt, orchid breeze, starlight. The loom-shaped constellation at the end re-images setting as ancestral witness, charging closure.

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Single stake: rewrite fate of broken precedents via sewing. Pressure intensifies as each stitch re-animates plate and canyon—one meaningful deepening, no reversals needed. Agency is continuous; coincidence absent. Cost is felt heat in her palms and the canyon’s exhalation of dead voices; tactics shift from quiet kneel to determined onward walk.

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through fracture-to-filigree image chain: ruin is not erased but re-patterned into blueprint. Subtext whispers in ghost tapestries and rearranged stars—no elder sermon required. Final image of child stepping from plate with storm offers resonant, non-moral answer. Ambiguity lingers: guild may still condemn, canyon may fall silent tomorrow.

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Lyric first-person omniscient is stable, taught by first sentence’s “centuries-old labyrinth” and held to last star-loom. Syntax ripples like tide—long breaths for canyon, needle-sharp fragments for stitches. No head-hop; knowledge stays bounded to dreamer. Register never drifts into workshop voice; diction stays salt-lick, orchid-solace, whale-song.

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Sentences braid concrete nouns and strong verbs: “thread curling like smoke,” “dust that tasted of forgotten hymns.” No looped stems or synonym churn; each image adds new pressure. Metaphors stay physically coherent within dream-logic. Occasional elevated lyricism is pattern-taught and pays off at closure without clutter.

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Mythic weaving meets artifact mending in a red-canyon dream-map—synthesis feels inevitable, not grafted. Risk: lyric escalation instead of causal reversals, but coherence holds. Plate-as-heart, star-loom, orchid-solace are non-portable particulars. No trope is left stock; even “ghosts of salt” is re-sung into new cadence.
