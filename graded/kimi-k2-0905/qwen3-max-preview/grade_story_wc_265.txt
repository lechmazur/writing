<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The philosopher’s curiosity and practiced resignation are vivid, but interior contradiction is only asserted (“wanted rediscovery yet kept the gear”). Embodied emotion peaks at mercury waterfall; afterward he becomes a serene pilgrim without visible cost on the page. Closure feels lightly earned because the gear’s refusal to fall is external magic rather than a choice that hurts.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each metallic vignette layers sensory density until the void-music reweights the stake. Orientation is taught by word 30 (“tumbling through the canopy”), so no penalty. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration—the spinning gear and colorless light re-price the world—but the cost is conceptual rather than viscerally felt, clipping the top band.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mechanical rainforest is rendered with ear, eye, and weight: “brass vines recoiled,” “flowers of spun steel bloomed only when he passed.” Mercury waterfall and spinning gear both charge the final image. One-to-one mapping of tree type to metallic timbre is economical world-rule exposition. Environment literally parts for him, so it constrains movement and elevates the 9-band gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“rediscover the wild frontier of his mind”—is signaled early. Pressure tightens once: dipping the gear into mercury makes it heavier, a micro-turn that foreshadows frequency-key revelation. Cost is conceptual (abandoning old cognition) rather than tangible; absence of a visible forfeiture keeps it below 8.0.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from inversion: cognition as cartography, wilderness as internal. Final “frontier of his own becoming” reweights earlier metallic map imagery without moralizing. Subtextual tension between listener and witness positions is subtle but present. The conceptual repricing lands cleanly, satisfying the 9- gate for non-literal answer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays close to his perceptual filter; diction (“tuning fork struck against the ribs of reality”) is character-apt. Compression is taught early (“he’d translocated during sleep again”) and paid off at the Edge. No dialogue to test distinction, yet interior cadence modulates from wince to laugh. Rhythm accelerates into breathless fragments as static becomes music, matching emotional crest.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Strong read-aloud cadence with varied sentence ingress; “roots retracted with pneumatic hisses” does double sensory work. Occasional stacked modifiers (“mossy oil from before the sixth sense awakened”) verge on purple but stay within voice. No scaffold loops or synonym churn; mercury dip and void crossing are cleanly sequenced. Metaphor vehicles remain physically coherent inside the alloyed ecology.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Metallic rainforest plus intuition-as-sound-map is a fresh synthesis; the gear-as-frequency-key inverts the typical MacGuffin. Risk is taken with the Edge-void sequence that could read as empty mysticism, yet it is grounded by prior acoustic logic. Concept commits fully—no retreat to literal explanation. While “philosopher seeks self” is ancient, the sonic engineering of cognition feels new.</comment>
