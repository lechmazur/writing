<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The seer’s longing for “the shape of home” is visceral and embodied, but the interior contradiction—why she now buries rather than awakens talent—arrives as declarative backstory instead of a pressured micro-choice; the renunciation is felt yet not dramatized in-scene, so the cost is legible but not fully earned by prior causal beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the stone cracks open and the shelves rearrange into an archway of her own language, costing her the prophet’s detachment—an undeniable before/after under an Accumulative/Textural lens; orientation anchors by word 60, well within the 120-word safety window, and the final image reweights all prior texture-work with felt cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The mountain-bookstore’s breathing corridors and mercury surfaces are not postcard garnish—they physically shift to form the archway that admits her into her archived life; the lost language stone and raven feather function as micro-setting that constrain every tactile gesture, directly charging the closure image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recovering “home” via texture—is signaled early; the single deepening occurs when the feather dissolves and gravity anchors her feet, foreclosing itinerant prophecy with visible price; pressure intensifies under Accumulative lens through density of haptic detail rather than causal reversal, sufficient for this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: home as resonance retrieved through synesthetic memory-work; the final image of the stone’s pulse quieting into lived language re-weights the entire motif chain, offering a non-literal answer that resists moralizing while leaving charged ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Voice is mercury-slow, synesthetic, and rhythmically controlled; perceptual signature is laser-specific—“obsidian wind,” “stormcloud leather”—without overwriting; no head-hop, no filter-verb clutter; compression taught early (“she substituted reality…with textures”) pays off in closure’s haptic gravity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Line-level craft is near-flawless: varied sentence cadence, zero paraphrase loops, high information density; figurative layering is dense yet coherent because the physical logic (glass, mercury, stone) remains consistent; only micro-slip—“downward pull that anchored her feet” slightly duplicates “steady her breath” in semantic cluster—stops this short of 9+.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The premise of a prophet who reverses her gift by seeding her own memory-texture into a mountain archive feels fresh; raven-feather as tactile trigger and bookstore-as-mountain are specific synthesis, not stock occult tropes; risk in lyric accumulative structure pays off in closure, though indebted to Borges/Valérian echoes.</comment>
