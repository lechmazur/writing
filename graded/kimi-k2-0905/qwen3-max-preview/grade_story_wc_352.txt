<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The “prism-minded” trait stays ornamental; Elira’s choices are reactive fetch-quests rather than interior contradiction. No contradictory impulse is dramatized; the only micro-choice—tracing the sigil—repeats skill already claimed. Closure cost is asserted (“the chamber sealed”) not felt; she exits smiling, path unblocked. Interiority is scenic catalogue, not embodied stakes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Causal chain is legible: inverted gravity → thresholds open → sigil guides → chamber yields Seed. Orientation anchors (who/where) appear by line 3; no penalty. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration: world re-rights, chamber seals, Seed now whispering—conceptual cost legible. Yet tightening is single-turn; no option narrows before the wall peels apart, so escalation feels foregone rather than earned.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Phosphorescent moss, floating silt, root-bridge underside—each image is filtered through Elira’s pattern-vision and integrated into motion. Inverted gravity is not merely spectacle; it enables the only path to the chamber, hence constrains tactics. Spatial choreography is clean; no geography drift. Final chamber image recharges “clandestinely luminous” motif, satisfying 9+ gate for environment-charged closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—retrieve Seed of Vigilance—signaled early. One meaningful tightening: wall sighs open only after sigil tracing + dialect sequence; options narrow from “search entire grotto” to “this seam.” Cost is conceptual (world re-gravitized, chamber sealed) but not viscerally felt by Elira—she smiles, stakes deflate. Agency is present but low-pressure; gravity inversion does the work.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly: vigilance lives in margins, doodles, negative space—echoed by margin-doodle key and final “spaces between breaths.” No explicit thesis; final image reweights prior marginalia without moralizing. Subtext operates through motif return (spiral, seven eyes, Seed layers). Ambiguity preserved; complexity acknowledged rather than tidied.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person close stays locked to Elira; perceptual signature vivid (“synaptic threads glowing,” “powdered stars”). Diction—“clandestinely luminous,” “prism-minded”—is compressed yet patterned; syntax flexes with pressure. No dialogue to judge; voice remains coherent under inverted-physics stress. Minor elevated register drifts (“conceptual repricing”) but within archivist lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>High metaphor density in every sentence risks purple fatigue, yet each vehicle serves atmosphere or physics rule; limited −0.3. No scaffold loops or synonym churn; sentences vary openings. Information density strong: one line often does two jobs (e.g., “boots left no prints” shows weightlessness + character habit). Closing couplet relaxes cadence, giving earned exhale.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Familiar “lost archive / inversion key” scaffold is re-animated through sensory specificity and marginalia-as-key twist. Spiral-map, gravity-clock, Seed-of-Vigilance feel particular to this grotto rather than generic genre parts. Fresh inflection: doodle as living threshold. Risk level moderate; success relies on texture more than conceptual leap, but texture is rich enough to lift above template.</comment>
