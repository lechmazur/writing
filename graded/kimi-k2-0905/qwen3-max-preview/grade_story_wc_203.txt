<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied (“brushed dust from knees,” shallow breath) and the paternal link to the child’s drawing gives emotional stakes. Yet the technician’s core contradiction—repairman vs ghost-witness—never complicates his tactics; he proceeds exactly as expected. The final “weightless burden” is declared, not dramatized through a micro-choice that costs him anything on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the bagged artifacts and closed door crystallize a new equilibrium—ghosts acknowledged, story preserved—felt cost is the lifelong responsibility he now carries. Causal chain is lean: because he uses the barrel, he sees the dust-woman; because he witnesses, he archives; because he archives, the building “exhales.” No plot amnesia or teleporting props; spatial choreography of stool/tile/bucket is clean.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Ticket office is textured through technician’s tool-mediated gaze: popcorn-sawdust smell, water-stained tile, moonlit dust curls. The mainspring barrel doubles as micro-setting that refracts light and reveals footprints—environment actively constrains discovery. Single drop into bucket at end re-weights the silence, fusing setting and closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“discover what ceilings hide”—is signaled early and tightens once: spiral footprints vanish overhead, forcing the climb. Escalation is accumulative/textural: dust patterns deepen, silence thickens, object emerges; no causal reversal but a single meaningful deepening that narrows options to “witness or walk away.” Cost is conceptual—eternal custodianship—visible in evidence bag and gentle door click.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of custodial attention emerges through concrete ritual: noticing dust, archiving remnants, closing door. Child’s drawing + pearl button re-circulate as silent plea against erasure; final image of “C_R_U_” marquee half-dream reweights neglect into vigil. No moralizing—meaning stays implicit, earned by tactile choices.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to technician’s perceptual signature: mechanical metaphors, light angles, tool logic. Syntax lengthens during discovery then contracts at exit, mirroring breath. No head-hopping or filter-verb clutter; diction stays within plausible repairman lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence. Figurative language is sparse and purposeful—“dust like fleeing children” compresses time and guilt. High information density: one sentence often does description, emotion, and foreshadowing. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; copy is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Ghost-as-neglect is familiar, but the mainspring-barrel-as-mirror forensic method feels fresh and specific to character craft. Circus aftermath seen through repairman’s archive ritual flips standard haunting trope into conservation parable. Risk is moderate; synthesis is coherent and memorable.</comment>
