<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elara’s “collects stories not profit” motive is vivid, but her interiority turns abstract in the crucial courtyard beats: “trauma echoes” and “curates catharsis” are diagnostic labels rather than embodied contradiction. The renunciation of the locket is credible because her prior micro-choice to hum instead of knock shows listening overriding acquisition, earning the relinquishment with visible cost—she gives away the object and the story it contains.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly as Charged Poise: the mailbox exhales and Leo’s weep converts the locket’s grief from private echo to communal witness, reweighting Elara’s rule-set—objects leave when their story is heard. Causal chain is slim (“hum therefore door opens”) but acceptable under Situational lens because the emotional pressure is coherent and the cost (Leo’s tear-streaked laughter) is on-page. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Jasmine and waking birds are selective, but the courtyard never physically constrains choices; it’s backdrop rather than tactical space. The locked mailbox functions as micro-setting and recurs with state change (closed → organic click), satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography stays clean across the four-day stoop vigils.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“will the story inside the locket reach its keeper?”—tightens through Elara’s refusal to knock, narrowing her option to only humming; the visible cost is four dawns of uncertain return and final surrender of the object. Agency is present but low-heat; escalation is more accretive than perilous, fitting the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</question><comment>Theme of listening-as-healing emerges from the humming ritual and mailbox payoff rather than assertion; the final image of the seashell “thank you” reweights the courtyard into a perpetual exchange without moralizing. Avoids tidy closure by letting Leo keep both grief and laughter—ambiguity is purposeful, not evasive.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person lyric voice maintains consistent perceptual signature—“tarnished silver with a hairline hinge fracture” is curator-precise. Compression such as “voice rough as unwashed linen” is taught early and paid off; no head-hopping. Filter verbs are minimal; syntax modulates between cataloguing precision and tender cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Strong read-aloud rhythm and sentence variety; only one scaffold loop (“humming again. And the next.”) that mildly dulls momentum. Metaphors stay coherent; no mixed vehicles. Information density high—one line often advances atmosphere, character, and object state simultaneously.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Collecting “stories not objects” is a fresh inflection on found-object tale; the locked mailbox that opens only when matchmaking is complete is a non-obvious mechanic that feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk is gentle rather than bold, keeping score just above median excellence.</comment>
