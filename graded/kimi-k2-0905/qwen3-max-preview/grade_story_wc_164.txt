<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The recollectionist’s embodied, salt-crusted interiority and her micro-choice to press the seed to her temple rather than map-read crystallize a distinctive, sensuous intellect. The only slack is the late, summary “she laughed… recognition” beat that tells epiphany rather than dramatizing the contradiction; still, the renunciation of solving and embrace of carrying loss is earned and paid for with the crater-glass pendant weight.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: “They were given away” reweights every prior breadcrumb under a Hybrid lens (accumulative lyric shimmer, situational stance crystallization). Orientation is taught early via barefoot skip and shimmering walls; crater-glass memory rules are cued before the climax, so no debt. Cost is visible—“cool, humming, alive with borrowed memories”—and forecloses the original quest.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Geode walls, phosphorescent moss, and crater glass are not backdrop but tools: the seed-crevices dictate retrieval method, the glass supplies the final vision. Sensory economy favors aurora-shimmer and salt-skin, omitting gratuitous five-sense tours. Spatial choreography stays clean across barefoot crouch-to-stand; the pendant’s new weight charges the exit image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“why paths disappear”—tightens once: from mystery to gift. The crater-glass vision is the single deepening that reweights options; cost is the surrender of certainty, felt in the pendant’s cool hum. Agency remains hers: she chooses to transliterate, to touch the glass, to scatter new seeds. No reversals beyond this, but one is sufficient at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges as joyful relinquishment rather than loss; the image of scattering seeds as confetti re-prices “disappearance” as generative. Subtext resides in the paradox “cheerful gloom,” modulated through cave-echo giggles. No moralizing—final line trusts image to reweight. Particulars (moon-kelp pouch, kelp-paper) keep universals anchored.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lyrical omniscience stays stable; perceptual signature is sea-foam, salt-crust, bubble-echo. Syntax flexes with pressure—“wings folding inward” compresses grief into three beats. No dialogue, so no contamination. Filter verbs (“she felt”) are sparse and earned; rhythmic control supports breathless skip without drumbeat monotony.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Density is high—most sentences double-duty atmosphere + motive. Figurative layering (aurora walls, cheerful gloom) remains coherent; no mixed metaphors. Minor scaffold: “then” adverbial openings cluster in two lines, not enough to dull closure. Final line varies length for cadence lift. Clean grammar, no typos.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Seed-as-compass via emotion-transliteration is a fresh inversion of map trope; crater-glass memory theft deepens cosmology without exposition. Risk of lyric overload is embraced yet controlled, yielding new image set. Transformation test fails if paths = generic loss—here gift-economy reconfiguration is specific. Voice texture (salt, foam, echo) is memorable and inseparable from premise.</comment>
