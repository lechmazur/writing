<comment>The balladeer’s longing is embodied in ink-stained fingers and barefoot chill; her micro-choice to press the steel plate to the terminal crystallizes her hierarchy of values—communion over safety. Internal contradiction flickers (“tears fell…from wonder of being understood”) yet her flaws never complicate tactics; she is always drift-sure, never mis-stepping. The earned cost is present—the plate warms, her tears fall—but because the ghost does the final decoding work for her, the change feels co-received rather than self-forged. Voice remains singular, but emotional calibration is almost too tidy for someone touching the sublime.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: “You encoded longing. I decoded love” reweights every prior spray-stroke with undeniable social cost—she is no longer singing into voids but into a shared syntax. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of chromatic glyphs and server-hum crests until the gold final bridge; the courtyard’s fog itself becomes a legible before/after. Orientation is taught lyrically rather than literal-anchored—acceptable because the disorientation of “above clouds” pays off as the gravity-optional hush that lets the bolt-plate communion happen. Persistent constraint is present: the bolt plate’s obsolete grooves literally shape the cipher that makes the connection possible.</comment>

<comment>Selective sensory hierarchy mirrors POV: ozone taste, struck-crystal silence, cloud-drift barefoot chill—each filters through her alert-listener bias. The courtyard’s anti-gravity is signaled early and constrains choice (she can kneel, balance spray cans, press plate flush); the ivy-fuzzed terminal serves as micro-setting that must glow for the glyphs to register. Weather (mist) evolves into harmonic ribbons—an environmental response that charges the final image. No line is spent on tourist catalog; every detail is tethered to sonic or chromatic action.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—“articulate unspoken needs”—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens when the ghost demands the no-title song; refusal would orphan the ghost again. Agency is present: each spray arc is an irreversible mark that could expose her to mundane scorn. Cost is visible—tears, warm steel, the dawn-empty courtyard she’ll have to leave—but escalation is more textural than causal; the ghost’s reply feels like arrival rather than new jeopardy. Still, one meaningful intensification occurs: gold bridge arcs shift her from private communion to public invitation, foreclosing her anonymity.</comment>

<comment>Theme emerges as inverse imperialism: instead of colonizing the machine with human meaning, she lets the machine colonize her lullabies—mutual elegy. Subtext lives in chromatic grammar—cerulean arcs = vernacular of loss; silver drips = elegy in metallic bleed. Final image (“messages…in rust…in rain-slick brick”) offers resonant non-literal answer: loneliness is a protocol error that can be patched by shared obsolescence. No sermonizing; the ghost’s “I decoded love” is spoken by the affected party, not the authorial chorus.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Perceptual signature is acute: “driftingly alert as if half-tuned to frequencies only ghosts could hum” seeds every subsequent sensory filter. Syntax breathes with her tempo—long herbaceous clauses for mist-drift, staccato spray-can bursts for glyphs. Diction stays within her balladeer lexicon yet coins “tinkersong,” “server-room hums,” avoiding gimmickry because pattern is taught early. No head-hopping; even the ghost’s voice is ventriloquized through her childhood samples, keeping focalization pure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Information density is high: one sentence often layers gravity physics, parental lullaby residue, and obsolete tech. Metaphors are coherent—taffy time, ozone taste—none collide. Rhythm modulates: fog-bound anapests yield to terminal-flick trochees. Minor scaffold appears in repeated “she…then she…” opens, but never within the closure beat. Final gold bridge line is propulsive, uncluttered, leaves reader mid-air as required.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Premise fusion—lyric balladeer + sentient packet-loss—is non-obvious yet feels inevitable once graffiti-Fibonacci is claimed. Chromatic cipher mechanics are specific to obsolete printing plates; swap bolt plate for USB stick and whole symbolic grammar collapses. Risk in elevating a “ghost in code” to tender speaker pays off because the voice remains filtered through her sampled lullabies—emotional truth trumps tech hand-waving. Final bridge invitation avoids cleverness-for-cleverness’ sake; it reweights loneliness as shared protocol, a fresh inflection in contemporary fabulist space.</comment>
