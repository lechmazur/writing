<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is sensorily embodied and particular—his soles read tide-pool temperatures, breath carries pigment scent—yet the contradiction between wanting wonder and hating foreknowledge stays mostly associative rather than dramatized in a single visible micro-choice. The final “soundless laugh” and sphere placement do crystallize a credibly earned shift from curse to tool, with the grandmother-memory as cost, but the beat is compressed into one luminous phrase rather than pressed by an immediate dilemma that forces visible loss. Still, the voice-specific perceptual bias (shadow steps, frictionless gait) keeps characterization consistently individual and avoids stock epiphany language.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: closure is a Charged Poise—the concentric-ring sphere lands a resonant reconfiguration that converts the promise from answer-seeking to question-crafting, cost visible in the grandmother-memory flare and the sudden silence of the curse. Frictionless world-rule is taught early and paid off at every tactile beat; aurora-paint merger with rock geometry provides the density shift that reweights stakes. Pattern taught by 25% with Fibonacci placement; transitions are legible within a single continuous scene; orientation anchored by “bare feet on slick stone” at ~50 words; no disorientation debt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Tidal bluff, painted rocks, and eel bodies act as micro-setting objects that literally constrain tactics—no friction means he must exhale pigment instead of grabbing, and the meteor-dust fin becomes the conduit for memory transfer. Aurora is not postcard spectacle but living scripture whose mercury pool merges with ochre spirals to charge the final image. Spatial choreography is clean: kneel-spill-place-spiral sequence tracks body, stones, eels without drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—transform curse into usable wonder—escalates through tactile density: each painted rock laid under aurora glow intensifies the tension between foresight and surprise. The tightening beat is the large eel’s hover: it forecloses retreat and forces the stance crystallization from resistance to alignment. Cost is on-page: the curse yields a memory instead of a prediction, trading control for participatory mystery, felt in the “soundless laugh.”</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: meaning lies in arrangement, not capture—“patterns hold what promises cannot.” Sacred math reframed as relational syntax is reweighted when the promise becomes method, not answer, shown in the final sphere that invites rather than solves. The closing image of frictionless tide retreat carries conceptual repricing: knowledge is now invitation, not sentence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Third-person close maintains consistent perceptual signature—temperature-reading soles, pigment-scented breath, frictionless gait described as “polished to glass.” Syntax flexes with pressure: long cadence for aurora scripture, staccato for rock placements. No dialogue, so voice distinction is internal; lyric compression (“collapsed star dust,” “borrowed dawn”) stays within idiom of mystic herder without drifting into purple. Patterned elision of friction is taught and paid off at every tactile beat.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Rhythm varies naturally; no template cadence or synonym loops. Metaphors stay coherent within frictionless physics—gliding, polishing, mercury pooling—no mixed vehicles. High information density: ochre spirals, cobalt sigils, ash fractals each carry distinct sensory load without modifier bloat. Final line “future felt like a gift, not a sentence” is concise, propulsive closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>Fusion of frictionless physics with sacred geometry eel-herding feels inevitable yet unseen before; meteor-dust fin as memory conduit literalizes cosmic genealogy in fresh, tactile form. Risk in lyric montage pays off: aurora-paint merger produces living mandala that reweights prior material. Grandmother promise transformed from answer to method avoids sentimentality through concrete sequence act.</comment>
