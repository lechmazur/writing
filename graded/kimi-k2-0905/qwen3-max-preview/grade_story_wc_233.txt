<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The queen’s interior contradiction—power versus pulse—surfaces in every tactile step and star-scorched palm; the final renunciation to “climb back down as witness” is earned by the cascade of buried memories. Micro-choices (bare feet on shale, letting starlight scorch) keep authority credible yet humbled. Only the “softly commanding” label drifts toward diagnostic shorthand; the body already shows it.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the grotto seals behind her, fireflies fused to her pulse—an irreversible cost that reweights every prior treaty and silence. Causal chain holds: burned warnings → dream bleed → ascent → pool revelation → descent under new terms. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“cliff’s edge”) and never wavers. No lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The ridge’s frost-laced mouth, cobalt veins in obsidian, and star-blood hissing into steam are not backdrop—they refuse her entry until she strips queenly skin. The grotto ceiling open to the firmament literally bends her sense of time and scale, forcing the final stance shift. Environment is the crucible; without its bleeding light, memory cannot pool.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“unravel the dreams or keep drowning in them”—tightens when the sky’s blood confirms the leak is her own buried grief. One meaningful escalation: the pool shows her signing the Edict of Silence, collapsing any return to old rule. Cost is visible: starlight scars her palms and the grotto seals, foreclosing future denial.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as the price of trading resonance for rule: starlight = memory, and the sky weeps what she buried. No moralizing—final image of fireflies clinging like living lace lets the reader feel the reparation without statement. Subtext in the weeping constellation and pawned crown carries the argument in objects.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays locked to the queen’s nerve-endings; perceptual signature is regal yet eroded—“velvet robes traded for linen that whispered… like regret.” Rhythm swells and contracts with breath and altitude, no template cadence. The hooded guide’s cathedral-ruin voice is distinct without stealing focal air.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Density is high—every sentence advances image or stakes; only one soft loop (“starlight… starlight”) but it serves as incantatory reprise. Mixed metaphors avoided; “lacy menace” and “mercury wine” stay within grotto physics. Final drip of celestial fire onto stone is crystalline, no filter-fatigue.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Familiar “fallen monarch seeks redemption” arc is re-forged through star-blood grotto and cobalt fireflies—specific enough to feel new. The inversion that dreams are invitation, not prophecy, reweights trope. Risk in lyric compression pays off: grotto seals, denying easy triumph. Could not swap names without collapsing the light-economy.</comment>
