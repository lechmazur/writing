<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The courtesan’s bodily-poetic identity is more declared than dramatized—no moment shows her body-as-text actually constraining a tactical choice or costing her under pressure. Interior contradiction is implied (chastity vs. courtesan role) but never activated in a micro-choice; the final unlocking succeeds on first quiet whisper, so no visible flaw or price is paid. The refusal to take lovers is stated, not tested; thus the “armor of solitude” never chafes or forces a trade-off. Still, the through-line of self-definition as living poem gives her a memorable, singular edge that almost earns the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a textbook Conceptual Repricing: the prism disgorges its stored echoes, reweighting the world’s rule-set so silence is no longer neutral. Cost is legible in “she stepped back, bare feet leaving no prints”—a quiet erasure that shows she has given her substance to the air. Causality is lyric-accumulative: each untangled thread releases a real sonic seed, and the final dissolution of the knot is earned by the remembered-voice cue. Orientation is taught by the second sentence; the lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds cleanly to the last image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Silver courtyard, snow, and prism are not backdrop but instruments: snowflakes tremble mid-air under sonic vibration, courtyard glows with memory-in-motion, prism acts as lock and loudspeaker. Spatial choreography is immaculate—barefoot prints that leave no trace literalize the cost. Micro-setting (the prism’s lowest facet) is handled twice and directly gates the climax. Sensory hierarchy stays lyric-poetic, yet every detail is filtered through her body-of-text priorities; no filler description survives.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—return suppressed voices to the wind—is signaled in paragraph four and tightens through each untangling; each released sound is a micro-intensification that reweights the stake. Agency is pure endurance and tactile attention; the final thread’s surrender is triggered by her on-page whisper, not luck. Cost is conceptual but unmistakable: she becomes the absent print, forfeiting corporeal trace. One more beat where the released voices momentarily threaten or rebuff her would have pushed this into the 9-band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges as the right of erased voices to weather—no moral is stated, only enacted. The prism’s emptying reframes earlier “madness” gossip into systemic silencing, a quiet political indictment. Subtext lives in gesture: her bare soles on ice = acceptance of erasure as fair price. Final image offers non-literal answer: resonance itself is home, not triumph—an insight earned through concrete labor, not assertion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays tight to her perceptual filter: every metaphor is bodily-poetic (breath as stanza, snow as benediction). Syntax elongates during untangling to mimic thread-loop rhythm, then shortens at release: “She did not flinch.” No head-hopping; prism’s humming is sensed, not explained. Voice is instantly recognizable and modulates with pressure without ever drifting into committee-poet diction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Ear-test rhythm is impeccable: sentence length and stress rise/fall with each knot’s resistance. Figurative density is high but patterned—serpents, sugar, tea, cat—each returns in a later sentence to earn its keep. Zero paraphrase loops; no filler filter verbs. Only hairline slip: “alarming serenity” is named rather than rendered through body—keeps this from perfect 9.0.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses courtesan + chastity + sonic archaeology—an angle not seen in slush. Risk: lyric accumulation could have collapsed into gimmick, yet every echo is tethered to a concrete prior life (lullaby, last gasp). The bodily-poetic conceit could feel grad-school, but specificity of “bare feet leaving no prints” grounds it. Transformation test passes: swap any detail and the whole dissolves.</comment>
