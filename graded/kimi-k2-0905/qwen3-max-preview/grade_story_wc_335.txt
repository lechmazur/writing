<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (retreat vs. mentor) play out in real time; the backwards walk embodies risk and self-imposed exile. Micro-choices—tea-stained annotation, the 37-degree line—visibly cost her authority and safety. The cartographer’s laugh shows her mentorship worked, yet she remains fractured; cost sticks. Interiority stays concrete, never drifts into label-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the shadow stays caged, her exile remains reversible, cartographer redraws with firmer hand—felt cost is the continuing burden of fracture. Causal chain holds: tea-leaf misread → void threat → precise annotation → novice shift → containment confirmed. Orientation granted in first 40 words; no seams. Lens is Causal; every beat tightens possibility or knowledge.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The tilted mirrors, chipped cup, siege-spiral leaves are tactile tools that constrain tactics; the 37-degree shadow line literally guides the cartographer’s redraw. Micro-setting (tea cup, shard-mirror) doubles as environment and oracle, charging the final image. Broken skylight and empty swing anchor time-of-day tension. Spatial choreography exact: backwards perimeter walk, eastern alcove, spiral stairs—no drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: keep shadow contained while teaching resilience; each annotation ups the risk of mis-exile. Escalation is the cartographer’s despair → firmer strokes; her single forward peek shows stakes bite. Cost visible: she trades pieces of her coherence (tea on fingers, cracked reflection) for his growth. Coincidence absent; all pressure internal to library rules.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through pattern: teaching fracture without false repair. Final annotation “draw the line that holds it — not to cage, but to compass” reweights earlier siege spiral into delta of possibility—Conceptual Repricing on the page. No moralizing; resonance lives in the empty swing still moving. Stubborn tenderness as ethos, not thesis, lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is acidic, tactile, ritualistic—“combative tenderness” is lived in syntax. Perceptual signature: dust as text, tea leaves as cartography, backward motion as recalibration. Compression taught early (“shard-mirror archivist walks backwards when nervous”) and paid off at closure. No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens during swing-hush beat. Dialogue sparse, indirection heavy—“What am I supposed to see?” / “Where.”</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Rhythm flexes: long clauses for circling, single-line punches for grit. Sentences multi-task—e.g., “She annotates his margin with a fingertip: a single line bisecting his despair, angled at 37 degrees — the same as the shadow in the glass” advances plot, imagery, and causality. No loops or mixed metaphors; “tea-stained smudge” stays physically consistent. Final line crystallizes without flourish.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: cartographic exile + tea-leaf geomancy + mentorship via vandalized marginalia. Risk of preciousness avoided by grit and broken glass. Shadow-as-inventory and reversible exile feel inevitable yet new. Concept commits fully; no retreat to safer metaphors. Specificity (“whalebone-bound Treatise on Ephemeral Borders”) anchors oddity in lived world.</comment>
