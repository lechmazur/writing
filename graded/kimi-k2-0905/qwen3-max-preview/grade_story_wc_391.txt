<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The mapper’s interiority is rendered through embodied, concrete actions (hand on viaduct, boots on frost, chalk coordinates) that externalize her quiet insurgency; her internal contradiction—impatience converted into disciplined witnessing—remains dramatized, not labeled. Micro-choices (she “whispered thanks,” “did not celebrate,” “kneels again”) carry visible cost and foreclose the path of spectacle, earning her Earned Stasis. Voice stays singular, idiosyncratic, consistent under pressure; no safety-hedging moral symmetry.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the final image of the mapper kneeling on thawing ice, mapping change itself, crystallizes options and reweights the revolution from event to atmosphere; cost is felt in her refusal to seize overt victory. Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout—density of lunar repetitions, cadence shift from industrial clang to hush—culminating in the resonant reconfiguration of silence as power. Orientation is clear within 60 words; no causality breaks, no lens ambiguity. Persistent constraint (moon’s cadence) shapes every tactic and the final stance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The viaduct’s iron lattice and the frozen lake function as micro-setting that literally constrain choice—she must walk the ice, align iron with moon, sleep under basalt arches. Sensory selection is urgent, POV-filtered: “iron bones gleaming under a sky still bruised” compresses sight and tactile chill. Spatial choreography is immaculate; no impossible moves. Environment evolves with thaw, forcing her final adaptation—setting directly charges the closing image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—replace spectacle with stillness—tightens through accretive beats: each night she forfeits noise, draws crowds into silence, risks erasure. One meaningful deepening: spring thaw threatens her ice-stage, forcing the final cartographic act. Cost is visible—she forgoes anthem, flag, even celebration—yet agency remains hers; no coincidence resolves. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens; silence becomes the irreversible victory.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: stillness as insurgency. No thesis statements; the viaduct’s lullaby, children tracing frost, the envoys retreating in bafflement assemble the argument. Final image re-prices “revolution” from noise to breath. Subtext resides in gesture—her refusal to celebrate is the true victory. Resonance sticks: reader left listening for silence in their own world—conceptual cost acknowledged without moral sermon.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is razor-sharp: the mapper notices magnetic hum in her palms, translates wind into glyphs, folds time into lunar cadence. Syntax mirrors her patience—long lilting sentences that taper to single-line renunciations. No head-hop; distance stays deep-third, consistent. Diction stays within her plausible lexicon—no academic register drift. Rhythm breathes with scene needs; quiet peaks accelerate via fragmentary perception.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Read-aloud ear test passes: sentence openings vary, paragraph lengths create visual rhythm, no template cadence detected. Figurative language is selective—“bruised sky,” “unyoked magnetic song”—vehicles stay consistent with physics of scene. One minor scaffold: “she did not…” refrain repeated 3×; however, it functions as ritual beat, pattern-taught, paid off in final renunciation. No mixed metaphors; information density high; every sentence advances atmosphere or stakes.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: geomantic insurgency via lunar tuning of industrial relic. Risk taken—quiet revolution without coup—pays off through specificity of ritual (chalk coordinates, sextant older than regime). Tropes inverted: rebel leader who refuses to lead, weapon who hums lullabies. Transformation test fails if names/places swapped—magnetic viaduct + basalt sanctuary + lunar cartography are irreplaceable. Conceptual integrity total; no retreat into allegory.</comment>
