<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elias’s synesthetic perception is rendered through concrete, embodied choices—tracing the reed, arranging stems by stiffness—that externalize his colorblind sight and “beauty in the stumble” ethic. The moment he hands Marta the reed tongue crystallizes a credible shift from solitary salvager to mentor, paying the cost of sole ownership of his method. Interior contradiction is present but subtle; a sharper beat of self-doubt or risk would have nudged this into the 9s.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The piece teaches an Accumulative/Textural lens early—patterns of plant, ash, reed—and lands a Charged Poise closure: the courtyard’s new pulse is felt, options reconfigured, no tidy victory. Causality is interior yet legible: reed placement → soil vibration → Marta’s recognition → shared kiln vow, each step tightening the communal stake. Cost is atmospheric but undeniable—the once-private ritual is now co-owned, Elias’s monopoly on wonder surrendered.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Glass shards, furnace soot, and reed curvature are not backdrop but tools that constrain placement and resonance; the cracked birdbath filling with unseen dew recharges the opening ash-shadow. Sensory hierarchy obeys Elias’s haptic bias—velvet moss, brittle maple—so every descriptor performs double duty as world-fact and character filter. Spatial choreography remains exact across kneeling, wedging, stepping barefoot.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can the broken courtyard be persuaded to “breathe”—is signaled in paragraph one and deepens through each plant spacing, tightening toward the shared kiln vow. Pressure is textural rather than antagonistic: every arrangement tests Elias’s belief that imperfection can sing. The final cost is the loss of solitary control, a felt narrowing of options even though the external situation improves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: value lies not in fiery spectacle but in the quiet, cracked aftermath where collaboration redefines worth. The reed’s return as communal tuning fork reweights “bartered awakenings” from quaint trade to shared covenant. No moralizing final sentence—just the courtyard’s hum—lets the concept resonate.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays glued to Elias’s tactile lexicon; diction of “damp velvet,” “brittle crackle,” and “off-key lullaby” is consistent and character-specific. Marta’s brief dialogue—“Teach me”—is spare, plausible, and status-shifted. No head-hopping; perceptual signature remains intact under emotional peak.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary from long, breath-held accumulations to the fragment “The rosemary twitched.” No synonym loops; each plant is chosen for mechanical property, not color wheel repetition. Metaphors stay physical and coherent—reed as translator, yarrow as antennae—supporting the concept without purple overload.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Combining colorblind synesthesia, post-phoenix ecology, and botanical acoustics yields a synthesis that feels inevitable yet unseen before. Risk is high—quiet plant-arrangement as plot—but the piece commits fully, trusting texture over spectacle. The reed’s redefinition from discarded part to resonant covenant is a fresh inflection that would collapse if swapped for any other object.</comment>
