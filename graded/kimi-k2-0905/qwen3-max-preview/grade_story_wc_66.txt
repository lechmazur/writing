<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The copyist’s interiority is vivid—ink-stained fingers, ember-lit posture, tear-blurred staves—yet her contradiction (rebellion through monastic patience) stays mostly asserted rather than dramatized in a single pressured choice. The pivotal “let herself cry” beat is tender but arrives as gentle permission, not an irreversible cost; the path forward stays open, so the renunciation feels lightly rather than mortally earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: her first pirate transmission crystallizes a new reciprocal network, the cost felt in the singed thumb and the exposed secrecy of the radio. Causal chain holds—dust motes only speak after lyrics + tears—and the lens stays accumulative/lyric to the final image of “another alcove would warm,” re-weighting solitude into collective risk. Orientation is anchored by word 50 (“ember alcove”); no ambiguity at end.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Micro-setting dominance: the glowing dial and cooling hearthstone function as both workspace and emotional barometer, their heat literally guiding her midnight choices. Mist, embers, and moth-wing cloth recur with shifting temperature, constraining when she tunes and how she hides tears. Final beacon-image reprises these thermal cues, charging the closing line without exposition.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can she coax stories back from dust—tightens when the dial burns hotter and demands her tears as catalyst, visibly narrowing her safe anonymity. Cost is legible: singed skin, wept ink, and the leap into outbound transmission that can no longer stay hidden. One decisive escalation suffices under accumulative lens; no reversal is required.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges obliquely: memory needs mourning to resurrect, and art is clandestine communion across silence. The dust-mote theater literalizes this without thesis statement; the final unsung “thistled calm” trusts the reader to feel the conceptual repricing. No moralizing line mars the close.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical-archivist: syntactic parallelism mimics scored music, yet diction stays within a copyist’s lexicon (“staves,” “vellum,” “dotted rhyme”). Filter verbs are rare; perceptual signature filters every sense through transcription—radio glow read by fingertip warmth, tears diluting “watercolor ghosts of staves.” Compression and patterned elision are taught early (“note by note, breath by breath”) and paid off in the final broadcast cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm pulses like rests and runs; sentences vary from fragmentary arpeggios to longer legato flows. No paraphrase loops; every image either advances lore or deepens character. Mixed metaphors avoided—moon’s “boots of river clay” stays physically consistent with silt and rust. Only micro-slips: “thistled calm” is coinage, but context teaches the neologism and it lands cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Story-famine + pirate shortwave + orchestral resurrection feels inevitable yet freshly synthesized. Risk of sentimentality is side-stepped by making revival contingent on grief, not heroism. The concept commits fully: no retreat into generic dystopia, no wink at reader—dust literally re-orchestrates. Final inflection that the copyist becomes broadcaster completes the loop with hindsight inevitability.</comment>
