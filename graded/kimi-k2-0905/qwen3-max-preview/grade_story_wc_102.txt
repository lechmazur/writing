<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>The artist’s interior contradiction—rational inquiry fused with spiritual longing—stays embodied in every micro-choice: aperture turns, breath counts, the tremor when Kwan Yin’s tear appears. Her motive (“where is unused love stored?”) is never declared; it is lived through lungfuls of inverted star-petals. The pilgrim encounter is credible renunciation: she kneels, breathes, receives, and the path forecloses—no map, no message, only permeation. Cost is visible: the tear dissolves into her skin, a transferable wound that ends her search.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a textbook Conceptual Repricing: the tear’s diffusion reweights the premise—love was never stored, only sung. Causality is lyric-accumulative; each breath pattern is a because/therefore unit that tightens toward the final permeation. Orientation lands by line 5 (twilight viaduct, camera on back), then deepens through sensory anchors. No teleporting props; the camera, petals, and tear track cleanly. Cost is unmistakable: “the mist curled around her wrists… not to possess, but to permeate” — love’s receipt is also surrender.</comment>

<comment>The viaduct is not backdrop but respiratory membrane: iron arches breathe with her ribs, orchids weep dew that beads on the lens. Micro-setting (the obscura’s chamber, parchment swimming with drowned-star petals) constrains every tactical choice—she can only see when the aperture bows to twilight. Final image recharges the opening: same bloom, brighter, now lit from within by the love she inhaled. Spatial choreography is flawless; the tear’s trajectory is traceable across quadrants to the pilgrim’s upheld palms.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—will she locate the reservoir of unspent love?—tightens through breath-based agency: each inhalation literally changes what the lens reveals. Mid-story deepening occurs when the tear unfurls into filament-mist, narrowing options from search to surrender. No external antagonist needed; pressure is ontological. Cost is felt—she leaves the viaduct saturated, her former question obsolete—but the price is conceptual rather than visceral, keeping it shy of the 8.8 gate.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as an inverse economics: love is not scarce currency hoarded in hidden vaults but excess song that needs lungs, not ledgers. The final re-pricing (“unused love was not stored; it was sung”) lands as resonant non-literal answer, reweighting every prior blossom-face and breath metric. Subtext dwells in hush—no dialogue, only tidal respiration—allowing silence to carry the ethical calculus: to receive is to be remade. Avoids sermon; the only pedagogy is inhalation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is synesthetic metaphysician: “inverted blossoms swam across parchment like drowned stars” is perception only this artist could own. Breath cadence becomes syntax—long exhalative sentences that mimic 11-count exhale. Psychic distance tightens from aerial viaduct to intra-thoracic hollow behind sternum, a controlled shift. No dialogue, so no convergence risk; diction stays inside her plausible lexicon (aperture, obscura, Kwan Yin) without encyclopedic lapse.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Rhythm modulates like lung tides: long anapestic rolls for exhale, fragment bursts for inhale. Metaphors are internally coherent—tear as liquid starlight, mist as lullaby—no mixed vehicles. Information density high: one sentence often sets bloom, tool, emotion, myth. Only minor scaffold: “she inhaled slowly, exhaled—” repeated root, but it is pattern-taught and pays off in permeation. No loops or synonym churn in closing beat; final line is clean, propulsive.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Conceptual fusion—camera obscura + Buddhist tear reservoir + breath-based cartography—feels non-obvious yet inevitable. Transforms “finding lost love” trope into pneumatic ontology. Risk taken with lyric repetition of breath counts; coherence holds, so minor bonus. Specificity anchors freshness: Victorian optical device beneath bioluminescent orchids is not a pairing seen before. Could tip higher with more embodied social cost, but within-band excellence achieved.</comment>
