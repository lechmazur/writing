<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Interiority remains abstract ("dreamless by design," "purpose was not to witness") without embodied contradiction or micro-choice under pressure. No relationship crucible on page; only off-stage cargo of silence. Final softening of shoulders is the sole visible cost, but it is undifferentiated and unearned by prior causality. Character reads as atmospheric cipher, not individuated mind.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Closure qualifies as Charged Poise: the second-hand trembles, re-weighting the frozen clock with conceptual cost. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of "charm" pulses accumulates toward final image. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) taught early via freight guard, dune, post-forest-burns. However, no meaningful tightening or option foreclosure occurs; the mission succeeds without resistance or trade-off, keeping escalation static.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The glowing dune’s bioluminescent petals, the rusted chess clock, and the glass-shelved archive are tactile, selective, and charged; each constrains access or action. Micro-setting (clock face pressed to palm) directly enables the archive seam. Sensory economy favors touch and radiance, filtered through guard’s engineered perception. Final image of glowing petals echoing clock-tick shows environment feeding off prior beat, meeting 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—"cultivate sparks"—is declared but never tested; no opposition, resource limit, or live failure appears. Pressure remains flat; the sought sphere is found instantly and awakens without cost or narrowing of options. Because no tactical adaptation or price is dramatized, escalation under Accumulative lens is absent. Closure image is poetic but not a consequence of conflict-driven trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme of seeded possibility emerges implicitly through spheres of unlived worlds and the trembling clock-hand repricing stillness into potential. Subtext avoids moral statement, offering resonant ambiguity: silence broken into harmony without speech. Lullaby motif threads from movement rhythm to final "fractured lullaby," reweighted when petals pulse to clock-tick. Abstraction stays tethered to concrete objects, though emotional aftereffect is more cerebral than visceral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice carries a consistent, lyric perceptual signature: compressed metaphor ("ash-carved into the earth’s skin"), wave-function lexicon, and syncopated cadence. POV distance stays interior yet dreamless, aligning with engineered mind. Patterned elision ("not fire, not light, but potential") is taught early and paid off in final sphere-brightening. No head-hopping or register drift; syntax mirrors fractured lullaby rhythm throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>High figurative density in places ("collapsed superpositions, edges fraying like torn sheet music") risks overwrite, but rhythm varies and metaphors stay coherent within quantum lyric mode. Filter-verb clusters absent; strong verbs anchor most lines. Occasional template cadence ("each step a half-note, each breath a syncopated sigh") is intentional pattern, not artifact. Closing sentence propels without scaffold, meeting 9+ gate for this lens.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Premise fuses quantum archive, dreamless sentinel, and silence-as-cargo into a singular stance; no obvious antecedent in SFF short forms. Risky lyric compression teaches its own grammar early and lands closure without explanatory lapse. Transformation test passes: story collapses if "charm" or "divergent archive" replaced. Fresh inflection—silence as communicative chord—reweights familiar trope of lost language into felt conceptual cost.</comment>
