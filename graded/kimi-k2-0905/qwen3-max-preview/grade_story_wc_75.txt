<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elara’s rescue-of-art motive is vivid and embodied—she bakes, scans, documents—but the interior contradiction (why risk for mere song?) is asserted, not dramatized. No moment shows her tempted to quit; the arc is uplift without friction. The final renunciation of ghost-hunting is implied, not costed on-page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: “We are not preserving art. We are becoming it” reweights the stake from salvage to self-creation under an accumulative lens. The lens is taught early via repeating bread-and-lens pattern; transitions are legible. Cost is felt—the city’s silence is broken, anonymity sacrificed—but the causal chain is lightly sketched; we never see Elara debate the danger of exposure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Grotto acoustics, damp stone, and rosewater rot are filtered through Elara’s curator eye, constraining her choice of performance sites and charging the final fungal chandelier image. Micro-setting (lens, bread initials) doubles as architecture; every prop is handled, not backdrop. Spatial choreography is pristine.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stakes—“rescue dying arts”—escalate accumulatively: each Friday loaf lures another timid performer, tightening the communal risk of being heard from outside. The snare-drum beat is the visible pivot that forecloses silence; cost is legible in trembling hands, not in Elara’s personal loss. Pressure coheres but remains collective; Elara’s own safety is never on the block.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: art as living tissue, not artifact. The bread alphabet motif accrues meaning—initials become scores, then identity—without overt thesis. Final line crystallizes the reconfiguration; no moralizing. Slight deduction for abstract “rosewater dread” being named more than enacted.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lyric, curator-poet voice sustains metaphoric density without register drift; “echoes remembered songs better than the people did” is character-specific. Repetition of “emerald lens” and “bread initials” teaches the pattern; payoff in final paragraph reframes living through the lens. No head-hop; distance stable.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm modulates—long cadences for waterfall roar, staccato for drumbeat—without algorithmic pattern. Mixed metaphors (“rosewater dread,” “sweetness clinging to decay”) stay coherent. One scaffold trace: “Each dawn… each Friday” is template cadence but serves liturgical pacing. No loops obscure closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fallen-utopia-behind-waterfall is familiar, yet the edible alphabet archive feels freshly specific. Risk is taken in lyric montage over plot reversals; transformation arises from communal practice rather than heroics. Slight proximity to “dying art in drowned world” trope keeps it from total surprise.</comment>
