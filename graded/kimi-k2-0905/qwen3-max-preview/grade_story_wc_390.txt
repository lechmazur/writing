<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is sensor-rich and profession-specific (“calibrating beacon harmonics”), but the climax pivots on a quasi-mystical surrender that slightly outruns the prior mechanistic setup; the emotional cost is felt yet the shift from engineer to “weaver of waves” is more asserted than dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: ice-song → key awakens → Heartstone threat → sonic counter-song; the lock-in-a-hairline seam is a crisp Decisive Change that visibly costs her stamina and reconfigures her role. Closure is earned, on-page, and pays off the lighthouse-crystal premise without explanatory filler.</comment>

<comment>Drift-ice marina is never static: it converses, softens, guides her steps; cold iron key against “warmer flesh” fuses tool and body. Bioluminescent moss and liquid mercury basin are sketched with economical precision that charges the final cerulean pulse. Setting directly constrains tactics—she must match floe rhythm or fall—and crystallizes in the final image of star-pricked twilight, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<comment>Single dominant stake—protect the Heartstone—tightens when sonic harpoons introduce dissonant cost; her counter-frequency is a visible forfeiture of remaining strength. Escalation is coherent under Causal lens: each tuning action narrows options until only symbiotic resonance remains. Price is legible: post-rupture collapse to the floor, key now warm with transferred energy.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without sermon: violence answered by harmonic grace, crystallized in the final “sonic absolution” wave. The concept reweights earlier weaponized sound into forgiveness, achieving Conceptual Repricing. No tidy moral—scavengers kneel in revelation yet remain off-page, preserving ambiguity. Final image of stars over a hushed marina offers non-literal, resonant answer to the central question of how to guard the sea’s soul.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays locked to her perceptual filter: every sonic metaphor is filtered through an engineer’s vocabulary (“resonance thresholds,” “tuning fork”). Sentence rhythm mimics wave crests—long clauses build, then fracture into single-sentence beats at climax. Compression taught early (“Low, resonant groans…”) and paid off in final lullaby-wave. No head-hopping; diction remains within maritime-technical lexicon throughout.</comment>

<comment>Prose is dense yet breathes: “key leapt from her pocket as if pulled by tide” performs action, image, and personification in one stroke. No filter-verb stacks or synonym loops; figurative language spikes only at high-pressure beats and each vehicle is consistent (tide, resonance, mercury). Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line (“climbed back into the world…a guardian whose greatest strength was…consonance”) lands with cadential uplift that recharges motif.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses climate-ice folklore with acoustic engineering; “sonic absolution” reframes forgiveness as physics, not theology. Risk taken—magic key, living crystal—yet internal logic remains consistent, payoff foreshadowed. Specificity of “beacon harmonic calibration” and “weaponized frequency” prevents generic fantasy drift. Final inversion—scavengers disarmed by maternal lullaby rather than counter-attack—feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
