<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elira’s meticulous-mapper trait drives every beat: she deciphers cracks, crawls the arrows, catalogs doubts in mirrors. The punch’s tremor under her palm externalizes memory and forces the final surrender, giving visible cost to her vocation. Yet the mother-backstory is delivered in one dense block rather than pressure-triggered revelation, muting the interior contradiction at the hinge moment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: “the fortress of unspoken truths” reframes from place to chorus, remaking her vocation into listening. The brass punch dissolving into the silver needle is the felt price; the lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern density of arrows/whispers reweights stakes rather than causal reversal. Orientation is taught early by the she-where-when sentence, stable throughout; all arrows obey internal logic.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Body, tool, and mist vault constrain every move: the punch vibrates, flagstone splits, mirrors reflect only doubts—choices are physically limited by these objects. Sensory selection is urgent—soundless detonation, cold star-pools—guiding perception under pressure. The micro-setting of the silver-veined door acts as final fulcrum: without its obsidian surface the reprice cannot occur.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“find the fortress”—tightens when arrows cease at the door and refusal costs her prior identity. Agency is renunciation: she absorbs the chorus, foreclosing the mapper’s detachment; price is the punch’s dissolution and her “not whole” dawn state. Escalation is accumulative: each whisper-layer deepens density until surrender is the only stance left.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: cartography of silence vs. surrender to it. The punch-turned-needle motif reweights meaning—mapper’s tool becomes listener’s instrument, recharging every prior arrow. No moral is stated; final image of “walking toward” offers resonant, ambiguous commitment. Subtext in mirror-whispers (“I lied to survive”) forces reader to supply their own swallowed truths.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Elira’s analytically artistic filter: “sketched paths like symphonies,” perceives geometry in shame. Rhythm swells then thins—long cadences for descent, staccato clauses for door-beat—mirroring surrender. No dialogue, so voice purity judged by perceptual signature; punch-needle substitution is clean, no head-hop. Register holds without academic drift even at concept-heavy climax.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>High density without scaffold: single sentences fold time and metaphor—“air hummed with withheld confessions.” Varied sentence openings avoid drumbeat; paragraphs shrink at door-beat to accelerate breath. Figurative logic remains internally coherent—starlight pools, cracks bloom—no mixed vehicles. Minor paraphrase on “cracks…arrows” (three repeats) clips 0.2, insufficient to cloud closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fuses urban-explorer trope with metaphysical cartography—mapper charts silence, not space. Punch-needle as memory-tool re-casts mundane prop into existential key; premise commits fully without late rule change. Whispers-as-birds image feels fresh yet inevitable, grown from “swallowed truths” seed. Risk in lyric non-linear descent paid off by reprice clarity, meriting upper band.</comment>
