<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elira’s interiority is sparse but precise—her quiet deliberation shows in micro-choices (winding the key, recording backlash) that escalate to stepping through the threshold; the final renunciation of saviorhood for stewardship carries visible cost. No secondary character presses her, so status dynamics are moot. The only flaw: “quietly deliberate” is named more than dramatized in early beats, but the trait is finally embodied when she becomes the loop. Closure is earned and forecloses rescue fantasies.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The causal lattice is airtight: each winding tightens the sky-noon distortion, cumulating in her crossing into the vault; the spoons’ fracture is the inciting rule, the key’s resonance is the reversible engine, and the new rune is the decisive change that re-stitches causality. Orientation is taught by line 4 via place & time; no teleporting props. Closure lands with conceptual cost: noon now casts a shadow on time itself—a Resonant Reconfiguration that charges every prior measurement.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The cracked dome, barnacle-observatory, and serpent-key are tactile micro-settings that constrain every move; the drawer labeled “DO NOT WIND” is a Chekhovian object that literally gates the plot. Sensory economy favors ink, brass frost, and cobalt flare—each returned in the final image. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly across the orrery, drawer, and threshold. The 9-band gate is met: the key’s evolving states directly charge the final loop-closing image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>A single dominant stake—where shadows literally go—tightens each night as the key’s resonance shrinks the false-noon window; the seventeenth-night threshold crossing is the meaningful turn that narrows options to becoming the keeper or losing shadows forever. Cost is visible: the key burns with recursion, and she forfeits normal daylight. Pressure plateaus rather than spikes after the crossing; a second tightening would have pushed this into 9+ territory.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the inversion: absence is not loss but exile awaiting reconciliation. The closing-loop motif reweights “silence stole” into “silence shared,” avoiding any thesis statement. Final image—noon casting a shadow on time—offers a non-literal, Conceptual Repricing that invites rereading. No moralizing, only the cost of eternal custodianship.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elira’s calibrated noticing; perceptual signature is scholarly-lyric (“ink-stained and steady,” “forgotten frequencies”). Syntax tightens under pressure—sentence fragments appear only during threshold crossing, mirroring distortion. No dialogue, so voice distinctness rests in diction that never drifts into pseudo-academic filler. Rhythmic control heightens without obscuring causality.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: one sentence often performs world, body, and causality. Figurative language is selective—“spirals of gravity,” “liquid night”—and never stacks into purple. One paraphrase loop (“not metaphorically… literally”) is intentionally rhetorical, not scaffold. Clean grammar, zero filler beats; the final paragraph cadence mirrors the orrery’s backward spin.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The spoons-as-cosmic-fracture is a fresh, non-obvious catalyst; the automaton key as pedagogic threshold rather than lock-pick re-infuses a tired trope. “Sealed awakenings” flips shadow ontology from absence to dormant citizenship. Risky conceptual compression pays off: the story commits fully to its rule-set without explanatory hand-holding. Transformation test passed—this exact metaphysics could not survive name-swap.</comment>
