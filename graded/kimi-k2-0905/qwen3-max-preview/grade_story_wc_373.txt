<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The daughter’s calcified fear-to-purpose arc is embodied in micro-choices (dropping to knee, letting the fob swing) and charged by the grandfather relic that literally re-triggers Marla’s betrayal memory; her refusal to chase or gloat is an earned, costly stance. Interiority never slips into label-speak; tension stays in tendon-level detail. One slight under-trace: why “capture the sound” remains her life’s pivot—backstory hint is thin, but it survives because the final silence is viscerally paid for.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds throughout: each feint (disguise failures, knee-drop, fob touch) narrows options until the single touch ruptures the deal. Orientation (who/where/when) locked by line 5; no teleporting props. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—trust audibly breaks in Marla’s exhale and Chain’s boot click, costing both parties the alliance and the girl her anonymity; the cost is on the page and irreversible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Salt-rotted timbers, swaying gin lanterns, singing eels—selection is urgent, POV-filtered, and guides movement; the watch fob itself becomes micro-setting that physically bridges generations and catalyzes the rupture. Spatial choreography stays clean through crowd swells and knee-drop recovery. One minor over-color (“lanterns swaying like drunken fireflies”) but it pays off by contrasting the later frozen hush.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prevent the truce—signalled in paragraph 3; pressure tightens when disguises fail and Marla’s hounds sniff silence, narrowing to the single fob touch that collapses the deal. The false-start gambits cost her visibility and skin (gin spill, scraped knee), visible on page. Sunrise deadline is ambient but not actively tightening tactics within the scene; hence not max-band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Trust-as-sound motif emerges through acoustic images (ghost-tick, silence after exhale, boot click) rather than exposition; theme crystalizes when recognition, not violence, shatters the truce. Final image of girl swallowed by market dark offers Charged Poise—no moral stated, but cost of generational betrayal is undeniable. Avoids pat lighthouse-redemption tropes by keeping grandfather’s guilt a hush.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person hovers at a tight psychic distance that keeps salt-bitter diction and compressed syntax (“fear had long since calcified into purpose”) inside the girl’s perceptual range. Rhythm accelerates with clipped clauses during stalls and slows into long vowels at the silence beat, mirroring tide pull. No head-hopping; Marla and Chain read only through exterior cues, preserving POV modesty.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High information density—each sentence moves position or reveals texture; no scaffold loops or synonym churn. Metaphors stay physically coherent (sleeping serpent chain, tar-over-whispers). One register bump—“conceptual repricing” territory in “relic he swore kept time with the tide, not the clock”—but it’s brief and voice-motivated. Strong prop tracking: fob clasp, gin sleeve, crate of eels all reappear with altered state.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Familiar noir-pirate market is refreshed by acoustic stakes (“sound of trust breaking”) and a weaponized heirloom that memory-triggers collapse instead of blood. Risk taken: climax is a near-static touch, yet it feels inevitable because prior beats teach that silence, not blades, rules this under-pier economy. Specificity of shark-tooth coat and drowned-men-net hood keeps imagery from defaulting to generic pirate kitsch.</comment>
