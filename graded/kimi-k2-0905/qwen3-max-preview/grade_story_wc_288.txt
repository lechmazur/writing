<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Veyra’s layered memory (mammoth-walker / botanist / archivist) is dramatized through body-level choices—bare feet on stone, palms flaring gold to steady the sundial—so contradiction and cost are alive in scene. Her final whisper of future coordinates is earned by every prior micro-choice to channel her own resonance, not merely declare it. Reflective skin and reincarnation memory could feel like labels, but they are repeatedly activated under pressure (photon-whispers, cobalt flare) and tied to the story’s one meaningful renunciation: she forecloses mourning itself. The only minor slip is a brief mid-story clause that diagnoses her burden as “map of loss”; still, embodied action instantly reclaims the beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The piece teaches an Accumulative/Textural lens from the opening image of salt-crusted echoes and maintains it: pressure mounts through pattern intensification (tide → vapor-flood → gnomon blur) rather than causal reversals. Orientation is delivered lyrically yet lucidly inside 100 words (who: Veyra; where: tidal library above clouds; when: the brittle awakening of this dawn). Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the sundial’s shadow locks onto future genesis, reweighting the entire premise from archive to loom. The conceptual cost—she will midwife unknown hybrids instead of cataloguing ghosts—is unmistakable in the final metallic-tang image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The library is no postcard: drifting stacks hiss when touched, brass sundials bruise bare feet, damp stone drinks body-heat. The atomically reflective skin functions as micro-setting, refracting both aurora-memory and present danger into one surface. Spatial choreography is flawless—Chamber Seven’s crooked gnomon, lower galleries flooding, vapor-sea below—every move is trackable. Environment directly constrains the climax: the stone-circle hum faltering forces Veyra to substitute her own marrow-resonance, so setting becomes the decisive lever.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—active resistance against entropy through realignment rather than mourning—is signaled in paragraph four and escalates via two beats: the tide floods the galleries (pattern break) and the stone-circle hum stutters (core resource failure). Each tightening is textural, not causal, yet reweights cost: first she races to save the sundial, then sacrifices atomic reserves to re-steady it. The price is visceral—marrow vibration, skin flaring gold—and permanently forecloses the option of pure preservation. Agency is unmistakable; coincidence is absent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges entirely through imagistic reconfiguration: echoes → loom, salt → ozone, coordinates of loss → coordinates of genesis. No character ever utters a thesis; instead, the sundial’s shifted shadow wordlessly reprices the moral calculus. Subtext lives in silence—she never mourns aloud—and in touch, as brass absorbs her whispered future like a vow. The final metallic tang offers a non-literal answer: extinction is not denied, it is repurposed into creation, leaving plausible ambiguity about what “might yet be” will demand of her.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is oceanic-solemn, with tidal cadence taught early (“etched in salt-crusted stone… slow sway”) and held to the last “metallic tang.” Syntax lengthens and contracts like breath: long em-dash clauses during calm, staccato fragments under flood. Perceptual signature is exact—Veyra notices photon-whispers, marrow-hum, gnomon-blur—never generic. Register stays consistent; no sudden academic diction. Compression (“brittle awakening”) is patterned and paid off when the tide literally cracks the dawn.</comment>

<comment>Prose is densely figurative yet disciplined: almost every sentence fuses image and action (“cloud-tides surged… library groaned like a waking leviathan”). No mixed metaphors; vehicles stay physical and coherent. Rhythm modulates without algorithmic repetition; paragraph cuts are purposeful. Minor scaffold: two adjacent sentences beginning “She did not…” create a tiny template echo, but it falls outside the closure beat and does not dull the final image. Information density is high—each line layers memory, object, and stake.</comment>

<comment>The “echo-archive above clouds” premise is audacious yet fully internalized: rules (sundials tell no earthly hour, skin refracts ancestral light) are established early and obeyed. The reversal—library as loom rather than mausoleum—feels inevitable because the sundial’s crooked gnomon was seeded as a tool that can be re-tuned. Risky lyric accumulation succeeds under the Accumulative lens without obscuring clarity. Specificity throughout (ivory-bill coordinates, cobalt flare, vapor-hiss) prevents abstraction; no trope is borrowed wholesale without transformation.</comment>
