<comment>Elira’s interiority is vivid and profession-specific; her “quiet grit” and pattern-recognition mindset drive every beat. The contradiction between scientific discipline and stubborn hope is dramatized in micro-choices (tuning the poisoned violin while the campus fractures). Cost is visible: she forfeits credit, sleep, and safety, ending in cold coffee and static vigil. Only minor hedge—no status dynamics on-page—keeps her just shy of 9-band.</comment>

<comment>Causal chain is airtight: because the tricksters piggyback on the station, therefore Elira must hijack the same carrier; because she threads counter-frequencies, the barricades fall. Closure lands as Charged Poise: “Try me again. I’m listening” reweights the entire premise with undeniable future cost. Lens (Causal) holds start-to-finish; no orientation debt; no artifact near the final beat.</comment>

<comment>The radio booth functions as micro-setting: every dial, yellowed chart, and salvaged capacitor constrains tactic and imagery. Corkboard, Cold-War transmitters, and oscilloscope ground the speculative physics in tactile academia. Sensory hierarchy obeys Elira’s engineer bias—sound over sight—without checklist drift. Final image of the newly pinned counter-chart crystallizes both setting and stance.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—prevent psychological corrosion—tightens when the Unity Rally becomes the live test: if the counter-pulse fails, the campus tips to violence. Escalation is causal: each calibration narrows her margin, visible in oscilloscope jitter and student forum posts. Price is paid in real time: lost sleep, increased trickster irritation, and the open-ended vigil she embraces at dawn. One meaningful tightening suffices; no reversal overload.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: salvation-as-weapon versus science-as-lullaby. Never stated—only enacted through waveform metaphors and the image of students weeping while hugging. The ethical calculus sharpens when calming the mob also alerts the predators, implicating her in future retaliation. Final whisper to static offers resonant, non-moral answer: vigilance is love’s price.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is engineer-poet hybrid: precise RF jargon braided with lyrical compression (“tuning a poisoned violin until it plays lullabies”). Perceptual signature never slips—every metaphor is signal-based, every silence ionospheric. Rhythm accelerates under pressure without syntactic monotony. No head-hop, no register drift; the rare second-person dare in the final line is earned as address to the cosmos.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>High density: each sentence either advances waveform tactic or sharpens campus stakes. Figurative language is disciplined—no mixed metaphors, no purple drift. Occasional scaffold (“she’d seen it before…”) is brief and anchored to present cue. Closure line is clean, propulsive, artifact-free.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: SETI horror meets campus protest, routed through audio-engineering realism. The “counter-frequency as non-violent resistance” is non-obvious yet inevitable once established. Risk—lyric address to static—pays off by recharging the entire signal motif. Specificity of Cassiopeia pulsar and Cold-War transmitters prevents generic anywhereism.</comment>
