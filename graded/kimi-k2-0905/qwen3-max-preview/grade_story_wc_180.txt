<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The mender’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her calloused hands, the tightness in her throat, the hum of her mother’s tune—yet the daughter remains off-stage, so the “relationship as crucible” test is moot. Her stubborn, repair-not-redemption ethic drives every micro-choice (climbing the hymn-ladder, honey-coating the spoon) and the final stance crystallizes with felt cost: she forecloses reconciliation-in-a-day, accepting instead the slower graft of return. The only drag is a faint therapy-tag (“she didn’t believe in redemption”) that momentarily abstracts the beat where belief should be enacted; still, the hair-ribbon & vow stitching enact it immediately after, so the slip is hair-line, not causal.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the green scrap fluttering on the thorn reweights every prior vow and ribbon, making the cost of persistence legible without a hug. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—pressure grows through image accretion (pear-heaviness, honey-spoon, stitched promise) until the final crystallization. Causality is intact: each tool pulled from the forgotten bag enables the next micro-reach, culminating in the daughter’s fresh footprint. Orientation is clear by line 30; no teleporting props; the vow-tree rules are taught early and obeyed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The orchard-cathedral is not backdrop but toolkit: ivy-woven ladder, rose-thorn at the exit, fruit weight warping beams—all constrain how the mender climbs, reaches, and ultimately where the daughter can leave the scrap. Sensory triangulation (honey’s stick, parchment curl, dew on cheek) keeps the space three-dimensional. Cathedral light through stained glass literally colors the vows, making the setting an active sorter of promises. Spatial choreography is flawless: we track ladder, branch, spoon, boot, doorway without drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—"bridge generational wisdom before daughter forgets her"—is signaled early and tightened by each retrieved vow; the maple-leaf confession pinned to satchel is a visceral price that forecloses the easier path of verbal apology. Escalation is accumulative: each vow grows smaller, more personal, until the daughter’s own handwriting dangles like overripe fruit, forcing the mender to invent honey-spoon tactics. The cost is legible—the ribbon warms, the footprints prove risk taken—but because the daughter’s stance remains off-page, the final pressure is felt more by reader than by protagonist, keeping this just shy of the 8.5 gate.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without pronouncement: repair over redemption, persistence over absolution. The deciduous-vow concept reweights itself—vows once brittle as birch bark become sticky with honey, illustrating that promises can be re-stuck, not merely broken. The final green scrap offers Conceptual Repricing: spring color reframes the母女 cycle as seasonal, not terminal. No moral is stated; the image of the ribbon coiled in a sleeping fist answers the thematic question in tactile, not abstract, terms.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is compressed lyric with patterned elision (“deciduous vows” taught by line 70) yet stays legible. Perceptual signature is opto-mechanical—lenses, quartz, magnifier, thread—filtering every image through mender-trained sight. Syntax modulates: longer, leaf-curl sentences in calm beats, staccato clauses when branch recoils. No head-hopping; interior access is strictly single-POV. Dialogue is absent by design, so naturalism criteria are waived.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but breathable: “vow, sticky with unresolved emotion, adhered to the spoon like a child clinging to a lollipop” performs metaphor, tactile motion, and emotional sub-text in one stroke. No synonym churn or template cadence; sentence openings vary. Minor overwriting flag: three consecutive adjective-noun pairs in the cathedral-introduction sentence, but pattern is taught early as sensory overload and pays off in pear-heaviness later, so artifact is below −0.3 threshold. Final line—“wisdom, like orchards, grows best when tended across generations”—risks proverb, but the prior honey-spoon has earned the horticultural analogy, so it reads as culmination, not slogan.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Fusion of optician lore with magical arboriculture feels inevitable yet fresh; no extant trope covers “cathedral orchard where vows fruit and rot.” The transformation test fails wonderfully—swap any noun and the emotional engine collapses. Risk in omitting on-page daughter pays off through footprint and fabric swap, proving daring coherence. Minor deduction for faint echoes of “repair vs redemption” motif in recent boutique fiction, but here the honey-spoon mechanizes the abstraction, restoring originality.</comment>
