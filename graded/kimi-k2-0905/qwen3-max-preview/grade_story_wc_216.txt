<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Vey’s interiority is rich—timeless heartbeat as deliberate act, texture-of-time obsession—yet the moment of change (urn fragments fuse) is more miracle than earned choice; no micro-choice visibly pays the cost. Relationship with Lira remains observationally flat, no status shift under pressure. Still, embodied emotion (“hand near the silo’s core pulses”) and perceptual signature keep the portrait vivid.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: urn fragments, garage-sale breadcrumbs, and silo-hum accumulate until the chime reweights meaning. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Vey’s heart restarts, time curator role crystallized—cost is felt (“for the first time in years”). Orientation clean by 120 words; causality is pattern, not because/therefore, and pattern pays off.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Emerald silo, salt flats, and mother-of-pearl flecks are tactile, selective, and mirror interior states. The urn fragment acts as micro-setting: warm glaze, low chime, constrains the final fusion beat. Sensory economy supports tone without tourist excess; one paragraph could be trimmed for density, but setting continuously guides attention and choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—Vey’s need to feel time’s texture—tightens when the second urn fragment appears, narrowing options to “press together or remain broken.” Cost is emotional: heart restarts, old role abandoned. No external antagonist, but internal pressure coheres under Accumulative lens; one meaningful deepening suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme—time accumulates, not passes—emerges through sensory images (dust, unread letters, balloon echo) rather than exposition. Final image of curated echoes offers non-literal answer with conceptual cost. Avoids preachiness; ambiguity lingers about whether restart is gift or burden.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lyrical third-person floats close to Vey’s sensorium: “song no one else could hear,” “texture of time passing, grain by grain.” Rhythm modulates—short declarative beats under pressure, longer incantatory lines for accumulation. No dialogue contamination; garage-sale listings carry subtext. Filter verbs minimal; diction stays within POV lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High information density—single sentence often layers image, backstory, and scent. Metaphors sustained without muddle; only one mixed trace (“cracked earth like an old book” slightly overused). Zero loops, no scaffold. Final chime line is crisp, propels closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Great Recalibration where numbers mean texture, timekeeper turned echo-curator, garage-sale code as breadcrumb network—fresh synthesis. Risky lyric structure taught early and paid off. The urn-fragment fusion feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Minor deduction for faint echo of “time is breathing” trope, but specificity of mother-of-pearl and cobalt teapot listings keeps it singular.</comment>
