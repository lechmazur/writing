<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The folklorist’s “chronic curiosity” drives every action; her boots-muddy reflexes and notebook-stained fingers embody motive. The micro-choice to kneel, touch the mushroom, then stay inside the greenhouse forces a live cost—she forfeits surface life the moment she smiles and brushes soil from her knees. No contradictory impulse is staged in scene, only summary, so the internal conflict beat is missing, capping the score just below 9. Still, the renunciation is legible and character-bound, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the smile–soil gesture crystallizes her choice to feed the orchard with the rest of her memories, cost felt in the scent of peach and pipe smoke that now will be swallowed. Causal lens holds throughout—each star-map, log entry, and the final trawler deviation act as because/therefore triggers that narrow options toward this last fork. The price is on-page and irreversible; no ambiguity at the lens. Meets 9+ gate with constraint (she can no longer leave) shaping the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The greenhouse’s broken skylight and Ursa-Major warp constrain her detection method and literally bend the climax; environment shapes tactics. Sensory hierarchy obeys her scholarly bias—she notes “equations… beside pressed petals,” not tourist-catalog vistas. Spatial choreography is flawless: we track finger, mushroom, pedestal, skylight without drift. Micro-setting status is met; the warp charges the final image, nudging into high band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recover stolen memories—tightens when the trawler breaks habit and the mushroom pulses; that single escalation is meaningful and causal. The price (she will lose remaining memories if she stays) is legible but abstract until the final scent hit; slightly less visceral than ideal for 8.8+. No false reversals; coincidence complicates rather than saves. Agency is hers throughout.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</question><comment>Theme emerges as the cost of insatiable curiosity: she chooses to become the orchard’s next meal rather than live with vacancy. No final moral is stated; the smile-soil image reweights earlier “vacancy” as voluntary sacrifice. Subtext operates in gesture—she brushes soil from knees like sowing seed, implying self-burial. Complexity holds: orchard is predatory yet starving, she is victim yet accomplice.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person tight interiority sustains perceptual signature—her gaze parses “fractured rainbows across oilskin coat” and catalogs star distortions as equations. Syntax mirrors scholarly precision: nominalized phrases (“decades later, the ache still lived…”) compress time efficiently. No head-hop; psychic distance contracts cleanly in the final beat. Register stays within her academic lexicon; no filter-verb bloat.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm is controlled—clause length modulates with revelation beats; no template cadence detected. Mixed metaphors (“cathedral of lost seasons”) stay single per beat, avoid coherence break. One scaffold trace: “not grief, but vacancy” could be cut without loss, minor. Figurative language avoids muddle in peak beat; information density high. Slight tightening still possible, hence 8.4 not 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: memory-eating sunken orchard as astrolabe wreck-lure is novel yet inevitable in hindsight. Fairy-ring-as-threshold trope is subverted—here it is bait, not portal. Risk in lyrical accumulation pays off: star-warp = memory-theft is taught early and lands at closure. Emotional truth grounds the conceit; specificity prevents gimmickry.</comment>
