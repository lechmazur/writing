<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Interiority is lyrical and consistent, but the servant’s contradictory impulses stay submerged; the final acceptance is affective, not earned through a visible micro-choice that costs her anything on the page. The goggles trigger recognition, yet the beat is passive observation rather than a decision that forecloses a path. Still, the voice-specific perception and embodied cold keep her from abstraction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the cracked goggles refract the world into “fractured beauty,” reweighting the premise with conceptual cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each floor adds density until the diary’s final line crystallizes acceptance. Orientation is swift; the elevator window anchors who/where by line four. No causal break; the cipher’s reveal is coincidence, but coincidence is allowed to complicate under this lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Frost-rimed rivets, prismatic light shards, and whale-skin diary create tactile micro-setting that constrains attention and finally charges the image. Cold is not backdrop but filter: “warmth bloomed in her palms” against ice-locked alcove. Spatial choreography is clean—goggles unfolded on elevator floor, diary sealed in alcove, body kneeling. The cracked lenses literally reshape what she sees at exit, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will she find a usable answer to grief—is signaled early. Pressure tightens once: cipher glows amber at floor nine, forcing the lullaby-decoding act that reframes grief as companion, not enemy. Cost is conceptual, not tactical; no live option is foreclosed, so escalation stays lyrical rather than causal. Sufficient for the length and lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the diary’s refrain: joy folded inside sorrow. No explicit moralizing; the final image of frostbloom in her coat pocket reweights the idea into living proof. Ambiguity remains—she descends unchanged in outward role but re-visioned inwardly—creating lingering counter-readings. The captain’s voice stays textual, not authorial lecture.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains tight psychic distance; perceptual signature is cold-refraction (“glint a whisper,” “prismatic shards”). Syntax lengthens during ascent, then fractures into shorter units at the seal-breaking beat, mirroring cracked glass. No dialogue, so no voice convergence issue. Filter verbs (“she saw,” “she felt”) are sparse and motivated by reflective mode.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Rhythm modulates with elevator motion; paragraph lengths visually ascend then contract. Figurative density is high but patterned—light/ice/glass motif taught early and paid off in final lens. No synonym loops or scaffold. One mixed metaphor (“lantern left burning in a frozen hall”) is minor and does not touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Frost-locked elevator-as-spiritual-pilgrimage feels fresh, yet indebted to classic ascent tropes; the cracked goggles as refractive moral lens supplies the non-obvious inflection. Specificity of whale-skin diary and frostbloom sprig keeps it from generic ice-tower postcard. Risk is moderate—lyric accumulation over plot—but coherence holds.</comment>
