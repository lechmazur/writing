<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elira’s interiority is vivid—scar as text, coffee ring as map—and her micro-choices (touching wood, kneeling to seed) flow from motives shown, not told. The “closure seeker” label is stated once; the rest is embodied, so the diagnostic-speak penalty is waived. Final renunciation earns its cost via seed-dissolve that rewrites her scar, foreclosing old identity. No contradictory impulses shown simultaneously in-scene keeps this just below 9.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands: seed-merge is Decisive Change with conceptual cost—her former quest ends, new translation begins. Causal chain holds: ivy whispers → coffee ring confirms → tunnel opens by invitation → seed rewrites scar. Orientation anchored by 60 words; no penalty. One tightening beat suffices; lens stays situational-poetic throughout. Cost is legible in seed’s dissolution and hourglass release; no offstage resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Tower, cellar, cathedral crypt form a vertical world that physically guides descent and return; ivy as living GPS constrains route. Frosted hourglass recharged in final image, meeting micro-setting gate. Sensory selection narrows to touch and vegetal murmur under crisis, then widens at dawn; spatial choreography tracked cleanly. Selective detail skips broad city map for root-level specificity, economy observed.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“translation not resurrection”—signals early; pressure tightens when tunnel opens, foreclosing safer daylight search. Agency drives every beat: she touches ring, walks tunnel, kneels, accepts seed. Cost is visible: seed merges, hourglass starts, spiral path replaces old quest. No coincidence resolves; ivy warning complicates rather than saves. One meaningful deepening suffices; no escalation drag.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from seed’s refusal to resurrect—continuation over closure—shown through vegetal memory and rewritten scar, never declared. Subtext in coffee rings and hourglass silence accumulates meaning without overt statement. Final spiral reweights prior motifs without moralizing, achieving CR. Ambiguity lingers: new power may cost further displacement, embracing complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is lyric-sensory, compression taught early (“meteor hush,” “green memory”) and paid off in final spiral. Syntax mirrors vegetal pulse—long sentences root, short bursts leaf. No head-hopping; single POV stable. Diction stays within Elira’s mystic-trauma lexicon; “translation” vs “resurrection” distinction is character-bound. Rhythm accelerates during tunnel descent, breathes at seed merge—intentional modulation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm varied; no template cadence runs. Information density high—each sentence layers image, motive, mythic echo. One mixed metaphor (“silence pooled like spilled ink”) but cleared by immediate context. No scaffold loops; adjective use disciplined. Opening and closing lines bookend with charged hourglass image, satisfying propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Plant-telepathy as accidental blessing, miracle-as-seed, and coffee-ring cartography synthesize fresh angles on familiar mystic quest. Transformation test fails if elements swapped—specificity of vegetal memory and scar-translation is non-transferable. Risk in lyric ellipsis pays off by heightening resonance without gimmickry. No close echoes of famous scenes; voice feels singular.</comment>
