<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid—“discarding assumptions” becomes a dramatized, embodied act under lunar pressure. One visible cost: she dissolves the fragment, forfeiting proof and future funding. Micro-choices (raising hands, descending alone) crystallize her hierarchy of values. Slight safety-hedge: competence so absolute it nearly flattens struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the towers awaken, the fragment sacrificed, her path foreclosed—cost is the lost artifact and perpetual exile from proof. Causal linkage holds: lunar perigee → coil tuning → fragment resonance → city revival, each beat because/therefore. No orientation debt; anchors (who/where/when) land by line 3. One of the rare 600-word pieces where the final image reweights the whole premise with conceptual cost visible in the dissolve of “oxidized chrome” into sky.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Rusted gantry, frost-glazed metal, serenely electric gloves—micro-setting objects constrain every tactical move. The Hollywood fragment’s temperature-shift under moonlight is a sensory pivot that charges the climax. Spatial choreography is flawless: boots crunch, antennas straighten, gorge exhales. Environment literally dictates the sound of genesis—setting becomes instrument.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“find the beginning in every ending”—is signaled in para 2 and tightened when she must sacrifice the fragment to release the chorus. One meaningful escalation: lunar perigee narrows the window from cycles to seconds, forcing the final tuning gesture. Cost is visible: loss of tangible evidence + city’s irreversible awakening. No fake reversals; coincidence only complicates (the archivist’s timing), never resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the reversal of failure into genesis: Hollywood’s failed eternity becomes the seed of cosmic rebirth. Subtext in gesture—raising empty hands—speaks louder than any thesis. Final image of “quietly broadcasting genesis” reweights the whole concept of silence as creative potential. No moralizing; resonance is purely imagistic and earned.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays tight to her perceptual filter: selective attention to capacitors, antennae, copper filaments. Syntax mirrors tuning—compression at pulse-moment, then airy release. No dialogue, so voice purity is uninterrupted. One minor lapse: “serenely electric” recurs as catch-phrase rather than fresh sensation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with scene—long aerial sentences suspend, then fragment at the pulse. Metaphors are tightly welded: “shard of hush” remains consistent physical object before it becomes concept. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or causality. One mixed vehicle: “tides in the sky” slightly strains physics but is saved by lyric licence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fusion of Hollywood memorabilia with cosmic background radiation is a genuinely fresh synthesis. The towers-as-instrument reversal flips post-apocalypse trope into creation myth. Risk taken: negative-space sound as plot engine; pays off because the hush is physically embodied in the fragment. Conceptual integrity absolute—no retreat into metaphor alone.</comment>
