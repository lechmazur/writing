<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is textured—her anosmia is lived through touch and listening—but the midwife-screw “fulcrum” beat is delivered by Ren, not tested by her own micro-choice, so the final stance feels gifted rather than earned. Still, her embodied attention to clients’ jaw-clench and the clock’s fracture keeps contradiction alive in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the broken clock plus screw reweights her practice from “fraud” to witness, with felt cost (“throat tight”). Causal chain holds—screw → fulcrum insight → clock reliquary → bow to couple—under Accumulative/Textural lens; fog-softening mirrors internal shift. Orientation anchored by 50-word mark; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Brass gears, damp counter, cracked escapement wheel, and fog-thinned lampposts are filtered through haptic POV; the screw’s cold bluntness is re-handled twice, charging the final image. Micro-setting (clock ribcage) constrains the closing gesture of mounting the screw, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can she still “unveil miracles” without smell—tightens when Ren reframes the screw as opener, not clamp, foreclosing her self-label “fraud.” Pressure escalates via accretion of sensory lack and client memory; cost visible in swallowed throat and offered bow. No reversal, but one meaningful deepening suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges: presence > perfume, witness > remedy. Screw’s redefinition from tool to fulcrum re-prices birth pain into grace; final bow to pregnant couple externalizes the shift without moralizing. Fog-thinning reprise echoes occluded clarity motif, giving non-literal resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person hovers close to Elara’s haptic ear; syntax lengthens with reflection, shortens under pressure (“She swallowed”). Ren’s tide-low diction contrasts without voice convergence. No head-hopping; perceptual signature consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm breathes—fog / brass / screw / bow—no scaffold loops. Metaphors (“clock like lungs”) stay coherent; “mechanical grace” risks elevated register but fits Ren’s idiom. High density: one sentence often does description + interior + thematic tilt.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Anosmic aromatherapist + birthing screw + broken water-clock fuses fresh angles on caretaking and time. Screw-as-fulcrum rewrites obstetric violence into agency; broken clock still “holds time differently” offers non-obvious wisdom. Risky premise fully committed, payoff legible.</comment>
