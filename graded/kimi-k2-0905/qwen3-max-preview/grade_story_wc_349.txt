<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The vendor’s interior contradiction—needing to erase herself by trafficking others’ absences—drives every beat; the ledger stylus of frozen breath and the counter-incise ritual embody the cost. Micro-choices (arranging bottles, accepting whispered payment) keep the void she carries palpable. The final image of seven gleaming cuts shows earned stasis: she grows lighter only by distributing weight, foreclosing any return to her own cacophony of roles. No label-speak; trembling fingers and refracted shards do the emotional work.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the open ledger and seven ceiling-dancing glimmers reconfigure meaning—the vendor’s emptiness is now externalized inventory, cost legible. Accumulative lens holds: each sale adds density until the counter’s gleaming lattice crystallizes the stakes. Orientation is taught by line 3 (“glass orchard library floating…”) and pays off in the final orchard-labyrinth exit. No causality break; the incise ritual foreshadows the culminating mark.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The glass counter whose incisions refract moonlight into prismatic birds is both tool and environment; it constrains the vendor’s ritual and charges the final image. Cloud-sea and crystalline shelves are sketched with ozone and unread epilogue scent, never catalogued. Spatial choreography is clean: cart → counter → orchard aisle → ceiling shards. Selective detail (bare feet on glass petals, bottle humming with dusk) filters through the vendor’s bias toward measurable absence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—trading personal void for others’ measured hollows—tightens with each sale; the seventh incision shifts cadence, making the lattice of light irreversible. Pressure is accumulative: 3.7 heartbeats, 12 grams, 1 dissolved home—each quantity adds weight to the vendor’s distributed burden. No coincidence; the patrons’ arrivals are lull beats that compound density. Cost is visible in the counter’s gleaming scars and the vendor’s felt lightness.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme—absence as currency—emerges from the ledger’s dissolving numbers and the prismatic birds overhead, never stated. Subtext lives in gesture: the patron clutching the bottle “like a confession” implies his unquantified shame. Final image of the open ledger offers resonant non-literal answer: stories begin in the space left behind. No moralizing; the silence between chapters reweights the premise.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person intimate stays locked to the vendor; perceptual signature favors lunar metrics and glass tactility. Syntax lengthens during reflection (“daughter, debtor, deserter, dreamer”) then fractures into incise-imperatives under pressure. No dialogue clutter; the two patrons speak only enough to reveal their thirst for erasure. Frozen-breath stylus and “glimmering parole” coinage remain within the library’s invented register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies: long breathless sentences for cloud-sea arrival, staccato ledger entries for tightening. Information density high—“bottled moonlight glowed faintly, not with illumination but with implication” does double sensory-conceptual work. No mixed metaphors; moonlight stays lunar, absence stays hollow. Zero loops; each sentence advances inventory or image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Premise—apothecary that sells quantified absence—feels inevitable yet unseen; fusion of lunar alchemy and library-of-unread-stories is non-obvious. Risky second-person imperative (“Choose your emptiness”) pays off by crystallizing customer complicity. Transformation test fails if bottles, ledger, or incise ritual is swapped; the concept is inseparable from the objects. Specificity of 3.7 heartbeats and 12 grams anchors the fantastical in lived metric.</comment>
