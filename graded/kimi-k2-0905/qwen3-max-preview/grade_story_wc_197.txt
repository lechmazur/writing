<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elira’s quiet, tactical interiority is vividly embodied and consistently resourceful; the “key” becomes a living extension of her fingers, not a prop. The final renunciation—sitting cross-legged to watch dials ignite while sirens close in—pays the full price of her life-risk and crystallizes her value hierarchy without a spoken manifesto.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>A single causal chain—key → puddle-grid → hatch → Engine → blackout—tightens across one continuous scene; every beat is because/therefore. Closure is a Charged Poise: she is gone but the broadcast keeps propagating, reconfiguring the city’s epistemic rules at undeniable social cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The lagoon’s starlit grid literally routes her footsteps to the submerged hatch; water temperature and mirrored constellations constrain timing and body stance. Final image re-weights the same lagoon as both crime-scene and birthplace of public memory—setting as tool and tomb.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“will erased truth re-enter the public bloodstream?”—tightens once: when she uploads cassettes and power drains citywide, the broadcast’s irreversibility forecloses retreat. Cost is visible on-page: blackout, sirens, her certain arrest or death.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete reversal: lullabies of obedience become lullabies of rebellion; the image of children humming resistance is earned by the broadcast, not asserted. No final moral—just the Ace of Keys card—lets the reader reprice what “coded freedom” will cost the city.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person intimate sustains a tactile, synesthetic signature: “water cool as forgotten truth,” “dust thick with static.” Rhythm compresses under sirens, widens during solder-work; no head-hop or register drift. Final vanishing preserves voice distance without explanatory tag.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Metaphors are sparse and purposeful; no mixed vehicles. High density lines (“mirrored surface swallowing the last blush of dusk”) advance atmosphere and plot simultaneously. Only micro-loop: “key…key…keys” thrice in 30 words; not at closure, so −0.2 max, still within 9-range.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fusing analog tape-archive with liquid-mirror cartography is fresh synthesis; the puddle-map as hacker interface feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk—quiet protagonist, no gunfire—intensifies stakes rather than flattens them. Ace of Keys card twist repurposes a gambler’s symbol into an encryption sigil, specific to this world.</comment>
