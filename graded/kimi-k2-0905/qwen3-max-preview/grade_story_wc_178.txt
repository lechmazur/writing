<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The astronomer’s interiority is concrete and character-specific—his threadbare robe, sold cloak, barley crust all manifest the “frugal” trait in embodied cost. Contradictory impulses (rationality vs. magic-belief) co-exist inside single beats, not alternating summaries. The final renunciation—no monument, no coin—lands as earned stasis because every prior sacrifice (lenses, meals, cloak) is logged on-page. Only the trembling-fingers beat edges toward diagnostic self-awareness, barely within tolerance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the tile’s hum becomes a secret covenant beneath future thrones, reweighting all prior chalk lines with conceptual cost. Causal chain holds—because he sold the cloak, he could buy oil; therefore the resonance is captured tonight. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) hits by word 40. One meaningful tightening: the chalk spirals narrow from planetary transit to a single frequency confirmed at 15. No late rule changes, no teleporting props.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The cracked ziggurat terrace functions as micro-setting: its dust coats the robe, its dais must align with Sirius, constraining bodily placement. Palace memory (ivy, throne gaps) is filtered through POV priorities—what an astronomer notices is acoustic resonance in stone, not royal heraldry. Spatial choreography is clean: kneel → uncloak → lay tile → sketch → rise → descend, no impossible positions. Environment charges the final image: the bronze door seals a vibration into stone that will outlive regimes.</question>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—access the cosmic frequency—is signaled in paragraph 1 and tightened when the tile actually hums, foreclosing the option to abandon vigils. Cost is visceral: winter cloak sold, barley cake supper, page 3,412 of logged silence. No antagonist needed; pressure is coherent cosmic indifference. The hum’s activation is not luck but the earned payoff of sacrificed comfort, making the final stance crystallization legible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: “encrypted devotion” is not named but enacted through etched numerals, chalk lattices, and the ledger entry “Confirmed.” The final image—rulers will sit atop a vibration they never hear—conceptually reweights ambition vs. attention without moralizing. No symbolic convenience; the magic square’s uselessness to merchants is shown earlier, so the ending reprise feels inevitable. Ambiguity lingers: is the frequency divine or statistical? The story lets the contradiction stand.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Third-person POV stays pinned to the astronomer’s perceptual signature: every noun is chosen for utility (lamp oil, ephemerides) or resonance (angular momentum, chalk dust). Syntax mirrors his frugal precision—no surplus adjectives, clauses stacked like telescopic lenses. The diction “empirically ironic” appears once, inside his head, not narrator intrusion. Rhythmic control peaks at the hum line: low and resonant, two beats matching the tile’s vibration, then immediate log entry—voice modulates with intensity without breaking distance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High information density: single sentences do map work (“constellations mapped not in stars but in silence”) and emotional work simultaneously. No paraphrase loops; each chalk line adds new orbital data. Metaphors stay coherent—architect of gravity, syrup under moonlight—without mixed vehicles. One scaffold risk: “empirically ironic” is repeated twice; second use feels slightly ornamental but occurs early enough to be forgiven and does not touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: the magic square as scientific instrument rather than fantasy MacGuffin transforms the trope. Frugality-as-epistemology is a non-obvious angle—selling warmth to buy silence. The palace reimagined as acoustic resonator for cosmic data collapses empire and science into one setting. Risk taken: no dialogue, no confrontation, yet stakes feel planetary; the quiet ending is bold and coherent.</comment>
