<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The keeper’s mute vigil is rendered through embodied, contradiction-rich interiority (“tranquilly perceptive” yet bone-bent over the box); her refusal to open it crystallizes an earned stasis whose cost is legible in the final honey-gold glyphs. Micro-choices—bare feet brushing dust, spine curved into storms—reveal a hierarchy valuing silence over release. No second on-page character, so relationship bullets waived. The covenant functions as persistent constraint; the gratitude flicker from the beekeeper ghost externalizes the cost without sentimentality.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each paragraph thickens the resonance of silence until the master beekeeper’s turned gaze reweights the entire pattern. Closure is a Charged Poise—the stained glass casting honey-gold glyphs—whose conceptual cost (perpetual guardianship of the unsaid) is undeniable. Orientation anchored by line 3; no causal breaks. The covenant’s price shapes every tactic; no outline drift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Desert ruin, splintered roof-light, and the box-as-micro-setting all constrain choice: she curls her spine around the box during storms. Sensory triage favors grit-in-mouth ash and hive-wood splinters over visual catalogues. Cobalt/amber glass hues return in the final honey-gold projection, recharging the motif. Spatial choreography clean; no impossible ghost placements.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve the architecture of silence—tightens once: when the beekeeper ghost meets her gaze, the option of release is foreclosed with gratitude rather than sorrow. No external reversals needed; accumulative pressure suffices. Cost visible in bodily wear and eternal vigil. Agency is renunciation/attention, not conquest.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete particularities: pollen dust, child’s charcoal sun, glass bees. No thesis statements; final glyphs speak a language “only silence could speak,” achieving Conceptual Repricing. Ambiguity lingers—gratitude equals continuation, not liberation—resisting moral tidy-up. Subtext carried in gesture: spectral fingers on honey-press neck.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person lyric register sustains a hush-compressed cadence; syntax elongates then snaps into short declaratives (“She never opened it.”). Perceptual signature—echo-hunting, weight-cataloguing—remains character-specific. No dialogue, so dialogue bullets waived. Metaphor layer (“stones in a dry riverbed”) is pattern-taught early and paid off in final dust-glyphs.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High information density: each sentence layers image + stakes + history without scaffold. No synonym loops; “ash,” “grit,” “dust” carry distinct sensory loads. Rhythm breathes with escalating dusk light; no algorithmic patterning. One mixed metaphor (“heat mirages given form”) but it is taught early and coherent under ghost-logic.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Post-apocalyptic beekeeper-ghost silence-guardian concept is fresh synthesis; not a template echo. Risk-taking in omitting names, plot, and dialogue heightens rather than obscures stakes. Specificity of pollen-ghost sifting, charcoal child-drawing, and cobalt-amber glass prevents generic transfer. Final inversion—gratitude for eternal burden—feels inevitable yet non-obvious.</comment>
