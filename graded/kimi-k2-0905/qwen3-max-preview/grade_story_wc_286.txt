<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The potter’s quiet, observant interiority is vividly embodied—“fingers tracing the rim,” breathing “slow as cooling clay”—but her motivation (understanding resistance to change) stays observational; no contradictory impulse or micro-choice visibly forecloses a path, so the renunciation feels gentle rather than costly. The bee interaction is a lovely micro-choice, yet it remains the solitary beat where kindness alters tactics; more friction against her passivity would sharpen the arc.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: the piece layers image upon image (smoke, wax, resin, clay) until the final soft pot + glowing glass crystallizes “time that chose to pause.” Orientation is secure by line 3; the tightening occurs when she decides not to fire the kiln—an Earned Stasis that visibly surrenders permanence, paying the conceptual cost of porous fragility. Causality is lyric rather than plotted, but the pattern is taught early and closure reweights the stakes cleanly.</comment>

<comment>Micro-setting triumph: the cracked kiln, sagging comb, and hollowed stone are handled, sat on, poured into—objects that constrain her choice to leave the pot unfired. Sensory economy is excellent—heat-flattened smoke, resin-pooling moments—filtered through the potter’s tactile gaze. environment actively shapes the ending: the unfired pot must stay soft in this dust, a constraint that charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—comprehending how the oasis resists entropy—deepens via accretion of sensory beats rather than external opposition; the single meaningful tightening is the decision to withhold fire, which narrows options from durable artifact to breathing vessel. Cost is conceptual yet legible: she trades permanence for resonance, leaving the pot vulnerable to ruin. Pressure is situational and gentle; a harsher test of her kindness ethos would escalate further.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through concrete recurrence of “softness versus stasis”: wax pooled but never sealed, clay coiled but never fired. The final image—light curling upward again—offers a Conceptual Repricing that redefines resistance as surrender, not fight. Subtext stays implicit; no character articulates the thesis, avoiding sermon. The notion that kindness is the only force that coheres time is earned through the bee-drinking beat and lantern glow, not assertion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Perceptual signature is distinct: potter-noticing diction—“spirals that defied gravity,” “tides she could no longer see”—remains tactile and kiln-inflected throughout. Rhythm modulates with breathing paragraph breaks that mirror cooling clay. No dialogue, so voice compression is internal; lyric fragments (“time curled upward again—tender, unbroken, humming”) are pattern-taught and pay off in the final line. Register stays within her artisan lexicon; no filter-verb clutter.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm is supple—long liquid sentences for heat-daze, then short fragments at dawn. Metaphors stay physically coherent (“dunes that shifted like liquid regret”) and avoid purple overload. No paraphrase loops; each image advances texture or stakes. Minor scaffold: “time… time…” repetition is intentional, forming pulse, not drift. Information density is high—one sentence often does two jobs of sensory cue + thematic hint.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Fusion of beekeeping, pottery, and speculative time-slippage feels fresh; the lighthouse lens repurposed as compass is a lovely synecdoche for guidance without ships. The “phototropic to kindness” rule is a new inflection on empathic tech. Yet the oasis-as-resistance concept treads familiar eco-ruin territory; risk is more in lyric voice than in world logic. Specificity of wax pooling upward and unfired pot keeps it from feeling like metaphor checklist.</comment>
