<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and embodied—guilt is “traced” through ivy, bellows, echo-length. Contradictory impulse (to map pain yet shun absolution) drives every micro-choice. The final stance—leave the station rearranged, no note—pays full cost of her methodical penance. Slight peak beat label-speak (“self-forgiveness, a terrain”) docks a hair.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each graffito, ivy tendril, wheeze reweights the guilt map. Closure is a Charged Poise—accordion chord fading, station “shifted to make space”—felt cost is undeniable. Pattern taught by 25% (Point Zero sink) and coherence maintained through final image. Persistent constraint: taped bellows constrains every song to imperfect timbre.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Station as micro-setting constrains every action: sink = Point Zero, skylight = confession booth, ivy = palimpsest. Specificity is tactile—porcelain pool, hinge-by-hinge door, echo-length measured in pulls. Spatial track clean: distance from ticket booth to farthest stall is consistent across beats. Final image (rust sign “Track 3 — Last Departure”) crystallizes environment as internal threshold.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake: learn grammar of flow to forgive self for flood abandonment. Escalation through successive graffiti that tighten moral calculus: “unfolded,” “path didn’t,” “draw them bleeding.” Each re-weights map-making toward visceral cost (weeping against wall). Agency remains chronicler’s—every datum is her decision to stay, play, document. Cost visible: leaves station rearranged, accordion fingers raw.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges from ivy-as-archive and bellows-as-regret: pain must be read, not solved. Final reconfiguration (no train, no note) rejects redemption narrative—self-forgiveness is ongoing flow, not arrival. Subtext in ivy indexing screams and echo-duration as guilt half-life avoids moral statement. Emotional aftereffect lingers in “dirge only she could hear.”</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is riverine: time is current, memory is silt, sound eddies. Syntax lengthens when chronicler “maps,” fragments when she “plays.” Free indirect slips clean: “maps lie unless you draw them bleeding” becomes her interior verdict without filter verbs. Lyric elision (“each syllable a coordinate”) taught early and paid off in final chord. No dialogue, no head-hopping—single voice sustained.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose breathes with accordion: long sentences swell, short snaps release. No loops; each line adds new sensorium or data point. Metaphor density high but coherent—physical logic never broken. Final clause “station itself had shifted” is precise, avoids anthropomorphic excess. Only hairline slip: “remorse river deltas” borders mixed metaphor yet saved by prior water grammar.</comment>

<comment>Flood-guilt mapped via graffiti-bathrooms, ivy-index, patched-bellows sonar is fresh synthesis. Risk in methodical graffiti epistemology pays off—wisdom literally scrawled under rusted faucets. Final refusal of train/departure subverts expected redemption arc. Conceptual integrity: every tool (map, accordion, ivy) obeys its own logic to the last beat.</comment>
