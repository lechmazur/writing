<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The saxophonist’s interior contradiction—grief versus duty—is embodied in breath-fog on brass and trembling reed; every micro-choice (softened attack, dissolved note) alters the metaphysical stakes. Motivation stays legible: silence a prophecy that frost-bit his family line. The renunciation costs him the prism itself and any future return, a price felt in the final glance back. No stock therapy-speak; even “prophecy” is kept symbolic, not diagnostic.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each synesthetic image thickens the hush until the single visible chord fractures. Orientation is taught by ~80 words (“stone met sky,” “cobblestones beneath his boots”) and pays off when the same arch later holds only a memory-light droplet. Closure is a Charged Poise: the prism’s non-noise shattering reweights every prior note as erasure. Cost is the permanent loss of the grotto’s aurora and of the music itself—no applause, no echo.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The saxophone body becomes micro-setting—valves condensing dew that lenses the prism’s last glow, directly constraining his embouchure shift. Negative space is rendered as tactile fog that “curls like smoke around silence,” forcing him to play absence instead of sound. Spatial choreography is flawless: droplets freeze mid-fall, stalactite lips are tracked, and the arch’s empty curve at the end is the exact negative of the vanished prism. Environment is inseparable from tactic; remove the mist-and-crystal physics and the counter-spell fails.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—prevent the prophecy’s time-unspooling—is signaled in the fourth paragraph and tightened when the prism’s glow narrows to a single chord. Escalation is textural: fog thickens, colors drain, droplets stall, each beat raising the metaphysical cost of failure. The protagonist’s agency is renunciatory—he dissolves rather than confronts, yet this very subtraction collapses the prophecy. No coincidence; even the final droplet is a causal residue of the dissolved prism.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as “some silences must be composed, not merely kept.” The lullaby fragment, prism shards, and dew-drop lens form a sparse but coherent image-set that reweights meaning at the end. Subtext lives in gesture: saxophone lowered “like a sleeping child” equates music with mercy killing. No moralizing—insight is the empty arch where color used to hang.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Perceptual signature is synesthetic and breath-synced: “notes slipped through negative space” is a saxophonist’s way of hearing. Rhythm mirrors embouchure pressure—long liquid sentences relax into fragmentary whispers as the hush wins. No head-hop; grandmother’s voice is quoted memory, not external POV. Diction stays within a working musician’s lexicon; even “prism atrium” is repurposed as stage-lighting, not science lecture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Every sentence performs two jobs: sensory anchoring + causal push (“dewdrops formed faster now” ⇒ prism light magnified ⇒ spell resistance felt). Metaphors are coherent—fog as ink in milk, prism as submerged lantern—no mixed vehicles. No loops or scaffold; each clause adds new physical state or tactical shift. Final line cadence mirrors a fade-out: three stress drops—“stepped,” “saxophone,” “vanished”—mimic the vested hush.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The fusion of jazz breath-control with spell-cancellation is non-obvious and inevitable in hindsight. Prophecies are usually shouted; this one is unwritten by erasure—risk that pays off. Saxophone-as-exorcism transforms familiar busker trope into metaphysical luthier work. Specificity of brass dampened by mountain-fog and code carved in tombstone rain feels lived, not borrowed.</comment>
