<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Quietly driven is shown, not told, through seventeen seasons of notation and a packed satchel; the hollow ache is anchored in concrete ritual (whistle at dusk) rather than label-speak. Internal contradiction pulses—obsession vs. city denial—embodied in tactile map-creases and reed against sternum. Final micro-choice to climb at midnight is earned by prior causal chain: watcher’s head-turn → proof of listen → personal risk. Cost is felt: she may become “another name whispered”; refusal to wait forecloses safe citizenship.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: because watcher turns, therefore she acts; because journals found, therefore pattern language devised. Single-scene orientation secured inside 120 wds (who=cartographer, where=apartment overlooking turtle-shell city, when=seventeenth dry season). Closure is Charged Poise: on-page image of whistle tucked “like a second heart” crystallizes both challenge and potential annihilation. Cost is undeniable—she steps into the ridge’s lethal silence—no reset possible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Turtle-shell city isn’t backdrop; cracked carapace desk literally guides finger-maps and therefore tactics. Micro-setting tool—reed whistle—constrains every tactical move (breath, pitch, humidity). Watchers on horizon act as living topography; their salt-shadow texture tightens dread. Final image of midnight ridge re-weights same shells from map-desk to potential grave.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prove the watchers answer—signalled first paragraph. One meaningful tightening: watcher turns head → option space collapses from theory to mortal confrontation. Price legible: city denial, elders’ scorn, risk of joining lost expedition. Coincidence absent; escalation driven solely by her pattern-language agency.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of silenced history vs. private witness emerges through spiral maps, whistle code, and buried journals—never stated. Ambiguity preserved: watchers may be guardians or predators. Final image re-prices silence as lethal invitation; no moral delivered. Subtext in “sound that slipped between buildings like smoke” lingers beyond plot.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature sustained: cartographer’s noticing is cartographic—ridges, grooves, plateaus—syntax mirrors spiral logic. Reed whistle “trembled in her lips, not from fear, but from electric certainty” = voice-specific embodied cognition. No dialogue, hence no contamination; compression (“sun bleached the sky white”) is taught early and repaid at climax. Rhythm modulates: long accumulative sentences build density, final fragments mimic breath patterns of whistle code.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops; each sentence advances map, memory, or pressure. Mixed metaphors avoided; “spirals that collapsed inward like failed lungs” is single coherent vehicle. Information density high: “etched them inside her reed whistle’s hollow chamber” does triple job (memory, code, concealment). No artifact touches closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: cartography as musical breath on turtle metropolis. Lost-expedition trope inverted—survivors weren’t killed, they were silenced by refusal to speak pattern-language. Risk of lyric stillness paid off: watcher’s micro-movement ruptures scale. Specificity makes concept inseparable from this world—generic swap would collapse story.</comment>
