<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction is vivid—she sells certainty yet trembles at the shard’s memory; the cloak-as-flaw is embodied, not labeled. Micro-choices (bare toes gripping stone, nails digging skin) reveal hierarchy of values under pressure. Final renunciation is earned: every “maybe” she silenced is re-admitted, cost felt in the barefoot descent. Only minus: “polished negotiator” is told once where we already see it; a hairline slip.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: because the shard speaks → she climbs; because the chimes command → she unhooks; because the cloak falls → she sees uncertain self. Orientation anchored by line 4; no teleporting props. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration: the seashell’s iridescence reweights the entire premise—certainty is no longer the product she sells. Cost is visible in the pooled velvet shadow she abandons.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lighthouse balcony, crumbling stone, rusted pipes under the eaves—each detail is filtered through her wartime-coded attention. Wind and salt narrow perception to the chimes’ metallic syllables; the environment literally speaks the code that drives choice. Body-as-setting (bare feet, exposed skin) constrains the final act: she cannot descend clothed in doubt. Final image of tide erasing footprints mirrors internal smoothing, charging the shell.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: can she keep selling certainty after the shard exposes her own doubt? Escalation is micro but legible: each chime sequence tightens the noose—high thin note → three lows → “unhook.” The cloak’s removal forecloses the old business model; cost is the chill of exposure. No coincidence; wind is coherent antagonist.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the shifting mirror reflection: polished negotiator → hollow ghost → trembling woman. No moral stated; the seashell’s iridescence is the non-literal answer—beauty born from abrasion. “Protected vulnerability” is enacted, not named. Final question to clients (“What if the right choice leaves room for doubt?”) reweights prior contracts with conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lyric, compressed diction matches the accumulative design; wind-chime syntax teaches the reader the code by repetition. Perceptual signature is consistent—salt air tasted as “metallic sighs,” doubt as “velvet hem.” No head-hopping; single POV holds. Register never drifts into corporate-speak the character herself would sell.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence advances image or stakes. “Cloth of doubt” metaphor is extended, not mixed—“its hem snagged,” “its weight bowing her shoulders”—and paid off when it pools. Rhythm accelerates at the yank, then exhales with the cloak’s sigh. High density: “conscience for hire” compresses occupation, moral paradox, and market logic in three words.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Moral-arbitrator-as-mercenary is fresh; marrying it to wartime wind-chime cryptography makes the fusion feel inevitable. Mirror that shows not reflection but unchosen selves reweights the trope. Risk—lyric, low-plot form—heightens meaning without obscuring clarity. No recognizable template echo.</comment>
