<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The veiled dreamer’s interiority is vivid—glyphs etched in her own blood, the watch’s temperature against skin—but the “cautious exuberance” is asserted more than dramatized in micro-choices. Her final silent acceptance is earned by the recursive logic of the archive, yet the emotional cost is more conceptual than embodied; we see the mirror crack, feel the mist, but the character’s interior contradiction peaks earlier and stays flat at the climax. Still, the theft-of-voice motif ties motivation to action cleanly, and the endurance of becoming the archive itself is a credible renunciation. Just short of a 9 because the final beat leans on image rather than a last visible internal fracture.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The recursive, accumulative design is declared early (“cyclically reversed nature of the stacks”) and pays off in the cracked-mirror Resonant Reconfiguration: every prior seeker is folded into the same loop, making the protagonist both cause and effect. Propagation delays are not technobabble—they visibly rewrite the shelves behind her, so the closure image re-prices the entire journey with conceptual cost. Causality is coherent under an Accumulative/Textural lens: each glyph she carves literally alters the archive’s past, tightening the spiral. The mirror’s reflection is the unmistakable on-page moment where cost becomes undeniable.</comment>

<comment>The library is rendered through kinetic specificity: shelves “curved like vertebrae,” mist thickening into sentences when stared at too long. Spatial choreography is flawless—footfalls echo before they are made, negative space between books becomes a tactile interface. Environment actively constrains tactics: rewritten stacks force her to retrace steps, the lectern mirror is both setting and final object. Micro-setting qualifies for 9+ gate: the watch and bone stylus function as portable “settings” that charge the closing image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—access to the unspoken word—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens when documentation starts altering the archive itself, forcing her to pay with her own pulse. One meaningful deepening occurs at the scent-memory of bergamot/rain: the archive demands she absorb someone else’s swallowed apology, narrowing her options to endurance rather than retrieval. Cost is visible—each new glyph scars her arm—but the final price is more conceptual than visceral. Sufficient for high band under Accumulative lens, but lacks a secondary tangible loss to push into 8.8+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: the unsaid is not hidden but recursively generative, each seeker becoming the medium that preserves what they sought to release. The mirror-identity image reweights the premise—ownership of silence is indistinguishable from being consumed by it. No moralizing; the final silence-shaped glyph is resonance, not lesson. Complexity is honored: the library is both sanctuary and trap, and the story refuses to pronounce which is “right.”</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays veiled yet intimately synesthetic: “ticking syncopated like a nervous heartbeat.” Perceptual signature is consistent—attention to negative space, temperature of objects, scent as memory vector. No head-hops; the recursive structure is externalized through setting, not POV slippage. Rhythm modulates with pressure—short clauses when the watch spins wildly, longer languid sentences during mist inhalations—without losing clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentence variety is high, figurative density purposeful; only one paraphrase loop (“each mark a vow, each scar a citation”) but it is pattern-taught and brief. No mixed metaphors; physical logic holds even when metaphor is surreal. Information density is excellent—single sentences deliver world rule, character state, and tactile detail. Minor scaffold: “the library responded in kind” is a near-template transition, not quite sharp enough for 9+.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The recursive archive of unspoken words feels inevitable yet fresh—Borges-adjacent but grounded in corporeal documentation with bone stylus and blood ink. Risky structural recursion (every arrival rewrites the past) is executed without clarity loss; the mirror-crack image has not appeared in canonical predecessors. Synthesis of timepiece-for-thresholds and scent-as-memory is particular to this voice. Conceptual integrity absolute: the story commits to its paradox and follows to terminal silence.</comment>
