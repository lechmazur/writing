<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias’s pivot from profit to purpose is sketched rather than dramatized; the interior contradiction between “shrewd broker” and “quiet architect of compassion” is asserted, not embodied in a single high-pressure choice. The final beat—listening to dock laughter—offers Earned Stasis, but the cost (lost time, money, reputation) is only implied, not felt on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the returned locket and new envelopes reconfigure Elias’s world from transactional to circular kindness; the cost is the irreversible shift in identity. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each anonymous delivery adds density until the harbor itself becomes the text. One minor scaffold: “whimsically attentive by nature” repeats three times without fresh inflection.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Salt-kissed air, lantern glass, mop bucket—details are selective and filtered through Elias’s cargo-broker gaze. The library skylight and pier shadows serve as micro-settings that enable stealth delivery, but no object or space actively constrains a final tactical choice; the woman’s smile is charged yet external to the closing image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—uplift the unseen—tightens when Elias risks his shrewd reputation by hand-delivering envelopes without credit. Pressure escalates accumulatively: each worker’s tear becomes social proof that narrows his future options back to profit. Cost is legible in the shift from shadow-observer to recognized “Silent Contributor,” a title that forecloses anonymity.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through the cycling envelopes: compassion is a harbor currency that appreciates only when spent anonymously. The final image of laughter drifting like tide reweights the opening ledger metaphor without moralizing. Subtext in Marta’s whispered “Lena” lets grief and gratitude coexist, resisting tidy uplift.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Elias’s perceptual signature—he notices “tidelines in teacups” and stacks crates in thought even while delivering hope. Syntax lengthens during nocturnal deliveries, then contracts at the final listening beat, mirroring his shift from calculation to contemplation. No dialogue to test voice distinction, but internal diction remains consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is lyrical yet propulsive; sentences carry double duty—description and moral arithmetic. One loop: “again in silence, again with care” repeats the cadence of earlier deliveries without fresh texture. Metaphors of tides and seasons stay coherent, but the harbor symphony metaphor vanishes after the opening, leaving faint structural echo.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>The anonymous-gift economy feels fresh against familiar “Christmas angel” tropes; the maritime ledger mis-delivery reframes it through dock-worker micro-trades. Risk is taken in the circular structure—ending where it begins under stars—yet the pattern is taught early and pays off. Specificity of job titles (foghorn tuner, tide-chart corrector) anchors novelty.</comment>
