<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory impulse—fear of relapse into numbness vs. hunger for rupture—drives every beat; the needle ritual crystallizes a visible cost (the cavern’s raw exposure) that forecloses safe silence. Interiority is embodied in cedar dust trembling up her spine, not labels. Micro-choice hierarchy is legible: she risks her own fragile equilibrium to offer students a scalpel, not a lullaby. The slight cap reflects one stock phrase (“hollow shells who smiled without meaning”) and an off-page grandfather memory used as convenient catalyst.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the luminous silence after the backward glitch reweights the entire filament of hush from fragile to radiant, cost paid in the cavern’s exposed sobs. Causality holds: needle → reversed Bach → sympathetic drum shudder → group contagion → new ritual. Orientation anchored by line 3; no penalty. One micro-turn (skip = sob) tightens stakes under Accumulative lens. Persistent constraint—future sessions must begin with rupture, not comfort—shapes tactics.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Cavern air, resin, and sage are filtered through Elara’s vibration-reading skin; drum-skins and dust motes act as micro-setting that constrains her final placement of the needle-relic. Spatial choreography clean: crate → rear alcove → turntable → center of largest drum. Seasonal crispness cues time without cliché. The broken needle as charged object passes the 9+ gate by altering tactics and charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—defeat her own numbness—signaled in paragraph 4; tightening occurs when the glitch forces her to host raw exposure instead of curated quiet. Agency: she cranks the dynamo, chooses broken needle, accepts sympathetic drum-shudder cost. Price visible: veteran’s cry, girl’s laugh, cavern’s loss of sanctuary status. No coincidence; escalation coherent under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from inverted music as emotional surgery: silence learns to scream. No moral stated; final image of needle-relic reweights hush from absence to potential. Subtext in gestures: students mirror palm-down posture, contagion without words. Avoids tidy catharsis—rupture becomes ongoing ritual, not cure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Texture is percussive and tactile: “cedar staves curved like ribs,” “rawhide stretched taut,” dust motes “danced when struck by unseen pulses.” Rhythm accelerates with crank-stutter-shriek sequence, then breathes into luminous silence. No head-hopping; single POV holds. One register drift—“sympathetic resonance” feels academic amid visceral diction—but brief.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>High information density: each sentence advances image, stakes, or cadence. No loops or scaffold; metaphor chain (ribs, bellies, scalpel) stays coherent. Opening line anchors voice and sensory path. Minor mixed metaphor—“filament of hush that could stitch fractured minds”—but repaired by tangible needle act.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: deaf healer weaponizes backward Bach via broken needle to make silence audible through glitch. Risk—ritualizing pain—pays off by converting cavern from sanctuary to surgery suite. Specific detail (hand-crank dynamo, dust motes as vibration read-out) prevents trope drift. Inevitable in hindsight yet non-obvious.</comment>
