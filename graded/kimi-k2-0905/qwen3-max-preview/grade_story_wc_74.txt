<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The painter’s quiet, nightly ritual and belief in encoded kindness are vividly interiorized; her refusal of fame/catharsis in favor of anonymous transmission gives her a crisp, idiosyncratic spine. The only lack is a second beat where her own kindness costs her something tangible—she stays safely in the giving role, so the arc is more stance-deepening than path-altering.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the teenage stranger entering to co-paint reconfigures the painter’s solitary mission into a communal future, the cost being her anonymity and the finite moonlight left tonight. Causal chain is tight—each glyph’s street-level echo is traced back to the brush—so the lens is cleanly causal throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Greenhouse glass, soot streaks, meteorite ink, and the airborne salt/jasmine puff give tactile specificity; the rooftop’s oxygen-starved height and moon-path alignment constrain how and when she can paint, so setting actively shapes tactics. Micro-setting doubles as tool, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—can dormant empathy be re-ignited without publicity—escalates through successive real-world kindness pulses traced to her glyphs; the tightening occurs when the billboard projection forces her anonymity to fray, visible cost being the meeting with the teen that ends her invisibility. One meaningful deepening suffices for this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of anonymous interconnection emerges through concrete cause-and-effect rather than statement; the final image of two strangers painting in moonlit silence offers a resonant, non-moral answer to the thematic question. No late authorial summary intrudes, so the subtext stays clean.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lyrical third-person hovers at a consistent mythic distance; diction (“saffron quiet,” “ink-pooled silence”) stays inside the painter’s perception without drifting into purple. Compressed syntax mirrors insomnia’s sparseness, and the moonlit brush is personified just enough to feel heirloom-alive.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is loop-free, with high-density sentences that layer scent, pigment, and resonance without scaffolding. Metaphors (ink pooling like silence) stay coherent; only a faint cadence repetition (“not for… but for…”) nicks perfection, not touching closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The premise—moon-calligraphy that materially seeds urban kindness—feels fresh, its execution grounded in archival grit and billboard tech rather than pure whimsy. Risk in blending extinct linguistics with quiet magical realism pays off because every beat stays causally traceable to the glyphs.</comment>
