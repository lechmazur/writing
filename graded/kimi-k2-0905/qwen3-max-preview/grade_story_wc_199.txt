<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elira’s interiority is lush, tactile, and consistent—“mossy delight” is both affect and worldview; every micro-choice (prodding the speck, humming, embedding dust) flows from her need to listen. The final grandmother-touch crystallizes a credible internal change with visible cost: she weeps, moss blooms, her satchel now “heavy with dust-specks and unsung elegies.” No therapy-speak; contradictions (delight amid ash) stay embodied. The only micro-slip: “singular” motivation is stated once rather than dramatized in tension, but the steady escalation of stakes overrides it.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens: each leaf-descent, dust-speck, and monument adds density until the arbor’s glyphs cohere into a legible past. Closure is a Charged Poise: the grandmother’s translucent hand reweights Elira’s vocation—she will keep sorting, but now “each seed carries a whisper.” Cost is felt in the bodily bloom of moss and the heavier satchel. No causality breaks; even the speck’s awakening is anchored in reverent prodding.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The ashen skyborne arbor is no backdrop; its petrified-root canopy and coded leaf-fall constrain every action and supply the story’s lexicon. The moonstone speck functions as micro-setting—embedded in bark crevices, it literally stitches memory into matter. Spatial choreography is clean: root-knot → fern-tip → wrist → monuments. Final image of root-fiber grandmother charges the environment with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“decode the message”—tightens when the speck’s lullaby proves the arbor speaks in memory, not prophecy. Each embedded dust-speck raises the emotional ante: charred rye scent, medal clink, unshed tears. The grandmother’s emergence is not coincidence but cumulative pressure made manifest; it forecloses exile and turns the arbor into public sanctuary. Visible price: Elira’s tears, her satchel’s weight, the travelers she must now tend.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges as “the past is perpetually unfolding, asking only to be seen.” No moralizing; the final image of humming towers of light reconfigures exile into communion. Subtext lives in silence: the hush where past meets prophecy is never labeled, only enacted. The baker’s burnt loaf and soldier’s apology carry irreducible specificity, resisting tidy universals.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person lyric remains tight to Elira’s perceptual signature: velocity of leaves, scent of char, taste of petrichor. Syntax mirrors her sorting mind—cascading participles, hyphenated compounds (“dew-glass beads,” “root-fiber”). No head-hop; grandmother’s voice is filtered through Elira’s wrist-vine. Rhythm swells toward the dawn moment then settles into the hush, matching the tonal modulation from delight to weeping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High metaphor density is justified by the accumulative design; each figurative layer adds memory-texture rather than clutter. Zero synonym loops or template cadence. Minor risk: “mossy delight” thrice-repeated could feel tic-like, but the final tear-bloom recharges the phrase. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with leaf-fall cadence; no scaffold sentences.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fuses cli-fi exile, folkloric dust-library, and quiet eco-liturgy into an inevitable whole. The moonstone-speck-as-memory-loom is a fresh inflection unseen in prior arboreal fiction. Risk—lyric excess—pays off because the closure reweights the premise: prophecy is retrospection. Specificity of “baker’s burnt loaf deemed unworthy” prevents abstraction. Conceptual integrity holds; no retreat into generic moral.</comment>
