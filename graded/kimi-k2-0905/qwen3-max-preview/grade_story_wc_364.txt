<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Interiority is vivid—"felt its call in his marrow," "small and sure"—and Arlo’s contradiction (meek yet unyielding) is active in every descent/forge choice. The final renunciation of silk is earned by the prior pattern of giving it away; cost (loss of magic conduit) is visible. No secondary character applies pressure, so status/relationship bullets are waived; solo micro-choices still trace a credible arc.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each silk-thread gift tightens the pattern until the last length charges the wall glyph—closure is a Charged Poise where magic returns to world, not object. Causality holds: silk diminishes → community strengthens → glyph locks → Arlo becomes conduit. No orientation debt; who/where anchored by word 40. Cost is felt: “He didn’t need the silk anymore” = conceptual repricing with personal forfeiture.</comment>

<comment>Micro-setting (silk, forge, mine wall) constrains every beat; floating orchard arches mirror the upward release after underground pressure. Sensory economy is exact—"orchard blossoms drifted…like silent kites"—and filtered through blacksmith’s eye (metal, soot, resonance). Final image of arches humming recharges opening vista, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—prove meekness can transmute rubble into hope—tightens as silk dwindles; each gift is an earned micro-turn that narrows Arlo’s option to keep any magic for himself. Visible price: last length sacrificed to fix glyph, foreclosing future forge-magic. Agency drives every escalation; no coincidence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: resilience is a communally forged currency, not an individual power-up. Subtext sits in silence—villagers never thank Arlo aloud, yet return stronger. Final hinge wrapped in remnant silk offers non-literal answer: magic is the act of giving away what you hoped would save you. No moralizing, only image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Distinct perceptual signature: blacksmith’s synesthesia—"shimmering like liquid twilight," "frequency of half-remembered spells"—maintained throughout. Rhythm compresses under pressure ("He packed his tools, blew out the lantern, and climbed") yet stays in character-sure cadence. No dialogue, so evaluation is on lyrical free-indirect texture; it remains clean and pattern-taught.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>High-density lines—“time existed between understanding and confusion” doing triple duty—propel without scaffold. Figurative control precise: mixed-metaphor vigilance finds none. Minor paraphrase loop in “magic never did when shared without greed” / “magic returned, woven into soil, steel, and spirit” costs −0.2; closure image untouched. Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Premise—meek blacksmith barters away magician’s silk to re-enchant a post-magic orchard planet—feels fresh, not riffed from familiar templates. Transformation test passes: Arlo’s quiet defiance is inseparable from this floating-root world. Risk in quiet lyric ending heightens resonance without gimmick. One fresh inflection: glyph that previously dissolved now holds because the weaver has become the weave.</comment>
