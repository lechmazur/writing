<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The guardian’s motivation is ancient, non-verbal, and consistently dramatized through tactile micro-choices—mirror angles, shutter nudges—each costing her solitude and bodily exposure. Her contradictory impulse—stoic silence versus active intervention—plays out in real time, culminating in the renunciation of voice that lets the drowned woman choose ascent. The embodied cost is legible: she wipes dew from the mirror and steps back into shadow, path foreclosed. No slips; the interior hierarchy (silence > self > stranger) is shown, not labeled.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the final unbroken star-beam re-configures the canal’s rule-set—darkness now accommodates light without expelling the guardian. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each shutter-tilt adds refracted glyphs that accumulate into the one sustained beam; cost is the guardian’s perpetual exile, visible when she “stepped back into shadow.” No orientation debt; who/where/when anchored by line 3. Causal chain intact—mirror → glyphs → drowned woman’s slower sink → star pierces. Persistent constraint (eternal vigilance) shapes every tactical tilt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Cobalt dock, rain-slick planks, and iron shutters are not backdrop but instruments: the planks’ grain is read like braille, the shutters’ hinges are oiled to whisper, and the lock’s spillway becomes the screen for life-or-death glyphs. Environment physically constrains stance—crouching, fingertip leverage, mirror submersion—and charges the final image when unfiltered starlight hits the same water. Micro-setting (dental mirror) likewise constrains angle of reflection, deciding which glyphs appear. No static postcards; every sensory detail alters tactical possibility.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will the next soul choose drowning—is signaled early and tightened when the new shadow appears. Guardian’s agency: she “nudged the shutter left—then right—then left again,” each micro-tilt narrowing the drowned woman’s options toward gentler submission. Cost is legible: guardian’s own withdrawal into shadow shows perpetual forfeiture of rest. One meaningful deepening suffices; no reversals required under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: darkness as audience, not enemy, taught by iterative star-glyphs. The dental mirror’s re-weighting—from stolen toy to soul-lens—embodies the concept that salvaged refuse can redirect fate. Final image (one true star unswallowed) non-literally answers the thematic question—value taught, not by sermon, but by refraction. No moralizing; resonance lingers in after-image of ladder-of-light.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Third-person omniscient stays outside the guardian yet retains her perceptual signature—silence, braille-wood, constellations in water. Syntax is spiralingly calm: long breath-like clauses, sibilance, muted verbs (“trace,” “nudge,” “cradle”). No head-hopping; drowned woman’s interior accessed only via gesture and smile. Compression taught early—“silence was her dialect”—and paid off when final star speaks without words.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary from 5-word pulses to 35-word undulating clauses, rhythm mimicking tidal inhale/exhale. Figurative language is selective—one vehicle per beat—e.g., “ladder of light” followed by concrete tactile clicks. Zero paraphrase loops; each image advances glyph, body, or stakes. No mixed metaphors; “bruised clouds” and “drowned sapphire” coexist within aquatic color-plane.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fusion of stolen children’s toy + iron sewage shutters + dental mirror as soul-periscope is non-obvious and inevitable in hindsight. Urban-legend frame—guardian maintains threshold, not canal—flips familiar ghost-story vector. Risk of lyric still-water tension pays off: no dialogue, no confrontation, yet stakes feel mortal. Fresh inflection: starlight as pedagogy rather than salvation.</comment>
