<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Interiority is rich—“abrasive calm,” “deliberate pacing,” “muttering counter-arguments”—but the arc is static endurance; no contradictory impulse forces a visible pivot, so the renunciation feels pre-decided rather than earned in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each layer/catalogue entry thickens the stake of memory vs. erasure. Closure lands as Charged Poise—cog on bell, water shifting—conceptual cost legible, but the beat is more tableau than tightening; no option is newly foreclosed, only re-affirmed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Environment, body, tool triad all constrain: tilted cathedral spire limits ascent, oilcloth sleepskin shapes nightly ritual, cog’s tick calibrates his refusal. Sensory economy is lean yet specific—“phosphorescent glow of fungi” charges the final image; no spatial drift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—memory vs. amnesia—signalled early; pressure accumulates via each salvaged artifact, but no reversal or fresh trade-off emerges. Council’s steel obelisk is declarative, not an active obstacle that narrows his tactics; escalation is atmospheric, not tactical.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges from sedimentary cataloguing: memory as geological patience vs. surface slogans. Final cog-on-bell image reweights “time in erosion” without moralising; ambiguity between futility and permanence lingers. Avoids explicit thesis, earns resonance.</answer>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is a sustained perceptual signature—star-drowned, tide-scored lexicon, rhythmic inward argument. Syntax swells and contracts with fungal light, never defaults to template; abrasive calm modulates into whispered coordinates without distance slip.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>High density—each sentence layers archive, body, concept—yet occasional Latinate stacks (“methodology incarnate”) flirt with register drift. No loops or mixed metaphors in peak beats; final line “grain by grain” is deliberate cadence, not artifact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Inverted-archive philosopher mapping ruin via sewer strata is fresh synthesis; trope of post-plague scavenger transformed by sedimentary epistemology. Risk—static refusal rather than plot—paid off by resonant closure image that could not exist without this exact conceit.</comment>
