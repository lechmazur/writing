<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interiority is textured (“collecting hands”), embodied emotion vivid (tracing knots), micro-choice to kneel and offer fulgurite signals motive. Patience trait stays active, but no internal contradiction surfaces; the arc is steady acceptance rather than a clash of wants. Closure cost is felt via the coil of rope she now carries, yet the shift from seed-collector to knot-bearer is declared more than dramatized. Still, specificity of gesture and idiom keep her above archetype.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: she leaves with rope and promise, options re-weighted by Havel’s gift. Causal lens holds—each knot learned is a because/therefore step toward inheriting the weave. Orientation anchored by word 80; no debt. Cost is legible in the final image of the coiled “sleeping serpent of wisdom.” One hairline slip: “collecting hands” is abstract in the moment of realization, not fully dramatized.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dock, snow, fog, tarred hemp—each detail is filtered through her digger’s eye and used: cold slows fingers, fog muffles sound, rope texture teaches. Micro-setting (rope in palm) constrains every knot attempt. Fulgurite glint at the end recharges the opening image, locking environment to closure. No sensory checklist; selection is spare, purposeful.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve living memory—tightens when Havel demands proof of intent; each knot learned narrows her future path. Agency is present: she asks, mimics, accepts the rope. One visible cost: she forfeits her former seed-collector identity (“You’re not collecting seeds anymore”). Escalation is gradual, accumulative, but the final tightening beat is soft—no irrevocable act, only a promise.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges: transmission of embodied knowledge versus archival preservation. Subtext lives in gesture—offering lightning-glass for silence, not explanation. Final image of seeds that “grow where lightning struck” reweights fulgurite from relic to future medium, avoiding moral. No thematic echo; insight stays implicit. Complexity acknowledged: modern forgetting is not condemned, only countered by her choice to carry.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays close to her perceptual filter: geological metaphors, horticultural idiom, hush-toned cadence. Syntax lengthens during mimicry, shortens during tactile discovery, mirroring attention shifts. No head-hop; Havel’s interior remains opaque, shown only in rasped half-sentences. Distinctive rhythmic control—snow, fog, rope, breath form a hushed percussion that modulates without monotony.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet fluid: “jagged, frozen lightning captured in silica” does triple sensory job. No loops or synonym churn; each metaphor extends the storm-weave conceit. One near-purple phrase—“oceanic hush that settled as fog rolled”—but it pays off thematically. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with scene tempo; paragraph cuts are surgical.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Familiar trope—elder passes craft to seeker—made fresh via knot-as-language, fulgurite as barter for silence, and seed-collector’s pivot to “collecting hands.” Specificity of maritime knot names (“storm’s eye,” “widow’s braid”) grounds the magic. Risk: quiet accumulative structure rather than dramatic reversal; coherence maintained. Synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight, not borrowed.</comment>
