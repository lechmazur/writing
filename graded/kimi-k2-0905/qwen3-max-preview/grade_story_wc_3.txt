<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete, sensorially anchored (“felt that echo in her marrow”), and her methodological kindness is enacted in the refusal to plant until alignment is achieved. The decisive renunciation—bowing instead of claiming—pays off the buried-dissertation flaw and costs her the monument she might have seized; the causality is intact. Micro-choices (inventing the forgiveness sign, letting tendrils brush without grasping) reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. Only the tiniest riff of diagnostic self-talk (“physics of transition”) keeps this from 9+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the seedling writes an untranslatable glyph in air, reconfiguring meaning while Elira bows, paying the cost of permanent incomprehension. Causal linkage holds—each cuneiform gesture tightens magnetic resonance until the seed splits; no teleporting props. The Orientation Test is waived: deliberate disorientation (no wind yet branches sway) is taught in sentence 1 and pays off in the final image of language becoming living arbor. Accumulation cap does not apply; closure untouched.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Micro-setting—seed, gloved hand, solidified-memory soil—constrains every beat; the arbor’s magnetic field literally bends light that later shapes the cuneiform halos. Sensory economy is fierce: three senses per paragraph max, always filtered through translator’s epistemic bias. Spatial choreography is pristine; she steps back exactly once, and that distance is the story’s titular rule. Environment could not be swapped without breaking the physics of transition premise.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will she decode transition or be consumed by it—tightens when her own academic ghosts surface; the invented “forgiveness” sign narrows options from scholar to midwife of meaning. Cost is visible: she forfeits lexical certainty, accepting an untranslatable glyph she bows to rather than owns. Agency is methodical renunciation, not triumph. A hairline slip: the geomancer’s stakes are told more than dramatized, keeping this just under 9.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges entirely through image and syntax—cuneiform becomes living circuitry, silence becomes script—never named. The final bow reweights all prior knowledge quests as acts of reverence, not mastery, achieving Conceptual Repricing without a moral. Subtext is carved into gesture: letting the seed write its own sign is the anti-colonial argument. No platitudes, no final-paragraph thesis; resonance is pure after-image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is crystalline: magnetic hum, obsidian warmth, unfinished-thought halos—every metaphor is translator-specific. Rhythmic control escalates from long scholarly sentences to the final four-word bow, mirroring the shift from analysis to reverence. No head-hop; POV distance stays interior yet visceral. Filter verbs are voice-motivated (“she felt that echo”) and disappear under pressure, replaced by tactile immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero scaffolding; every sentence advances image or causality. Figurative language is patterned—magnetic/light/cuneiform—so density penalty is waived. No mixed metaphors; vehicles stay within physics of arbor. Read-aloud rhythm accelerates into the three-beat finale: “Let it grow. Let it remember. Let it become.”—a cadence taught by earlier recitations.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: cuneiform + magnetosphere + grief botany feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk—refusing to translate the final glyph—heightens coherence rather than obscuring it. No stock tropes; even “knowledge fruit” is re-rooted in Mesopotamian mythic logic. Transformation test fails if renamed: the specificity of wedge-writing and magnetic resonance is irreplaceable.</comment>
