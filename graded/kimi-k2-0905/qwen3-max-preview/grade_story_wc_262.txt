<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The gazer’s interiority is vivid—her spatial imagination is dramatized through the film-handling ritual and the discovery of the letters; her recognition micro-choice (“she, too, had written goodbye letters…”) anchors empathy. The final act of mailing the decades-late letters crystallizes a credible renunciation with visible cost: she leaves the theater lighter yet burdened by the weight of witness. No contradictory impulses collide in-scene, so the arc is slightly tidy, but the embodied emotion and earned stasis satisfy the 9+ quick test almost fully.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a textbook Conceptual Repricing: the marquee’s un-programmed epigraph—“LOVE NEVER ENDS — ONLY CHANGES FORM”—reweights every prior vault-of-love image with undeniable social cost. The lens is Accumulative/Textural; density crests when the oilcloth bundle is revealed, then re-crystallizes in the rain-walk image. Causality is intact: because she incubates the film, therefore she finds the letters, therefore she chooses release, therefore the theater exhales. Cost is legible in the final line—lanterns ready to go out—so the ending lands on the page, not in summary.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The projection booth’s velvet dust, ozone smell, and rusted canister constrain every tactile move; the film strip itself becomes micro-setting that must be handled gently, shaping her breath-by-breath tactics. Spatial choreography is flawless—spiral staircase, hidden compartment, marquee flicker—each object re-appears to charge the exit image. Weather (rain drumming the dome) tightens the hushed-thunder tone and literally softens to a sigh at release, mirroring interior pressure without overt symbolism. The 9+ gate is met: the film-strip-tool and theater-walls together foreclose her earlier quest for “storage” and force the pivot to motion.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“where unused love is stored”—is signaled in paragraph 3 and tightens when the letters are found, forcing a public vs. private archive choice. One meaningful deepening suffices: the shift from seeking storage to choosing release narrows options and carries felt price (she will mail letters to strangers, risk exposure). Agency is interior but active; no external antagonist is needed. Cost is visible on-page: “letters cradled against her chest like rescued birds,” ready for uncertain skies—this image fulfills the Q4 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: unused love as material archive that demands witness, not ownership. Subtext lives in gesture—the trembling fingers, the whispered “Thank you”—never in exposition. The final marquee glitch literalizes the conceptual re-pricing without sermonizing. The moral ambiguity is preserved: release may wound descendants or glorify strangers; the gazer accepts that uncertainty as cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person lyric close-focus sustains a consistent poetic register that matches the gazer’s synesthetic perception. Rhythm modulates: long breath-like sentences incubate memory, then shorten into staccato beats (“She rose, knees stiff…”) as decision nears. No head-hopping; psychic distance stays intimate. Diction stays within her metaphysical lexicon—“vault for unsung lullabies,” “second skeleton”—so the elevated register feels earned, not grafted.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Line-level craft is dense yet musical; metaphor layers (“ink still wet with apology”) carry double duty. No synonym loops or template cadence detected; each sentence advances knowledge or atmosphere. One mixed metaphor—“lanterns on a river, glowing until they’re ready to go out”—is permissible at closure where the emotional logic overrides physical impossibility. Information density is high: a single sentence can deliver scent, backstory, and foreshadowing.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Premise—psychometric archaeologist of orphaned love—is fresh, and the 1947 film strip plus projection-booth vault feels non-obvious. The “love never ends” marquee glitch risks near-triteness, but it is saved by being diegetically un-programmed, hence a genuine rupture. Risk-taking in lyric accumulation could have collapsed into sentimentality; instead, specificity of the oilcloth bundle and looping cursive keeps it grounded. Not quite a 9 because the core metaphor—unused love as physical residue—is familiar, merely re-lit brilliantly.</comment>
