<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is rich and embodied (“grief had scraped her soul to marrow”); the contradiction between making beauty from grief and never claiming credit is credible. The final gesture—placing the crane on the library steps—crystallizes her renunciation with visible cost: she will never know if the locket is opened. Voice-specific tics (“curtains of intention”) occasionally edge toward self-conscious lyricism, nudging her below the 9-band. Still, her micro-choices (fold, burnish, release) form a legible hierarchy of values.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the observatory curtains stir miles away, proving the network of grief-breadcrumbs is alive and re-weighting her solitude into communion. The causal chain—fold → leave → stranger’s unseen uptake → curtains glow—earns the resonance without sentimentality. Time-pool design is taught early and pays off when distance collapses in the final image. Cost is undeniable: she surrenders even the knowledge of whether her gift works.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>“Weighted silk the color of twilight” and shuttered lenses convert the observatory from star-machine to grief-chapel; the brass locket cavity functions as micro-setting that literally holds absence. Sensory economy favors touch and weight over visual catalogues. Spatial choreography stays clean across city-wide folds and returns. The environment’s emotional responsiveness (curtains glow to ache) is internally consistent and charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“teach withering to bloom again”—is signaled early and tightens through iterative acts of release; each origami surrendered is a self-imposed loss of proof. Escalation is accumulative: density of unmourned coordinates increases until the curtains’ stir confirms the circuit is live. No reversal in the classic sense, but the final resonance reweights her solitude into shared circuitry. Cost is felt: she forfeits witness, forever unsure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the reframing of artificiality as sacred—“the meaning? That was real as bone”—without ever moralizing. The network of empty lockets and paper animals argues that constructed tenderness can outperform organic closure, a conceptual repricing that lands in the last crane. Subtext operates in silence: she never signs, never stays, never knows. The reader carries the haunted sense that invisible infrastructures of care might already surround them.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person POV maintains consistent lyric distance; diction (“ephemera soaked in other people’s endings”) is specific to the maker’s profession. No dialogue, so voice distinction is tested through perceptual signature alone, which passes. Filter verbs are sparse and earned (“she felt the observatory’s curtains stir”). Rhythmic compression under pressure—single-line paragraphs for each fold-leave act—propels without drum-beat monotony.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings avoid template cadence. Information density is high—each sentence layers grief-craft, astronomy, and city geography without pad. One mixed-metaphor risk: “time pooled here like spilled ink” is salvaged by immediate calibration “neither advancing nor retreating.” Zero paraphrase loops or synonym churn. Final line (“faintest warmth return to their chest”) risks mild abstraction but is earned by concrete crane-to-chest relay.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The inversion of observatory-as-grief-engine and the premise that paper coordinates can reroute sorrow feel fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Synthesis of horology, origami, and mourning jewelry is specific to this voice; removal would collapse the story. Risk in shuttering an observatory from stars to feelings pays off via the glowing-curtain closure. No close echoes of famous scenes; the network-of-anonymous-gifts trope is retooled through astronomical resonance.</comment>
