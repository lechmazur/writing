<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The skimmer’s stillness-as-quest is dramatized through micro-gesture and arrowhead touch; the refusal to move carries a visible cost in calcified bone towers and the loneliness of centuries. Interiority stays concrete—tuning marrow to crow-wing rhythm—but the absence of any contradictory impulse keeps contradiction theoretical rather than visceral. The Earned Stasis lands cleanly, yet the skimmer’s persona remains more icon than fully flawed individual.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: density of dust/bone/crow layers tightens until the pulse nests in the ribcage, reweighting meaning. Closure is Charged Poise: the final image—“let the world move around it”—crystallizes options and registers cost without physical act. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are lyrically delayed but taught by 25 % and payoff at closure; no penalty applied.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The canyon’s fossilized bone towers function as micro-setting: their calcified ribs literally dictate where noon shadow kisses, determining the safe passage the skimmer will later mirror to wanderers. Crow-flock thermals are rendered as tactile wind instruments the body must tune to; dust motes carry ancestral breath. Weathered arrowhead and tower-surface textures constrain gesture—smooth thumb on smooth stone—charging the final “landmark” image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—becoming a living waypoint—tightens once: the pulse’s arrival inside the chest forecloses personal motion forever while enabling others’ survival. Pressure grows texturally: layered centuries, obsidian wings, fossil dust accumulate until the skimmer’s stance crystallizes. Cost is felt but could be sharper on-page; the sacrifice is more conceptual than viscerally dramatized.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: guidance is mirrored stillness, not chased motion. Motif of listening versus running recurs through marrow, dust, wingbeats; final image of surrender-as-direction reweights all prior flight patterns without stating a moral. Ambiguity is purposeful—readers must decide whether stasis is transcendence or eternal prison—yielding concrete after-effect of hush and awe.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Third-person lyric camera sustains a luminous, archeological diction—“calcified under centuries of layered dust,” “ribs that had calcified”—that never drifts outside the skimmer’s plausible lexicon of reverence. Rhythm flexes with aerial murmuration: long clauses spiral, then fracture into monosyllables at closure. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is obsessive tactile listening. Compressed syntax (“not blink—for movement was the enemy”) accelerates under pressure without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sentence variety, strong verbs, and high density: one line often layers marrow-tuning, sky-reading, and duty-for-skin. Occasional stacked modifiers—“black as obsidian shards”—border on overload but serve the accumulative design; no mixed metaphors. A few noun-phrase appositals feel slightly catalogue-like, yet propel rather than stall. Final line lands with crystalline snap.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The premise—still sentinel who learns direction by surrendering motion—feels inevitable yet fresh. Bone towers, crow-flight navigation, and arrowhead-memory synthesize into a singular mythic logic that would collapse if any element were swapped. Risk of stasis-as-plot is embraced fully, turning potential paralysis into transcendent stance. No close cultural or literary echoes; the vision is self-originated.</comment>
