<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Aris’s porous receptivity to the uncanny is shown through his immediate, wordless acceptance of the seed and the nightly soil-braille ritual; the vow beneath the willow embodies an enduring contradiction—embracing stench and decades of waiting—that drives every later design choice. Yet “old and satisfied” compresses a lifetime of obsession into a label, blunting the embodied cost of lifelong monomania. Interiority loops the same abstract refrain (“innovation needs rot”) rather than letting contradictions fester on the page. Still, the final journal line turns the earlier vow into earned stasis: the refusal to force bloom forecloses an easier fame and leaves the seed’s silence as the lasting price.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The seed’s arrival → planting → room design → sideways sprout → posthumous journal forms a clean causal chain under an Accumulative/Textural lens; each beat adds density to the myth rather than chasing external plot. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: “The seed was never meant to flower” reweights every prior puzzle and obsession, revealing the cost is lifelong dedication to potential, not actual bloom. One过渡性微转：the shoot grows sideways—an on-page reversal that bends gravity in the next room, tightening options without breaking causality. Orientation is anchored by word 40 (“nocturnal haven beside a quiet brook”) and held; no ambiguity at closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Moonlight “like liquid mercury” and reeds “whisper” seed the brook micro-setting early; the willow’s shadow becomes cathedral via tactile nightly kneeling, charging the final image. The corpse-flower myth is woven through scent-based riddles and phantom odors, letting setting constrain puzzle mechanics. Spatial choreography stays clean: envelope → willow base → nightly soil-braille → journal buried beside the same brook. Weather (autumn wind of “burnt sugar”) appears only at the sprout beat, serving the cadence shift rather than cataloguing.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—can Aris hold space for the grotesquely slow without forcing it?—is signaled at the vow and tightens when the shoot spirals sideways, forcing him to surrender control into the next room’s gravity-bend. There is no external antagonist; pressure is ontological: decade-long dormancy versus entrepreneurial clock. The meaningful turn is the sideways sprout that reweights “flow” from metaphor to literal physics in the Spiral Root room, visible price paid in lifelong delay of bloom. Cost is conceptual but legible: he forfeits conventional success for mythic latency.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges obliquely: beauty-through-rot, innovation-as-patience. No character sermonizes; the journal’s final line is a crystallized stance, not a moral. The seed’s “never meant to flower” re-prices the entire escapist enterprise, leaving the reader with an after-image of dedication to unborn potential. Ambiguity lingers—was the obsession wisdom or delusion—without false equivalence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Lyric-omniscient voice sustains a controlled cadence, pulsing with alliteration (“moonlight skimmed… liquid mercury”). Diction stays within a dark-fantasy register, avoiding corporate intrusion. Perceptual signature favors synesthetic leaps—scent → sound, silence → pressure—mirroring Aris’s orthogonal mind. No dialogue to corrupt voice; internal monologue is filtered through sensory metaphor rather than diagnostic labels.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense but breathable; sentence length modulates to mirror obsession’s hypnotic pull. Figurative layering is purposeful, not ornamental—each image seeds a later puzzle mechanic. Minor template cadence in “He didn’t… He didn’t…” triad, but it serves incantatory effect. No mixed metaphors; “obsidian-black, veined with crimson” is precise and consistent.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The escape-room designer who builds a room around a seed that refuses to bloom is a fresh synthesis of botanic anomaly and immersive-art obsession. The sideways-growing root re-weights gravity in live gameplay—an orthogonal leap that feels inevitable once seeded. avoids both sci-fi technobabble and gothic cliché by rooting spectacle in one man’s nightly soil ritual. Risk taken: a story whose climax is non-flowering; the Conceptual Repricing makes restraint feel radical rather with the ordinary trope of glorious fruition.</comment>
