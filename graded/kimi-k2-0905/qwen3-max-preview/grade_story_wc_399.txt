<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The walker’s quiet endurance and asymmetrical mask create a credible, low-key mystic; her sole purpose—“preserve the echo of wisdom”—is legible and consistent. Interiority stays concrete (“scent of dry sage and ozone guide her breath”) rather than abstract. No contradictory impulse or visible flaw complicates her, so the arc is flat, but the consecration still costs her spent focus, satisfying the length’s modest change requirement.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each beat layers sensory density until the pavilion’s “satisfied” hush and the hovering clearings re-weight the stake. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—her withdrawal leaves the preserved silences hovering with conceptual cost: the pavilion can never again be merely stone. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 3 and hold. No causality breaks; every image answers to the final hush.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The pavilion’s lattice of “petrified vines and wind-sculpted arches” is tactile, spatially tracked, and directly shapes the ritual geography; the buried kinetic parapet hums beneath her palm, constraining the act. Sensory hierarchy follows her mystic attentiveness—sound before sight, temperature before color—keeping detail selective. Final image re-uses these anchors so the setting charges the closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“preserve the echo”—is signaled early; escalation is textural: each clearing thickens the air’s resonance until the last “satisfied” murmur forecloses further action. Cost is felt exhaustion and the pavilion’s irreversible sanctity. Agency is continuous attention rather than a single decisive act, fitting the accumulative lens. One meaningful tightening suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from silence-as-wisdom: not the prophet’s words but the hollows that absorb them. The half-mask literalizes the duality without sermon. Final image—wind now carrying “whispers” instead of dust—re-weights the premise sans moralizing. Ambiguity lingers: who will hear? Complexity preserved.</comment>

<question>6</message><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person lyric,_stable, never leaks POV. Syntax is sinewy, wind-like—“whisperfield calm,” “drip of dew”—mirroring the walker’s cadence. No dialogue, so voice purity stays intact. Compression (“she did not force…she simply remained”) teaches the peripheral method early and pays off in the final hush.</comment>

<comment>Rhythm modulates: long breathy sentences for stillness, fragments for gear-clicks. Metaphors stay physical (stone, dew, pollen) and coherent. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence adds density. No artifact touches the final image. Read-aloud ear test passes at every paragraph break.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Desert-mystic trope is refreshed by engineering relics (kinetic parapet) and the non-blood consecration via “peripheral awareness.” The conjured clearings—psychic hollows made visible—offer a fresh mechanic for preservation. Risk is quietness, but coherence holds. Specificity of resin-stained temple-wood mask and sandstone hum keeps it from generic mysticism.</comment>
