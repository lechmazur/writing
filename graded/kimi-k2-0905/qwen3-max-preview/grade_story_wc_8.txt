<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Interiority is rich—“ivy… like veins of forgotten time,” “pulse quickened not from fear… but from the weight”—and her renunciation of triumphalism is embodied in the quiet exit. Yet the causality of her decision to “draw parallels” rather than publish raw is asserted in reflection, not dramatized under pressure; the cost is announced, not tasted. Still, her calibrated emotion and the final refusal of triumph earn a credible Earned Stasis.</comment>

<comment>Causal lens holds: discovery→plan→exit, each because/therefore link legible. Closure is a clean Charged Poise—she steps off the platform having foreclosed the heroic path, rose-petal image reweighting the lie she will dismantle. Cost is felt—“no triumph in her stride”—but not yet paid in flesh or social capital, keeping it shy of 9.0.</comment>

<comment>Damp-gloom station, brass edge of a secret hollow, crimson petal in a puddle: selective sensory triad that doubles as tool and mirror. Micro-setting (the letter’s gold leaf catching twilight) literally guides her next move—she pockets it and times spring release. Environment constrains discovery and later tactics; ivy-as-veins image re-enters the final cadence, charging closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—rescue truth from national myth—signaled in paragraph 2. One meaningful tightening: realization that publishing raw would “snuff the lantern” forces her pivot to metaphoric method; this narrows her path and raises reputational risk. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral; pressure tightens but never becomes bodily endangerment, capping escalation just below high-band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without sermon: family myths→national myth, rose petal mirroring the last drip of pretense. Final image answers the core question—how to tell truth without destroying the fragile public—by showing her quiet exit; no moral is declared. Subtext operates in the station’s sigh and the rose’s surrender, inviting reader to grieve and rebuild.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric flexes syntax—“ivy strangling… roots cracking”—yet filter stays historian-attuned (dates, vellum, archives). Rhythm accelerates at discovery, then lengthens into resolve, matching emotional contour. No dialogue, so voice purity rests on perceptual signature; “keystone to her life’s work” is slightly academic but earned by professional lens.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>High density—“ticket-counter hollow known only to scholars who still believed archives could bleed” does three jobs in one clause. No loops; metaphors stay coherent (ivy/veins, rose/pretense). Occasional elevated Latinate diction (“calculated fabrication,” “conceptual repricing”) nudges register above spoken range but fits historian POV; does not obscure closure.</comment>

<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Freshening the familiar “historian-exposes-myth” by focusing on method—parallel with family airbrushing—rather than simple expose. Rose-petal reprise feels inevitable yet not pre-announced. Risk is lyrical compression; it pays off in resonant final image without gimmickry. Could swap names, but the fusion of personal-archive metaphor with national myth is specific enough.</comment>
