<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elira’s interiority is textured—her thumb tracing scratched-out names, the warmth she feeds into the ink—yet the operative contradiction between “gentle” and “negotiator” never manifests as an on-page choice that costs her; the final smile feels bestowed rather than wrested from contradictory impulses. No micro-choice visibly risks her identity or safety, so the endurance lacks a wound we can feel.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the thumb-print mosaic reframes the clipboard into a mirror whose cost is the irrevocable publicity of their consent under triple moons. Causality holds—her ritual preparation summons the soldiers—yet the story leans Accumulative: density of celestial and volcanic imagery reweights the stake rather than narrows tactical options. Orientation is swift; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The terrace’s volcanic grain, triple-moon halos, and the scent of burnt sage are filtered through Elira’s ritual attention; the dais she converts from grain-altar to ink-altar physically constrains the final signing. Micro-setting (clipboard as portable altar) charges the closing image, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—make peace a pulse, not a pause—is signaled early and tightens when the first sentry arrives; the pressure is textural (moonlight, ink, oaths) rather than causal, adequate for Accumulative lens. A visible price is legible—her palm warms the ink, sealing personal presence into the pact—but no option is foreclosed for Elira herself, keeping the score below 8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through the inversion of altar-offering: grain becomes ink, gods become witnesses, negotiator becomes priest. The final mirror image reweights “redemption” from abstract absolution to embodied, flawed consent—no moral is stated, but the cost is felt in the smudged thumbprints that can never be withdrawn.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person intimate maintains consistent psychic distance; diction—“operatively gentle,” “binding rhythm”—is character-bound and rhythmic without purple drift. No dialogue, so voice distinction is judged solely on narrative texture, which modulates cadence to match ritual slowness and peaks at the final whispered line.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and clause structure; metaphor is selective (meteorite ink, dove-bone pen) and tied to ritual stakes. One paraphrase loop—“she had come to… she had come to…”—but it occurs early and does not touch closure. No mixed metaphors or filter-verb stacks in the final third.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>The fusion of diplomatic thriller with pagan liturgy feels fresh; the clipboard-as-portable-altar and thumb-print covenant transform familiar peace-treaty tropes. Risk is moderate—lyric ritual over plot reversals—but the synthesis is specific enough to resist name-and-place swap test.</comment>
