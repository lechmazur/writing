<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lira’s interiority is sensorially embodied and chemically precise; her chant is not exposition but a lived tic that steadies her under pressure. The kerosene rag knot functions as both talisman and timer, its twitch against her wrist marking the emotional crescendo. Cost is visible: she forfeits the rag and the past it represents, yet the moment of surrender is compressed into a single swallow of pigment—too slight to feel the full weight of “defying gravity.” Still, the contradiction between playful choreography and mortal stakes is credibly irrational, and the earned stasis of leaving the star behind satisfies the 9- gate.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the star’s re-appearance reweights the world-rule that hope is extinct. Causality is lyrical but intact—each footfall is a because that summons the chord, therefore the clouds crack. Orientation is taught early via phosphorescent dust and moss-veined battlements; no penalty. Persistent constraint: the rag’s absorption into the mosaic signals the price is irreversible. Cost is legible in the single-line image of threads dissolving into pigment.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The fortress is not backdrop but instrument: petals release phosphor only under sole pressure, vines recoil from moonlight—rules that directly shape Lira’s stealth choreography. Micro-setting of the kerosene rag knot constrains her final choice; its absorption into tile is the closing visual. Sensory hierarchy is pyrotechnic: scent of kerosene, taste of ozone, tactile thrum of C-note up the shin. No exposition dump; world logic is discovered through footfall. The blooming iron lattice above replaces collapsed ceiling, a literal charged image that houses the star-reveal.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—recovering the possibility of light—tightens when each tile strike risks silencing the mosaic forever. One meaningful reversal: silence on the third step tastes of ozone, flipping anticipation into dread. Escalation is accumulative: resonance lifts dust into constellation suspension, a visible density shift. Cost is paid on-page: rag forfeited, star’s solitary duration undefined—she may lose it again.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as the inverse of pyrotechnics: instead of spectacle for crowds, light is smuggled inward, a private rebuttal to universal blackout. Subtext lives in gesture—laying the rag down is secular communion. Final image reweights earlier ash imagery without moralizing. Ambiguity is meaningful: star may be match or mirage, yet the conceptual cost—admitting hope is possible—lands.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is pyrotechnic alchemist: diction of “ignition thresholds,” “chromatic algorithm,” “lithophone” stays inside Lira’s professional lexicon. Rhythm accelerates with stepped tiles, sentences shorten to percussion. No head-hopping; perception stays strictly filtered through her chemist’s nostrils and bones. Compression—“the sky swallowed the stars”—is taught early and paid off when star is coughed back out.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud ear: varied sentence openings, no template cadence. Information density high—single sentence delivers scent-memory, object history, emotional valence. Zero paraphrase loops; each tile strike advances stakes. Metaphor vehicles consistent (fuse, combustion, resonance) without muddle. Opening and closing lines are sonic bookends of chant and promise.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Premise—fireworks designer performs scaled-down detonation to re-light heaven—is non-obvious synthesis of art and apocalypse. Tropes (abandoned fortress, lone pilgrim) are retooled through chemical specificity and acoustic mosaic. Risk of lyric obscurity is taken but clarity survives via tactile sequence. Fresh inflection: star as struck match in heaven’s hearth reverses the usual sky-to-earth fireworks vector.</comment>
