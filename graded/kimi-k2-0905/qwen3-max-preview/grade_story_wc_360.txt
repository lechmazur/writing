<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The operator’s hunger to “map the unmappable” is vivid, but interior contradiction is asserted rather than dramatized in scene; no micro-choice shows her resisting or embracing erosion. Borrowed personalities remain abstract coats, so the cost of losing her own name is told, not embodied. Closure attains Renounced Stasis—she walks away unnamed—but the price feels conceptual, not viscerally earned on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each pamphlet and halo-use adds density until the final glyph collapses meaning. Orientation is swift—workshop, star-death deadline, and nameless operator arrive by line 3. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the last star sighs, the fragment dims, she walks into dark; the cosmos-scale cost is felt. One causal gap: how pamphlets “find” recipients is unestablished, but the pattern teaches it as part of the mythic logic, so the waiver applies.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Topaz panels refract starlight into moving glyphs that mirror her emotional equations, constraining her belief that grief can be graphed; the workshop itself becomes a tool. The halo’s pulsing light and ozone-scented violet ink provide tactile immediacy. Spatial choreography stays clean—press, bench, fragment, door—across a single continuous scene. Weather is the vanishing stars, a live clock that forces her final typeset beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake: solve for the mathematics of emotion before the last star vanishes. Pressure tightens when each halo-use siphons its light, foreclosing further experiment; the final pamphlet costs her the fragment’s glow. No reversal, but a deepening—her earlier erosion-by-empathy becomes irreversible renunciation. Cost is conceptual, not visceral, keeping the score below 8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through accreted pamphlet titles and the halo’s collapsing empathy-space: measurement of feeling annihilates the measurer. Subtext resides in the un-signed glyph that means both beginning and ending—ambiguity as the only honest answer. No moral is stated; the final image of her walking into dark reweights all prior equations as unsolved. The concept stays complex, resisting tidy profundity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lush, rhythmic free indirect style mirrors the operator’s synesthetic calculus: “integral of a sob,” “asymptote of longing.” Diction stays within her arcane lexicon; no filter verbs dull immediacy. Compression (“she never met him. She never needed to”) teaches the reader to accept elision. Voice remains singular and consistent under starlight pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm accelerates during press runs, then exhales in short declaratives at closure. Figurative language is dense yet coherent—no mixed metaphors. One scaffold loop: “borrowed personalities like coats left at a threshold” appears twice with minimal variation. Otherwise high density without clutter; final glyph line lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Collapsing empathy-space into a letterpress workshop is a fresh synthesis; the halo fragment as dimensional shard rather than divine relic avoids trope. Risky second-person address (“you read it beneath a blood moon”) is brief and pattern-taught, heightening mythic reach without gimmickry. Conceptual payoff—the operator vanishes into her own unsolved equation—feels inevitable yet non-obvious.</comment>
