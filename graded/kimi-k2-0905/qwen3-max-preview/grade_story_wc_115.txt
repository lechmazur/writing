<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Interiority is visceral—grief manifests as drowsy alertness and the need to calibrate truth. The contradiction between skeptical intellect and grief-driven compulsion drives every beat; the final twist of the valve is a micro-choice that costs her the comfort of denial. Flaw is active: her refusal to “believe” forces her to lug the radio and wheel into the tunnel, literally externalizing guilt. The ending renunciation—carrying the weight instead of exorcising it—pays off the prior causality with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the ghost shift re-defined as mental machinery rewinding guilt. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of callers’ testimony → radio playback → valve turn reweights the stake from “is it real?” to “it’s mine to carry.” Causality is clean: her drunken call → buried radio → discovery in tunnel. Cost is felt when “dust falling from the tunnel ceiling like silent applause” marks the moment she accepts ownership; no causal breaks, no teleporting props.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Beaded valve wheel functions as micro-setting that constrains the climax—its brass coldness anchors the tactile epiphany. Tunnel’s mildew breath and gravel echoes are filtered through skeptic’s POV, noticing texture not spectacle. Spatial track is flawless: alcove distance, ceiling collapse, corroded radio half-buried beside wheel. Final image of dust falling re-uses tunnel ceiling as silent witness, charging the ending under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“can I trade ghost logic for my own guilt?”—tightens when she discovers her own recorded call inside the tunnel. One meaningful deepening: the valve’s backward spin is re-priced from supernatural to self-haunting. Agency is renunciation; twisting the wheel without cosmic payoff forecloses magical absolution. Cost is conceptual but felt: she exits “steadier” because the option to blame ghosts is gone.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from pattern: callers’ testimonials → her own voice on radio → dust applause = guilt externalized until reclaimed. No explicit moral; the final line “hers had just begun” is Charged Poise that reweights ghost shift from paranormal to psychological labor. Subtext lives in gesture: touching cold brass instead of prayer. Avoids tidy profundity; ambiguity lingers—she still doesn’t believe, yet must live as if she does.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is razor-sharp: “drowsy alertness that clung like static after sleep” is idiosyncratic and sustained. Syntax tightens under stress—fragments when she hears her own voice: “It was hers.” No filter-verb bloat; perceptions are immediate. Compression like “calibration, not belief” teaches the lens early and pays off. Voice modulates from sardonic skepticism to exhausted acceptance without dropping texture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero scaffold loops; each sentence advances image or pressure. “Dust falling… like silent applause” is precise, non-generic metaphor that recharges motif. Sentence rhythm mirrors descent—longer clauses approaching valve, clipped fragments at recognition. No mixed metaphors, no register drift; technical details (3:17 timestamp, transistor corrosion) are accurate and POV-filtered.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Ghost-shift-as-mental-rewind freshes the tired haunted-mill trope; synthesis of talk-radio transcript inside real tunnel is unexpected yet inevitable. Risk: letting climax hinge on a found radio could feel contrived, but prior seed of her drunk call earns it. Specificity—beaded valve numerals worn smooth—grounds the concept in tactile reality, preventing gimmickry.</comment>
