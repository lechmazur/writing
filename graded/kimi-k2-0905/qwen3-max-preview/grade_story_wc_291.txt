<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elira’s face-blindness and tactile memory shape every beat; her refusal to judge the keeper and demand to “remember them properly” crystallizes her arc with felt cost. Contradictory impulses—methodical data vs. raw empathy—coexist in-scene, not in summary. The final faceless sketch of the keeper is earned by every prior texture she traced. No safety-hedging; moral ambiguity stays live.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the quarry breathes with suspended masks and shared grief, reweighting the premise that remembrance is the only justice possible. Causal linkage holds: ribbon → sketches → keeper’s tremor → joint unearthing. Cost is legible in the final image of two faceless figures guarding glass cases. Lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern taught early and deepened to last flicker.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The ribbon’s silver thread, limestone grit, and salt-stiff collar are tactile anchors that constrain Elira’s detection and the keeper’s exposure. Quarry mist narrows perception to sound of breath and tremor, guiding the final approach. Micro-setting—ribbon on stone, candle-flash on glass—charges the closing image. Spatial choreography never drifts; bodies track cleanly in darkness.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—awaken empathy before erasure completes—tightens when the ribbon surfaces and again when Elira offers joint remembrance. Escalation is textural: each new mask/sketch increases density of absence until the keeper’s tears make the cost visceral. No reversal, but deepening that forecloses legal justice and stakes everything on shared mourning. Protagonist agency drives every turn.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the inverse of sight: only by surrendering the face can the women be truly seen. Subtext lives in tremor, salt-stiff cloth, and sealed glass—beauty preserved as wound. Final image of a faceless keeper and a faceless portrait offers non-literal answer: memory is the sole justice, and it hurts. No moralizing; resonance is purely imagistic.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is tactile, synesthetic, forensic: “silver threads catching flame like veins of ore.” Compression taught early (“contours meant everything”) stays consistent; no filter-verb bloat. Dialogue minimal, hushed, indirection-rich: “You kept their masks.” Voice never explains what the images already show. Rhythm mirrors breath—short clauses under quarry pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence advances image or pressure. Figurative language is sparse, precise, and pattern-linked (mist as guilt, ribbon as vein). Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image that recharges prior motifs. No register drift; diction stays within Elira’s sensory lexicon. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with scene tension.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Face-blind detective who draws by texture is fresh; inversion of usual eyewitness trope. Quarry-as-mausoleum and masks-as-relics synthesize beauty/horror without gimmickry. Risk taken: no courtroom payoff, only empathic stalemate—yet it feels inevitable. Specificity of crescent-moon thorn ribbon prevents generic swap.</comment>
