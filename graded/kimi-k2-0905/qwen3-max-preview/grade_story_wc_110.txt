<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elira’s interior contradiction—reliance on silence while yearning to speak—remains embodied. Micro-choices taper to stillness; the cracked lens tucked away enacts earned stasis with visible cost. Secondary keepers function as choral pressure, not individual crucibles, so relationship beats stay light. Motivation stays anchored, but final smile drifts toward tidy resolution.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the silver circle reframes communal stance with felt cost (lens cracks, doodles fade). Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density of silence, rain rhythm, and image layers tighten once. Causality is lyric, not sequential, and pattern is taught early; no orientation debt. Cost is legible at the final image, satisfying 9+ quick test borderline.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Crystal forecourt and projector lens jointly charge the final image: rain basins catch light, lens fractures under accumulated trust. Spatial choreography stays clean across collective kneeling, humming, touch. Sensory detail is selective—refracted streetlight, wet glyphs—filtered through registrar’s archivist eye. Setting constrains the only possible ritual, earning micro-setting credit.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—transparency vs. silence—signals early. One meaningful tightening: lens-beam moment forecloses retreat into wordless mistrust, visible in cracked glass price. Escalation is textural density, not causal turns; sufficient under Accumulative lens. Collective agency spreads stakes thin; individual cost is present but diffused.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges from silence-made-visible ritual; no explicit moral stated. Subtext operates through doodle curves, hummed harmonics, and cracked lens—images reweighted at end. Ambiguity stays purposeful, inviting reader to feel rather than decode. Final smile nudges toward sentimentality, slightly softening resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lyric third-person sustains distance registrar’s profession implies. Syntax catalogs textures—“quartz veins,” “liquid stars”—mirroring archival gaze. No dialogue, so voice contamination avoided. Rhythm modulates: dripping metronome, then braided humming—pattern taught and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Figurative runs frequent but serve image-accumulation design; mixed metaphors minor (“liquid stars” beside “flint eyes”) yet physically coherent. No paraphrase loops; minor scaffold in “silence that had settled since words became unnecessary.” Sentence rhythm varies, paragraph cuts tight. Lens crack at closure is taut; earlier density slightly dilutes mid-section.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Familiar post-apocalyptic archive trope refreshed through synesthetic ritual: light-thrown doodles as honesty conduit. Specificity of registrar-lens pairing and choral hum lifts premise above stock. Risk in wordless resolution succeeds via taught pattern. Could edge higher if silence-as-language device felt less abstractly universal.</comment>
