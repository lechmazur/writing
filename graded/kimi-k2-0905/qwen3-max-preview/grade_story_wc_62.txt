<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elias’s interior contradiction—grief as geometry yet motion as migration—grounds his fierce meditative stance; the embodied image of “thundering calm” at the chisel shows contradictory impulses acting in-scene. Ribbon-tying micro-choices (one per poem/name) visibly reorder his workspace, enacting a hierarchy of memory over commerce. Closure earns renunciation: he picks up the chisel not to finish but to begin again, foreclosing solitude with felt cost. The flaw: mentor’s guidance never tests a wrong move; perfection flattens flaw-driven tension.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: ribbon-tying cadence and butterfly wing-beats tighten density until the final image reweights grief as shared migration. Closure lands—Silas’s palm over heart crystallizes Charged Poise, cost legible in the shift from isolation to communal carving. Orientation anchored by word 60; no ambiguity. Minor causality gap: ribbon’s transition from keepsake to loom occurs in reflective summary rather than pressured beat, blurring the pivot that enables later ritual.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Greenhouse glass, moss-slick flagstones, and iron rafters are tactilely navigated as Elias knots ribbons overhead—environment constrains posture and tool angles. Butterfly panes become parchment metaphor, recharging the epitaph’s texture at closure. Spatial choreography holds: distance from lemon tree to stone block remains consistent across beats. Dusk violet light evolves with migration timing, mirroring internal dusk-to-night emotional arc.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</question><comment>Dominant stake—map collective grief—signals early; pressure deepens via each ribbon knot incrementally populating the rafters, turning solitary carving into communal loom. No visible price (time, money, tool loss) is dramatized; only symbolic cost. Butterfly migration coincidence complicates but does not resolve, satisfying lens. Escalation is textural, not tactical; options never narrow, only accrue density.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from iterated images: stone breathes, ribbon looms, butterflies migrate—grief reframed as living geometry rather than void. No moral stated; final smile answers the question “how to grieve” with communal continuation. Subtext operates in silence between Elias and Silas, implication replacing exposition. Grandmother’s forgotten name threads ironic counter-current: even erased memory can be re-inscribed through ritual.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lyric third-person distills perception through stone-carver idiom: “letters not as marks but as vessels” is a worldview, not exposition. Rhythm modulates—long breath-like clauses during reflection, hammer-short beats at chisel strikes. No dialogue, hence no voice convergence. Register stays artisanal, never drifts into academic; “bruised hues of twilight” remains within poetic craftsman's lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</question><comment>Figurative language is patterned early (migration = grief) and paid off at closure, avoiding density penalty. Sentence rhythm alternates 3:1 cadence, preventing template monotony. One mixed metaphor—“vessels for love, rage, regret” alongside “geometry of absence”—is justified by thematic fusion of emotion and measure. No filter-verb stacks; information dual-loaded in image and motion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Premise fuses stone-carving with butterfly migration to literalize grief as transit—fresh synthesis rather than trope repaint. Ribbon-loom twist transforms sentimental keepsake into architectural memory-web, irreversible to story logic. Risk of spectral mentor is offset by silent guidance, avoiding expository cheat. Final image of thunder as bass note beneath calm re-orients weather cliché into artisan soundscape.</comment>
