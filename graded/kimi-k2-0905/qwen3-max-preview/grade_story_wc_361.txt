<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>The courier’s interiority is rich and embodied (“trembling not from cold but from the weight of his absence”), but the decisive renunciation—releasing the pendant—arrives without a visible micro-choice that forecloses an alternative path; the cost is lyric, not legible on the page, so the arc feels half-earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the pendant’s release reconfigures meaning and the lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds, but the cost is atmospheric rather than concrete; the beat is beautiful yet slightly weightless because no prior tactic is visibly constrained by the pendant’s loss.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Aurora-lit ridgeway, moth-wing canopy, and frost-crunch act as micro-settings that filter through POV bias and charge the final blue-after-aurora image; the dragonfly-wing pendant itself becomes mobile setting, constraining her route and then exiting to reweight the sky.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“germinate wonder in routine”—is signaled early; pressure deepens through the child’s breath-catching beat, but the tightening is poetic rather than tactical, so the cost feels diffuse under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: wonder as pollen-thick residue of generous attention; the final image of empty hands dissolving into wind reconfigures the mentor’s axiom without moralizing, achieving Conceptual Repricing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Voice owns a sustained lyric cadence, perceptual signature (“sky bled violet and emerald”), and rhythmic modulation under pressure; compressed diction stays coherent, no head-hop, no filter-verb stacks—fully controlled.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense, propulsive, metaphorically audacious yet internally coherent; only a faint synonym echo (“wonder spilled through / wonder lingered”) prevents a 9+; no loops or mixed metaphors dull the closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The dragonfly-wing as portable wonder-generator feels fresh; risk lies in near-allegorical tone, but specificity of frost-song, moth-wing canopy, and auroral glyphs keeps the concept rooted and memorable.</comment>
