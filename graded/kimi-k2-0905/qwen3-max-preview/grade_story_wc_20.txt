<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s guilt over withholding a name from a dying rival calcifies into the load-bearing stone under her ribs; the embodied metaphor and ritualized micro-choices (pouring regret, whispering syllables) keep interiority concrete. The final shift from “Even” to “Mended” is earned because every beat ties back to her refusal of mercy and the coin’s cracks. No contradictory impulse is dramatized in real time, however—guilt is confessed rather than fought—so the arc falls just short of the 9-band gate.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens: the coin’s saturation, the rising motes, and the slow rain create a density shift that reweights the stake from balance to mercy. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Charged Poise—where the dust vial hums beside her heart; cost is the irreversible loss of the coin and the permanent recoding of her identity. One micro drag: “exploring limits” is named late; earlier cueing would have tightened pattern, but the final image still reprises it.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The foundry’s cold anvil, warped skylights, and wet-iron scent constrain every placement of crucible and footstep; the golden seam that remains on the anvil after the dust ascends is the charged micro-setting that reconfigures meaning. Spatial choreography is spotless—no floating rooms. Environment is not backdrop; it supplies the crucible surface that literally holds her fracture-gold and becomes the sacred relic left behind.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can she bear the weight of the names she refused to speak—tightens as each whispered syllable widens the coin’s cracks. One meaningful deepening: the shift from repairing the coin to letting it shatter beautifully narrows her options and makes the cost visible. Agency is continuous; every pour and murmur is an irreversible act that feeds the dust spiral. No secondary reversal is needed; the single intensification is sufficient under an accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the kintsugi metaphor made literal: fracture as sacred architecture, not flaw. The final image—golden seam on cold iron—offers a non-literal answer: redemption is not erasure but gilded breakage. No thematic statement is pronounced; the dust motes carry the concept. Ambiguity lingers: she is “truer,” not healed, honoring complexity without tidy moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays tightly latched to Elara’s alchemical perception: mercury-to-sulfur ratios, moonstone steam, “cathedral of rust.” Syntax lengthens with incense-like cadence then fragments under pressure (“She did not stop.”). No head-hopping; perceptual signature is consistent. The elevated diction is voice-motivated—an alchemist would think in metallurgical scripture—so register drift is waived.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or pressure. Figurative vehicles stay physically coherent—coin “saturated” with sorrow, cracks “like rivers of liquid light.” Information density is high: one line can layer temperature, guilt, and metallurgy. Rhythm breathes with the scene—drumbeat Rain / short declarative gasp / slow luminous release—without syntactic monotony.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The kintsugi alchemy conceit is freshly literalized: fracture-dust becomes constellation of names, a reverse-astrology that rewrites fate from inside. Risk—letting the magic coin break instead of mend—pays off narratively and thematically. Synthesis feels inevitable: alchemist + broken coin + named guilt → gilded dust compass. No close genre echo; the beat is singular.</comment>
