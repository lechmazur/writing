<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lira’s interiority is sensorially concrete—fingers tremble, bow hair rasps, she kneels in moss. Contradictory impulses (grief vs. need to play) coexist in the same beats; the final smile is a costly renunciation of fixing. No therapy-speak; “beauty in the unfinished” is enacted, not labelled. Micro-choice hierarchy (bow → water → petal) is legible and character-specific.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the sustained note reweights meaning with undeniable cost—child adds scorched petal, silence becomes sacred. Causal chain: bow stroke → water ripple → greenhouse exhales → child emerges, each step because/therefore. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) are vivid by line 3. Lens—Accumulative/Textural—holds: density of image and cadence shift, not external plot turns, drives the reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Greenhouse glass, rusted hulls, and chipped bowl constrain every beat: Lira kneels where floor dips, water bowl catches vibrations, child descends rafters. Teak violin body and salt-fogged panes return as tactile tools. Final image—petal floating in bowl—recharges all prior setting objects. Micro-setting (bow on string = site of action) meets 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“unbind beauty from the unfinished”—tightens when each played phrase visibly revives orchid, creaks hatch, draws child; options narrow from solitude to shared hush. No external antagonist; pressure is accretive vibration vs. chronic silence. One meaningful escalation: the greenhouse answers back. Cost is felt—the held note costs Lira her last breath of sound, child pays with scorched petal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly through unfinished chords, floating petal, and held silence; no moral stated. “Beauty lives in the breath before the word” is dramatized, not asserted. Subtext in child’s awed tears and swaying vines. Final image reweights premise: unfinished is not broken but breathing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person lyric close-focus; perceptual signature is Lira’s acoustic bias—she “hears” ripples and shipwreck ribs groan in key. Rhythm modulates: long cadence for description, breath-length fragments at peak bow stroke. No head-hopping; child’s awe shown externally. Diction stays within a weathered musician’s lexicon; no register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence. Figurative language is sparse, each metaphor carries dual duty (“ash over every leafless ridge” = sight + grief). Zero paraphrase loops or synonym churn. Information dense: one line can set scene, reveal tool, and tilt emotion. Final line trades on earlier “unfinished” motif, no clutter.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Post-burn rainforest as silent auditorium, shipwreck-ringed greenhouse as chapel, violin carved from drowned teak—specific synthesis not seen before. Risk of quiet lyric accumulative structure pays off. Bonfire-story tradition retooled into wordless music keeps concept fresh. Without these exact objects the resonance collapses.</comment>
