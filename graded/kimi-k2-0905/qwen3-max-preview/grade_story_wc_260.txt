<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is rich and embodied—her fingers tracing the severed tail, dawn-gold pigment matching the fracture—yet the epiphany that “conviction, too, needed shedding” drifts toward label-speak, softening the decisive moment. Micro-choices (lighting the brazier, mixing lichen pigment) visibly enact her hierarchy of values, but the turn from complicity to reconstruction is one micro-step too tidy for full 8-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: she forecloses the old sanctuary path, accepts slower regrowth, and the tail-tip compass crystallizes cost. Causal chain holds—ledger reveal → betrayal → tail ritual → new sanctuary plan—tightened once through pigment-mixing beat that reweights her mission. Lens is cleanly Accumulative/Textural; image cadence, not plot twist, reconfigures meaning.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Micro-setting triumph: the glass case, brazier embers, and lichen pigment constrain her next-moves and charge the final compass image. Mist and stars function as environmental mirror without slipping into atmospheric cliché; spatial choreography remains precise as she moves from moss-stained floor to cot. Weather is felt (cold clarity) but never overwhelms the indoor crucible.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—save remaining animals without re-infecting herself—tightens when reconstruction beat converts guilt into tactical plan. Price is visible: resignation letter, anonymity risk, savings drained. Coincidence absent; escalation is interior density increase rather than external twist, sufficient under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organistically: chameleon autotomy → institutional self-amputation → personal regrowth. No final-paragraph moral; instead, the glowing tail-tip silently answers the central question. Ambiguity remains—new sanctuary could still fail—but the image reweights “fragile convictions” without sermon.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is consistent: wildlife-handler diction (“enclosure schedules, medication charts”) filters every notice. Rhythm swells and contracts with emotional temperature—compressed during tail alignment, expansive during starlit reflection—no head-hopping or register drift. Free-indirect slips are clean and purposeful.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Read-aloud cadence varies; sentence lengths breathe with ritual pacing. High density per line—“twilight violet at the base, fading to dawn-gold”—each adjective earns its place. One paraphrase loop (“shedding…shedding”) is minor; no mixed metaphors or scaffold clutter. Final image is pristine, artifact-free.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Wildlife-laundering sanctuary as betrayal frame feels fresh; tail-reconstruction ritual reframes taxidermy into ethics. Conceptual risk—quiet lyric ending rather than raid scene—pays off. Specificity of pigment source (lichen, crushed quartz) prevents trope drift; transformation is internal yet materially grounded.</comment>
