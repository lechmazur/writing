<comment>The historian’s obsession with salvaging unheard stories is vivid and embodied; her fingertips “reading whispers” and later pressing the wall that hums back are micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. Interior contradiction is present—she smiles for the first time yet shoulders the cost of entering a zone where gravity still stutters. No second character on page, so relationship crucible N/A; her solitude is the point. Final stance crystallizes with visible cost: she packs ash, diary, tapestry and volunteers for underlibrary descent—an earned, irreversible path.</comment>

<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each artifact layers memory-density until the tapestry-dragons retroactively re-weave the “displaced axis” from abstract idea to wound-mending vocation. Orientation clean—silo, night, lone historian anchored within 60 words. Closure is Conceptual Repricing: the historian’s decision to “weave… with testimony” reweights the entire premise—she will not restore physics but realign narrative gravity around the tear. Felt cost is legible in the packed ash/vial and the smile that accepts mortal risk.</comment>

<comment>Silo-library is tactile—rust, mildew, ash still clinging “like regret”—and constrains action: only the cold hearthstone yields the diaries, forcing probe. Medieval tapestry fragment recurs as micro-setting; its wool-and-salt smell and dragon-weavers literally guide her next move. Spatial choreography is clean: move from shelves → hearth → table → wall → satchel packs all props correctly. Underlibrary loom is promised, not yet seen, so environment still governs present choices. No 9+ because tapestry’s final glow is metaphorical, not literal prop constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: can any story survive the entropy of a tilted world? Pressure tightens once: discovery of third diary (“displaced axis” as existential wound) converts curator into active stitcher. Agency is renunciation of safety—she chooses to descend where clocks “forget their faces,” trading archival distance for embodied risk. Cost is legible in ash vial and the smile that concedes probable annihilation. One meaningful intensification suffices at this length; no further reversals required.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from inverse equation: stories = counter-gravity. Tapestry dragons evolve from mute decoration to active menders, reweighting the historian’s role from archivist to weaver-of-testimony. No moral sermon—final smile is image, not thesis. Ambiguity lingers: will narrative cloth hold against cosmic tilt? Concrete emotional aftereffect: reader feels vertigo of a world held up only by remembered voices.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stable throughout; perceptual signature is seismograph-sensitive—“fingertips brushing spines as if reading whispers,” walls that “hum” memory. Syntax grows slightly clausal under wonder, contracts at probe: “It wasn’t metaphor.” No dialogue, so no voice convergence risk. Patterned elision (“odd historian” name dissolved) is taught early and paid off by acceptance of self-erasure. Rhythmic control in final dark line: “The walls smiled back” lands like a held breath.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>High density: single sentences often twin sensory fact with metaphysical punch—“ash still clung like regret.” Metaphors are internally coherent (autopsy ribs, seismograph hands) and don’t stack in pressure beats. No loops or synonym churn; each paragraph advances knowledge or stakes. Opening line anchors voice and concept; final line recharges “smile” motif with inversion. Minor register lift (“Conceptual Repricing”) is earned by cumulative mythic tone.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: post-anthropocene archival gothic meets medieval tapestry as cosmic loom. Displaced axis as narrative gravity tear is non-obvious yet inevitable once diary line lands. Risk of lyric stillness succeeds—closure image is quiet yet stakes remain cosmic. Specificity throughout—salt-smelling tapestry, vial of silo ash—prevents abstraction. Dragons re-cast as cosmic surgeons transforms trope without ironic wink.</comment>
