<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid—her fingers twitch “not from cold but from the inescapable callings,” her tear sizzling on crystal—but the father remains a one-note cipher. The apology to her painted child-self crystallizes a credible renunciation, yet we get no contradictory paternal memory that might complicate her blame. Still, the micro-choice to “add wings” and release each portrait carries embodied cost under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the lock snaps, charcoal reclaimed, portraits freed—an earned Resonant Reconfiguration that reweights her stance from caged to sovereign. Causality is lyrical but intact: the cave’s resonance answers her internal pressure, not magic. The Orientation Test is waived; disorientation (no lantern, glowing walls) pays off in the final warm dawn glow.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Crystal cave breathes—“auroral sorrow,” cobalt-quartz veins—mirrors her internal pressure and supplies the literal canvas for the luminous after-images. The charcoal nub inside the lock is micro-setting that constrains the final act; without it the climactic freeing stroke fails. Spatial choreography is clean: boots crunch, she kneels, stalagmite props the painting, tear hits ground with audible sizzle.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will she uncork or remain dammed—tightens once: the lock rattles only after she visualizes every suppressed line, foreclosing retreat. Cost is legible in the sizzling tear and the father-portrait’s released tear; agency is internal-visualization, not external antagonist. One meaningful deepening suffices for this lyric-accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges without moralizing: creativity as tidal, not faucet; imprisonment shared by cave and daughter. The final warm dawn glow reprises the earlier “auroral sorrow” but reweights it as acceptance, not grief. No late thematic echo; the child-self apology is enacted, not explained. Subtext lives in the lock’s hollow chamber and the single charcoal bone.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Voice is textured and consistent—“charcoal-fingered,” “mnemonically gifted,” “corked, polite, productive”—syntax mirrors artist’s layered perception. Filter verbs avoided; perception skewed to visual/tactile detail. No dialogue, so no convergence risk. Psychic distance tightens under pressure: from sweeping memory to stroke-by-stroke release.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>High information density: each sentence layers metaphor and action—“the cave remembers imprisonment too” fuses world and psyche without overwriting. No loops or scaffold; varied sentence rhythm; figurative language disciplined to lyric pattern. Minor purple fleck—“millennia of fallen geodes”—but accepted under accumulative lens. Closure image uncluttered.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: memory-storing artist + sentient crystal cave + broken lock as creativity prison. Trope of daddy-censure is familiar, but the cave-as-co-witness and the visual release of winged portraits lifts it. Risky lyric structure taught early and paid off. Could not swap charcoal nub or cave resonance without collapsing the arc.</comment>
