<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elira’s interiority is vivid—her fingers “tracing the oily floor as if reading braille” shows embodied perception, and her quiet renunciation at the end carries visible cost. The single contradiction (she exists only because her mother violated causality) is held in concrete tension throughout, not merely labeled. No second character on page, so relationship crucible is N/A; micro-choice hierarchy is clear when she “redirected her breath, her heartbeat, her very intention” to sidestep rather than push. Motive remains character-particular: discovery, not escape, and the final weeping is earned because the shard’s fulfilled pulse dramatizes the price of that knowledge.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the green shard cools, the bay re-crumples, and Elira’s responsibility is felt without exposition. Causality is coherent under a lyrical-accumulative lens; each sensory beat thickens the texture until the crystalline core’s weight re-prices her existence. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) appear within 120 words and recur through sensory cues, satisfying the single-scene window. Only hairline slip: “cyclically spontaneous flickers” is named twice but never given micro-cause; yet this does not touch the final image, so no deduction reaches closure.</comment>

<comment>The abandoned repair bay is not backdrop but instrument: rusted console, broken gantries, and residual warmth after transition constrain how Elira moves and where the shard can spin. Sensory hierarchy is POV-filtered—she reads scent, vibration, electric hum—never tourist catalog. Micro-setting qualification met: the shard itself functions as portable environment that charges the final image when it cools. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible positions across the viscous transition.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—uncover the withheld truth about her mother’s sacrifice—is signaled in paragraph three and tightens when the crystalline core floods her with foreign guilt. One meaningful deepening suffices: the moment she learns her own existence is the divergent splinter, every prior choice is re-priced. Agency remains hers; she chooses to step back through the veil, accepting responsibility. Cost is visible: the shard flares then dims, and the bay re-collapses into silence—options foreclosed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the concrete particular of a daughter discovering she is the living debt her mother paid; no authorial statement required. Subtext operates in the shard’s glowing pulse and the bay’s alternating ruin/restoration—images reweight meaning at closure. Final image reconfigures the premise: “some truths don’t set you free—they make you responsible.” No moralizing sentence; the weep is the non-literal answer. Emotional aftereffect lingers as unbearable lightness rather than sentimentality.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person deep stays tightly locked to Elira’s sensory filter; no head-hop. Diction is textured—“viscous syrup made of memory,” “film peeling from reality’s surface”—yet remains within her perceptual lexicon. Rhythm accelerates under transition pressure, then settles into the final quiet cadence. No dialogue, so voice distinction bullet is N/A; internal voice is coherent and singular.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or stakes. Figurative language is sparse and patterned—“ghosts of engines,” “cathedral of silence”—never dense enough to obscure causality. High information density: one sentence can layer sensory cue, world rule, and emotional charge. No mixed metaphors; final line lands clean with the concrete noun “bones” anchoring the conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Portal-hopping to parallel ruins is familiar, yet the fresh angle is a cartographer who navigates by scent and guilt rather than coordinates. The green shard’s transformation from compass to moral burden is a specific, non-obvious reweighting. Risk is taken by making the protagonist the cosmic error; the story commits fully without softening the implication. Synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight: mother’s sacrifice → daughter’s existence → daughter’s responsibility.</comment>
