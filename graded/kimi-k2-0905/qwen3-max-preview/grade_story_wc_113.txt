<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>A single, keenly observed consciousness drives every beat; her tactile attention to silence, program, and ghost-conductor embodies contradictory impulses (curiosity vs. dread) that culminate in the wordless duet. The renunciation of sound for skin-listening and the final dry-program tuck carry visible cost, earning her shift from observer to medium.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory layer (water, rust, lantern-light, stain-glyphs) intensifies the dominant stake—“decode the drowned score”—until the final image reweights silence itself as music. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the dry program and warm water crystallize her new role without exposition; cost is felt in her trembling lungs and the house’s final exhale.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Flooded pit, floating podium, and lantern angle function as micro-setting that literally constrains every gesture; the 37-degree tilt is the technological key that unlocks the glyph-score, charging the final image. Sensory economy is strict—ankle warmth, rust weep, glitter arpeggios—each chosen to mirror internal crescendo.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Pressure tightens through accretion: each newly revealed stain forecloses randomness and forces her closer to the single option—silent conducting. The moment she angles the lantern, agency crystallizes; water vibrates, and the ghost’s gaze makes the cost of refusal palpable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: art’s resurrection through decay, silence as medium, memory as score. The opera house’s exhalation and the warmed floodwater reprice silence itself—no moral, only a reconfiguration of what music can be.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyric compression is pattern-taught from line one—“kneeling in ankle-deep water”—and paid off in the final hush. Voice remains anchored to her musician’s ear: tremolo, fermata, arpeggio used as verbs; no POV slippage or corporate register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm mirrors musical phrasing—crescendo of clauses, then caesura of fragments. No loops or scaffold; each metaphor (chairs like lily pads, chandeliers drowned) stays within physical logic. One hairline slip—“black mouth swallowing moonlight”—edges toward purple but is earned by gothic frame.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Flood-rewritten sheet music is a fresh conceptual turn; the silent performance with a ghost conductor repurposes the ruined opera house as instrument. Risk (wordless climax) heightens rather than obscures stakes, making the finale inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
