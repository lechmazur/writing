<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority is rich and embodied—her “trembling fingers,” the way dust ‘whispers’ to her—showing a believable contradiction between archival detachment and aching need to belong. The micro-choice to switch off overhead lights and angle the lamp is decisive, stakes her professional routine on a personal quest, and forecloses pure objectivity with visible cost (her supervisor’s glance, the new logbook). The reflective blocks stay anchored to present stimuli (button, dust ghosts) and tilt her stance; no diagnostic label-speak. Only the “quiet companion” heartache leans abstract; a hair more specificity in how that ache sharpens focus would clinch 9+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens dominates: finding the button → cross-referencing → logging kindnesses, each because/therefore linkage tightening her mission. Orientation is crystal-clear by line 3 (who, where, when). Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the button under glass becomes a compass, reconfiguring the file room from crypt of endings to sanctuary of beginnings, with felt conceptual cost—she will keep excavating tenderness while loss lingers. No causal breaks; every artifact (dust handprint, crayon drawing) is discovered through her agency and paid off in the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The file room is rendered through tactile micro-setting—spines, fluorescent hum, slanted light—each detail filtering her archivist gaze and guiding choice (where she angles the lamp). The button functions as a recurring object that constrains her next move and finally charges the compass image. Spatial choreography is flawless: desk, shelf, lamp, shadows track cleanly. Only a single weather cliché (“afternoon light”) and one unattached brand mention (“magnifying lamp”) keep it shy of 9.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prove that love survives institutional erasure—arrives with the button and escalates through each dust revelation,foreclosing her prior detachment. Agency is continuous: she photographs, cross-references, opens “Magnifications,” accepts the supervisor’s box—each act narrows options and raises reputational/emotional cost. The final tightening is her public smile to volunteers, a stance crystallization that accepts perpetual excavation of pain as price of witness. Cost is legible on-page: “she didn’t heal by forgetting… she healed by magnifying small kindnesses” with the ache still present.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the accumulating particulars—dust, button, handprints—not from thesis statements; final image of “light doing the explaining” is a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights prior material without moralizing. Subtext thrives in gesture (switching lights off) and silence (supervisor’s coffee offering). The tension between archival rigor and tender retrieval is never resolved into platitudes, leaving plausible ambiguity about how much kindness can offset systemic loss. No thematic echo or final-paragraph sermon.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person intimate sustains a consistent perceptual signature—dust motes as “whispers,” files as “ellipses”—syntax grows clipped under discovery pressure (“She set the button gently… stepped back”). No head-hopping; supervisor’s dialogue is filtered through her ears, carrying subtext of institutional permission. Lexicon stays within archivist diction: “intake form,” “regiment insignia,” “logbook.” Rhythm modulates from languid opening cadence to staccato cataloguing beats, mirroring her intensifying focus.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “dust settled in whispers, in gradients, in patterns shaped by breath, movement, neglect, or reverence” performs three jobs—sensory, thematic, character lens—in one breath. No paraphrase loops, no mixed metaphors; figurative language is spare and precise. Opening and closing lines are ear-perfect, the final “lets the light do the explaining” landing with imagistic snap. A half-point deduction for two adverb clusters (“tactfully hopeful curiosity”) that could compress further.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Foster-care-archive-as-sanctuary is a fresh angle; dust forensics as love archaeology feels non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. The button’s transformation from illegal artifact to moral compass synthesizes military and nurturing histories without sentimentality. Specificity—1947 intake form, regiment insignia—anchors novelty in verifiable detail. Risky structural choice to hinge plot on dust patterns pays off when closure reconfigures the room’s meaning.</comment>
