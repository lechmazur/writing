<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (arsonist vs savior) are present but rendered in summary rather than dramatized in-scene; the final palm-press is credible renunciation yet the cost is more mystical than personally earned. Interiority is lyrically specific (“volcanic tenderness”) and motive stays consistent, but the archive’s responding tremors externalize pressure instead of forcing a visible internal trade-off.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the singing archive reweights her identity from fugitive to curator with undeniable conceptual cost. Causal chain is lyric-accumulative: each art-leap (charcoal, clay, hair-woven linen) tightens the spiral toward the intact portrait. One soft teleport: the slab “dissolves into light” without prior rule cue, but the glow is accepted under mythic lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>“Petrified ink and salt” and “thumbprints in clay” are tactile micro-settings that constrain her process; the spiral motif carved into fallen columns directly guides her next move. Volcanic tuff and obsidian seal supply persistent geological pressure that charges the final aperture of light. Orientation is swift: coastal ruin, seventh day, beneath dome—all within 120 words.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“rescue a forgotten promise”—is signaled in line 2 and tightens through each incomplete artwork that forecloses anonymity; the final intact portrait forces her public self-recognition at cost of lifelong exile above-ground. Escalation is textural: each new artifact increases density until the archive literally sings; price is felt when she accepts lifelong criminal status for memory’s sake.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: memory demands destruction-as-creation; fire as archive, ash as ink. Subtext whispers in negative space—every missing half-portrait implies civilization self-censoring to survive. Final lullaby of ash reconfigures arson from vandalism to curation, offering ambiguous mercy that avoids moralizing. The face in the tapestry literalizes ancestral recursion, making the personal political without exposition.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is incantatory, syntactically parallel to mirror tapestry spirals; compression (“She vanished…She moved…She wept”) taught early and paid off in final “She smiled.” Diction stays within POV lexicon—volcanic tenderness, petrified ink—never academic. No dialogue, so no convergence risk; internal idiom remains heretical-archivist throughout. Rhythm accelerates into light-dissolution, matching pressure peak.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density: single sentences braid action & image—“She carved the spiral into fallen columns” advances both plot and setting. No filter-verb stacks; metaphors stay volcanic-consistent. One loop risk: repeated “she painted…she carved…she wove” cadence, but pattern is taught early and serves ritual momentum. Closure line “She smiled” is spare, crystallizing earned stasis without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: librarian-arsonist as archival messiah, fire repurposed from destruction to mnemonic purification. Mythic archaeology meets contemporary off-grid vanishing; trope inversion feels inevitable in hindsight. Risky second-person ancestral address (“We promised you would remember”) lands because the tapestry prefigures it. Specificity—crushed lapis, volcanic glass pigments—anchors cosmic stakes in material craft.</comment>
