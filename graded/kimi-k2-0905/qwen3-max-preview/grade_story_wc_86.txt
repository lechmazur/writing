<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interiority is textured—her fingers tracing the drawer pull anchors memory without summary labels—and the final swap of relics crystallizes a hierarchy of values. However, the brother’s off-stage death and the courtroom backstory remain abstract; the emotional cost is felt but not embodied in a present-tense physical reaction, so the renunciation reads slightly under-cooked.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the relic swap is a Conceptual Repricing that makes the shared silence cost legible. Causal chain is thin—no concrete obstacle is overcome on stage—but under the Accumulative lens the tightening of atmospheric density and the mirrored grief suffice; the drawer-pull cue anchors every reflection block, so orientation stays intact.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The parapet’s hostile exposure directly shapes the tactic of silence-as-currency; wind and salt are returned in the final image, charging the “shared path.” Sensory selection stays urgent—cold iron, gravel crunch—without tourist checklist. Micro-setting (the two relics) also constrains choice, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</question><comment>Dominant stake—swapping ghosts, not prisoners—is signaled early and deepens through the relic exchange; the parapet’s exposure escalates vulnerability. Cost is felt but not viscera-level; a sharper tactical forfeiture (e.g., she burns the list) would have pushed higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the hush itself—silence must be earned, not demanded—and the final image of synchronized boot-rhythms reweights all prior mist/wind imagery. No moralizing; the wisdom stays implicit in the relic transfer, achieving resonant reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is distinct—metaphorical moon-phase timing, “furrowed hush”—and syntax tightens under emotional peak. Dialogue is sparse but carries subtext (“Did you bring the names you buried?”); no head-hopping, no register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Rhythm breathes with scene needs—long sentence for mist crawl, fragment-like exchanges for staccato tension. No loops, no mixed metaphors; information density high (“drawer pull…raw material”). One minor scaffold: “the point” after exposure statement could be cut, but it does not touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The prisoner-exchange-as-ghost-swap reframes a political trope into intimate reckoning; the relic swap feels inevitable yet fresh. Risky use of moon-phase metaphorism pays off by charging the final silence. Specificity of Ministry desk burn and cell key grounds the concept in lived history.</comment>
