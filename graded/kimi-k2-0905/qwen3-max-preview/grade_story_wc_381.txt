<comment>Interiority is lyrically concrete—bare feet, dew, heartbeat syncing with ferns—yet the summoner’s contradictory impulses (to silence vs. to hear) stay largely parallel rather than simultaneous in scene. The final renunciation (“she would return… to hear them fully”) is foreshadowed by the whispered line “sky forgets only when earth stops listening,” so the choice feels earned, but the cost is more atmospheric than visceral. A hair more bodily friction or risk would push it into the 8+ band.</comment>

<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each repetition of hush, flow, and paper-light re-weights the stake from “avert doom” to “become listener.” Closure is a Charged Poise—the crane’s spiral carries the prophecy upward while the summoner’s stance crystallizes into nightly vigil; the cost is the open-ended surrender of solitude. Orientation is swift (moonlit brook by line 3), causality is lyric but coherent; one causal hairline slip—how mapping silence physically unravels code—keeps it shy of 9.0.</comment>

<comment>Micro-setting mastery: the origami wing doubles as environment and tool, its paper fibers drinking moonlight and later lifting the entire thematic turn. Brook, moss, dew, and starlight are filtered through summoner’s sensorium, each detail pacing breath and decision. Spatial choreography is immaculate—kneel, place, lift, rise—every motion grounded in tactile earth. The wing’s final ascent charges the closing image, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“will the sky forget dawn?”—tightens when the whisper reframes the prophecy as plea, not warning, forcing summoner to trade certainty for perpetual listening. One meaningful deepening suffices: the coded dread dissolves into guardianship. Cost is conceptual (endless vigil) rather than visceral, visible in the final “quiet purpose,” keeping it just below the 8.8+ band that would require a sharper felt price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: listening as creative act, silence as medium for cosmic repair. Subtext lives in gesture—cradling the coded cry like a fledgling—never sermonized. Final image of stars re-weaving sorrow into lullaby-light offers resonant non-literal answer. A whisper more ambiguity about what “remembering dawn” entails would deepen complexity, but the current balance is elegant.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is sustained lyric hush: long vowels, liquid consonants, syntactic parallelism that mirrors water-flow. Perceptual signature is consistent—summoner notices texture, cadence, breath—never slips into editorial gloss. One clause (“terrestrially cosmic rhythm”) risks register drift but is earned by prior cosmological frame. Under peak pressure the diction compresses without fragmenting, maintaining coherent interior stream.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm is hypnotic yet varied; sentence length undulates like brook current. Figurative layering is dense—moonlight as rain, prophecy as spine—but each vehicle returns to water or paper, creating coherent texture. No loops, no scaffold, zero paraphrase churn. A single mixed metaphor (“velvet void where meaning pooled”) is minor enough to leave closure untouched.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: origami crane as both message and messenger, silence as cartographic tool, listener as guardian of dawn. Risk-taking—entire plot is internalized listening—pays off because stakes remain legible. Concept feels inevitable in hindsight yet not derivative. A half-step shy of 9+ only because the cosmology skirts familiar “sky forgets” trope without fully subverting it.</comment>
