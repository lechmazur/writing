<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is sensorially rich and idiosyncratic; the designer’s synesthetic perception drives every micro-choice. The final forging of the memory-catcher is the earned crystallization of her marrow-deep need to warn others, paying the cost of reliving her sister’s absence. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in scene—grief is monolithic rather than contested—so the arc stops just short of full complexity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the memory-catcher’s existence reweights the world’s silence into an audible warning, cost paid by the ashes of her sister’s voice. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each absence fed to the forge thickens the pattern until the final crack reconfigures meaning. Orientation is taught early (“sunken orchard greenhouse… skeletal ribs of shipwrecks”) and repaid in the resonant hull-hum at the end.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The greenhouse’s cracked glass, frostbitten petals, and phosphorescent algae are not backdrop but instruments: they vibrate in response to the forge, constraining when she can safely extract the cooling alloy. The shipwrecks’ sonic answer externalizes her internal scan for fracture, making the setting an active participant in the climax. Every sensory note is filtered through her synesthetic bias, so place never decays into postcard.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—“find the sound of trust breaking before it is too late for others”—tightens through each absence burned: every new void intensifies the alloy’s resonance, narrowing her physical and emotional options. The final crack is the single decisive deepening that forecloses her search and crystallizes the warning device; the cost is the audible consumption of her sister’s remaining echo. Pressure is accumulative rather than adversarial, perfectly aligned with the chosen lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: grief can be alchemized into communal warning, but only by sacrificing the last private echo of the lost. The memory-catcher’s curved silence answers the opening question—trust fractures at a whisper, not a scream—reconfiguring the reader’s ear toward future fragility. No moral is declared; the image of ash-hands dissolving into aurora leaves counter-readings intact.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is synesthetic, compressed, and rhythmic—“the violet of twilight as a whispering hum”—teaching the reader to hear color as the POV does. Syntax shortens under pressure (“Then — a crack. / Not loud.”) without breaking the established cadence. No head-hopping; every perception is marrow-deep and character-bound, sustaining a singular perceptual signature through the final skylight climb.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Figurative density is high yet purposeful: each metaphor extends the synesthetic rule-set rather than decorating it. Occasional stacked modifiers—“memory-dust,” “phosphorescent algae”—risk purple but are justified by the lyric accumulative mode. No loops or scaffold; every sentence advances image, sound, or stakes. One clause drifts toward abstraction (“alchemy of grief turned into guidance”) but is anchored by the tactile packing of tools that follows.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The fusion of synesthetic perception, grief-forge, and shipwreck-orchard is a singular synthesis not seen elsewhere; the concept of burning absences to alloy a warning device is inherently fresh. Risk is maximal—lyric compression, synesthetic world-rule, accumulative stakes—yet coherence never breaks. The final image of aurora dimming to gray-sound recharges every prior hue, making novelty feel inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
