<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The immortal’s ennui-to-wonder progression is credibly embodied through tactile contact with the fragment and the final kneel; however, interiority occasionally drifts into abstract summary (“immortality had sandpapered awe into ennui”) rather than moment-by-moment contradiction under pressure. No second character appears, so status/relationship bullets are waived; the micro-choice to kneel and press palm to ground is concrete, earned, and legibly costly. Reflection stays under 20 % and is anchored to present stimuli. Quick test satisfied for 9+ eligibility, but slight over-articulation of emotional state keeps it just below the top band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the spatial mutiny ruptures the escondite and delivers the immortal to a literal plain of goodbyes—an earned Resonant Reconfiguration with felt conceptual cost. Orientation is established within 120 words; the lens is Accumulative/Textural (densifying mystery and spectacle toward a final image). Causality is coherent: storm → fragment activation → spatial rebellion → gateway. No teleporting props or retroactive patches. Meets 9+ quick test, but the final image’s cost is more conceptual than viscerally personal, keeping it shy of the exceptional band.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Setting is vividly selective: the prismatic escondite and violet-gold storm are filtered through immortal perception; every sensory detail is harnessed to mood and impending rupture. The fragment itself functions as micro-setting, constraining activation to magnetic storm conditions, and its final unfolding directly enables the closure image. Spatial choreography stays coherent despite geometric inversion. Environment is not merely backdrop but shapes tactics and charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate; slight overindulgence in lyric spectacle in one sentence prevents the full 9.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“what happens after goodbye”—is signaled early and escalates through storm timing, fragment vibration, and spatial mutiny that forecloses retreat. Agency is present: the immortal deliberately aligns the fragment with the storm, then chooses to step through; cost is the collapse of his refuge and irreversible exposure to the plain of endings. Under Accumulative lens, the deepening arrives via density of goodbyes heard and the final tactile pulse under palm. Cost is legible but generalized rather than sharply personal; hence high-band entry but not apex.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: endings as a collective resonance rather than personal oblivion. No explicit moralizing; the final image of “quiet thunder of endings” reweights prior spectacle into hushed reverence. Subtext operates through absence-shaped whispers and the inversion of cosmic scale into intimate farewells. Thematic complexity—ennui vs. wonder, spectacle vs. silence—is maintained without tidy resolution, offering lingering ambiguity that feels earned rather than evasive.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is lush yet controlled, with a perceptual signature attuned to color, magnetism, and cosmic scale; diction (“prismatic escondite,” “ionized regret”) stays within an immortal lexicon. Rhythm modulates from languid ennui to charged anticipation; no template cadence. No dialogue, hence no voice contamination. Compression and elision are taught early (“galaxies collapse into sighs”) and remain legible. Distinct texture and consistent POV distance meet the 9+ quick test; one moment of slightly purple flourish keeps it just below 9.0.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Line-level craft is exemplary: high information density, no loops or scaffold, metaphors are coherent and physics-consistent. Sentence rhythms swell and contract with magnetic storm beats. One mixed-metaphor risk—“whips of ionized regret”—is acceptable within sustained lyric mode. No artifacts appear in final third; closure image is crystal. Meets 9+ quick test for technical cleanliness.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Freshest synthesis: bored immortal × cursed fragment × spatial mutiny yields an ending-plain made of goodbyes—inevitable yet unforeseen. Risk-taking (cosmic geometry mutiny) heightens meaning without obscuring clarity. No close echoes of famous scenes; concept commits fully. Minor slip from familiar “storm as catalyst” trope prevents 9.0, but transformation is strong.</comment>
