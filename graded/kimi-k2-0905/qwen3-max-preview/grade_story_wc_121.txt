<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>One-woman show, so no relationship crucible, but interior contradiction is vivid: “I let others define my gravity” spoken while she literally hovers. Each micro-choice—touching wall, climbing stairs, vocalising admissions—carries visible cost, escalating from spatial defiance to ontological merger. The final fusion with echo-selves is earned by iterative confession, not therapy-speak. Flaw: emotional calibration edges toward tidy arithmetic; a single residual echo refusing merger would have kept ambiguity alive.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the tablet blooms, selves merge, gravity language rewritten—cost is the cracked tablet and the irreversible loss of singular identity, felt on-page. Causal lattice holds: tablet fracture → corridor generation → confession → merger; every beat obeys the “because therefore” chain. Mosaic shards (viaduct, childhood room, staircase spiral) are taught by 25 % and transition via glowing veins; lens stays accumulative-textural, ending in conceptual repricing. No orientation debt; who-where-when anchors at word 30.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The viaduct’s glowing veins and frozen raindrops are not backdrop—they are the pressure apparatus, threading every choice. Body-as-setting functions too: bare feet read the stone’s temporal leakage, forcing route changes. Tablet core of “liquid starlight” is the final image, recharging all prior blue phosphor motifs. Micro-settings (equation-wallpapered room, staircase labels) constrain tactics—she can only climb the dates she forgot.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake: singular vs. plural identity, signaled in line 1. Escalation is textural densification: each confession thickens the air until rain freezes—visible price. No reversals needed; the deepening reweights the cost of self-definition. Agency persists—she speaks the admissions, triggers the merger, pays with her lone selfhood.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges from recursion imagery: “I am the branching. The fracture. The recursion.”—a final conceptual repricing, not a moral. No abstract slogans; the tablet’s blooming root-script enacts the theme. Subtext lives in gesture: hovering inches signals refusal to be claimed, long before she names it. Final image offers lingering ambiguity—she is now legion; is that triumph or dissolution?—inviting counter-readings.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is laser-specific: “phosphorescent residue of temporal leakage,” “organic script that shifted like roots seeking water.” Rhythm modulates from breathy fragments under pressure to flowing merger at the end. No dialogue, so no ventriloquism risk. Single POV never leaks; knowledge stays strictly character-bound—she discovers the runes’ admissions only as they sprout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Read-aloud ear test passes: sentence length varies, no template cadence. Information density high—one line can world-build and escalate: “Runes flared: not carved, but grown.” No mixed metaphors; root/vein/branch motif stays coherent. Minor scaffold: “she stepped…the floor dissolved…she climbed” uses three identical openers in seven lines—−0.2. No artifacts touch closure beat; final “liquid starlight” is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Synthesis of procedural generation + confessional lyric is non-obvious and feels inevitable after first paragraph. Risk taken: merging physics-defiance with emotional algorithm pays off—hovering becomes honesty’s engine, not spectacle. Fresh inflection: the tablet does not decode futures; it grows pasts she must orally release. Transformation test: swap hovering for flying and whole metaphor collapses—proof of tight integration.</comment>
