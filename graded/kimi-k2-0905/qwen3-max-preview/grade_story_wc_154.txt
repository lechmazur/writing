<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mira’s contradictory impulses—stoic translator reflexes versus the need to re-humanize memory—surface in embodied micro-choices: clutching the coral, kneeling to the cast, pressing coral to plaster. Interiority stays concrete, never drifts into diagnostic speak; the anesthetic haze distorts perception in a character-specific way. The final renunciation—carrying rather than fixing pain—pays off the established flaw of over-translation, cost visible in the cooled coral and her lighter yet scarred gait. No stock gestures; every beat is filtered through her salt-stung, language-warped sensorium.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the rearranged stick-figure and cooled coral reconfigure meaning without erasing loss; cost is felt in the atrium’s exhale and her decision to “carry with grace.” Accumulative lens holds—each spiral, smudge, and temperature shift layers density until the final image reweights the stake. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 3; no ambiguity persists. No plot amnesia; coral and cast track cleanly from first to last beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Glass ceiling dripping condensation, mist curling like hesitant ghosts, and the coral’s labyrinthine ridges all constrain attention and later charge the final image. Sensory hierarchy obeys Mira’s wartime translator bias: she reads temperature, texture, and salt before visual detail. Spatial choreography is pristine—coral moves from palm to thigh to plaster without teleport. Micro-setting (the cast itself) functions as environment that alters her kneeling stance and decryption tactic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preventing erasure of a child’s witness—surfaces in line 5 and tightens when the frantic spirals soften into tide-words; options narrow from decryption to stewardship. Agency is contemplative but active: each whispered phrase materially rearranges the cast’s surface, visible cost on the page. No coincidence; escalation is driven by her tactile decryption under anesthetic pressure. The final image forecloses the option to “heal” and crystallizes endurance as the only viable path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the salt-tide imagery: translation is not fixing but listening; peace is sutured, not signed. Subtext lives in the stick-figure’s mute hand-hold—no moral spoken, yet meaning reweights all prior knots. Final image offers conceptual repricing: scars are not wounds to close but stories to carry. No thematic echo; the lotus-hearted ache stays implicit in the cooled coral and lighter step.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise—“ghost-pressure of ocean tides,” “salt and silence”—syntax lengthens under anesthetic, contracts during decryption. Perceptual signature is translator-leaning: she parses condensation as “liquid gold,” deciphers smudges before naming them. No head-hopping; POV remains tightly bound to her skin-level sensorium. Rhythm mirrors drugged tide—long clauses inhale, short whispers exhale.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>High information density: “brain coral fragment, its grooves still humming with ghost-pressure” does three jobs—object, metaphor, memory—in ten words. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or choice. Metaphors stay physically coherent—mist as breath, coral as calcified hope—no mixed vehicles. Final clause “lighter, not because the pain had vanished, but because she’d learned to carry it with grace” lands clean, no scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Premise—anesthetic dream-atrium where war memories are decrypted through a child’s cast—is non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Coral-as-memory-bone and translator-as-unknotter synthesize fresh angles on trauma stories. Risky lyric compression taught early and paid off at closure without clarity loss. Specificity of Pacific atoll refugee smoke roots the concept; could not swap coral for “pocket watch” without breaking logic.</comment>
