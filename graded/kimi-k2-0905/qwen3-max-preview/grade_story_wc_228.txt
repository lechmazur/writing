<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Interiority is sensory-rich (“brine and buried time”); the cracked-mirror trigger justifies retreat; leaving the shell is visible cost. Motivation stays interior-credible; no external pressure tests status, so relationship bullets N/A. The final renunciation lands cleanly but lacks a contradictory impulse on-page, keeping it short of 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: lyric density builds via salt, drip, candle, shell until the cave absorbs her mark. Closure is Charged Poise—“I’m still here” plus shell abandoned—reconfigures meaning with felt cost. Orientation anchored by line 3; no causality breaks. One micro-turn (wrong turn → cave) tightens stakes; no escalation cap triggered.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Cave operates as micro-setting: damp acoustics force whispered steps; salt-crystal “stars” charge final image. Kelp-slick steps physically constrain descent; pool water becomes paint medium—tool substitution on-page. Sensory hierarchy obeys painter’s eye (color, sheen, flicker). Environment dictates pace; no postcard drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: restore self-trust after mirror-crack; cave supplies solitary pressure. No antagonist; tightening is sensory densification, not option reduction—valid under Accumulative lens. Cost legible: candle death, shell relinquished. Could use one earlier tactical loss (bruised knee, soaked sketchbook) to push higher band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through recurrence of reflection vs. motion: cracked glass → painted wall → tide. Final re-pricing: “reflection wasn’t in glass, but in motion” crystallizes concept without moralizing. Shell left behind externalizes letting-go; no thematic echo sentences. Complexity preserved: beauty still ephemeral, but agency renewed.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person intimate maintains consistent psychic distance; painter’s perceptual signature (color-coded noticing, stroke metaphors) stays intact. Rhythm modulates: long cadence for descent, staccato for drips. No dialogue to test; free indirect clean. Prose as character: syntax mirrors brush-layering. Elision taught early (“nothing looked quite real”) and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>High-density lyrical lines do dual duty: “echoing with drips that sounded like metronomes” sets pace and stakes. Zero paraphrase loops; metaphors coherent (mirror/water, cave/cathedral). Internal paragraph cuts tight; each advances image or choice. Minor near-redundancy “steps slick with kelp and memory” forgiven for sonic echo. Read-aloud ear excellent.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Freshens familiar “artistic crisis in cave” by folding mirror-crack into literal loss of reflection, then literalizing paint-on-rock as antidote. Risk: lyric density could obscure, but clarity holds. Shell motif avoids tokenism—handled, used, abandoned. Not quite 9 because core arc (retreat→renewal) remains recognizable template.</comment>
