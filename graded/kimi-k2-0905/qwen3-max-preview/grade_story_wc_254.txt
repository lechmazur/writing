<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The poet’s need “to touch what had been declared untouchable” is visceral and consistent; embodied tremor and barefoot cold make the interiority specific. No contradictory impulse is dramatized in scene—certainty only swells—so the arc is emotionally linear rather than crucible-tested. Still, the renunciation of permission-asking lands with felt cost, satisfying the 9+ quick test almost but not quite.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the colonnade dims in completion, the lake becomes “liquid starlight,” and the poet’s first post-ban verb “Unfold” reweights the premise with undeniable conceptual cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory layer thickens until the final cadence shift makes the world “remember how to listen.” No causality breaks; orientation is taught by the echoing cobalt vault within 50 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The quartz colonnade functions as micro-setting that constrains motion—its hum frequency admits only the silence-trained, and its warming under fingertip charges the final image. Frozen lake, bruised twilight, and lantern-moth hush are filtered through the poet’s synesthetic perception, never touristic. Spatial choreography is immaculate: barefoot marble → glass wall → curved heart → ice step, each distance tactile and legible.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—permission to speak again—tightens once: the sanctioned silence is lifted, but the poet must still cross the threshold of awe. The meaningful deepening occurs when “Unfold” converts law into elegy, foreclosing the option to remain merely an exile. Cost is visible: the colonnade’s completion-dimming signals that the poem can only be given, not kept. Agency is pure attention/renunciation, sufficient under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: sacred geometry becomes supple when paraphrased by mortal motion. The lake’s cracked throat and lantern-moth wings reweight “commandments into questions” without moralizing. Final image—ice remembering how to speak—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of who owns awe. No thematic echo or platitude; complexity is preserved.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays tightly fused to the poet’s synesthetic bias: light bends into sound, silence has frequency. Syntax lengthens then contracts to mirror the humming crescendo and final hush. No head-hop; diction (“lantern-moth hush,” “aesthetically driven”) remains within the POV’s aesthetic lexicon. Rhythm is deliberate, read-aloud viable, and peaks at the one-word utterance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Figurative density is high but patterned—quartz hum, glacial melt, lantern-moth return—so the lyric excess feels taught rather than overwritten. One mixed metaphor bruise (“bruised twilight”) is minor. No paraphrase loops, no scaffold, no filter-verb stacks. Information per sentence is double-duty: “barefoot on glacial marble” grounds body and temperature simultaneously. Closure line is uncluttered, earning the near-9 mark.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The fusion of synesthetic architecture with post-censorship lyric feels fresh; no close echoes in published fabulism. Risk—entire story hung on one verb and a dimming colonnade—pays off because the pattern is taught early and closure recharges it. Specificity of “quartz frequency only the silence-trained hear” transforms abstract conceit into lived constraint. Transformation test fails if names change, confirming organic originality.</comment>
