<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid, embodied, and contradiction-laden (“hands shook not from fear but from the weight of kintsugi intentions”). Micro-choices (each lacquer press) visibly trace values and cost. The final renunciation—pouring her tears, not gold—crystallizes earned change. Slight over-articulation of grief items keeps it from 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the statue’s golden aura reweights the entire premise, making brokenness sacred. Causal linkage holds—each pockmark-to-memory match is a because/therefore beat that narrows options until the last tear transmutes the stakes. The workshop stabilizes not by mechanics but by meaning, with undeniable felt cost. Lens is causal-ritual; no ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><comment>Acid sea, gear-grate floor, and green fumes anchor who/where by line 3. Sensory hierarchy obeys crisis—visual stinging, floor trembling, fox charm tactile against palm. Micro-setting (fox tail as question-mark) constrains her final gesture when it brushes the saint’s chin. Environment literally dissolves if the ritual fails, charging the image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“conjure meaning before acid breaches”—tightens with each lacquer pour that consumes breath and memory. Escalation is internal: every sealed crater forecloses denial, culminating in the tear-offering that spends her last air. Cost is visible: fumes thicken, floor lurches, workshop sinks lower. Agency is ritual, not combat, but narrows to life/death.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the kintsugi praxis itself—brokenness as revelation, not repair. No moralizing; the final image (golden aura pushing back acid) reweights prior wounds without statement. Subtext lives in gesture: fox charm silent at start, gleaming at end = question becomes answer. Complexity intact—wounds gilded, not erased.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person lyric remains anchored to her perceptual field; no head-hop. Diction is alchemist-poetic (“chorus of dying serpents,” “lunar craters”) yet precise. Syntax mirrors breathless thinning—long clauses crash into fragments as fumes rise. Dialogue absent by design; voice carries subtext through lacquer whispers.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>High density: every sentence advances image, stakes, or ritual step. Metaphors stay coherent (acid sea = serpent chorus; fox tail = question mark) and paid off. Zero repetition, no filter-verb stacks. Final tear-gold fusion line is crisp propulsion, not purple. Minor register lift (“conceptual repricing”) is narrator-accurate.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Floating acid-sea workshop, kintsugi-as-soul-surgery, and saint-statue memory-map are fresh syntheses. Transformation test fails if transplanted—entire ritual logic is setting- and body-specific. Bold risk: lyric ritual pacing under literal acid threat. No familiar trope echoes; fox charm reprise feels inevitable, not ornament.</comment>
