<comment>The survivor’s embodied silence is believable and specific—her grief visible in “the tilt of her head when listening to nothing,” her competence shown through the calibrated fork strikes. Interiority stays concrete, never drifting into label-speak. The micro-choice to warm C512 against her wrist before the fountain strike crystallizes her hierarchy of values and costs. The only drag is the late, single-paragraph exposition dump on “months developing her method”; that reflective block is capped at 20 % but still dilutes pressure just before the climax fork strike.</comment>

<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of thermal “notes” stitched into an unheard symphony. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 3 and hold. Closure is a Charged Poise: the final “deep, slow thrum” reweights silence as alive, with cost—she forfeits audible music forever. The persistent constraint (no ears, only skin/bones) shapes every tactic and is felt in the last image.</comment>

<comment>Winterglass conservatory functions as micro-setting: the frozen fountain lip is the exact surface that translates C512’s vibration into visible aurora, constraining her final tactic. Spatial choreography stays clean—boots crunch, visor overlays glow, she kneels, strikes, weeps, rises. Sensory hierarchy obeys crisis: only touch and temperature matter; sight is filtered through thermal overlays. The setting’s glass beams and orchid alcoves are re-used as emotional waypoints, not postcard filler.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—prove silence ≠ absence—tightens through each fork strike; each thermal map deepens the pattern rather than widening scope. Escalation is textural: blue swirl of regret → crimson pulse of wonder → aurora shimmer across display; the cost is the irreversible surrender of audible music. No reversal is required under Accumulative lens; the meaningful intensification is the fountain ice’s silent song that finally answers her thesis. Stakes remain internal yet feel total because the prose keeps them sensorially concrete.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the iterative thermal score: silence re-priced as saturated with feeling. The fork set, initially salvage, becomes the instrument that transmutes memory into warmth—an organic return that reweights “unshaken marvels” from tag to lived proof. No thesis states the moral; the final smile in the eastern archway is the non-literal answer. Subtext sits in gesture: gloved palm to ground = acceptance of new listening mode.</answer>

<comment>Third-person limited stays tightly pinned to survivor’s perceptual signature—“her skin heard, her bones conducted.” Syntax mirrors her hush: fragments (“No audible ring.”) and tactile diction. No dialogue, so no voice drift. Free indirect style is clean, e.g. “It worked.” Psychic distance compresses under peak stress—single-word paragraphs (“She wept…”) without filter verbs.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Information density high: one sentence often sets glass, temperature, and emotional valence. Figurative language is selective—“snowflakes hovered like paused notes”—and never stacks in high-pressure beats. One scaffold detected: “not metaphor, not memory, but actual, resonant harmony” is a triplet that could lose middle clause; minor, does not touch closure. Rhythm breathes: long sentence of dawn ascent followed by one-line finality. Copy-clean; no typos or tense drift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: post-calamity silence re-imagined as thermal symphony, with tuning forks as emotional seismographs. The inversion of hearing through skin instead of ears feels inevitable in hindsight and grounded in real physics of bone conduction. Risk—silent protagonist in a silent world—heightens rather than obscures stakes. Specific detail (A440, C512, D587) prevents abstract anywhere-setting.</comment>
