<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interiority is sensor-rich and embodied; the artist’s contradictory impulses (obligation to ledger vs. need for silence) are dramatized through kneeling, sketching, gifting—micro-choices that escalate. Cost arrives: her refusal to sell forecloses income and public recognition, visible in the kiln’s humble brick and starlit aloneness. Flaw—passive revelation (“She was meant to find this place”) replaces active discovery, slightly blunting agency.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: frost–ledger–glass pattern intensifies until the canyon becomes a map of escapes, reweighting survival into service. Closure is Charged Poise: the ledger framed in her own glass crystallizes a new stance—gifting, not hiding—with felt cost (solitude, material scarcity). Orientation taught early by tactile canyon cues; no causality breaks. Minor slack: “Of course” moment is narrated epiphany rather than earned reversal.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Canyon, body, and ledger object constrain every move: frost patterns dictate glass designs; canyon sand literally fuses into gifts; starlight provides the only illumination for work. Spatial choreography is clean—kneel, sketch, kiln, gift—no floating props. Final image (ledger inside molten glass) recharges both materials, satisfying 9+ gate. Weather and rock stay consistent; no exposition dumps.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—transform private survival into shared meaning—tightens when gifting forecloses profit, visible price on page. Escalation is accretive: each dawn’s irreproducible frost heightens the risk of failed translation into glass, sharpening attention. No external antagonist needed; internal pressure (silence vs. witness) suffices. Cost legible, though second beat could carry higher tangible loss (tool breakage, injury).</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: rupture → pattern → gift, never stated. Ledger’s redefinition from “profits” to “escape map” reweights value without moralizing. Drifting resonance is embodied in starlight caught in glass, not asserted. Final image refuses tidy comfort, sustaining ambiguity between solitude and service—lasting aftereffect.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays tight to artist’s perceptual filter: “molten glass into vessels of captured light” mirrors her vocation, “drifting resonance” mimics starlight diffusion. Rhythm modulates—long breathless accumulations for frost study, abrupt fragments at kiln heat. No head-hopping; diction never exceeds canyon-sculpted lexicon. Filter verbs (“she noticed”) are minimal and voice-motivated.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Read-aloud cadence varies; sentence openings avoid drumbeat. Metaphors stay physically coherent (frost = galaxy arms, ledger = map) and serve information density. Zero paraphrase loops, no synonym churn. One mixed image—“luminous glass artist” (literal) vs. “luminous” prose—could tighten, but does not blur causality or closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: smuggler ledger repurposed as spiritual cartography; frost as daily sacred text; glass shards reborn into gifts—three materials collide to redefine escape. Pattern-over-time structure mirrors frost’s vanishing art, aligning form with content. Risk (no dialogue, quiet ending) pays off through resonant image. Minor proximity to eco-healing tropes, but canyon specificity and refusal to sell keep it singular.</comment>
