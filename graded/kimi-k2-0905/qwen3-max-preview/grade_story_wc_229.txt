<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid—blistered fingers, shallow breath, the cork’s warmth—yet her “whispers > shouts” creed is stated more than dramatized; we see the result (ships turn) but not a moment where she doubts or over-shouts herself. The beat of pressing the cork to her lips crystallizes her hierarchy of values; the empty vial in her pocket supplies visible cost. Still, the absence of a micro-choice that could fail—no temptation to bellow into the gale—keeps the arc a hair short of perfect contradiction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a lyrical Resonant Reconfiguration: the scent-thread returns in the final breath, reweighting the premise that tenderness can reroute steel. Causal chain holds: cork → scent → vibration → captain’s inhalation → rudder turn; no teleporting props. Cost is felt—the empty twin vial, her knees sinking—but the lens wobbles slightly between causal and accumulative; the paragraph that asserts “whispers travel farther” is more commentary than because/therefore linkage, preventing a 9.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The cobalt tower, salt-silence, and jasmine-cereus scent are not backdrop but conduit: paint peels under salt, the railing is cold against blistered skin, the lantern room swallows stars. Environment constrains her only route—descend, uncork, breathe—and the scent’s night-garden memory charges the final image. Spatial choreography is flawless: cork, empty vial, vest pocket tracked without drift. Micro-setting (the cork as lightning-scarred heartwood) functions as both tool and setting, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can tenderness redirect ships?—is signaled by word 30 and tightened once: the scent’s release. Agency is renunciation/endurance rather than combat; she hazards her private creed on a single breath. Cost is legible (empty vial, knees buckling) but because no live option is foreclosed—she never considers shouting—the tightening feels gentle, not gnashing. Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the density of scent-imagery reweights the stake; under Causal, the reversal is mild.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete particulars: jasmine ghost, cork’s lightning scar, gull’s greeting—never abstract sermon. The final whispered thanks reconfigures the opening vow without stating a moral. Subtext lives in silence: captains stop mid-syllable, fists unclench; no dialogue spells out forgiveness. The only overt thematic articulation—“this was screaming tenderness”—is earned by sensory accrual and lands as image, not thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Voice is oceanic and salt-stained: “salt and silence,” “liquid gold,” “thick as honey.” Syntax swells and ebbs with paragraph length, mirroring tide. Perceptual signature is keeper-specific—she notices hull angles, paint peeling under salt, the beam’s mechanical pulse. No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens from cosmic dawn to the warmth of cork against palm. Filter verbs are sparse and purposeful; free indirect style stays clean.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Rhythm is ocean-breath: long sentence sets scent adrift, short clause lands “smooth as a sigh.” No paraphrase loops; each sentence adds sensory or causal layer. Metaphors are physically coherent: “tuning fork struck against bone” fits vibration physics; no mixed vehicle clutter. One near-overwrite—“humming with the memory of the heat wave”—is saved by specificity of peeling paint. Final line is crisp image, not scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Conceptual freshness: a scent-driven lighthouse keeper who reroutes ships via intention-purifying cork struck by lightning—synthesis feels inevitable yet unwritten. Risk of sentimental whimsy is averted by salt-cruel detail and embodied cost. Tropes—lighthouse, dawn, ships—are re-inflected through olfactory neurology and quiet activism. The angle is non-obvious and fully committed; remove any ingredient and the whole aroma collapses.</comment>
