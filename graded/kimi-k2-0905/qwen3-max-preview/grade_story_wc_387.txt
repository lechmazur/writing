<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interior contradiction is subtle but present—she courts notice while claiming to shun fame; embodied emotion lands in cool stone under bare feet and whisk-grooves against moonlight. Micro-choices (whistling names, palm to erased chalk) trace a hierarchy of values, and the renunciation of leaving no mark is earned. Reflection stays anchored to present stimuli, but the arc is observation-heavy; a single decisive external test is missing, capping excellence at 8.4.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: each sensory layer (rain, moon paths, firefly pulses) thickens the stake of “seeing the unseen.” Closure is a Charged Poise—whisk aloft, fireflies syncing—where cost is felt as eternal anonymity. Orientation is clear by line 8; causality is internal but coherent. No tightening turn escalates risk; the piece deepens instead, satisfying the 8.8 gate for lyric design.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment> parapet, clay cup, bamboo-whisk grooves, and firefly after-rain air are tactiley lived-in; moonlight pools guide her steps, constraining the final stance. Sensory economy is exemplary—sound of wet silk, cool stone under arch—each detail mirrors internal hush. Micro-setting (whisk-as-totem) charges the closing image, meeting 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</question><grade>Dominant stake—“to witness unseen labor”—is signaled early; pressure intensifies as each erased chalk mark equals obliteration. No external antagonist or reversible loss, so escalation is emotional/textural: firefly alignment crystallizes cost of remaining invisible. Agency is attention/renunciation; path foreclosed when she walks away footprint-less. Cost is felt but not vis-à-vis a live option lost; hence stops short of 8.2.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</question><comment>Theme emerges organically: invisible labor keeps the world from fraying. Final whispered “I see you” reweights every prior erased tally without moralizing. Imagery of knots, nets, moon paths, and firefly blinks forms tight particular set; no abstract platitudes intrude. Resonant reconfiguration lands as conceptual repricing—visibility itself becomes the rare currency.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Perceptual signature is distinctive: philosopher-net-mender notices “hush between breaths,” divines with tea whisk, counts chalk ghosts. Syntax flexes with cadence of tides; diction stays within humble coastal lexicon. No dialogue, so no head-hop risk; compression and elision are pattern-taught in first paragraph and paid off in final whistle. Voice modulates from hush to syncopated shanty without rupture.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</question><comment>Rhythm breathes—long sentences for moonlit contemplation, clipped fragments for firefly blinks. Figurative density is high but patterned (starlight in spider-thread) and tied to POV craft; no mixed metaphors. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence adds new sensory or conceptual grain. One scaffold: “demure audacity” is repeated; its recurrence is thematic, not accidental, so minor deduction only.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</question><comment>Fusion of net-mender + metaphysician + night whistler feels fresh; trope of “unseen labor” given tactile heft via chalk erased by rain. Synthesis is specific: whisk stirs matcha and cosmos alike; fireflies as pulse-code for anonymous workers is non-obvious. Risk—lyric accumulative structure rather than plot—heightens resonance without obscuring clarity. Not quite 9.0 because emotional arc is quiet, not boldly transformative.</comment>
