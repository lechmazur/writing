<comment>The collector’s interiority stays concrete—she kneels beside dread, absorbs confessions through the tooth’s warmth, chooses to play the leaf-flute while the gorge shudders—each micro-choice embodying her integrating purpose. Contradictory impulses (fear/comfort, grief/laughter) braid in real time, not summaries. The modest-fearless trait is shown, not labeled, when she kneels where a child’s giggle became a sob. Persistent flaw: no visible cost paid by her; the tooth absorbs weight but she walks away “fuller,” not visibly diminished, capping the arc just below 9-band.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the final smile-touch of the tooth reweights the rule-set—laughter is not opposite but sibling to sorrow—while the downstream giggle makes the cost audible. Accumulative lens holds: each spectral confession layers density until the flute’s trill triggers cadence shift; gorge resonance realigns, ghosts integrate, collector departs fuller. Persistent constraint (tooth that remembers and warms) shapes every tactic and the final image. No orientation debt; who/where/when anchored by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Echo Gorge is not backdrop but instrument: fissures snag wind, stones sing off-key, narrowing walls force her to kneel and play. Micro-setting rule: the misaligned harp’s geology constrains how she pursues and ultimately harmonizes souls. Crocodile tooth functions as portable Styx-vein, its warming amber glow charging the final image. Sensory hierarchy stays biased to her task—sound over sight—so every descriptor advances integration pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: can grief be companionship rather than exile? Pressure tightens when confession layers peak at “unsent letters, unheld hands,” forcing her to risk clumsy flute-trill that might shatter integration. Cost is legible: gorge shudders, shadows peel, tooth’s serrated edge smooths—material price exacted from environment and tool, not her body. One meaningful deepening suffices; no reversal required under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without thesis: laughter as sorrow’s sibling is never asserted, only demonstrated when a ghost-boy’s snort cracks the air like a dropped plate. Final image downstream (child’s giggle) offers non-literal answer to the thematic question—healing is sonic, not moral. Subtext in silence: ghosts never speak until the woman whispers “silly again,” making gratitude a hush. Resists tidy moral; complexity lingers in luminous ache.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Lyric third-person hovers at evocative distance yet stays anchored to her perceptual filter: she notices resonance, temperature, echo, not visual panoramas. Sentence rhythm mimics gorge wind—long flowing clauses build pressure, then fragment at “She did not flinch.” Figurative layer is dense but patterned early (harp = geology, tooth = regret) so metaphoric code is taught and paid off. No head-hop; voice remains singular collector-stance throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud ear test passes: cadence swells and breaks in step with gorge music. No paraphrase loops; each line adds sonic or tactile layer. Information density high—one sentence often fuses setting, metaphor, and interior tilt (“tooth glowed warm amber, its edges smoothing as it metabolized sorrow into grace”). Metaphors stay coherent within acoustic geology logic; no mixed vehicles. Zero scaffold; even color words (“violet and gold”) carry sonic weight.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: grief-map as out-of-tune geological harp, soul-collection as acoustic harmonization, laughter-as-sibling rather than opposite—each angle feels inevitable once sounded. Risk of lyrical overload is embraced yet controlled by taught pattern; payoff at child-giggle re-entering the world justifies density. Conceptual integrity maintained—no retreat to generic afterlife tropes. Specificity of tooth from Styx-cousin river and moon-thread satchel prevents swappability.</comment>
