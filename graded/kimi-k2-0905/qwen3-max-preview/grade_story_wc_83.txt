<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid—“each step a quiet defiance against the silence that had replaced her heartbeat”—and the geode’s pulses give embodied contradiction. Motivation stays consistent: cartography of lost possibility, not revenge. The final micro-choice—thrusters queued while she whispers names—earns her bleak exhilaration. No secondary character on-page, so relationship crucible absent; head-count clarity perfect.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each simulation collapses → therefore new coordinates → therefore thrusters fire. Closure is Charged Poise: “the observatory leapt into the dark” reweights stakes with undeniable cost—she leaves safety forever. Orientation anchored by line 3; no ambiguity. Setup of “Cradle of Cold Eyes” pays off as launch site, not mere backdrop.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mirrored domes refracting starlight into “spectral grids” is tactile and specific; zero-g grating constrains every step. The geode functions as micro-setting—its violet ripples alter air density she breathes. South-Pacific coordinate emerges as future setting that already pressures choice. Environment charges final image: she flees toward emptiness the observatory itself was built to watch.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—map unused potential of annihilated futures—signaled in paragraph 3 and tightens when simulations keep collapsing, forcing physical hunt. One meaningful escalation: final coordinates force her to abandon the observatory’s safety. Cost is legible: she forfeits orbit, supplies, and any last tether to pre-strike life. Agency pure: no coincidence, only iterated failure → jump.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme—potential is indestructible, only displaced—emerges through geode cartography rather than statement. Subtext in naming dead softly counters military euphemism “drone strike.” Final image of universe “that chose differently” reweights premise without moral sermon. Ambiguity lingers: she may drown in potential, yet the drive is undeniable.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is scientist-poet hybrid: “probability manifold,” “spectral grids,” yet synesthetic “trauma-tuned nerves.” Perceptual signature sharp—she notices silence replacing heartbeat, violet against eyelids. No dialogue, so no convergence risk. Compression like “Cradle of Cold Eyes” teaches pattern early and sustains it.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High information density: one sentence often jobs—world rules, emotional state, metaphor. Rhythm varies: long hypotactic buildups crash into fragmentary launch countdown. No mixed metaphors; “wound turning in its sleep” sustains orbital metaphor. Zero loops, zero scaffold; “intangibly tangible” is earned paradox, not ornament.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Premise—“hunting pooled unused potential via post-strike geode in orbit”—is non-obvious synthesis of grief and quantum cartography. Risk of abstractions is high, yet piece commits fully, following “perturbation theory” to literal thruster burn. Specificity of dead names sung off-key keeps it from sliding into generic loss allegory. Transformation complete: swap any detail and story collapses.</comment>
