<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The scholar’s quiet refusal to resurrect the past but instead to *listen* to its question is a credible, earned renunciation; the cracked voice she finally offers is a micro-choice with visible cost. Interiority stays concrete and bias-driven—“dust motes drifting…like tired bones” is perception filtered through her hush-drunk lens. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene, only a single steady obsession, so the contradiction slot is empty; that caps her just below the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the crystal’s echo returns her own uncertainty and re-weights the whole quest from recovery to open-ended listening; the conceptual cost—her data method is useless for what comes next—is legible in her closing the notebook. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each strike→echo→transcription grows pattern-density until the final cadence breaks the pattern. Orientation anchors land by line 4; no因果 turns are required under this lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The library’s “suspended hush” is not backdrop but active acoustic instrument that reshapes sound and therefore method; the crystal’s micro-setting (held in taper-light on the table) literally focuses the final image. Dawn’s slant and settling floorboards supply tactile, POV-filtered immediacy without tourist catalog. World-rules stay consistent—no electricity, only breath-scale physics of echo. Meets 9+ gate: environment (vaulted ceiling) bends the sound that forces her final stance.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“does the past contain a reproducible pattern?”—tightens through density, not reversals: each strike thickens the textual record until the echo flips the question outward (“What grows now?”). Agency remains hers; she abandons transcription, paying with professional identity (notebook shut). Cost is visible and felt. No off-stage rescue; coincidence is absent. Sufficient single intensification for 600-word frame.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme—growth is not retrieval but unknowing—emerges entirely through acoustic imagery and her final spoken uncertainty; no editorial thesis is stated. Subtext resides in the shift from glyph to voice, from answer to question. Final whisper re-prices seventeen winters of data, meeting CR standard. No platitudes, only patterned hush→voice inversion that lands as emotional aftereffect.</question>

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Third-person lyric remains tight to scholar’s perceptual filter: synesthetic “sound pooled like liquid mercury,” fern-unfurling simile marks her botanist instinct. Syntax lengthens then fractures in tandem with echo distortion; diction stays archaic-leaning without counterfeit dumbing. No dialogue, so voice purity is uncontested. Read-aloud rhythm controlled through comma-stitched clauses that mimic held breath—pattern taught early and paid off in final short sentence “I don’t know.”</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>High information density: one sentence often does three jobs (anchors time, reveals method, colors atmosphere). No scaffold loops; metaphors stay internally coherent. Minor register drift—“conceptual repricing,” “acoustic instrument”—are scholar’s legitimate lexicon, justified by POV. One mixed image: “origami made of breath” is physically impossible but reads as intentional lyric compression rather than error; it touches, not obscures, closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: acoustics + archival decay + linguistic extinction compressed into portable 700-word chamber opera. Stakes are microscopic yet cosmic; no genre template matched. Chandelier crystal as diagnostic mic is novel and inevitable once taught. Risk of plotless lyric is high, but payoff—uncertainty as methodological breakthrough—justifies gamble. Specific “fractured sequences” concept travels beyond familiar mnemonic-object trope.</comment>
