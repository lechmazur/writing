<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The herald’s interiority is lyrically rich yet remains at a single emotional register; no contradictory impulse or micro-choice is dramatized under pressure, so the “accidentally prophetic” trait never complicates her tactics or produces visible cost. The final stance is beautiful stasis, not earned renunciation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the inverted-shadow flare reweights the world’s future with undeniable conceptual cost. Accumulative/textural lens holds—pattern of nightly ritual tightens through sensory recursion—though the piece teaches its mosaic rhythm late (~40 %), warranting a small orientation waiver.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Emerald tower, salt-slick cliffs, and lantern-wick micro-setting are filtered through the herald’s storm-tuned senses and directly charge the final image; the lighthouse glass literally enables the total-internal-reflection steering that reconfigures fate. Spatial choreography remains coherent across the single aerial vantage.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“steer the world’s dreaming edge”—is signaled early; pressure deepens when star-needles stitch urgent warnings, forcing the nightly ritual to produce the inverted-shadow flare. Cost is conceptual but legible: futures are repossessed from algorithmic weariness, yet the herald’s exhaustion is only asserted, not felt.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: mythic attention as antidote to data-drowned numbness. The inverted-shadow library/tide-school future offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Ambiguity remains—whether the world will choose awe—creating lingering complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is unmistakable: storm-wrought syntax, percussive alliteration, and lightning-forged metaphors that never repeat. Psychic distance modulates from cosmic sweep to sea-salt breath without losing coherence. The herald’s perceptual signature—laughter as weather instrument—sustains throughout and peaks in the final kiss to the horizon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Figurative density is extreme yet patterned; the piece teaches its lyric cadence early and pays off in the lantern-flare crescendo. No mixed metaphors or synonym loops; each image advances atmosphere or stakes. Occasional elevated diction (“sacerdotal ink”) stays within the herald’s mythic lexicon.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Fusing meteor-carved lighthouse, total-internal-reflection fate-bending, and post-news myth-making feels novel yet inevitable. The inversion of darkness-as-illumination reconfigures familiar light/dark tropes. Risky lyric compression succeeds because closure remains legible under the accumulative lens.</comment>
