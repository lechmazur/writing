<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied (“fingers fidgeted productively”); the self-forgiveness arc is credible because each micro-choice (kneeling to winnow, tracing the fogged mirror) is tied to the prior pedagogical sin. The only flaw is a touch of diagnostic self-talk (“guilt from grief”) that momentarily flattens the contradiction. Closure cost is felt: she carries the truth “lightly,” a renunciation that forecloses exile as identity. Meets 9+ quick test despite minor therapy-speak flicker.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Mirror moment delivers Resonant Reconfiguration: the fog absorbs “I see you,” dissolving into acceptance—visible conceptual cost under Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality is clean: each tapestry she mends softens the corridor metal, a literalized because/therefore linkage. Orientation anchored by word 60; no lens ambiguity. Closure image reweights the entire gambit metaphor; persistent constraint (carrying truth lightly) shapes the final walk.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>“Platinum labyrinth” functions as both setting and tool: its walls warm in response to her winnowing, constraining her pace and charging the final image. Time-frozen village is not postcard scenery—the suspended coin and mid-sway sign constrain her tactical quiet. Micro-setting inside the mirror-frame reprises the metallic cold, now absorbed into acceptance. Gate met: recurring object/platinum corridors reweight stakes at closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—self-forgiveness—signaled in paragraph 1; pressure tightens when each re-woven thread re-creates the boy’s fracture. One meaningful deepening: the mirror refuses clarity, forcing acceptance instead of absolution. Cost is visible: she forfeits the right to erase her past, must “carry it lightly.” Agency is internal but active; no coincidence; escalation coherent under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges from pattern vs. silence: chess tactics = life traps; mending tapestry borders = mending marginalized lives. No explicit thesis; final image of rain “coaxing seeds” reweights the entire labyrinth as soil, not prison. Subtext in gesture—tracing fog instead of shattering glass—asserts acceptance over redemption. Avoids sermon; resonance lingers in “mistakes learned to breathe.”</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person lyric voice sustains a controlled, slightly archaic cadence (“woven hush,” “charged with woven silence”) that mirrors the tutor’s analytical mind. Perceptual signature is tactile-strategic: every noticed detail is a thread or gambit. No dialogue, hence no convergence issue. Rhythm modulates: long sentences for suspended time, fragment (“She entered.”) for decisive plunge. Pattern taught early and held; closure legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High information density: one sentence often does three jobs (setting, metaphor, interiority). Minor template cadence in triple-present-participle openings (“brushing… adjusting… tracing”) but it is voice-motivated and paid off. No mixed metaphors; platinum ↔ tapestry ↔ board logic stays coherent. Final line “mistakes learned to breathe” is crisp, propulsive, leaves resonance. Fits 9+ gate with hairline repetition only.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fusion of chess pedagogy with tapestry-mending is fresh; neither trope feels grafted. The “woven hush” as compressed presence is a conceptual risk that pays off by literalizing silence into thread. Time-stalled village avoids cliché by internal logic: suspended giggle, mid-pour wine. Final reconfiguration—“exile irrelevant”—flips the expected redemption arc into acceptance. +0.3 risk bonus within band; synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
