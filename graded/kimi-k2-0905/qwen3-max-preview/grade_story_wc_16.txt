<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is rich and embodied (“her breath shallow,” “hands shook as she reconstructed”); motivation (restore trust) drives every micro-choice. The arc from solitary obsession to communal conductor is visible, but the cost is felt more conceptually than viscerally—no private loss or irreversible forfeiture is dramatized. Still, her contradictory impulses—reckless sonic daring vs. philological precision—coexist in scene, satisfying the 9+ quick test’s “contradictory impulses in scene.”</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: because she deciphers harmonic betrayal → therefore she composes a restorative score → therefore colleagues must sing or re-fracture trust. Closure is a literal Decisive Change: communal song re-activates the archive’s acoustics, prismatic light from empty well = undeniable conceptual cost. Orientation is anchored by word 30; no lens ambiguity; persistent constraint (one false note = collapse) shapes every tactical decision. Meets 9+ cost-proof test: “the glass ink well, now empty, reflected… scattered promises kept.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Archive breathes as character: dust motes spiral under vowel resonance, chandelier remembers purpose, scent of rain released. Glass ink well recurs, handled in at least four beats, its final prismatic projection charging the closure image—satisfies 9+ gate. Selective sensory economy (sound > sight > smell) mirrors philologist’s priorities. Spatial choreography clean; no floating props or impossible positions.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore communal trust—signaled in para 1 and tightened by the living acoustic test: sing falsely → semantic collapse re-occurs. Escalation is causal: each recovered phoneme narrows the live option to withdraw or continue; final public performance forces irreversible communal stake. Visible price: empty ink well, tears, dust “snow,” curator’s awed silence—cost legible on page. Agency is hers alone—she composes, conducts, risks fracture.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from action: truth as performative harmony, trust as fragile chord progression. No explicit thesis; final image of empty well casting prismatic “promises kept” reweights prior material without moralizing. Subtext in curator’s crossed arms, trembling meniscus, chandelier’s single tone. Invites counter-reading: is restored harmony merely nostalgia? Complexity lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tightly bound to linguist; perceptual signature—“ink remembered the voices it once transcribed”—is character-specific. Syntax mirrors sonic obsession: sibilance, cadenced clauses, musical punctuation. No head-hopping; distance stable. Filter verbs (“she realized”) are voice-motivated, not slack. Dialogue minimal but distinct: curator’s warning vs. her counter—register difference clear.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies: long breathless accumulations mirror rising chord, then short declaratives at release. No template cadence or synonym loops. Mixed metaphors avoided; “symphonies of truth” is literalized, not decorative. Minor scaffold: “she documented everything… dipping her quill…” could compress, but does not obscure causality or dull closure. High information density: one sentence often advances setting, stakes, and sensory cue.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: linguistics + acoustics + legal contracts = literal musical truth. Concept fully committed; implications pursued to communal performance. Risk-taking in making climax a choral act inside an archive—could feel abstract, yet grounded via visceral acoustics. Not transformable to generic fantasy; specificity of Syrathi harmonics, drowned monastery charts, bell-tower resonance charts renders it singular.</comment>
