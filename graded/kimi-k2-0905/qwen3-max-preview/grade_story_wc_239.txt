<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Witness’s interiority stays lyrically specific; the barefoot tread, cracked spine, and unlearning vocabulary are embodied micro-choices. Motive—“housekeeping” of reality—remains consistent and personal, so the final surrender feels earned. No secondary character, so no status crucible, but solitary spiral fulfills arc. Cost: identity dissolves; dictionary burns into light—felt, irreversible. Meets 9+ quick test under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a textbook CR: dictionary pages dissolve into light; coherence is repriced with conceptual cost—she becomes hush itself. Accumulative lens holds: density of glyphs, shelving resonance, and memory floods tighten rather than cause-and-forward. Orientation anchored by line 3 (“barefoot through the ancient temple library”) and pattern of hiccup/time-slip is taught early; disorientation pays off in negative-space inversion. One meaningful tightening at midpoint—library reads her—narrows options to surrender. Cost undeniable: “she was no longer witness. She was the hush after.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Library is not backdrop; humming shelves and domeless sky actively constrain tactics—resonance decides which book she pulls. Micro-setting tool: the regret-bound volume and the dictionary alter her next action (hand on book = surrender trigger). Spatial choreography crisp: barefoot on mosaic, shelves rotate, glyphs orbit. Final image—eyes in sky rippling—recharges earlier “dust motes hung like frozen stars.” 9+ gate met: environment charges closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake = clarity through unification; signaled in line 7: “she had come not to read, but to unify.” Spiral arbitration provides single escalating rhythm—each coil absorbs contradiction, tightening until surrender is only exit. Price legible: dictionary lost to light, self lost to hush. No coincidence; pressure is accumulative density, not external antagonist. Under Accumulative lens, one deepening suffices and lands with felt cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Thesis—“meaning is negotiated”—emerges through action, not lecture; final coherence is image, not maxim. Recurrent hush evolves from atmospheric descriptor to ontological state, reweighting all prior noise. No moral; ambiguity lingers: is dissolution failure or apotheosis? Subtext carried by gesture (laying palms, smile of recognition) and silence itself. Earned wisdom: specificity of “unfinished sentences ever uttered in the dark” avoids abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays tight to witness’s perceptual bias—only she hears shelves hum, sees eyes in sky. Syntax mirrors spiral: long clauses coil, then fragment at surrender. Diction within plausible metaphysical-librarian lexicon; no filter-verb clutter. Compression taught early (“time here didn’t flow; it eddied”) and paid off at closure. No dialogue, so no voice convergence issue. Rhythm accelerates into final short sentences, matching breath cessation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Lyric density is high but patterned—repetition of “hiccup,” “spiral,” “hush” functions as accumulative drum rather than loop. Metaphors stay internally consistent (dust = stars, library = lung). One mixed metaphor flagged: “letters lifted…like iron filings around a lodestone”—minor, does not touch closure. No scaffold; each sentence advances image or pressure. Register stable—no sudden academese. Final line is clean, resonant, proof-read.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade>
<comment>Conceptual fusion of library, cosmology, and linguistic undoing feels fresh yet inevitable in hindsight. Spiral arbitration reframed as housekeeping = non-obvious synthesis. Risky second-person cosmic scale paid off by anchoring in tactile barefoot steps and book spines. No derivative templates; resists salvation/domination tropes. Final reconfiguration—“she was the hush”—turns entire story into ear, not eye. Bold compression and ontological surrender elevate stakes beyond generic apocalypse.</comment>
