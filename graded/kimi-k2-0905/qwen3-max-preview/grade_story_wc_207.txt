<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Elira’s sensibly eccentric collector identity shows in gear (brass dish, compass) and micro-choice (licking a page), but we never see her interior contradiction under escalating pressure; the “surrender” epiphany is accepted, not wrestled with, so the change feels foregone rather than earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each image layers petrichor-as-memory until the final Charged Poise (“the stone sighed…a closing eyelid”) makes the cost of irreversible inward guidance legible. One clean shard, no orientation debt, closure lands.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The lagoon–compass pairing constrains every beat: still black water demands stillness, inverted stars rewire the compass, and that reweighting shapes the final renunciation. Sensory selection stays biased to Elira’s scent-collector lens, never catalogic.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stake—find the place where explanations fail—is signaled early; the single deepening comes when the compass flips from exit tool to inward guide, foreclosing retreat. Cost is legible conceptually (she seals herself below) but not viscerally felt on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through scent-as-memory rather than assertion; the closing eyelid image reweights “lost” as chosen burial without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers: is this transcendence or annihilation? The particulars invite both readings.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays tight to Elira’s perceptual bias—petrichor metaphors, mineral tastes, ozone tang—without filter-verb clutter. Syntax breathes with cavern rhythm; no head-hop or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>High information density—each sentence layers scent, silence, and mythic time without scaffold. Only minor purple clusters (“breath of earth remembering its own becoming”) but the cadence supports the incantatory mode and never obscures causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Petrichor-as-memory and compass-that-points-to-surrender synthesize into a fresh metaphysical descent; the inversion of lost→found feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk in lyric compression heightens resonance without clarity loss.</comment>
