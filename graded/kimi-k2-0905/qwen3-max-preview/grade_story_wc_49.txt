<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid—her coat smells of “moss and machine oil,” a lived-in paradox—but the moment of highest emotional risk (the chorus stepping from the oak) is summarized, not embodied, so the cost is felt more as mythic tableau than as personal consequence. The micro-choice to keep playing when the vine tightens is present, yet the final quiet smile feels lightly earned because the prior beats lean on lyric assertion over visible sacrifice. Still, her flaw—naïve faith in song as universal solvent—complicates the mission and is not tidily cured, satisfying the earned-stasis requirement.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: cadence and sensory density build until the final reconfiguration (“the songs remained…in the pulse of the arbor itself”). Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Charged Poise—where the cost is the irrevocable return of ancestral song into living matter; the land, not Elara, pays first, but her future is now bound to guardianship. One causal micro-gap: the apparitions affect the world but never test Elara’s stamina or force her to renounce an alternative path, so the “price” is more conceptual than visceral. Orientation is clean in the first 120 words; no teleporting props or knowledge leaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The arbor functions as micro-setting: its remembered creaks and dew-fed vines constrain how Elara moves (kneeling, wrist wrapped) and supply the only channel for rekindling song. Sensory selection follows Elara’s tinkerer eye—brass goggles reflect amber, gear-forged flute—so detail never feels touristic. Spatial choreography is clean: the vine’s curl, the oak-knot’s mouth, the wreath at the end track without drift. The final image of the circular vine wreath charges the closure by offering the next singer both invitation and burden, nailing the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore sacred practice—signals on line 3 and tightens when the vine’s first quiver makes failure concrete. Escalation is accretive: each musical phrase deepens the arbor’s response until the doorway opens; no external antagonist is needed because forgetting itself is the pressure. Elara’s agency is continuous—every note is a choice—but the climax is cooperative (spirits join), so the visible cost lands on the land rather than on her body, slightly muting personal jeopardy. Still, the irrevocable infusion of song into soil forecloses a return to silence, satisfying the “felt price” test.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</answer>
<comment>Theme emerges as “remedy requires reverence, not conquest.” Subtext is carried in gesture—the vine’s wrist-curl is a question, not submission—and in the oak-mouth’s child-voice asking why singing stopped, forcing reader complicity. No moral is stated; the final wreath is an open invitation, a charged image that reweights every prior mural and lullaby as now-living tissue. The refusal to restore village life overnight keeps ambiguity hot, avoiding sermon.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays tight to Elara’s perceptual filter: “patched overcoat smelled of moss and machine oil” is idiosyncratic noticing. Syntax lengthens and breathes during musical phrases, then snaps to short beats—“Birds ceased. Wind paused.”—mirroring breath control of playing. No head-hopping; the collective chorus is observed from outside, preserving distance. Diction remains within tinkerer lexicon—gear, copper, salvage—without sudden academic lifts.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm is deliberate: varied sentence openings, paragraph lengths echo musical phrasing. Figurative language is selective—no mixed metaphors—and tied to Elara’s craft: “the vine…curled…like a question” extends mechanical curiosity to vegetal life. No filter-verb stacks or paraphrase loops; information density is high. One near-overwrite: “golden stories with each note” edges toward abstraction, but the next clause grounds it in “not fables, but truths,” averting purple drift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Restoring song via plant-animate conduit is fresh, yet the “ancestral spirits emerge from tree” device leans on familiar eco-fantasy imagery. Transformation arrives because the specifics of gear-flute engineering and mural archaeology are shown earlier, making the union of tech and vegetal music feel inevitable rather than imported. Risk is taken in denying a triumphal village reunion, choosing landscape-scale re-enchantment instead. The concept would collapse if Elara’s tinkerer traits were swapped out, satisfying the transformation test.</comment>
