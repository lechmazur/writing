<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The chimera twin’s contradictory impulses are vividly embodied—her hesitation at plucking *Lirien* shows simultaneous yearning and dread. Interiority is concrete, never clinical: “Would that self still fit inside her skin?” carries felt cost. Micro-choice at the valve wheel triggers the floor-split; the prior beat of card-searing palms justifies the bold move. The earned stasis—accepting “trapped freedom” as freedom—caps her arc with visible forfeit of safe re-integration.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: a Conceptual Repricing that reweights identity from singular to plural, with felt cost—the card dims, the ship trembles. Causal linkage holds: emerald flare → valve turn → staircase discovery; no teleporting props. The accumulative/textural lens is announced by the garden’s density increase and cadence shift, stable through the final image. Minor waver: anchoring who/where slips to ~140 words (carnival ship location vague until “prow”), but disorientation ultimately serves the payoff, so Orientation Test waived.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Micro-setting triumph: the emerald card evolves from color token to skeleton key, constraining the final opening beat. Fog-thinned bay and oil-slick constellations mirror internal liquidity of identity without overt symbolism. Spatial choreography is airtight: descent route, valve wheel, staircase track believably. Sensory hierarchy skews tactile and olfactory—copper/cinnamon memory—grounding abstract premise in bodily experience.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“will she re-claim an erased twin-self?”—signals early and tightens when the card sears flesh, forcing the valve-wheel choice. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length: the garden confrontation materializes the abstract conflict into literal fruit of names. Cost is visible: card spent, identity balance destabilized. Agency is hers; coincidence never resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: identity as negotiated plurality rather than singularity. No moralizing—final line “if you chose the bars” offers resonant, non-literal reweighting. Motifs (naming, carnival decay, colour swatches) recur with shifting sense, charging closure. Subtext of ownership over selfhood resists tidy binaries, inviting after-effect without confusion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise; patterned metaphor (“stitched from divergent souls,” “narrative threads weave around her”) taught early, paid off at garden entry. Syntax curves with emotional swell—long breathless clauses yield to stark fragment “And all.” Perceptual signature is consistently othered: colours taste, names hang like fruit. No head-hopping; single POV sustained. Compression under pressure (“I am both. And neither. And all.”) heightens without losing legibility.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies: clauses elongate in descent, tighten at climax. Information density high—each sentence pushes image or stakes. Figurative language controlled; no mixed metaphors. Minor filter-verb clusters (“She realized… She whispered…”) appear but are offset by sensory immediacy. No loops, scaffolds, or near-duplicate sentences detected; closure beat remains luminous.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fusion of chimera selfhood with color-swatch relic and sentient name-garden feels fresh yet inevitable. Premise risks allegory but stays anchored to bodily stakes. Risky second-person invitation to reflections (“I remember you,” she lied) pays off by foregrounding belief over truth. Specificity—petal-shaped letters, cinnamon memory—prevents abstract drift; transformation test passes: story collapses if elements swapped.</comment>
