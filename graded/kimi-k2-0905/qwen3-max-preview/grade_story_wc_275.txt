<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara’s pacifist vocation is credibly rooted in embodied rituals—sheathing the knife, slicing stems for orphans—yet the interior contradiction between inherited violence and chosen gentleness is told more than enacted in scene. The final gift of a cutting to the child crystallizes her hierarchy of values with visible cost, earning the earn-stasis closure, but the absence of a live antagonist or intimate foil limits relational pressure. Her perceptual gift (noticing petal tremors) is lyrically evoked yet never complicates a beat or forces a tactical error, so it stays ornamental. Still, every action aligns with motive and the refusal to hunt carries inherited weight, satisfying the 9− band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The accumulative/textural lens holds: each shard (rose ritual, visitor encounter, child coda) layers density until the final image reweights “quiet” from absence to active presence. Causality is lyric rather than plot-driven; the ballast scrap threads memory forward and the last seed-gift delivers conceptual repricing with undeniable social cost—continuity in ash. Orientation is secured by line 3 (“after the tower fell”) and the pattern is taught early. No meaningful escalation beyond deepening thematic stakes, but that is sufficient under the lyric contract; closure beat is the girl fingering dirt under her nails—cost felt without exposition.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The glass dome refracts sun into “liquid gold,” a micro-setting that literally constrains Elara’s choices—she can cultivate but cannot leave. Ballast sand, knife sheath, and rose stems recur as handled objects whose states evolve; the fraying scrap finally swaddles the child’s cutting, charging the last image. Sensory economy is tight: red soil under fingernails, thorn-crowned stems, condensation rationed—each detail double-labors as moral and tactile texture. Spatial choreography remains clean despite time-jumps; orphanages and slums are named only when they receive flowers, keeping the world rule compact yet lived-in.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—continuity versus despair—is signaled early and deepens through accretion rather than reversal. Each micro-scene (ex-soldier, finger-missing man, child) tests Elara’s offer of quiet, but pressure stays conceptual; no concrete resource is ever at risk, blunting visceral cost. The final tightening comes via the child’s question, forcing Elara to externalize her creed; the seed wrapped in airship cloth is a resonant gesture yet does not foreclose a live alternative path. Agency is present but diffuse—she endures rather than gambles—fitting the lyric mode yet capping intensity short of 8+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete particulars: ballast sand as memory, roses as absorbers of grief, knife turned florist’s tool. No character articulates a thesis; even “continuity” is offered as answer to a question, not sermon. The conceptual repricing at the end—ashes into root space—reweights prior images without moralizing. Subtext resides in silence offered to refugees: tea brewed from hips, judgment withheld, lullabies at dawn. Ambiguity is preserved: pacifism is chosen daily, not sanctified, allowing counter-readings about privilege inside a dome.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person lyric achieves perceptual signature: Elara notices “grief in a root’s curl,” a phrase no other narrator would craft. Syntax breathes with long sentences during calm, then tightens into fragments (“Watered it. Named it Hope.”) under emotional crest. Filter verbs are absent; metaphors stay agrarian and concrete. Dialogue is minimal yet distinct—missing-finger man’s clipped skepticism contrasts with Elara’s gentle declaratives, voice separation maintained.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm varies from sinuous botanic catalogues to clipped seed-planting beats; no template cadence detected. Figurative density is high but patterned early (“secret whispered against the sky”) and repriced at closure, so it earns its lyric excess. No mixed metaphors or register drift; “ballast for the soul” is the single abstract leap, justified by prior object handling. Information density is strong—one sentence often performs setting, metaphor, and micro-action simultaneously.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The pacifist bounty-hunter’s-daughter is a fresh synthesis; the dome-as-monastery trope is inverted by using airship ballast as relic soil. Risk is taken with quiet, accumulative structure rather than plotted reversal, and the gamble pays off in the final reconfiguration. Specificity—rose-hip tea, condensation rationing, thorn crowns—prevents generic anywhere setting. The concept of “engraved quiet” could have tipped into pseudo-profundity but remains grounded in tactile ritual.</comment>
