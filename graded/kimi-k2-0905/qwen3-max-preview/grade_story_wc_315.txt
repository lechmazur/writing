<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The protagonist’s interior contradiction—between truth-telling and truth-revising—remains embodied and active in every beat; the thumb-brushing code and the buckle-click vow are micro-choices that visibly cost her trust capital. The memory of the ruined village keeps the flaw alive, so her final silent walk is earned renunciation, not stoic cliché. No diagnostic label-speak; body memory trumps abstract guilt. The only bar to 9+ is that the external world stays entirely off-stage, so relational/status crucible pressure is absent by structural choice, not lapse.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the single chime reframes the entire arbor network’s stance toward silence, re-pricing “quiet” from threat to covenant. Because/therefore chain holds: static clears → silence felt as signal → buckle chime → arbor glow answer → she re-clips → walks toward next quiet. The cost is legible in the re-clips click—she now carries the added weight of every future revision. No orientation debt; world rules (sideways trees, sky-whales) are taught through her attention filter within 120 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Environment is not backdrop but interface: the sideways root grip and bioluminescent vines literally transmit her code; the buckle ironwood railing becomes the instrument. Sensory hierarchy obeys Watcher priorities—low-frequency vibration in soles before any visual cue. Final image of wind rising “carrying no message but the memory of silence” fuses setting and theme. Micro-setting (buckle as tactile ground) constrains every tactical choice; meets 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“preserve communal trust under uncertain silence”—tightens once: the vacuum after static is the pressure, and her single chime forecloses the option to speak aloud ever again. Escalation is accretive, not linear: each sensory detail (sky-whale sigh, vine pulse) deepens density until the arbor tremor forces the audible act that crystallizes her perpetual burden. Cost is the irrevocable adoption of a wordless language she can never retract. Slight deduction because the tightening is singular; no second turn, but that is within short-form allowance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges entirely through image pattern: silence shifts from absence to medium, revision from moral compromise to communal mercy. The parachute buckle migrates from memory anchor to musical instrument to vow—its final click is the non-literal answer to “how do you carry responsibility?” No explicit thesis, yet the reader re-weights silence itself as communal glue. Resonance lingers in the after-echo of the chime; no sentimental assertion, only reconfigured perception.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: synesthetic noticing of “shiver of a sky-whale” and “soundless echo” compresses distance between body and world. Syntax lengthens during reflection, then fractures into staccato micro-gestures (“She re-clipped. The click.”) under decision pressure. No head-hopping; POV distance stays inside her skin. Voice modulation is purposeful; loses 0.1 only because arbor diction flirts with elevated register (“nocturnal arbor”) yet remains consistent, so barely a blemish.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>High information density: one sentence often carries world, emotion, and motion (“She unclipped the parachute buckle…like a stone dropped in still water”). Metaphors stay physically coherent—no mixed vehicles. Rhythm breathes with scene pace; paragraph cuts land on image beats. Zero loops, no synonym churn, no filter-verb stacks. Final third is pristine; allows 9+ adjacent.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The sideways-rooted cloud arbor is not surreal ornament but the only possible stage for a caretaker who must literally “tend the quiet.” Muscle-memory semaphore via parachute buckle repurposes military tech into pastoral care—fresh synthesis. Risk in rejecting spoken climax pays off: silence becomes the audible act. Conceptual integrity holds; no retreat to explain. Specificity makes the frame non-transferable—remove buckle, arbor, or hush and the story collapses.</comment>
