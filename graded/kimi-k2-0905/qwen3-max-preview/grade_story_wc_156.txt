<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority is lush and sensorially anchored; the contradiction between methodical craft and hunger for surrender pulses throughout. Micro-choices—touching the mural, flicking the coin—are vivid and value-revealing. Final renunciation (nickel replaced by humming stone) is earned and costly. Only nit: the “no fixed identity” line drifts toward abstract self-diagnosis instead of embodied contradiction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sonic layer adds density until the cadence shift of the nickel dissolving reweights stakes. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—her heartbeat in D-minor—felt cost on the page. Orientation (who/where) is anchored by line 3; no drift. Garden’s silent rearrangement forms Charged Poise, foreclosing return.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sound-wave garden is not backdrop but instrument: brass petals, echo-archways, and the nickel’s ricochet constrain every tactic. Micro-setting (the nickel warmed against thigh) becomes the pivot object that charges closure. Sensory hierarchy obeys Elira’s tuner-ear: she notices resonance decay before color. Setting evolution (garden re-tunes itself) mirrors her internal reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—trade certainty for wonder—signaled in paragraph 5 and tightened when direct contact fails, forcing the ricochet gambit. One meaningful escalation: mural’s refusal → nickel’s tremble → sensory migration into her body. Agency remains hers; no coin-toss miracles. Cost is visceral: heartbeat retuned, tool lost, identity unmoored.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from pattern of sonic peels—each awakening strips certainty rather than adding knowledge. Final image (river stone humming B-flat) reweights earlier motif: altered coins alter fate, now fate alters her. No moralizing; the silence after the garden’s laugh is the answer. Ambiguity lingers: is she vessel or conduit?</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person hovers at tight psychic distance, synesthetic and musically precise: “treble turned to dust.” Rhythm mimics waveforms—long crescendo, sudden drop, harmonic after-ring. No head-hop; garden’s voice is filtered through her perception. Register stays within artisanal lexicon until the final B-flat—an earned mythic lift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence propels—information often doubled (light → sound → scent) but always additive. Metaphors are acoustic, never mixed: “echoes folded into lullabies” obeys garden physics. Clarity perfect across time-sequence of ricochet. Read-aloud cadence mirrors tuning-fork decay—breath-lines at climax.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Acoustic archaeology as spiritual technology feels fresh; sonic frescoes, emotional weather, and hobo-nickel-as-tuning-key synthesize into singular mythos. Risk of conceptual overload is embraced—the garden re-writes itself to avoid novelty fatigue. The nested awakenings trope is inverted: each layer removes identity rather than accumulates self. Final object-swap (nickel → stone) is unforeseeable yet inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
