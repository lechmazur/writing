<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>The fractal weaver’s interiority is concrete—her fingers braid lamp-glow with sobs, her own locket anchors the final beat—but she never faces a true counter-pressure that tests her limits; the man’s arrival is a service request, not a crucible, so her “endurance” feels pre-ordained rather than earned in scene. Micro-choices (aligning the wick, twisting the lamp off) are present, yet the emotional cost is displaced onto the visitor; her own calcification is summarized in the last paragraph, softening the visible price on her. Still, the occupation-specific choreography and sensory embodiment keep her well above generic.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands cleanly: the protagonist applies her own ritual to herself, producing an Earned Stasis with visible cost—her locket rusted shut, silence calcified. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each new calcified object thickens the grotto’s emotional sediment until the final beat reweights her own burden. Orientation is anchored inside 120 words (“bronze grotto under starlight… first snowmelt”). No causality breaks; lamp physics remain consistent. While closure could be sharper if the man’s case had rebound consequences on her tactics, the final image still reconfigures meaning under the selected lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Bronze walls, oxidized copper halos, and the lamp’s brass rim form a micro-setting that literally channels starlight into the calcifying ritual—environment constrains the procedural beats. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: chill air, damp metal, faint hum of residual heat. Spatial choreography is clean: visitor enters, kneels, exits; weaver remains centered. Weather (snowmelt dripping as metronome) is tracked into the final paragraph, evolving with action. The grotto’s interior is not a postcard; it is a crucible whose material properties enable the magic mechanic.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“take weights”—is signaled in the man’s first line. One meaningful tightening occurs when the weaver redirects the lamp’s resonance onto herself; this narrows her future to perpetual endurance. Cost is visible: the locket calcified, silence internalized. Agency is present (she orients the lamp, twists it off), but because the external conflict is a one-way service, the escalation feels incremental rather than decisive; the rebound onto her own burden is telegraphed early, muting surprise. Still, the lens-consistent accumulation of fossilized grief satisfies the required deepening.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without slogans: grief can be geometrically compressed but never deleted; survival is the art of carrying polished stones. Subtext lives in gesture—folded letter stiffens into seashell whorls, a tactile metaphor for memory’s fossil trace. The final image of the weaver calcifying her own silence reweights all prior salvations as recursive self-application, avoiding moral sermon. Ambiguity lingers: is she heroine or self-imposed caretaker of endless sorrow? Complexity is honored, not tidied.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person intimate maintains consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature is saturated with metallurgical and textile diction—“tessellating lattices,” “copper halos,” “recursive braids”—that feels native to a fractal artisan. Syntax modulates: long spiraling sentences mirror weave patterns, then collapse into staccato “She didn’t smile.” No head-hopping; visitor’s panic is filtered through her auditory gaze. Filter verbs are minimal and motive-driven. Register never drifts into academic self-explanation; the diction stays within a mystic craft-worker’s ken.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm is deliberate: clause-rich braids under low-tempo chill, then tighter fragments at lamp flare. Information density high—“kerosene lamp burner, unlit but warm to the touch, its brass rim humming faintly with residual heat from the last soul it had helped calcify” packs object history, temperature, and moral cost into one stroke. No synonym churn or mixed metaphors; vehicles stay coherent to geology/textile lexicon. A single scaffold trace—“the lamp’s glow fading like a whale sinking into midnight depths”—is earned by prior whalebone motif, not decorative. Sentence openers vary; no template cadence detected.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The grief-geometry conceit—sorrow as crystalline fractal—feels fresh yet inevitable, marrying mathematics with ritual craft. Transformation test fails if swapped to generic mage; the weave-and-calcify mechanic is inseparable from the protagonist’s artisan identity. Risk is taken: a quiet service scene substitutes for conventional climax, yet pressure is maintained through accumulative density. No echo of famous lines; “whalebone reverie” coinage is specific and haunting. Concept fully committed: every detail (oxidized bronze, shingled hush) serves the crystallization rule-set.</comment>
