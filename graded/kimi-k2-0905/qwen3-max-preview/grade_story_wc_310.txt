<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is rich and embodied—molars, throat, knees—showing surrender-as-method without label-speak. The final refusal to draw lots crystallizes a credible shift from entropy-obedience to self-authored purpose, cost legible in the drachma pressed to skin. Micro-choices (spinning, scattering, pressing coins) trace a hierarchy of values under stellar doubt. Slight emotional plateau mid-vision keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the coin-toss celebrates a path already chosen, reweighting every prior surrender. Accumulative lens holds—each coin, static burst, and backwards prophecy thickens the pattern until the final cadence shifts from randomness to resonance. Persistent constraint: the dying amber star remains, ensuring cost survives the epiphany. No causal breaks or orientation drift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Observatory deck functions as micro-setting: cracked glass under knees, honeyed light on metal—details filter through POV’s tide-breath attention. The drachma’s cold edge constrains the final decision, charging the last image. Spatial choreography stays clean as she rises, walks, tosses. One stray adjective (“impossible moment”) barely blurs the lens.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether to keep surrendering to lots or reclaim agency—tightens when un-asked static delivers the child-vision, forcing stance crystallization. Escalation is textural: density of coin-memories and backwards prophecies increases until refusal becomes the only non-repetitive move. Cost is the forever-loss of certainty, paid in the final coin-arcing toss. No reversal beyond the single required shift.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges as resonance > randomness, distilled through tactile relics rather than stated. Final line’s “echo that outlasts the song” reweights every prior surrender without moralizing. Ambiguity survives: child-laughter in vacuum stays unexplained, inviting counter-readings. One near-theme-echo (“You’re not waiting for meaning. You’re distilling it.”) is earned by vision-shock.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Voice carries a cosmological monk cadence—measured, bone-listening, yet precise (“static burst like a bell forged in zero gravity”). Perceptual signature is star-dusted, tide-breath, neutron-star steady—consistent under pressure. No dialogue to distort cadence. One clause (“fiercely alive”) momentarily over-declares, but recovers in the same breath.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Sentences vary from long honeyed pulls to short neutron pulses, mirroring breath under stellar doubt. Figurative layer is dense yet purposeful—each metaphor (sugar in hot tea, dying pulsar) pays into the resonance bank. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; no mixed metaphors. Proofing clean, pronouns anchored.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Collapse-era coin-divination plus backwards prophecy synthesizes fresh mythic physics without exposition dumps. Risk: surrendering plot to lyric stasis succeeds because the final toss reconfigures agency. Child-laughter in vacuum feels inevitable yet unrepeatable. Derivative guardrail waived—specificity of breath-time currencies transforms trope.</comment>
