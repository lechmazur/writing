<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interiority is rich—“infinity pendant cold against her collarbone” anchors contradictory impulses (fear/exhilaration) in scene. Micro-choices (borrowing seconds from her own pulse, sketching the pre-song bird) visibly cost fatigue and foreclose retreat. Flaw: she never misjudges; every gamble pays off, softening the arc. Still, the renunciation of safety at the end is legible and earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the city wakes to live birdsong—conceptual cost is the giant’s dream-time permanently thinned. Causal chain holds: over-borrow → chime-risk → sculpt time → release echoes. One seam only: “cadence interrupted again” restates rather than advances. Orientation anchor (rooftop canals) arrives by line 6, well inside waiver window.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Canals-of-resonance, moss-slick stone, and embryo-silence chamber are tactile and bias-filtered through the illustrator’s acoustic gaze. Micro-setting (pendant, sketchbook) directly enables the climax; environment dictates tactics—sound channels, not water, guide every move. Spatial choreography stays clean across spiral aqueduct and collapsed bridge. One over-adjective moment—“iridescent throats”—but image still serves POV priority.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—keep echoes from vanishing—signals in para 1 and tightens when the giant’s breathing hitches. Agency drives escalation: each borrowed second visibly drains her, narrows options, and cumulates toward the final uncaging. Cost is legible on-page: pendant sears, knees buckle, city clock hands droop. Could use one more material loss (tool cracks?) to hit 8.8+ band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges without sermon: memory is not stored but midwifed—truth gestates before it is heard. Final image of children humming museum murals re-prices her earlier “illustrations as records” premise into “illustrations as seeds.” Subtext stays in gesture: she closes the book rather than claim victory. No tidy moral; ambiguity lingers—will the giant wake angry tomorrow?</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is distilled, synesthetic, pressure-calibrated: “echoes pooled like mercury” under stress; syntax shortens to fragments during chime crisis. Perceptual signature—sound as texture, time as clay—remains consistent and character-bound. No dialogue, so naturalism clause waived. One lyrical compression loop (“she pressed on, past…” x3) but works as incantatory cadence mirroring canal rhythm.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>High information density: “uncaging moments—not freeing them, but releasing them from stasis” performs three jobs (define verb, foreshadow cost, sculpt metaphor). No mixed metaphors; mercury image stays coherent inside acoustic logic. Rhythm breathes—long sentence for giant exhale, then staccato “It worked.” Proofreading clean; only nit is hyphen inconsistency in “saber-toothed.”</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Premise—sound gestates in rooftop canals while a napping giant suspends time—feels inevitable, not gimmicky. Fresh synthesis: dodos re-engineered from pre-echo vibrations flips standard extinction trope. Risk in second-person ambient address (“you” = reader) is avoided; POV stays disciplined. Transformation test fails if relocated: canals-as-wombs and borrowed-heartbeat magic are inseparable from this city.</comment>
