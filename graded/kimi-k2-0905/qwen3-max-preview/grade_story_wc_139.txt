<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is character-specific, but the “con’s conscience” self-label at climax nudges diagnostic-speak, capping just below 9-band. Contradictory wants (inherit grift vs fair-trade math) drive every beat; embodied emotion in the prep-room cold is sharp. Micro-choices (timing mortician steps, uncapping ink) scale stakes and foreclose paths with visible cost. The ending renunciation—walking out uncharged yet burdened—lands as earned stasis.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure unit is a resonant reconfiguration: ink rewrites contracts, child forfeits revenge for participatory justice, cost felt in dawn-exit image. Accumulative lens holds: each new signature deepens texture and reweights fairness. Orientation clear by line 3; no lens ambiguity. “Nothing and everything” line crystallizes price under final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Ink pot functions as micro-setting: its presence governs access, timing, moral temperature. Stainless steel tray, formaldehyde chill constrain child’s patience; cracked porcelain body mirrors their cracked allegiance. Final image of half-empty pot under lock yet unlocked door charges closure with conceptual cost. Sensory hierarchy obeys POV—midnight fluorescents, burnt-ozone scent—never stalls momentum.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—fair-trade math vs inherited grift—tightens when ink dissolves diplomat contract; each subsequent signature narrows child’s retreat to vengeance. Agency is attention & invitation, not violence; price is half the ink and the father’s future exposure. Escalation is textural density: more names, more light under door, more risk of discovery. Cost legible in dawn exit: child carries reckoning, not money.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from ink’s rewrites rather than thesis: equity over equality, participation over profit. Final image of unlocked door with pot inside reconfigures fairness as shared vulnerability. No moralizing—wisdom earned through tactile scenes of scalpel rearrangement and weeping recognition. Resonance lingers in quiet word-of-mouth spread, not slogans.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person close stays tight to child’s perceptual filter: “mathematics of fair trade” is their idiom, not authorial banner. Sentence rhythm accelerates with scalpel-taps, slows with ink flow, matching emotional tempi. No head-hopping; mortician’s dialogue is external, interpreted through child’s guarded stance. Distinctive diction—“deathly vitality,” “liquefied dogma”—taught early and paid off in closure glow.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High-density lines: stainless tray/embodied chill/ink obsidian triple duty—setting, character, theme. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence adds pressure or sensory charge. Metaphors stay coherent (ink as tea-dissolving sugar) and physically grounded. Final paragraph cadence slows to match exhalation of new covenant—no figurative muddle under peak image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fairness-as-liquefaction concept is fresh; grafting it onto funeral prep room and grifter heir risks gimmick yet feels inevitable. Ink pot repurposed from curio to moral instrument, not MacGuffin. “Waiting actively” reframes passivity as tactical mathematics—non-obvious stance crystallized in closure. Specific detail (midnight fluorescents, burnt ozone) prevents abstract drift.</comment>
