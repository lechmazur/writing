<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The scatterer’s mask-as-identity and refusal to remove it crystallize a credible, costly stance; the embodied ritual (bare feet, ash scattering) shows contradictory impulses—preservation vs. exposure—yet the interiority drifts into abstract self-diagnosis (“the mirage of safety”) that blunts contradiction at the peak beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the still rocker holds the cost of motion foregone, ash now irretrievably fused to portrait; the Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each ash drift and stilling creak tightens the stake of witness vs. erasure—no causal ambiguity at exit.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Gallery’s creaking floorboards, velvet pouch, and grandfather rocker function as micro-setting that constrains her barefoot ritual and times the final stillness; ash settling “like snowfall” recharges the dim room with tactile specificity, anchoring the closing image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—crystallize emotion before it vanishes—tightens once: the rocker stops, she scatters the last ash, foreclosing further delay; cost is legible (ashes gone, chair motionless), though escalation is single-note, not multi-turn.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of “honoring absence” emerges through ash-to-canvas transference and the unmoving rocker; no moralizing—final candle shimmer reweights the premise: stillness is not safety but sacred witness, leaving resonant ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lyric third-person hovers at psychic edge—porcelain mask “catches dim light like frozen screams”—syntax lengthens then snaps short under hush; no head-hop, perceptual signature remains consistent, rhythm modulates with ritual breath.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Read-aloud cadence breathes—varied sentence lengths mirror rocking motion; only minor scaffold (“she does not… she does not…”) but it pattern-teaches refusal; no mixed metaphors, high density, zero loops in closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Emotion-to-ash conservation ritual feels fresh; porcelain-mask-from-mother’s-teacups transforms domestic fracture into sacred tool, synthesizing grief and archive without gimmick; risk stays coherent, not ornamental.</comment>
