<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The insurgent grandmother’s interiority is concrete and embodied—steam curling around her knuckles, vines brushing her wrists—showing a hierarchy of values (memory over violence, evolution over dogma). Her micro-choice to offer the seed “Choose” crystallizes her stance and forecloses control, earning the cost of relinquished authority. Occasional diagnostic phrasing—“implanted destiny: a map of who they were meant to become”—leans toward abstraction, preventing a clean 9.0.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the amber dissolves into mist that seeds the land, reweighting destiny from singular artifact to distributed possibility. Causal linkage holds—glyph → chant → dissolution—each step narrows her option to possess, forcing renunciation with visible cost (her satchel now empty, joints creaking). The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; density increases until the final image crystallizes new meaning. No orientation or lens-ambiguity penalties apply.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Volcanic hot springs act as micro-setting that supplies both hazard (steam, sulfurous vents) and resource (the obsidian slab warmed for amber). Vines and obsidian constrain her choreography and choice temperature—amber must be placed on warm stone, not cold ground. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven: she notices scent, heat, and plant-whispers before visual breadth. Setting charges the final image: the springs bubble clearer, registering the seeding’s success.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—tradition must evolve or die—tightens when the Council-sealed embryo becomes the last live option. One meaningful deepening: the chant shifts from old liturgy to root-language, narrowing her path from decoder to midwife. Cost is felt on-page: she relinquishes sole custody of destiny, accepting joint authorship with the land. Agency remains hers; coincidence is absent.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme—destiny unchosen is no destiny—emerges through the dissolve-and-seed image rather than assertion. The embryo’s repricing from sacred relic to ambient potential reconfigures “implanted” into “invited,” a conceptual cost that lingers. No final-paragraph moralizing; the smile and creaking joints carry the aftereffect. Specificity of plant-script and obsidian keeps the insight anchored in lived particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Voice is lyric-accumulative with patterned plant-whispers and glyph-sighs taught early and maintained. Syntax flexes to breath-length under ritual pressure: “Not gold, not fire, but the deep green...” Short fragments mimic chant cadence without obscuring causality. No dialogue, so no voice convergence risk. Perceptual signature—selective attention to scent, heat, vegetal thought—remains consistently hers.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>High information density: sentences carry triple duty—image, metaphor, and causality (e.g., “amber glowed...not gold, not fire, but the deep green...”). Rhythm modulates from languid reflection to staccato chant without template cadence. One mixed metaphor—“teardrop of fossilized resin cradling something that pulsed...with potential”—is earned by context. No loops, scaffold, or register drift; closure image stays lucid.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Familiar trope—chosen seed, insurgent elder—is twisted by making destiny aerosolized rather than possessed. Plant-telepathy arises from accidental fever, not gift, grounding the fantastical in bodily contingency. Synthesis of glyph, kite-tail, and volcanic biome feels singular; removal would collapse the chant mechanics. Risk taken: lyric dissolution instead of explosion, paid off by clearer springs and creaking joints as cost.</comment>
