<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The revolutionary’s ache is palpable in every fingertip on the shard; his shift from agitator to mourner to translator is embodied, not declared. Interior contradiction—yearning for utopia while weaponizing nostalgia—drives every micro-choice, including the decision to veil mirrors. The cost is legible: he forfeits the heroic narrative he once lived by and accepts perpetual exile in negative space. Only the late entry of Dr. Voss prevents a 9+; her presence dilutes the crucible pressure that had been laser-focused on him.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the shard’s final haiku reweights revolution itself from seizure to listening. Causality holds—storm → veil mirrors → glyphs stabilize → poems emerge → stance flips—each step narrowing options until silence becomes wealth. The velvet drapes convert reflective time-echoes into readable past, a causal lever that pays off in the closing line. Cost is undeniable: he embraces irrelevance as the necessary price for translation, rendering the old victory meaningless.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The asteroid’s baroque ruin is not backdrop but instrument: low gravity lets dust motes swirl like slow scripture, the gilded balcony becomes a pulpit for dawn, and fossilized starlight in the marble literalizes “burnished sorrow.” The shard functions as micro-setting—its refracted glyphs map directly onto the ceiling, constraining decoding tactics. Chrono-ribbons outside serve as both clock and weather, bending perception so that covering mirrors is materially necessary, not symbolic. Spatial choreography stays clean as the two bodies orbit the shard beneath the ceiling screen.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recovering a lost grammar of equality—tightens when the shard proves illegible until mirrors are veiled, turning superstition into tactical necessity. Escalation is Accumulative: each stanza on silk raises the cost of failure while shrinking the revolutionary’s public identity to “romantic relic.” The final tightening forces him to trade legacy for listening, a renunciation that forecloses any return to heroic narrative. Price is visible: the last haiku relinquishes authorship to the reader—“We are the answer”—rendering his past victories inert.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges from negative space itself: silence, erasure, and the refusal to reflect become the only viable utopia. The shard’s ghost-letters carry a pre-greed syntax, but the story resists nostalgia by making translation an act of mourning, not restoration. Final image reweights prior material—unfinished songs as wealth—without moralizing. Complexity holds: the revolution was neither wrong nor right; it was simply speaking the wrong language.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person lyric narrator maintains consistent psychic distance, filtering cosmic spectacle through a poet-revolutionary’s sensory lexicon—“rosary of regrets,” “widowed chrono-winds.” Perceptual signature is sharp: he sees time as visible syntax, hears silence as currency, smells marble dust as history. Diction stays within his diction—no academic leakage when “haiku scrawled on silk” suffices. Rhythm swells and ebbs with storm pressure, sentence fragments mirroring glyph flickers without ever breaking causality.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose carries oral music—internal rhyme (“shard/rosary”), assonant storms—without purple inflation. Every sentence performs double duty: “fossilized starlight” fuses geology and elegy; “velvet drapes stitched from comet-tail silk” layers texture, class, and science-fantasy in five words. No scaffold loops; each image appears once, then evolves—mirrors, glyphs, haiku—building pattern rather than repetition. Opening and closing haiku act as hinge and lock, turning lyrical compression into structural necessity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: time-streams as weather, archaeology as revolution, mirror-covering as anti-reflective historiography—none feel grafted; each grows from the shard’s refractive logic. Risk of sentimental relic-worship is neutralized by making the past illegible without active silencing of the present. The utopia discovered is procedural, not nostalgic: shared silence, unfinished songs. Transformation test passed—swap any element and the whole lattice collapses.</comment>
