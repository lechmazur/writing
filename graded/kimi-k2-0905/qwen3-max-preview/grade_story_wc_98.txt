<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Aris’s interior contradiction—“doubt is the lantern”—carries through beat to beat; his tremor at misinterpretation is embodied, not declared. The seed-handling, chant, and stylus tracing are micro-choices that reveal his hierarchy: memory > ego. Closure shows earned endurance: he gives the last seed away, foreclosing any redo, with the cost visible in “small and weary.” Missing 9-band because Elira stays off-page, so relationship crucible and status shift cannot test him.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as resonant reconfiguration: the fractal ridge hovers, autonomous archive created, monsoon now answerable to dream-fed memory. Causal linkage holds—because Aris plants the seed after interpreting Elira’s dream, therefore the archive awakens—yet the price (loss of the last seed) is stated more than felt. Single-scene orientation is clear by line 6; no debt applied. Lens ambiguity cap not triggered; Accumulative/Textural drive inferred and held.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dew-laced grass, translucent glyph-vines, and salt-bread scent are filtered through Aris’s verifier gaze, each detail doing double duty: world-building + stakes. The ridge itself constrains the ritual space and finally replicates, charging the closure image. Micro-setting (seed, stylus, petals) guides every tactile action. No environment slack; even the twin moons tilt the flowers toward memory, tightening the magical rules.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—protect cultural memory from monsoon erosion—is signaled early and tightens when the ridge blooms early, accelerating the clock. One meaningful deepening: tremor shifts risk from abstract forgetting to immediate, irreversible mis-interpretation. Agency is Aris’s decision to plant the last seed after voiced doubt; option to wait or test further is foreclosed. Cost is legible (seed gone, no control group), though emotional sting could be sharper on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through specific particulars: dream-verification glyphs, salt-bread memory, mentor’s voice. Final image crystallizes the tension—memory insists on itself even under flood—without sermon. Ambiguity is productive: maybe the ridge remembers wrong, maybe longing = truth. No thematic echo or final-paragraph thesis stated; resonance is earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Aris; perceptual signature—“empirically whimsical,” “star-drunk skies”—carries his verifier lexicon without spillage. Rhythm modulates: long, liquid sentences build ritual cadence, then fragment at tremor. No filter-verb stacks; “he felt” is avoided in favor of sensory immediacy. Distinct texture sustained under pressure; 9 withheld only because no dialogue tests voice distinction.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentence openings rotate, no template cadence. Figurative language is patterned (opal petals, firefly glyphs) and paid off in the luminous fractal ridge. One paraphrase loop—“verified,” “consistent,” “contextually anchored”—is intentionally ritualistic, not sloppy scaffold. No mixed metaphors or register drift; clarity stays intact through peak beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fantasy of “dream-verified collective memory” feels fresh, anchored in ethnographic specificity (tide-witches, salt-bread, Wakening Dirge). Stakes invert standard apocalypse: not saving lives but saving lullabies. Fractal-archive closure grows inevitably from established magic rules. Risk-taking (no villain, no physical fight) heightens meaning without gimmick; could edge 9+ with one more irreplicable cultural detail.</comment>
