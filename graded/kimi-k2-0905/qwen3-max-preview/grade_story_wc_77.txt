<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid (“the gurgle of drowning…”) and the final extraction of memories is embodied, but the protagonist’s contradictory impulses are told rather than dramatized in-scene; the advisor’s opaque motives weaken relational pressure. The earned stasis lands, yet the cost feels symbolic rather than tactile because the “photographically cursed” trait is never allowed to block or enable a concrete choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure is a sharp Resonant Reconfiguration: the mirrored-self Fear dissolves when shown its own image, a Conceptual Repricing that reweights the rule-set. Causal lens holds: because the protagonist extracts and displays the toxic memories, Fear collapses. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 5; no penalty. Persistent constraint—the clasp’s pulse—shapes pacing. Cost is felt in the final stillness, though slightly abstract.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Funhouse compresses into micro-setting: cracked mirrors breathe, floorboard snaps like femur—details constrain movement and camera angles of dread. Recurring object, the clasp, is handled in at least two beats (pulse-throb vs. final cool), charging the closure. Sensory hierarchy narrows to visual/tactile under crisis. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible positions. Environment evolves: walls exhale, calliope reverses, then permanent stillness—change is causal, not decorative.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“trick fear into revealing its weakness”—is signaled early. One meaningful tightening: when the dream-dictionary paradox is read aloud, the funhouse groans, mirrors shatter, options narrow to confrontation. Escalation is Accumulative/Textural: density of cursed reflections increases until the protagonist must externalize the dread. Cost is legible but conceptual rather than visceral; no tangible loss (blood, time, tool) is forfeited, keeping it below 8.0.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges without moralizing: fear as collaborator, not enemy. Subtext lives in gesture—opera cloak clasp cools, funhouse exhales—rather than exposition. Final image (“finally awake”) offers Charged Poise that reweights prior motifs. Avoids tidy moral; ambiguity lingers. Paradoxical notes risk thematic echo but are buffered by scene pressure; no final-paragraph sermon.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>First-person voice carries a consistent perceptual signature: grease-on-glass afterimages, molars-ache vibration. Syntax stretches into lyrical compression (“letters melting like candle wax”) yet stays legible. No head-hopping; POV distance stable. Register stays within a near-death, hallucinatory lexicon—“retinal burn,” “iodine on skin”—without academic drift. Rhythm modulates: long breathless clauses under pressure, short kennings at closure. Dialogue absent by design; no penalty.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>High figurative density in every sentence; pattern is taught early and coherent, but in the climax (“pixel by pixel, melting into the funhouse floor like sugar in rain”) two mixed metaphors (pixel + sugar) create micro-logic clash. Paraphrase loops absent; no scaffold. Information density strong: one sentence often shows setting + metaphor + emotion. Filter verbs minimal. Final line lands cleanly, but figurative overload earlier keeps it below 8.0.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: carnival + resuscitation trauma + reverse lullaby. “Lingering luminance” as after-image of terror is non-obvious and internally consistent. Mirrors reflecting only dread-moments reframe familiar haunted-mirror trope through photographic curse. Concept commits fully—no safety-hedging. Risk-taking (lyric compression, paradoxical grammar) heightens meaning without obscuring closure. Could swap names/places but core metaphor would survive; hence not 9.0.</comment>
