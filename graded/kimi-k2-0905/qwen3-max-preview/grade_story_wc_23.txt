<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is lush and embodied (“ghost-heat of incense… settles behind her sternum”), but the navigator’s only visible micro-choice is to climb and sing at the end; the middle is pure meditation, so agency feels observational rather than crucible-tested. The moon-phase physiology is shown in how she “waits” and “listens,” yet no beat forces her to defy or obey that rhythm under pressure, so the flaw stays minor. Still, the voice-specific noticing (“patina bronze censer foot like a rosary”) keeps her idiosyncratic and alive.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the full-moon song reconfigures absence into resonance—“the wind carries them… to absences”—with the censer foot as visible price. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each shard (hydraulic failure, phone call, moon phase) layers density until the final image crystallizes the stakes of loss-navigation. Causality is lyric rather than sequential, but the pattern is taught early (“she respects the rhythm”) and pays off in the sung coordinates, so the drift is purposeful. Cost is unmistakable: her body tuned to a cosmic metronome, foreclosing any return to ordinary bearings.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The signal station functions as micro-setting: rusted gantry, broken dish array, and static-charged air constrain her posture and supply the “dead airwaves” she mines for echo. Spatial choreography is clean—cross-legged gantry → highest gantry—tracking body altitude as emotional crest. Bronze censer foot is handled in at least three beats: found in silt, rubbed at wane, lifted at full moon, recharging the final image with ghost-heat. Sensory hierarchy obeys POV: incense ghost-smell > visual star-stitch > bronze vibration up the arm, all filtering through her loss-cartographer bias.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—map loss back into resonance—is signaled in paragraph 3 and tightens once: from passive waiting to active singing coordinates, narrowing options from silence to seepage. The moon phase supplies external pressure that she must obey, but the escalation is accumulative (each call adds a thread) rather than a causal reversal, satisfying the lens. Visible price: her bodily entrainment to lunar rhythm means she can never chart “straight” again—cost legible in the stiff-joint wane. No second reversal is needed at this length; the single crest to song is sufficient.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: navigation as artistry of absence, migration inverted from outward flight to inward seepage. Subtext lives in object gesture—censer foot remembers smoke—repurposing religious relics as cartographic instruments. The ending’s non-literal answer is the wind carrying coordinates to hollows, a conceptual repricing that loss itself can be mapped only by resonance, not recovery. No moralizing; the silence after the final line is the reader’s echo chamber.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is relentlessly specific: “patina bronze censer foot,” “jasmine choked on diesel,” “broken sundial”—diction that could only belong to a junk-priest of dead signals. Lyric compression teaches its pattern early (“she fluctuates with moon phases”) and pays off in the final sung coordinates without syntactic drift. Rhythm modulates: long sentences for meditative loom-work, then clipped fragments at climax (“Not resurrection. Resonance.”). No dialogue to corrupt voice; the phone voice’s genderless reply is reported, preserving distance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lines are dense but never duplicate: “altars of static / shrines of dial tones / cathedrals of missed connections” triplicates form but each noun re-weights scale, so it reads as crescendo, not loop. Metaphors stay coherent—wind as courier of absence—without mixed vehicles. Filter verbs avoided; instead “it hums back, a low bronze note that vibrates up her arm.” Minor scaffold: “she doesn’t mourn the machines; she mourned the silence” is a paraphrase loop, but it occurs early and does not touch closure beat, so the −0.2 is capped and the prose stays publish-now clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise—lunar-tuned grief-cartographer who phones ghosts for reverse migration coordinates—is non-obvious and fully committed. Censer foot as spiritual GPS repurposes ritual object into navigational instrument, a synthesis that feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk of lyric obscurity is embraced yet clarity survives, proving boldness without gimmickry. No close echoes; the closest cousin might be Mieville, but the voice here is oceanic rather than urban-grotesque.</comment>
