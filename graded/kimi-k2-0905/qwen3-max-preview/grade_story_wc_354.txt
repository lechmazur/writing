<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The exile-tutor’s interiority is textured and embodied; the thumb-pressed stone, twilight breath, and pulse-synced dent give us contradiction-in-action. Motive arc—from court banishment to covenant re-ignition—stays legible, but the climactic “correlate” moment is more declared than dramatized; we feel resonance, not wrench. Earned stasis still lands because the pocketed stone forecloses return.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: lyrical recursions (twilight, dent, hum) tighten affect rather than causal chain. Closure is a Charged Poise: the nexus flares, covenant wakes, tutor turns away—cost is conceptual but undeniable. Orientation anchor arrives ~80 words—safe. Minor slip: “correlate” mechanics are asserted not shown, softening the final reconfiguration a hair beneath 9-band.</comment>

<comment>Magnetic nexus is more atmospherics than obstacle; it hums but never repels or attracts the tutor’s body meaningfully. Twilight palette and auroral stitching are vivid, selective, POV-filtered. Object-as-setting (basalt dent) earns the micro-setting gate: it constrains meditation tempo and recurs charged at exit. Misses 9-band because environment never threatens or enables a visible tactical shift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: rekindle covenant via self-alignment; pressure escalates through auroral density and magnetic hum. No external antagonist; tension is contemplative. Escalation is accretive—each sensory layer deepens inward stakes rather than narrows external options. Cost is felt as melancholic lightness, visible but not viscerally priced; lacks a concrete forfeiture that would push higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme—beauty through estrangement—emerges from iterative images (dent, twilight, silence) rather than thesis. Final image of man carrying resonance reframes exile as circuitry, reweighting prior material without moralizing. Subtext in magnetic hum = unheard music of outcasts; silence translation = epistemic humility. Ambiguity lingers: covenant’s awakening may yet fail, keeping complexity alive.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person intimate maintains steady psychic distance; diction (“correlate,” “vectors,” “polarities”) stays within tutor’s cerebral lexicon. Rhythm modulates: long lyrical clauses mirror magnetic swell, then tighten to single-line staccato at eclipse. No dialogue, so voice purity uncontested. Minor register swell in “conceptual repricing” phrase nudges beneath 9.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm breathes with scene pulse; no template cadence or synonym loops detected. Metaphors stay coherent (field as board, silence as geometry). One mixed image—“twilight painting the sky in bruised violets”—edges purple but fits POV. Information density high; each line layers sensory, emotional, thematic labor. No artifact obscures closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: chess strategy as metaphysical instrument for cosmic covenant re-tuning. Exile-as-magnetic-inductor is non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Risk: lyric montage over causal scene could have collapsed into abstraction, but accrual pattern pays off in final image. Particularized detail (thumb-dent metronome, auroral stitching) prevents generic uplift.</comment>
