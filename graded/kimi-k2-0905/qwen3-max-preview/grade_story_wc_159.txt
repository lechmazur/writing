<comment>The caretaker’s interiority is consistently concrete—her fingers brushing dew, the chime cradled “like a sleeping bird.” Her contradictory impulse—longing to summon yet refusing to resurrect—remains active in-scene, crystallizing in the final whisper of “Veyra-of-the-Unfinished-Song.” The renunciation is earned: she forecloses resurrection to keep the architecture of remembrance intact, and the cost is felt in the fading foxglove light. Voice stays particular to her sensibility; no diagnostic self-labeling.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the caretaker’s whisper reconfigures the stake—emptiness gardened, not filled. Cost is legible in the dissipating aurora and her quiet smile of “vow kept, not joy.” The accumulative lens holds: each tilt of the cracked chime layers density until the final cadence reweights the rule-set. Orientation is anchored by line 3 (“opal library above clouds”); no ambiguity at end.</comment>

<comment>The cracked bamboo tube functions as micro-setting: its fracture dictates how wind enters and thus how names are spoken. Spatial choreography is clean—descent of mist-stair, skylight of spider-silk, vacant reading nook—each detail constrains where she can stand and listen. Sensory economy favors sound and light over visual catalog. The “foxglove regret-hued” aurora charges the final image, tying environment to emotional cost.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—preserve by abstaining from resurrection—tightens once: the caretaker’s refusal to shout louder even as the light fades. Agency is her micro-choice to whisper, not shout; the price is the ephemeral violet glow that immediately vanishes. Under the accumulative lens, the deepening is the incremental dimming of each aurora, reweighting the cost of preservation. No coincidence; pressure coheres.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the paradox of preservation-through-absence; no character articulates a thesis. The cracked chime as “mouth for ghosts to breathe through” reappears with shifted meaning—now a covenant, not damage. The final image of dawn “blushing the cloud-floor rose-gold” offers non-literal resonance: abstinence itself is the act of love. No moralizing; complexity lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric-accumulative with controlled syntactic elongation—“rhythm older than the clouds beneath her feet”—mirroring the caretaker’s ceremonial pace. Diction stays within her sensibility: “foxglove regret,” “star-charts into tapestries.” No head-hopping; perceptual signature remains her listening bias. Rhythmic crests align with chime tremors, then exhale into shorter cadence at dawn.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>High information density: “grief bound in vellum, joy pressed between glass” compresses museum rules into one line. No synonym loops; metaphors stay coherent—“slow tides of mercury” sustains cloud imagery. Filter verbs are voice-motivated (“she believed her”). Final paragraph propels with clause variation and clean sequence. Minor elevated register (“opal,” “auroral”) fits the lyric mode without artifact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The “museum of extinct feelings” premise is fresh; the cracked chime as aperture for absence而非presence invert.expectation. Specificity—Elinor-of-the-Dew, Kaelen-Who-Walked-Backwards—grounds abstraction in named loss. Risk-taking (lyric, no dialogue, no antagonist) heightens coherence rather than gimmickry. Transformation test passes: story collapses without the chime-fracture rule.</comment>
