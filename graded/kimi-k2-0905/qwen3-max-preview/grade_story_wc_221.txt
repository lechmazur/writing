<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The pariah’s interiority is rich and embodied—her breath mists, her fingers trace, her pulse syncs with the compass—contradictory impulses (stay vs. flee, mourning vs. wonder) coexist in-scene. Micro-choices (unclip sketchpad, steady wrist, close book) chart a credible shift from passive witness to active cartographer of distorted time. No secondary character appears, so relationship bullets are waived; the grandmother voice is handled as recalled texture, not dialogue. The final renunciation—choosing to sketch the anomaly—costs her any chance of “normal” return, and that cost is felt.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the violet filament is absorbed into her page, reconfiguring her role from abandoned outlier to conscious witness whose map grants the universe peace. Causality holds throughout—every sketch stroke is a because/therefore response to the stretched sky—and the compass rose’s pulse provides an on-page constraint that shapes her final gesture. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“time dilation observation deck”) and never drifts. The persistent price: she is still alone, still exiled, but now purposefully so.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setting is micro-focused on body, tool, and deck glass—each constrains choice: the chilled glass limits breath, the worn sketchpad limits speed, the deck’s hollow resonance limits hearing. The temporally stretched stars are not backdrop but active antagonist, smearing Orion across minutes she must decide how to capture. Spatial choreography is flawless: she stands, turns, closes the book, and her position relative to the glass remains trackable. The final image—the vanished filament now living inside her sketch—makes the environment charge the closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will she find a reason to stay that justifies exile—is signaled early and tightens when the violet seam appears: sketch it and confirm exile, ignore it and rejoin panicked normals. One meaningful escalation: the anomaly’s first glimpse forces her to decide whether the custom still matters in stopped time. Agency is pure attention and charcoal; the cost is irreversible commitment to anomaly-worship. No external coincidence resolves anything; the filament vanishes only after she witnesses it into her book.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: star-sketching as family ritual becomes a secular sacrament that redeems distortion into meaning. The final image reweights “true north” from ancestral moral to personal compass of curiosity. Subtext operates in silence—the echoed hush of the deck is the world’s paused heartbeat, and her quiet breathing answers it. No moral is stated; the sketchbook closing is the non-literal answer to “what anchors when time breaks?”</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Lyric third-person intimate sustains a consistent perceptual signature: cold glass, gilded petals, violet filament are filtered through her synesthetic bias. Rhythm modulates—long liquid sentences for stretched starlight, staccato “She closed the sketchbook gently” for final cadence. No dialogue, so voice purity remains unbroken. Prose is the character’s mind: “time lingered like a held note” is both physics and emotion without register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence either advances star movement or her hand movement. Figurative language is disciplined—only three metaphors in 700 words, each anchored to physical action (taffy, held note, frozen fire). Information density is high: one sentence can layer chill glass, family memory, and temporal anomaly. Read-aloud ear varies naturally; no template cadence even in the repeat of “sketch” which accrues mantra force rather than monotony.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The “sketch the sky after time collapse” premise is fresh synthesis of hard-SF time dilation with folkloric star-mapping. Risk—quiet lyric witness instead of heroic fix—pays off by making reconciliation internal. No famous scene echoes; the closest DNA is Bradbury star stories, but the compass rose and familial ritual are idiosyncratic additions. Conceptual integrity holds: the story commits fully to stopped-time contemplation rather than last-minute rescue.</comment>
