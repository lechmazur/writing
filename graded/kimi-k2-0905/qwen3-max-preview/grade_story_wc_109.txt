<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The oracle’s quiet, almost passive obsession with absence is made legible through her tactile handling of the booklet and her commitment to mapping silence; the interiority is concrete, not abstract, and the final step into the night shows a credible renunciation with cost. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in scene, so the arc is slightly under-complex for 9+, but the character remains singular and unforgettable.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a lyric Earned Stasis: she finishes the map, tucks the booklet, walks into the dark she has charted—an undeniable conceptual cost under the Accumulative/Textural lens. The ambered hush pattern is taught in the opening paragraph and paid off in the final image; orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive within the first 80 words, so no cap applies.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The ridge fort, salt-stiffened shawl, flaking gold leaf, and storm are not backdrop but tools that constrain gesture and supply the raw material of silence; the final image of faint gold gleaming on stone is charged by prior tactile handling. Micro-setting (booklet as portable terrain) directly shapes the closure, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes are the exhaustion of stars and the completion of an impossible map; pressure deepens as each summarized silence adds weight to the booklet and narrows her future to a single step into darkness. The tightening is accretive rather than causal, but the felt price is legible in the cracked spine and her final vanishing.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: cartography of the unspoken is both futile and redemptive. The closing image of “marbled hush” reweights every prior summary as territory now walkable, offering no moral, only a reconfigured silence that lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Third-person lyric achieves a perceptual signature unique to the oracle—salt, moth-wing pages, honeyed resin breath—without ever slipping POV. Rhythm swells and contracts like tide, taught early and held to the last line; patterned elision (“summarized silence”) is legible and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Almost every sentence carries dual duty (image + motion, sound + memory); no loops, no scaffold, no mixed metaphors. Minor density clot in the lightning-flash / delayed-roar line is forgivable and does not touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Silence-as-topography is a fresh, risk-laden premise; the drowned cartographer, flaking booklet, and ambered hush are conjured rather than checked off. The final walker-in-her-own-map inversion feels inevitable yet uncanny, a synthesis impossible without every prior particular.</comment>
