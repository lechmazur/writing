<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The heiress’s motivation—truth-seeking as civic duty—remains vivid and coherent, anchored by the tactile pen nib and the rooftop stakeout. Interiority is concrete, e.g., “solemn playfulness” that blooms before she weaponizes evidence. Yet her internal contradiction is only implied, not dramatized in-scene; the pen never hesitates, so we see no moment where her drive might falter. The final choice is decisive and costly, but because it is solitary, status/relationship pressure is absent; still, the earned stance is credible for this length.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is clean: the emailed folio creates a Conceptual Repricing that collapses the official lie under its own impossibility, cost legible in the rooftop smoke now stitched to reckoning. Causal lens holds: every step (call → scope → timestamped photo → send) is a because/therefore sequence. The 2:17 a.m. burn-cycle tightens options; no coincidence resolves the conflict. Minor waiver: orientation anchor (who/where) is delayed until after 120 words, but the disorientation is deliberate and repaid by the inverted telescope image at closure, so no penalty applied.</comment>

<comment>Observatory-above-clouds is more than postcard: the grafted spy-scope turns the dome into an urban microscope, directly enabling the evidence grab. Brass railing, iron ribs, timestamped display—each tactile detail is filtered through her grandfather-trained perceptual bias. The pen nib qualifies as micro-setting; its warmth and click against brass constrain her micro-adjustments and later authorizes the Q.E.D. line. Environment charges the final image: smoke threading sky to earth mirrors the telescope’s inverted sightline, reweighting the stake.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—exposing state erasure—tightens once: the rhythmic smoke pattern forces her from passive documentation to active dissemination. Cost is visible: once the folio leaves her hand, her own safety is implicitly forfeit (persistent constraint). Agency is pure protagonist drive; no outside savior. The deepening beat at 2:17 a.m. is causal, not coincidental, and forecloses the option of continued silence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without sermon: “orbits of regret” and “ellipses in official statements” rewire astronomical language into civic critique. Final image—smoke as dark thread—reprises the earlier “elliptical, inevitable” orbit but now re-priced as path rather than prison. Subtext carries in the journalist’s trembling silence and the unsigned ledger equation; no character states the moral. Ambiguity lingers: the city still sleeps, unaware, so the moral cost is felt, not declared.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is singular, poised, and perceptually signature: she reads wind-whispers as “ghosts arguing over celestial charts” and timestamps smoke. Compression is taught early—“proof by contradiction” is defined inside her thought—so later elliptical syntax reads deliberate, not opaque. No dialogue, so no convergence risk; prose rhythm breathes under pressure, e.g., the staccato email list after long serpentine sentences. Register stays within her patrician-auditor lexicon; “bureaucratic fog” and “Q.E.D.” are credible heir-to-publisher diction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry dual duty: the pen nib is simultaneously heirloom, weapon, and metonym for marginal truth. Metaphors are coherent—telescope as urban microscope, smoke as thread—never mixed. No loops or synonym churn; each reprise (“orbit,” “ellipse,” “smoke”) gains new conceptual weight. Peak beat—the one-line Q.E.D.—is lean, letting the timestamped photo carry the visceral punch. Minor register elevation in “conceptual repricing” is voice-motivated and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Premise feels fresh: spy-scope grafted onto antique astronomy to surveil municipal document-burning. The inversion of stargazer into urban microscope is a specific, non-generic synthesis. Risk is taken with second-person plural echo (“Orbits, after all, are not prisons. They are paths.”) yet it lands as Charged Poise rather than gimmick. While “heiress-turned-investigator” is familiar, the astronomical epistemic frame and proof-by-contradiction method transform the trope into memorable stance.</comment>
