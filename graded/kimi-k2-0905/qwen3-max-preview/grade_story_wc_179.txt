<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction is vivid—pacifist who schemes, body as archive—but no second character on page means relationship crucible is NA; the micro-choice to press the broken pin to sternum and accept its silence is embodied and particular. The earned shift from external melody to internal marrow-hum lands with visible cost (she leaves the box behind). Still, the beat sequence is interior-only; a second pressure source could have sharpened the final renunciation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the melody migrates from object to body, foreclosing repair as a path. Causal chain holds—because pin stays broken, therefore she internalises song—cost is legible in the relinquishing gesture on the moss. Lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of dissolving edges + silent song intensifies until meaning re-weights. No orientation debt; anchors (who/where/when) taught by line 3 and evolve with shifting sanctuary.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sanctuary’s flicker between stone, glass, mist is selective, sensory, and directly guides the final choice to walk into dissolving walls. Music box as micro-setting constrains the beat: broken pin silences action, then becomes relic. Environmental mirroring (edges blur as she lets go) charges the closure image without overt symbolism. Meets 9+ gate: environment materially shapes the tactics of release.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—retrieve/release grief via song—tightens when external melody fails, forcing internalisation. One meaningful deepening: sanctuary walls soften to moss, narrowing option to embodied release. Cost is felt (she forfeits the box), though pressure is largely intra-psychic; a second opposing force could have nudged it higher. Agency remains hers throughout; no coincidence resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme—resentment must be re-membered, not argued away—emerges through image of broken pin and final marrow-hum, never stated as thesis. Subtext operates in gesture: placing box on moss = surrender of external crutch. Final reweighting of silence as internal song offers resonant non-literal answer. Avoids sermon; ambiguity (will it work for others?) lingers productively.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lyric third-person intimate sustains perceptual signature: “cellular memory,” “body’s quiet archive.” Rhythm modulates—long breath-like sentences in kneeling beat, shorter fragments at pin epiphany. No head-hopping; POV stable. Patterned elision (“reality shifted”) is taught early and paid off at closure. Distinct diction stays within pacifist-strategist lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentence openings avoid monotony. High density: “resentment, coiled tight for decades, finally unspools” does triple duty (image, backstory, stakes). No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances. One mixed metaphor—“hinge that bent but never snapped” beside “ink bleeding”—but it resolves into coherent physical logic. No artifacts in final third; closure image remains sharp.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fusion of pacifist strategist with body-archive release feels fresh; broken music box as failed technology turned relic is specific. Conceptual shift from repair to internalisation avoids easy magic-fix. Risk-taking in dissolving setting pays off by mirroring internal surrender. Could edge higher if external cultural stakes were hinted, but within 700 words the synthesis is memorable.</comment>
