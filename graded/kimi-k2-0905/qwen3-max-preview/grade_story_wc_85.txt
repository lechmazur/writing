<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The guilt-ridden genealogist is realized through embodied micro-choices—bare feet on cool tile, the vomiting reflex, the final pocketing of the silent watch hand. Interior contradiction pulses: she loathes falsifying bloodlines yet kneels to "weave truth," a believable flip driven by the sacrificial reveal. One flaw: the sacrificial backstory arrives as pure memory-dump rather than forcing a present-tactic change; still, her stunned physicality keeps the arc coherent.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Single-scene causal arc holds: because she forged identities, therefore the shore returns her father's carving; because she activates the watch, therefore she learns the withheld truth and chooses reversal. The driftwood-as-memory-sieve conceit is taught early ("this was how the hush worked") and lands with clear Decisive Change plus visible cost—the carvings dissolve, the watch goes silent, her trade flips. Orientation within 120 words is clean; only a trace of lens drift at midpoint (lyric accumulative) but closure re-centers causal lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Setting is micro-specific: cobalt tiles cool beneath bare skin, watch hand rusted yet ticking, tide that "gnaws" and reclaims. Each object constrains choice—warm carving versus cold tile, salt-slick cradle figure hummed, silent watch becomes ballast. Driftwood sieving mechanics are grounded in sensory choreography rather than symbolism for its own sake. The final blanked shore is causal, not decorative, erasing the evidence even as it frees her.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—"quell the tremor in her ribs" by finding the withheld truth—tightens once when the father-carving surfaces, again when memory floods, forcing a visible pivot in profession. Ticking watch and dissolving carvings externalize cost, satisfying 8.8+ gate. Agency is crystallized in the final interior vow to "become the sieve," a trade-off that forecloses the profitable lie.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of tempered regret emerges from concrete particulars: false family trees, salt-softened driftwood confessions, the watch whose rust turns gold. No moralizing—meaning accrues through the tactile reversal of her trade. Final image of "settled hush" reweights premise without abstraction, achieving conceptual repricing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is lyric-accumulative, taught by opening metaphor ("bruise against the horizon") and maintained through synesthetic ticks—cool tiles, humming wood, ticking rust. Rhythm modulates: longer languid clauses for dusk, staccato fragments under memory assault ("Not abandonment. Sacrifice."). No dialogue to test, yet perceptual signature is sharp and consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative layers serve pressure rather than stall. One minor loop: "salt and bile mingling / salt no longer clung" reprises 'salt' within three sentences without new pressure, costing a hair. Otherwise, strong verbs ("vomited into the surf," "tide tugged") and precise nouns carry double duty.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Sieved-hush memory shore is fresh; genealogy-as-forgery merged with driftwood confessions feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk of magical shoreline could tilt gimmick, but grounding in sensory detail and causal cost keeps it earned. Slight deduction for familiar "father gave me away to save me" reveal; still, the salt-wood mechanic reframes it.</comment>
