<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elira’s interior contradiction—preserver vs. awakened catalyst—drives every beat; the child-prophecy reprise crystallizes her renunciation of passive archiving with a felt cost (she kneels, palms bleeding into moss). The micro-choice to release the first petal is anchored in prior guilt and language-gift, so the turn is earned. Secondary pressure is missing—no live antagonist or relationship crucible—so agency tops out at strong, not exceptional.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Closure is a crisp Conceptual Repricing: the orchard’s hum reweights the city’s emotional economy, cost visible in Elira’s trembling palms and the businessman’s unforced smile. Accumulative lens holds—each cylinder, petal, and dead-language whisper layers density until the final frequency flips the stakes. Orientation is clean within 60 words; transitions between 1989 immersion and present are legible without seam. One minor waiver: the “velvet disquiet” tag is named late, but the pattern of soft infiltration is already taught, so no cap.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The orchard-as-micro-setting constrains every tactic: roots threading steel, petals dissolving into subway mist. Sensory hierarchy obeys Elira’s scribe bias—wax scent, copper-lined pouch, Etruscan sibilance—never tourist catalog. Geography stays coherent across elevator descent and street release; weather (smog clearing) mirrors emotional reconfiguration without overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—preserve vs. release emotional memory—tightens when the accidental prophecy redefines her mandate. The meaningful deepening is the orchard’s answering hum: options narrow to “release spores” or let the city stay sterile. Cost is legible in her trembling palms and the irreversible petal dispersal. No external antagonist keeps pressure interior, so escalation peaks at high-band entry, not apex.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from pattern: archived emotion refuses containment; empathy must be re-infected, not stored. The orchard’s final exhale reweights the 1987 giggles from relic to live culture. No moralizing—just the image of a stranger’s smile charging the air. Subtext in Miko’s whispered doubt pays off as city-wide question answered by petal-mist.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Perceptual signature is razor-specific: “static between heartbeats,” “syllables older than cuneiform.” Compression taught early (“dawn hush like dropped stitch”) holds to last line. No head-hopping; POV distance stays tight interior. Filter verbs absent; syntax grows shorter under revelation beat, mirroring cardiac lift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Rhythm modulates—long breathy sentences for orchard ascension, staccato for cylinder click. No loops or synonym churn; “velvet disquiet” appears once, charged by prior tactile cues. Metaphors stay physically coherent (moss-wet stone, copper-thread pouch). One near-artifact: “slow snow” for petals is faint cliché, but immediate dissolve into subway mist rescues freshness.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: phonograph shavings as emotional spores + skyscraper orchard as living archive transforms both eco-SF and memory-trope. Child-self prophecy retroactively weaponizes nostalgia instead of exploiting it. Risk—dead-language incantation—could have slid into gimmick yet pays off when orchard answers in root-hum older than cuneiform. Removal of any core element collapses the concept, proving irreplaceability.</comment>
