<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The portrait artist’s interiority is rich and embodied—her tactile engagement with splinters, thread, and parchment maps her psyche. Contradictory impulses (to repair vs. to descend into fracture) coexist in scene, culminating in the barefoot step that reassembles the box. The final self-portrait inside her eyelids shows earned transformation. Yet the mentor’s vanishing is asserted, not dramatized, so the catalytic grief feels slightly external.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the inverted lighthouse, vertical sea, and reassembled box crystallize a new perceptual rule-set with undeniable cost. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of stitched fragments escalates until reality buckles. Orientation is taught early (“damp stone floor of the forgotten library inside a lighthouse”) and pays off when space itself folds. Causality remains internal but coherent: stitch → resonance → spatial inversion.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The lighthouse-library is tactile: salt-crusted windows, rusted gears, leaning shelves that exhale new books. Micro-setting objects—the needle, the Tower card, the childhood sketch—constrain her stitching choices and charge the final tapestry. Spatial choreography is precise; distances collapse only after the fabric is stepped upon. Environment literally compresses to cocoon her, fulfilling the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: will she surrender to fragmentation or stitch a new coherence? Pressure tightens as each threaded secret screams—pain is the price of coherence. The decisive turn is the barefoot step onto the tapestry, foreclosing retreat; spatial inversion is the visible cost. Agency is accumulative rather than causal, but escalation is legible and irreversible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the material act of stitching loss into new form; no explicit thesis is stated. The final image—crestRISEN self with parchment wings—reweights “fracture” as portal rather than wound. Rhetorical questions remain unanswered, letting silence pool as thematic residue. Complexity is honored: grief is neither cured nor transcended, reconfigured.</question>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is lyric, compressed, and rhythmically controlled: “shelves leaned like drunkards,” “salt-crusted windows admitted only slivers of bruised twilight.” Syntax mirrors perceptual distortion—long cadences stretch, then fracture into fragments. The POV never leaks; perceptual signature is consistent (“light bent around absence”). Elision (“she didn’t flinch”) is taught early and paid off when pain becomes resonance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Almost every sentence carries dual duty: sensory image + conceptual twist (“truth had become a chorus of echoes, none daring to lead”). Metaphors are fresh and internally coherent; only one mixed vehicle (“time pooled like spilled ink and reality's threads snagged on rusted gears”) bumps. No scaffold, loops, or register drift. Final third is artifact-free, allowing 9-band proximity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</question>
<comment>Combines tarot, cosmic-collapse, and lighthouse gothic tropes, but grounds them in tactile stitching praxis. The inversion of sea and staircase feels inevitable because the text has trained us to expect perceptual buckling. Fresh inflection: “crestRISEN” neologism crystallizes transformation without exposition. Risk—lyric density bordering on purple—is justified by closure payoff.</comment>
