<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The adjuster’s vocation—to gentle the end—remains internally coherent and charged; his cracked-porcelain compassion is shown, not labeled. The puppet head functions as an extension of his motive: its cracked cheek mirrors his own scarred palms, making the resonance test personal. No contradictory impulse is dramatized on-page, so the internal conflict is more tableau than crucible, keeping the score just below the 8.8 gate.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the universe is not saved but tucked in, a visible reframing of apocalypse as lullaby. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density increases via nested lullaby patterns until the final hush reweights all stakes. Orientation is taught by line 3 (“hidden lighthouse at dusk”) and pays off when the beacon turns inward; no debt incurred. Cost is unmistakable in the dissolve of glass, stone, sea—matter itself forfeited for tenderness.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The lighthouse beam calibrated inward, the Möbius gear-band, and the puppet’s dangling eye all function as micro-settings that constrain the adjuster’s final twist of the spindle. Salt-worn stone and suspended gulls are filtered through his tactile vocation, not tourist catalog. Spatial choreography is pristine: each gear’s stanza is located in the lantern room, bodies track without drift. The inward-beacon rule is taught early and charges the final image when it dissolves into mist, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—make the end gentle—is signaled in paragraph 4 and tightens through each added lullaby pattern until options collapse into stillness. The protagonist’s agency is the slow turn of the spindle; no outside coincidence intervenes. Cost is rendered in the material dissolve of world into sigh, a felt forfeiture. One meaningful intensification suffices for Accumulative/Textural design; still, the lack of a live option foreclosed mid-scene keeps the score shy of 8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the inversion of apocalypse: annihilation reframed as mercy, articulated through the recurring lullaby image that moves from fetal heartbeat to stellar exhalation. Subtext resides in the cracked puppet—beauty in breakage—returning as witness, not symbol. No moral is stated; the final after-glow of warmth in_void reweights the premise without sermon. The reader is left to feel that tenderness itself is the last physics, an earned complexity rare at this length.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric achieves a singular perceptual signature: temporal friction scarred palms, pane of hush thicker than marrow. Syntax elongates then fragments in mimicry of slowing ticks, teaching the pattern by line 6 and paying off when the final tick occurs “beneath” time. No head-hopping; distance remains steady at elegiac altitude. Register stays within the adjuster’s metaphysical lexicon without drift into academic intrusion.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Every sentence advances image or cadence; no scaffold, loops, or synonym churn detected. Metaphors nest (clockwork stanza, fractal lullaby) but remain coherent under the lullaby conceit. Rhythm modulates from groaning steps to velvet hush, accelerating then suspending breath in sync with cosmic shutdown. The final line hands the reader the “first note after silence,” a closure image whose clarity forbids artifact penalty.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade>
<comment>The doomsday clock is familiar, yet the vocation of gentling entropy via lullaby is a non-obvious synthesis; the cracked puppet as tuning fork for cosmic sleep feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk—lyric apocalypse without violence—pays off by making stillness the stakes. Specificity (Möbius gear etched with lullabies) prevents abstract drift. The concept commits fully: no retreat into traditional bang, only the whispered tucking-in of galaxies.</comment>
