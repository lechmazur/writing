<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The editor’s voice is singular and consistent—ink-stained cuffs, squint, dry quips—and his quiet obsession (“where myth and meltwater converge”) motivates every beat. Interiority is concrete: the calloused finger tracing discrepancies, the tea poured lukewarm, the window fog becoming a map. No contradiction or therapy-speak; flaws (stubbornness, isolation) are dramatized rather than labeled. Cost is felt when he stops editing and starts witnessing; the path is foreclosed, not flagged.</comment>

<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each falcon delivery, each condensation glyph layers density until the delta forms on glass. Closure is Charged Poise—the spiral drawn in melted snow reweights every prior map and costs the editor his detachment. No teleporting props; the phrasebook glow is seeded early. The ending line “quiet bloom of water answering ancient words” crystallizes options without exposition.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Frozen lake, rusted outpost, salt-grimed window all filter through the POV’s cartographer eye—angles, distances, materials matter. Cold groans, brittle air, shattered mirror ice stay consistent and tactile; proximity guides choice (kneeling at the seam, opening atlas on snow). Window-as-divining-rod is micro-setting that charges final image. No anachronisms; spatial choreography clean throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—finding the rivers’ origin—tightens via each falcon fragment and condensation response; options narrow to “witness or keep editing.” Agency remains internal yet active: whispering the seventeenth translation, kneeling, drawing the spiral. Cost is the loss of editorial distance; no coincidence resolves. Escalation is pattern-intensification rather than external reversal, fitting Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from particulars: maps vs. myth, editing vs. witnessing, language vs. terrain—never sermonized. Final spiral answers the opening question obliquely; no moral nailed on. Ambiguity lingers: the falcon “unimpressed” undercuts heroism, leaving the reader to weigh silence against revelation. Emotional aftereffect is hush, not triumph.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>First-person voice is crisp, sardonic, lexically precise—“feathered bureaucrat,” “thermodynamics and tongue”—yet never showy. Perceptual signature is cartographic: angles, tributary glyphs, ley lines. Rhythm breathes with scene—short clauses under starlight, longer ruminative curls inside. No head-hop, no filter-verb clutter; diction stays within lone scholar’s range.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentence variation is musical; no template cadence detected. Metaphors stay consistent (ice as ship, condensation as delta) without mixed logic. High density—“editing out empires to reveal aquifers” does three jobs. Minor scaffold: “quiet bloom / quiet certainty / quiet pact” triplet is deliberate echo rather than churn; it tightens rather than loops, so penalty waived.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: cartography + glossolalia + condensation divination feels inevitable yet unseen before. Risk taken—no villain, no expedition, just a man whispering to frosted glass—pays off in resonant image. Falcon-as-courier, dog-ear-as-compass, atlas-as-witness all arise from lived scholar details, not ornament. Transformation test fails if relocated to generic fantasy; the specificity is the innovation.</comment>
