<comment>Interiority is sensorially acute—thumb on coin “valleys and ridges invisible to sight” reveals contradictory impulse: her deficit is her lens. Endurance closure—she sits beneath painted sky she alone will ever see—pays the cost of irreversible loss. Micro-choice hierarchy (renounce escape to finish ceiling) embodies value system. Flaw (face-blindness) drives every tactic and final renunciation; no competence without struggle.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: dawn whine + closed eyes + smile crystallize options—she has translated cosmos into touch and forfeited external witness. Lens is Accumulative/Textural: each groove-to-star brushstroke intensifies texture until final silence reweights stakes. “She didn’t need witnesses” is the conceptual cost that revalues her life’s work. Persistent constraint—demolition clock—shapes every tactical acceleration; cost is felt in final stillness.</comment>

<comment>Tree-library is not backdrop but crucible: bark shelves, damp wood scent, hydraulic groan outside all constrain pace and supply sensory palette. Micro-setting rule met: copper coin’s indentations function as portable sky-map, directly shaping ceiling brushstrokes. Spatial choreography clean—demolition crews idling beyond moss doors keep external pressure legible. Final image of painted heavens inside hollow trunk recharges every sensory anchor.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—translate sky before obliteration—tightens through audible countdown groans; each brushstroke forecloses alternative escape. Meaningful deepening at midpoint revelation: “limit was not a barrier, but a lens” reweights tactics, accelerates painting. Cost is visible: charcoal-stained palms + irreversible dawn + closed eyes = forfeited survival option. Agency is renunciation/endurance under Accumulative lens; no reliance on coincidence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from reversal: deficit → lens; no explicit thesis, only embodied translation of metal stars to wood cosmos. Subtext in silence—radios crackling, hydraulic whine—speaks louder than any moral. Final smile reconfigures solitude from failure to sovereignty. Conceptual repricing: sky once stamped for trade now reclaimed for private awe; commerce-to-wonder shift is non-literal answer.</comment>

<comment>Voice is tactile synesthetic—syntax mirrors fingertip cartography: “fractally precise gradations,” “ghost-light of dead astronomers.” Rhythm accelerates with brushstrokes, then settles into cross-legged hush; no template cadence. Perceptual signature never drifts—every metaphor filtered through touch > sight. No dialogue, hence no penalty; internal diction remains copper-green, charcoal-thick, star-etched.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Sentence density high—each line performs setting + motion + metaphor: “dawn bled through leaves like watercolor on vellum.” Zero paraphrase loops; no synonym churn. Figurative language is pattern-taught early (“fractally precise”) and paid off in ceiling swirl. Read-aloud ear test passes: varied openings, no drumbeat; final line two-beat silence lands with lip-close consonants.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade>
<comment>Premise—face-blind artist paints sky she can’t see from coin she can feel—is non-obvious synthesis of astronomy, haptics, and imminent loss. Risk of static interior monograph avoided by live demolition clock. Transformation test: swap any detail (coin, tree, blindness) and entire causal chain collapses. Fresh inflection: currency constellations privatized into ephemeral ceiling—commerce-to-wonder inversion feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
