<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority is lush and body-anchored; the contradiction between aromatic caution and the final uncorking crystallizes a credible arc. Micro-choice (switching on UV lamp, pocketing empty vial) visibly reweights her stance; cost is felt. One slip: “grief is not the enemy…” edges toward thesis-speak mid-crescendo. Still, the lanterns’ re-ignition under skin-level luminescence makes the change legible and paid for.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: she steps into dusk as a “compass,” path foreclosed yet luminous. Accumulative lens holds—each sensory layer deepens the stake until UV glyphs externalize memory with undeniable conceptual cost. Orientation clean by line 6; causality intact (because she inhales, glyphs appear; because they fade, she pockets compass). No meaningful leakage.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Greenhouse body-tracks and lantern choreography stay coherent; UV beam carving “twilight” turns air itself into setting that constrains the final revelation. Micro-setting rule satisfied—crystal vial and lamp act as portable “rooms” shaping choice. Sensory hierarchy mirrors perfumer bias: olfactory → visual → haptic. Slight over-milk of “crystal shadows” but cadence justifies repetition.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will she risk uncorking grief?—tightens once via olfactory assault → UV glyph reveal, narrowing options from preservation to propagation. Escalation is textural, not causal-reversal, but still forces stance crystallization. Cost is legible: empty vial + open weeping + lanterns now “charged.” Could wish for one external obstacle; still, internal pressure suffices under 800-word ceiling.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through pattern—scent as synaptic time-travel—never named until after the image does the work. Final line “broker… remembrance” reconfigures her social contract without moralizing. Midnight Heliotrope extinction ties personal loss to planetary erasure, widening resonance. One clause (“she finally knew why…”) flirts with explanation but is earned by preceding sensory avalanche.</answer>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person psychic hover stays tight to broker’s perceptual filter: “aromatically cautious,” UV as industry tool repurposed. Syntax breathes—long aromatic sentences contract into glyph stutters under UV stress. No head-hop; diction stays within perfumer lexicon. Lanterns’ flicker given agency but read as reflected light, not POV breach.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Line-level density excellent: glass/ghost/vanish/vial compression never loops; each phrase layers scent-light-memory. Metaphor vehicles (frozen tears, cathedral, loyal hound) cohere to glass-and-light motif. Rhythm modulates—clause lengthening under perfume rush, fragment sparks under UV. Zero filter-verb stacks; punctuation clean; final image “last crystal shadow trailing” lands without scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Perfumer-broker + extinct-plant greenhouse + UV memory-glyphs is a fresh synthesis; grief-commerce angle reframes typical scent-memory trope. Risk—lyric accumulative structure—heightens rather than obscures stakes. No derivative echoes; specifics (Midnight Heliotrope, lantern blue-shift) resist name-swapping test. Could push further into ecological economics, but within word count the concept feels singular.</comment>
