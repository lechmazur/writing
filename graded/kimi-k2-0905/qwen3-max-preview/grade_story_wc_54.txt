<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elira’s “functionally creative” trait is shown, not told—every micro-choice (cannibalizing conduit, welding scavenged torches) flows from the same internal engine. Interiority stays concrete and character-particular (“mapped stress fractures like poetry”). The final renunciation—she packs the sextant to keep working, not to admire—carries visible cost (no rest, no applause) and is earned by the prior causal chain. Only minor slack: the “equations for hope” verge on label-speak, though the embodied notebook work mostly saves it.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds from first step to final recalibration: each beat = because/therefore (ruptured line → redirection → warm breath → return of locals). Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration: the terminal is not “fixed” but re-cast as living maze; cost is the endless labor Elira embraces by pocketing the sextant again. No orientation debt; who/where/when anchored by line 3. Persistent constraint—entropy itself—shapes every tactic and the final image. Compression is purposeful, not elliptical; transitions are legible under single-scene default.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The sextant-as-micro-setting directly constrains choice (angles of load-bearing ghosts) and charges the final golden mosaic. Environmental details evolve causally: broken skylight → prismatic shards → LED strips powered by footfall. Sensory hierarchy obeys Elira’s engineer gaze—light bent, steam curled, not tourist catalog. Spatial choreography is immaculate; no impossible positions across the multi-level moves. Weather (rain at end) affects choice—she works under patched roof, hears drumming while writing equation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake = “can the terminal breathe again?”—signaled early. One meaningful tightening: thermal whisper forces descent, redirects entire project; live option (seal the leak) is rejected with visible trade-off (endless labor). Cost accumulates under causal lens—every redirection buys warmth but adds maintenance debt. No coincidence; all pressure stems from her探测 decisions. Closure forecloses fantasy of finished restoration; resilience now equals eternal recalibration.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from pattern, not sermon: “hope = redirected flows.” Final image of golden triangles on cracked wall reweights earlier light readings without moralizing. Subtext in gesture: she pockets sextant ≠ trophy but tool for next quadrant. Complexity preserved—terminal still cracked, locals still drifting, no utopia. Resonance lingers in reader’s body as warmth + flicker + footstep spark.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays welded to Elira’s perceptual signature—angles, arcs, equations. Diction remains inside engineer lexicon (“load-bearing ghosts,” “micro-charges”) without academic drift. Rhythm mirrors pace: long cadence during survey, staccato when welding. No head-hop; psychic distance compresses under torch glare. Final line’s quiet recalibration syntax embodies stoic wonder perfectly.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Density high: single sentences weld sensory, technical, and emotional work (“steam curling like breath against cold concrete”). Strong verbs replace modifiers (“cannibalized,” “threaded,” “fractured”). No filter-verb stacks. Opening line anchors voice & stakes; final line resolves by image that recharges sextant-light motif. Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: spaceport ruin + civil engineer + antique sextant = non-obvious. Redirected-entropy-as-method feels inevitable in hindsight yet un-mined in genre. Transformation test fails if names changed—specificity of geothermal steam in derelict spaceport is irreplaceable. Risk of lyric engineering pays off: closure legible, stakes heightened. No template echo or fad reliance.</comment>
