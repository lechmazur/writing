<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The owner’s shift from detached observer to participatory kin is embodied in the trembling hand that lowers the clippers, making the renunciation cost visceral; her contradictory impulses (intellect vs. awe) act simultaneously, not in summary.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the glowing new shoot and dissolved journal reconfigure meaning with undeniable conceptual cost; the Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density of rain, moss, leaf pulses until the cadence shift releases control.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The mossy trellis anchors every micro-choice—kneeling in mud, clippers lowered, palm against new shoot; rain and moonlight evolve causally, forcing posture changes. Minor lapse: “storm season” stays generic, never tightens decisions.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—decode vs. belong—tightens when she lowers clippers, foreclosing dissection; the price is visible: dissolved notes, muddy blouse, synapse-fear. Agency is renunciation under Accumulative lens; one deepening suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the leaf’s wait for her, not thesis: “never broken” lands as image, not moral. The twin-leaf cradle reweights prior pinned specimens with conceptual cost, refusing tidy profundity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Perceptual signature is botanist-poetic: “chlorophyll-green defiance,” “subterranean whisper”; rhythm accelerates with storm then breathes in mud. No dialogue, so no voice leakage; internal register stays consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>High-density lines (“veins glowing gold like liquid circuitry”) advance both image and stakes; no synonym loops. One mixed metaphor—“synapse mid-thought”—minor, doesn’t dull closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: sentient leaf waits for observer to surrender science, reversing anthropocentric plot. Risk of bioluminescence paid off by prior spectral analysis cue; transformation feels inevitable, not gimmicky.</comment>
