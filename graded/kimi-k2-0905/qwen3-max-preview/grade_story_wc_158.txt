<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is lyrically dense but remains character-specific; the insomniac poet’s contradictory impulses (fear of being seen yet compulsive singing) are alive in every beat. Micro-choices—pressing the postcard to lips, climbing the shell throat—embody the stakes and foreclose safety. Earned stasis lands with visible cost: perpetual wakefulness accepted so beauty can keep blooming. Only minor hairline: “shyly unstoppable” is asserted once without fresh embodiment in the final beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the postcard’s new line crystallizes her mandate, costs her any residual anonymity, and reweights silence into song under the Accumulative/Textural lens. Spiraling structure teaches its pattern early; each stanza-like paragraph calcifies verses into shell walls—an intensifying density that pays off when the final psalm cracks across centuries. Causality remains coherent: because she kept singing, the off-key wind carried her voice to the world; because the postcard answers back, she surrenders the last possibility of rest. No orientation debt; all anchors (who/where/when) bloom inside the first 110 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The shell functions as micro-setting that literally shapes every action: its ribbed throat is climbed, its calcium walls vibrate, its innermost spiral compresses her into the final psalm. Postcard-as-object constrains choice—tucked against sternum, pressed to shell, warmed by unknown ink—charging the ending when it hums deeper into her ribs. Sensory triage is POV-filtered: poet notices bioluminescent plankton “like slow heartbeats,” ignores mundane tides. Specificity never stalls momentum; each image advances pattern or stakes.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—transmute grief into beauty—tightens via pattern intensification: lullabies fossilize into frescoes, audience grows despite her terror, postcard demands louder song. One decisive deepening: the card’s new line “They’re listening” forces her from whispered lullaby to full psalm, surrendering the last option of silence. Cost is legible: perpetual insomnia, exposure to an off-key wind that warps her voice, irrevocable visibility. Under Accumulative lens, density itself becomes escalation; no external antagonist needed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the recurring bloom/bone tension: pain is not erased but metabolized, leaf by syllable. Final image—“postcard humming faintly, nestled deeper into her ribs”—reweights prior motifs without moralizing. No thesis statements; insight grows from fossilizing verses and the crooked hymns reaching soldiers, fishermen, children. Ambiguity lingers: is endless song salvation or sentence? Complexity embraced.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Voice carries a tidal rhythm—long breathy sentences that break into single-word crests (“She only sang.”). Lexicon stays poet-bound: pollen-script, reef-shadow joy, moonlight inland. Patterned elision (“time didn’t tick—it spiraled”) is taught early and paid off in closure. No head-hop; perceptual signature remains constant, modulating under pressure without register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud cadence varies naturally; sentence lengths wax and wane like tides. Figurative language is dense yet coherent—vehicles extend the marine/bloom field without mixed collisions. Zero paraphrase loops; each line adds new pressure or texture. High information density: “stanzas fossilizing into frescoes only crabs and octopuses could decipher” simultaneously advances setting, theme, and stakes.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses botanical armistice with insomnia-as-art in a way that feels inevitable yet unseen. Risk of lyric spiral structure is embraced fully and justified by closure payoff. Transformation test fails: swap shell for cave or postcard for letter and the whole ecology collapses. Bold specificity—“constellation spelling ARMISTICE in pollen-script”—anchors freshness without gimmickry.</comment>
