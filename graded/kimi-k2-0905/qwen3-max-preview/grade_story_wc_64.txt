<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Gardener’s interior contradiction—tenderness for the dead vs. need to disturb their silence—drives every micro-choice; the final shift from lullaby to question is earned by the tapestry’s forced recognition of her own complicity. Embodied emotion (palm on fabric, dust on tongue) stays specific; no diagnostic labels. The silver needle drawn from her own sleeve literalizes cost on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the tapestry’s released smoke-reconfigures graves into “thresholds,” reweighting the premise with undeniable cost—she forfeits the comfort of lullabies forever. Causal chain holds: silo’s call → sovereign case warms → needle appears → stitches reveal her own silences. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land by line 40; no ambiguity at end.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Cemetery rows, cobalt silo, and tapestry border function as micro-settings that constrain action: the silo’s rusted rungs force descent, the tapestry’s warp dictates tactile decoding. Candle-blue core and meteor streak are selective sensory flashes that charge the final image. Environment literally shapes tactics—she can only “untangle” what the beam’s height and fabric decay allow.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“will she disturb the dead’s silence at her own cost?”—tightens when each unraveled thread mirrors her own buried choices, foreclosing the option to remain merely curator. Escalation is accumulative: every decoded knot increases personal exposure until the lullaby forfeits its soothing power. Price is visceral: her sleeve thread becomes the stitching medium—permanent loss of fabric, permanent change of role.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: intentions are unfinished gestures, not destinations. The tapestry’s smoke-shapes and the meteor streak reprice this concept visually at closure. Subtext in the sovereign case—dust not coins—implies confessions evaporate, leaving only the needle’s wound. No moralizing; the reader left holding the half-spoken name.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyric third-person limited sustains blithe-yet-aching cadence; perceptual signature notices “moss-kissed” stone and “liquid twilight” air. Sentence rhythm lengthens during descent, fragments at needlework, mirroring breath. No head-hopping; knowledge stays gardener-bound. Compression (“velvet gloom,” “rumor on the horizon”) is pattern-taught early and pays off in final whispered questions.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence advances image or stakes. No loops or synonym churn; figurative language is sparse enough to avoid purple patches. Strong verbs—“silo’s curved walls drank,” “threads curling like smoke”—carry weight. One clause misstep: “its hinge sighing when opened” repeats auditory cue from earlier “sigh” but does not dull closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fusion of war-silo, textile necromancy, and cemetery gardening feels non-obvious yet inevitable. The sovereign case that births a needle instead of coin transforms familiar “inheritance” trope. Risky second-person address to headstones is abandoned for deeper structural risk—quiet conceptual repricing rather than plot twist—yet coherence holds. Specificity of dusk-colored thread pulled from her own sleeve anchors freshness.</comment>
