<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and profession-specific; the ache to “bear witness” propels every beat. The final micro-choice—labeling the spent hourglass—pays off the opening ache with visible cost: she relinquishes the hope of being understood. No contradictory impulse is dramatized on-page, so the arc is linear rather than torn, keeping this just outside the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the empty hourglass, the unheard harmonic, the label “Beauty intact” reconfigure the mission from data retrieval to elegy. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—each sensory layer thickens until the final image reweights the stake. Cost is legible in the throat-tight moment she lowers the camera, accepting archival burial. No orientation or causality slips; the chemical-delay mechanic is seeded early and paid off at 05:00.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The frost-rimmed hourglass itself functions as micro-setting: its thermal-fracture threshold dictates the 05:00 timing and thus the climax. Lunar vacuum, regolith crunch, and Earth-glow are filtered through an inspector’s trained eye, never touristic. Spatial choreography is immaculate—boots, visor, lamp, labeler tracked without drift. Environment constrains the final act: only vacuum allows the grain’s dissolution, making the summit an active participant.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“witness the last whisper”—tightens when she realizes the message is mathematically unreceivable. The irreversible chemical fracture at 05:00 is the single escalation; options narrow from “record” to “absorb.” Cost is felt: she forfeits the fantasy that anyone will decode the harmonic. No secondary reversals, but the one turn is sufficient under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: commemoration without audience is still commemoration. The harmonic no one can hear reframes human ingenuity as an act of faith, not utility. Final label “Beauty intact” is a conceptual repricing that privileges aesthetic persistence over transmission. No moralizing; the insight is earned through the sensory build-up and the silent hiss.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Voice is crystalline, low-temperature, matching the lunar dawn. Compression (“message unreceived. Beauty intact”) is taught early and sustains momentum. No filter-verb clutter; perceptual signature is inspector-specific—she notices fracture planes, chemical thresholds, archival tags. Rhythm accelerates into the final short sentences without breaking stance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence adds new sensory or technical data. Figurative language is sparse and accurate—“shadows swallowed machinery and memory alike.” Register stays within a trained technician’s lexicon. The one-line label is a perfect micro-burst of closure without syntactic flab.</comment>

<question>8</question><question>8.7</question>
<comment>Premise is familiar—lone watcher of obsolete tech—but the chemical hourglass tuned to an ionosphere that no longer exists is a fresh, specific twist. Risk is taken: the entire drama is the fall of one grain unheard. Transformation is complete; the story would collapse if the harmonic were receivable. Slight deduction for echoing the “last witness” trope without subverting it further.</comment>
