<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interiority is rich and embodied—ink-stained fingers, trembling hands, the warmth of the compressed moment against her palm. Contradictory impulses (order vs rupture) coexist in the same beats. Final renunciation—library forever glitched—carries visible cost: “perfection was ruined.” Only limit: no second character, so relationship crucible untested.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the library’s equilibrium is irreversibly broken and she embraces the chaos. Lens is Accumulative/Textural—density escalates through cascading rewrites of glass, frost, and grammar until the final aperture collapses. Cost is legible in the cloudy empty bottle and the shelf that “hadn’t existed yesterday.” No orientation debt; who/where/when clear by line 4.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Glass orchard, cloud-sea, frost patterns, and the letterpress are not backdrop—they dictate tactics: frost supplies the map, glass shelves refract the whisper’s chaos, the press warps under new glyphs. Final compressed moment is shelved inside a book that literally didn’t exist before, turning setting into archive. Micro-setting (bottled whisper) constrains the rupture’s scale. Minor cap: environment does not physically impede her body, so stays under 8.8.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—compress eternity vs preserve perfect order—signaled in paragraph 5. Tightening occurs when the spiral-keyhole frost pattern forces the uncorking; options narrow from “study” to “release.” Price is paid on-page: library systems glitch, shelves self-rearrange, clouds drift in impossible geometries. Accumulative lens satisfied; one decisive intensification sufficient.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges: chaos as midwife to meaning. No moralizing; final smile and shelved moment reweight prior equilibrium as sterile. Frost pattern, whisper, and glitched shelves form a small returning set that shifts from warning to invitation. Resonance lingers in the image of “beautifully broken” archive—ambiguity intact.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays tight to operator’s perceptual filter—spectral ink, geometry unsettled, frost warm with latent energy. Syntax lengthens under wonder, shortens under rupture: “Glass petals shattered without sound.” No head-hopping; diction remains within her arcane lexicon. Patterned elision (“laws bent like reeds”) taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Sentences carry triple duty—image, motion, concept: “The air cracked—not audibly, but dimensionally.” Metaphors stay coherent within negotiable-reality rule-set. One paraphrase loop detected (“equilibrium…favorite disguise” echoes prior “equilibrium monument”) but does not touch closure. Rhythm accelerates into the aperture beat then exhales, mirroring compression/release.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Concept of “eternity compression” via library frost-grammar is fresh; combines archival, alchemical, and cosmic registers without precedent drift. Risky second-person address to reader avoided; instead, world teaches its own logic and follows to terminus. Final shelf-that-did-not-exist is an image that could not be swapped out—irreplaceable payoff.</comment>
