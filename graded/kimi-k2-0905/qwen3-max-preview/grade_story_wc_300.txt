<comment>The inspector’s contradictory impulses—yearning to reconnect yet fearing the raw exposure confession brings—are dramatized in every micro-choice: kneeling to the cave floor, pressing pearl to shell, finally crowning herself. Interiority stays concrete (“pulse syncing with drip-drip,” “envied the dead their release”) and grows more embodied as pressure rises. The visible cost is the emptied shell and the vanished pearl, a literal forfeiture that seals her transformation from seeker to conduit. Voice remains singular, unsentimental, and resistant to therapeutic self-translation even at the peak of revelation.</comment>

<comment>Accumulative/lyric lens taught early and held: each confession layers refractive light until the cave itself becomes translucent, delivering a Charged Poise closure with undeniable conceptual cost—she is now the living medium of others’ abandoned hopes. Orientation is anchored within 60 words; no teleporting props. The shell’s emptying and pearl’s disappearance are the exact on-page images that re-weight the premise, satisfying cost-proof test. Persistent constraint: once crowned, she cannot return to private isolation; the glow she now carries is the price.</comment>

<comment>Crystal caves function as micro-setting: their prismic facets physically refract her headlamp, guiding her eye to the pearl and later externalizing the internal glow. The nautilus shell acts as a second setting-object, its logarithmic curve dictating the confession ritual that drives the climax. Spatial choreography is clean—kneel, cradle, crown—no impossible body or prop shifts. Sensory economy is severe but purposeful: one headlamp beam, one trembling halo, one warm pulse, each returned in the final refulgence.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—reverse isolation by activating the pearl—is signaled in paragraph 3 and tightens with each confession: every whisper forecloses her ability to remain a detached inspector. Escalation is accumulative under the lyric lens; the third confession (“envied the dead”) triggers the harmonic vibration that makes retreat impossible. The shell-crown act crystallizes her stance, visible cost = permanent receptivity to others’ hopes. No coincidence; pressure grows from her own syllables etched into spiral chambers.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without abstraction: isolation as the true apocalypse is enacted, not declared. The final image—glowing caves and glowing self—offers a non-literal answer: connection is not harvested but reflected back at the cost of privacy. Subtext operates in gesture (kneeling, crowning) and object state change (empty shell). No closing moral; resonance arises from the sensory reprise of light in stone and skin, re-weighting earlier “latent radiance” as lived burden rather than metaphor.</comment>

<comment>第三-person lyric maintains a geologist’s diction—“veined with amethyst,” “calcite formation”—yet modulates into liturgical cadence for the ritual beats, mirroring the shift from inspection to consecration. Perceptual signature is filtered through subterranean expertise: she notices shimmer before color, resonance before sound. No dialogue, so voice coherence is judged by internal rhythm; syntax lengthens then compresses with each confession, teaching the reader the spiral pattern. No filter-verb stacks; immediacy is sustained through tactile verbs (“pressed,” “lifted,” “crowned”).</comment>

<comment>Prose shows high information density: one sentence often layers physical act, emotional stakes, and world rule (“The cave responded—not with sound, but with a deep, harmonic vibration…”). Figurative choices stay geologically consistent—no mixed metaphors. Rhythm accelerates into shorter clauses as glow intensifies, then relaxes into a single long sentence for the final dissolve, mirroring breath. Zero loops or scaffold; no paraphrase churn. Opening line anchors both voice and stake; closing line offers image-only resolution that re-cues “glow” without repeating it.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The fusion of geologic inspection with emotional archaeology feels fresh; the pearl as mirror-not-battery re-prices familiar hope tropes. Risky lyric-accumulative structure is taught early and paid off, avoiding gimmick. Specificity of “logarithmic curve” and “Resource Wars” grounds the concept in lived detail rather than allegory. Only moderate band because the bunker-inspector frame, while efficient, is a known near-future archetype; the core inversion lies in the shell ritual and cave optics rather than character type.</comment>
