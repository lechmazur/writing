<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction is present—guilt over “aestheticizing harm” vs. serene ritual—but the shift from calligraphic complicity to puppet-subversion is summarized, not dramatized in-scene; no on-page micro-choice shows him risking tangible loss tonight. The puppet-self at the end supplies a concrete emblem of cost, earning partial change, yet Mira’s absence keeps relationship pressure offstage. Enough for credible arc, but not the full crucible of two-body stakes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the candle-lit puppet and the line “I reverse not to undo, but to reveal” reconfigure his future options and carry felt ethical cost under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Single-scene orientation is swift; radar dome, night, post-argument hush are anchored by word 80. One clean transition (memory flash of bar incidents) is taught early and paid off. Causality holds: because he weaponized elegance, therefore he now weaponizes grotesque puppets—pattern tightens rather than reverses again.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dome’s rivets-as-eyes and the campfire stick’s warmth constrain his rehearsal choices; environment is not backdrop but mirror that turns into mandate. Selective sensory triage—rain as Morse, velvet fog of silence—filters through his tactile calligrapher bias. Micro-setting (charred stick, single candle) literally steers the final image, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—ethical accountability versus aesthetic distance—is signaled in paragraph 3 and tightens when he decides tomorrow’s show will use his own blood-and-honey avatar, narrowing safe options. No external antagonist needed; pressure is internal and accumulative: each recalled commission raises the moral bill. Cost is visible: the shattered-mirror eyes of the self-puppet literalize the price of looking honestly.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges inductively from puppet inversion rather than thesis statement; final line “the story wasn’t over. It was just finally being told right” reweights earlier manuscripts-turned-marionette without moralizing. Subtext of “stories burn twice” accrues through stick’s tactile recurrence and the veteran’s bottle—violence as punctuation—creating lingering ambiguity about whether revelation heals or merely scars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays tightly fused to the calligrapher’s perceptual filter—ink, fonts, serifs—without spilling into omniscient editorial. Sentence rhythm modulates from long fluid clauses (serene) to staccato puppet-show anecdotes (pressure), mirroring emotional cadence. No dialogue on page, so voice distinction clause is N/A; narrative diction remains urbane yet penitent, a credible hybrid for the character.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High information density: each sentence layers metaphor that also advances causality (“stories burn twice” forecasts later bottle violence). Figurative vehicles stay coherent—calligraphy, fire, Morse—no mixed metaphors in peak beats. Minor scaffold: two adjacent “then” constructions mid-memory; not enough to dull closure momentum or trigger cap.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Puppet-show confessional inside a Cold-War radar dome fuses fresh angles on art vs. ethics; not a trope checklist. The Navajo stick’s warning is respected, not appropriated—it functions as lived constraint rather than exotic garnish. Risk of meta-art-as-atonement could feel academic, but concrete handling of wire-and-sock puppets grounds it. Specificity makes the synthesis feel inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
