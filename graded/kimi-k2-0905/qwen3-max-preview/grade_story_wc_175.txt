<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Interiority is lush and embodied (“trembling fingers,” “stillness settling into her bones”); the contradiction between transience and rootedness is dramatized in the deliberate looseness of the final bow. Motivation is legible throughout, but the absence of a second character removes status/relationship pressure, and no visible flaw complicates the ritual—she executes her devotional plan flawlessly. The moth-wing renunciation is earned, yet the cost feels aesthetic rather than personal, keeping the arc just shy of the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the spiral left to dissolve reweights the premise—beauty without audience as the only lasting form of memory. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural; each knot tightens the pattern until the final image crystallizes options and cost. Anchors (who/where/when) are taught by line 3; no orientation debt. One minor scaffold: “She had learned long ago…” could be cut without loss.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The grotto itself becomes a micro-setting that constrains the final choice—its mist and moss dictate the temporary shrine’s lifespan. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: she notices dew-slick stone, lichen tensility, monarchs as embers. Spatial choreography is immaculate; bodies and objects track cleanly across the spiral build. The dying monarch landing on the outer thread is the charged environmental act that seals closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stake is singular: dignify vanishing before it vanishes. Escalation is textural—each knot increases the density of reverence until the final bow forecloses permanence. The tightening is visible: “tender—a bow that would unravel by dawn.” Cost is conceptual but undeniable—the shrine must disappear to fulfill its covenant. Agency is all hers; no outside antagonist needed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the spiral’s deliberate entropy: memory is only honored once it is surrendered. The moth wing reweights from relic to sacrament; the monarch’s landing reweights migration as benediction. No explicit thesis is stated; the final image of the grotto “at peace” is the non-literal answer. Ambiguity is meaningful—reader must decide whether dissolution is triumph or elegy.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Voice is irreducibly specific: “esoteric realist,” “transiently rooted,” “velvet dark of collective amnesia.” Rhythm modulates—long breathless cadences for ritual, then clipped withdrawal steps at the end. Diction stays within her plausible lexicon; no filter-verb bloat. The lyric pattern is taught early (“knotting air with intention”) and paid off in the unraveling bow.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud ear is excellent; sentence openings vary, paragraph lengths breathe. No loops, synonyms, or template cadence. Figurative language is sparse and precise—“orange flickers barely disturbing the mist” is fresh without overwriting. One near-misstep: “blushing stillness” is used twice; the repetition is purposeful (grotto blushes deeper) but flirts with mannerism.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Premise—ephemeral shrine to disappearing butterflies—feels inevitable yet non-obvious. The spiral-as-signal is a fresh inflection on land-art tropes. Risk is high (no dialogue, no conflict, no audience) but coherence is higher. Transformation test fails: swap moth for feather, grotto for dunes, and the arc still holds—slight originality ding.</comment>
