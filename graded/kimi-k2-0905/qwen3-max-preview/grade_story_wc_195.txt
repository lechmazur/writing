<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The knight’s transformation from ossified warrior to living conduit is dramatized through embodied motion rather than exposition; each “unsnapped” hinge externalizes interior surrender. Internal conflict stays visceral—armor as second skin versus luminous nectar on bare feet—and the final laugh pays the cost of total exposure. No stock epithets; even “withdrawn” is shown by years of silence and moss, not told. The murmured allegiance functions as a credo that actively forecloses return to knighthood, satisfying Earned Stasis.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of organic surrender taught early with “murmured allegiance” and Mercury-root drip, tightens when vines balance him and threads weave through marrow. Closure is Charged Poise: outstretched palms offer rather than seize, reconfiguring meaning of capture. Cost is legible in irreversible bodily change—armor left behind, barefoot on singing soil—and in the dawn’s new grammar that erases old oaths. No causality breaks; each image accretes rather than explains.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Alchemical greenhouse is not backdrop but agonist: mercury roots rise to question, nectar reverses flow, ceiling dissolves into vortex that rethreads his joints. Micro-setting succeeds—armor hinges, marionette program pages, copper troughs—each handled and altered. Sensory hierarchy favors taste (dissolved time) and kinesthetic release over visual catalog. Final image of “soil that sings” fuses body and world, meeting the 9+ constraint by charging closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—capture the shape of possibility—tightens when capture is redefined as offering, not seizing. Escalation is textural: density of luminous nectar, inverted flows, threads that replace steel. Cost is felt in irreversible unarmoring and the dawn’s alien grammar. One meaningful deepening suffices; no external antagonist needed because orchard itself applies coherent pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges without dictation: possibility as living grammar versus fixed stars. Marionette program literalizes the critique of pre-written destinies; its blank final page Conceptually Reprices the entire war of whispering treaties. No moralizing; final laugh is sonic image of thaw, not lesson. Subtextual tension between control and surrender is played out in joint anatomy and root tendrils.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person lyric maintains consistent psychic distance; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is alchemical-kinesthetic—armor sighs, nectar reverses, soil sings—creating idiom inseparable from world. Compression taught early (“murmured allegiance”) and paid off in final barefoot step. Syntax mirrors surrender: long breathy clauses yield to fragmentary bursts at climax.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Rhythm breathes with scene: clauses lengthen during slow nectar drip, tighten into noun-stripped fragments as threads descend. No loops; each metaphor is single-use and precise—“thawing ice over deep water.” One near-purple line (“shivering bliss—a sensation like frost and flame entwined”) forgiven because it is the sole abstract descriptor of an indescribable bodily state. Closure image of singing soil lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fuses chivalric elegy with alchemical body-horror and puppet-theatre metaphysics in a synthesis that feels inevitable. Risk of weightless mysticism is countered by granular joint mechanics and metallic taste of mercury. Blank program page as Conceptual Repricing is fresh twist on “blank slate” trope. Specificity of phosphor-bark and copper troughs prevents generic anywhere/orchard.</comment>
