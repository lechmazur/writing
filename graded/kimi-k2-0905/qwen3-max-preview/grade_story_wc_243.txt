<comment>Interiority is lush and embodied (fingers reading braille of salt-crusted planks); motivation holds steady across beats. Micro-choices—closing locket, journal entry—carry visible cost, but the “gentle thorough” trait is asserted rather than dramatized in a way that forces hard trade-offs. Earned stasis in the final walk-off feels serene yet slightly protected; no moment of true interior contradiction ruptures the composure. Still, the character-specific perceptual signature is strong enough to reach high band with only a hairline gap in flaw exposure.</comment>

<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens taught early and held: tide-turn parallels internal rupture, ink smells of endings, lanterns flicker in jasmine—each image layers density toward a charged poise. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the archivist’s quiet smile and walk home crystallize the covenant as an ongoing devotional act, foreclosing rest or rebellion with felt emotional cost. Orientation anchors within 120 words; spatial logic stays clean across jetty moves. One soft spot: the “regenerated covenant” is named more than tested by a proximate cause that narrows live options; escalation rides on imagery accretion rather than a decisive tightening beat.</comment>

<comment>Jetty-as-micro-setting constrains every move: salt crust on planks, lantern petals caught in jasmine cracks, tide sigh against pylons—each tactile detail is filtered through the archivist’s conservationist eye and charged at closure when she walks the same planks home. Light, scent, and ink interweave without catalogue fatigue; economy favors selective, purposeful strokes. Nighttime tide and blooming jasmine serve as both atmosphere and tool: the scent tangles with ink to create the haunted euphoria tone that lingers in the final reprise. No slips in spatial tracking; environment meaningfully shapes the tactics of transcription and the final stance crystallization.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—preserve small weights against erasure—signals in line 3 and escalates through accretion of lost marsh, silenced lullabies, absent Sunday clinks. Pressure is coherent but diffuse; no single proximate cause forces a visible trade-off on the page—each “cause” is named in reflective summary rather than dramatized as a live threat that forecloses an option. The tightening is lyrical, not tactical: stakes deepen via image density rather than protagonist-forced choice with observable cost. Enough escalation for high-band entry, yet stops short of the knife-twist that would make the cost viscerally legible beyond the ache of ink.</comment>

<comment>Theme emerges organically from concrete particulars: locket photo, walnut ink, salt-slick planks. No abstract thesis is stated; the final image of lanterns “trembling like fireflies” reweights prior material by implying the covenant survives only through such fragile, repeated tending. Subtext lives in gesture—soft click of locket, refusal to weep lest ink blur—inviting reflection on how remembrance is an act of delicate defiance. Avoids sentimentality by keeping insight tied to sensory work; ambiguity lingers about whether the covenant can truly hold against asphalt and silence.</comment>

<comment>Third-person lyric voice maintains stable psychic distance; perceptual signature is sharply particular—“salt that had dried on that younger cheek,” “sepia tones held sorrow like a vessel.” Rhythm modulates with emotional swell: longer liquid sentences for tide turn, clipped fragments (“She did not weep. / Tears would blur the ink.”) for self-command. No dialogue to test, yet internal monologue avoids diagnostic labels, staying rooted in sensory causality. Voice unity survives the high poetic register because diction remains anchored to bodily action—ink dip, plank press, locket click.</comment>

<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence advances image or emotional charge. Figurative layering is patterned and justified—ink as vessel, laugh as first clause—no mixed metaphors or register drift. One minor paraphrase loop: “preserve the weight of small moments” restated as “small eternal weights” in closing line, but the reprise is purposeful echo rather than scaffold. Near-flawless control under pressure; the final image lands crystal without overwritten haze.</comment>

<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Freshens the familiar “memory archivist” trope by fusing conservationist ritual with tidal, floral, and olfactory specificity; the walnut-ink conceit feels lived-in rather than symbolically pasted. Conceptual risk—covenant regenerated through micro-gestures—pays off in quiet resonance without grand showdown. Could not swap names/places without collapsing the salt-jasmine-ink sensorium that powers theme. One small echo of commonplace “fireflies at twilight” but redeemed by lantern-petal fusion that localizes it to this jetty.</comment>
