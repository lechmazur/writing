<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority is lush and embodied; the janitor’s contradictory impulses (archive-order vs. reverence-for-decay) stay active in-scene. The final stance—sweeping on after the comet’s unlogged efflorescence—earns its quiet cost: he accepts permanent erasure of the moment he most values. Micro-choices (kneeling, raising the glass, returning to broom) trace a hierarchy of values without exposition. The only limit: no second character to pressure status, so crucible is purely intra-spiritual, capped under 8.8.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the comet’s self-erasing bloom reweights his vocation from witness to custodian of unrecorded peace, tears as visible cost. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern of “trace→feel→release” tightens once with the rogue comet, no causal reversals needed. Orientation is anchored by line 5 (“Andromeda Drift”) and lantern glass cues backstory without breaking present sweep. One micro-turn: unlogged comet shifts ritual from routine to singular, foreclosing archival proof.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Station, lantern glass, and crystalline deck function as micro-setting that constrains action: only here can an unlogged death be sensed without bureaucratic capture. Sensory hierarchy favors hush, velvet dark, and glass-warmed starlight—every detail filtered through POV’s priority of reverence over data. Spatial choreography is clean: scope→kneel→console→sweep, no floating anchors. Yellow glass recurs with evolving charge, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve unrecorded beauty—tightens when the rogue comet offers a one-time efflorescence that sensors will never log; his choice to merely witness narrows future options to eternal silence. Pressure is accumulative: each traced meteor deepens the stakes of remaining unseen. Cost is legible in tears and the final line “Thank you for remembering how to be still,” acknowledging the perpetual erasure he now embraces. No external antagonist needed; entropy is coherent pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of “flourishing stillness” emerges through the comet’s unwitnessed bloom and the janitor’s acceptance of erasure; no thesis is stated, only enacted. Subtext lives in gesture—lowering the glass, wiping tears with a patched tunic—showing vulnerability as strength. Final whispered gratitude reconfigures prior archive-rejection as sacred vocation, a Conceptual Repricing with felt cost. Resists moralizing; leaves reader in charged quiet.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person lyric remains tightly focalized; perceptual signature favors cosmic scale compressed into tactile minutiae—star-dust under broom, glass warmed by extinct suns. Rhythm modulates: long breath-like sentences for drift, fragmentary pulses for meteor streaks. No head-hopping; diction stays within janitor’s spiritual-astronomical lexicon. Filter verbs (“he felt”) are rare and voice-motivated, never dulling immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet aerated: “sky wept embers,” “gravitational sigh” do double duty for image and emotion. No loops or synonym churn; each sentence advances stance or atmosphere. One mixed metaphor risk—“ink in water” for vacuum bloom—reads as permissible lyric stretch under accumulative lens. Final paragraph slows cadence to match stillness, ear-tested flawless.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Cosmic janitor archiving unwitnessed deaths is fresh; trope of star-cataloguer turned mystic is inverted through empathy-as-method. Risky choice—no logged event, no external validation—pays off by making erasure the sacred product. Lantern glass as soul-filter and the unlogged comet bloom feel inevitable yet unforeseen. Specificity of “yellow lantern glass salvaged from a dead moon” anchors universality.</comment>
