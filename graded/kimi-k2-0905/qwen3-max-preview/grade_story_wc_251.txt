<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elira’s quiet insurgency is credibly rooted in her history with the grotto and the library’s hush; her interiority stays concrete (“she didn’t need followers. She needed witnesses”). The final micro-choice—handing Milo the white queen—pays off her gardener-of-seconds motive with visible cost: surrender of secrecy. Flaw: no contradictory impulse on-page; stance is steady, not sharpened by internal friction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each lit window adds density until the final arbor network reconfigures civic attention. Closure is a Charged Poise: “she was just the soil” crystallizes her renunciation of spectacle with conceptual cost—anonymous forever. Cost is legible in the same line; no orientation drift. One causal hiccup: grotto’s light-bending rules are declared, not foreshadowed, but the pattern absorbs the slip without breakage.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The cobalt library mist, magnetic grotto, and condensation-weeping glass anchor every move; the grotto-as-micro-setting literally bends the town’s light, constraining tactics. Spatial choreography is flawless across the window-to-window montage. Sensory hierarchy skews visual, but the bias matches Elira’s curator gaze. Meets 9+ gate: environment charges the final image—cobalt shimmer under her feet—as the cost of anonymity.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can dormant curiosity be rekindled without owning the spotlight—tightens as each window forecloses Elira’s option to claim credit. The midnight synchronization is the decisive escalation: once the arbor glow is cast, anonymity is irreversible. Cost is visible (loss of recognition) but lightly felt compared to thematic weight; keeps this shy of 8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the accretion of lit chessboards and whispered moves: knowledge as living photosynthesis rather than performance. Final soil metaphor re-prices the premise—rebellion is humus, not heroic. No declarative thesis; subtext carried by image alone. Resists moral binaries: town’s scientists “mutter” yet the glow persists, leaving complexity intact.</answer>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyric-accumulative voice taught early (“weeping condensation…vaulted hush”) and sustained without scaffold. Syntax flexes from elongation to fragment (“amplified quiet.”) under pressure. Filter verbs purged; perception stays embodied. No dialogue, hence no voice convergence; internal idiom remains distinct and soil-humble.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>High information density: single sentences fuse metaphor, stakes, and sensory data (“cobalt stacks…grotto cradled…rhythm of her resolve”). Zero paraphrase loops; each metaphor is singular. Rhythm accelerates into the midnight release, then breathes into the soil coda. Micro-slip: “magnetic grotto under starlight” thrice-repeated phrase borders incantatory overdose but stays character-motivated.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: insurgent urban gardening via chessboard light-bending is non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Risk—renunciation of heroism—heightens stakes without gimmickry. Conceptual integrity holds: anonymity as soil is lived, not preached. No derivative premise trace; magnetic grotto sidesteps genre cliché entirely.</comment>
