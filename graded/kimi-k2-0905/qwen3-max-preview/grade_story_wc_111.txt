<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The dresser’s quiet, tactile ritual of polishing cracked marbles embodies her interiority; every micro-choice (placing the resin-mended green orb on the altar, tucking the snowdrop petal) crystallizes her hierarchy of values. Her refusal to wear a probability band is not declared but enacted, with visible cost: institutional scorn, aching knees, the garden’s slow slide into unsanctioned chaos. The final Earned Stasis—she sits against the altar, ankle circled by a questioning vine—feels inevitable because each prior marble commemorated a season when she already paid in full. Only the intern’s dialogue drifts toward convenient exposition, preventing the last decimal.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the garden’s firefly spirals mirror her marbles, reconfiguring the stake from “compliance vs. defiance” to “consent through listening.” Cost is legible in the dead wrist-band dangling “like a shed snakeskin” and the vine’s gentle shackle around her ankle. The accumulative/textural lens holds: every cracked marble adds density until the final shaft of light reframes survival itself as gloss. No orientation or causality breaks; even the off-stage bureaucrats exert coherent pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The maze’s overgrown walls, pulsing mossy altar, and resin-glued marble function as micro-setting that actively constrains her choices: she can neither leave nor force bloom, only commemorate. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true—“seedpods cracking open” laughter, damp-earth breeze before rain—never tourist catalog. The final firefly spirals charge the image with reciprocal recognition, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—garden’s consent vs. metric control—tightens once when the intern delivers the 12% compliance edict, forcing her explicit renunciation. Cost is visible (dead wrist-band, institutional scorn) but the tightening is singular; no second reversal compounds pressure. Sufficient for the length, yet a hair’s breadth from the 8.8+ band that would require a persistent constraint shaping next-season tactics.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: reciprocity over measurement. The marble cracks reweight from “damage” to “testimony” without a single explicit thesis. Final image—fireflies writing spirals that copy her marble constellations—delivers conceptual repricing: the garden commemorates her, turning surveillance logic inside out. No moralizing, only mute resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is elder, soil-stained, gnarled-verb (“knuckles...gnarled as old rootstock,” “dry sound like seedpods cracking”). Syntax lengthens only in the lullaby memory, compressing again under intern intrusion. No head-hopping; even the vine’s “question-mark” curl is filtered through her ankle’s sensation. Minor cadence echo in “murmuring to the jasmine overhead / shivered, not from wind, but recognition” is pattern-taught and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero scaffold loops; each sentence adds new texture or knowledge. Metaphors stay physically coherent—moonflower against frost, wisteria “heavy as regret, sweet as forgiveness.” Information density is high: “She polished a deep-blue sphere webbed with hairline fractures, murmuring to the jasmine overhead: ‘You remember...’” does four jobs in one breath. Even the em-dash cadences serve elder breath-control, never obscuring causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The cracked-marble commemorative altar reframes “mended deception” as living horticultural resistance—an angle not seen elsewhere. Risk is high: a 750-word lyric accumulative piece whose climax is a firefly spiral, yet coherence never wavers. Specificity is irreproducible: tea-leaf lullabies, census-drone night, resin-glued frost survivor—none swappable with generic tokens. Garden-as-mutual-witness feels freshly inevitable.</comment>
