<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elara’s “nervously confident” trait is repeatedly named but never embodied in a micro-choice that costs her; the copper nail warms but doesn’t force a visible trade-off. Her great-grandfather’s backstory is told in a 100-word expository block that halts present pressure. The decisive act—typing the stanza into the resonance board—reads as effortless victory rather than a crucible that forecloses any path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>The causal chain is clean: stanza discovered → typed → sky rewound, and the copper nail re-weights the ending with ancestral cost. Orientation is anchored by line 5; no penalty. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the sky’s golden crack and the quiet hum in her pocket crystallize exile reversed into pilgrimage. The “memory is grief” paragraph edges toward thematic echo but stops short of moralizing.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>The station’s flickering emergency lamps, the resonance board’s whirring dials, and the copper nail’s warming hum are micro-settings that constrain and enable the final act. Selective sensory hierarchy—salt-stiff pages, mildew reek—mirrors Elara’s cartographer eye. Spatial choreography stays clean across the single room. The golden light that rewinds dawn is the charged image that reconfigures meaning, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Single dominant stake—reverse exile by proving maps predict weather—is signaled early and tightened when the stanza is revealed as control, not prediction. The act of typing it narrows options to one: finish the ancestor’s sacrificial diversion. Cost is present but abstract—sky cracks, alarms blare—yet no concrete price (injury, guild retaliation) is dramatized on-page, keeping it below 8.0 band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: erased histories (sailors, grandfather) demand cartographic resurrection; maps are memory, storms are grief. The copper nail’s quiet hum and the fresh journal’s first line enact the theme without stating it. No final-paragraph moralizing. The re-weighting is the golden sky-dawn being “rewound,” a conceptual repricing that lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Lush, lyrical third-person limited stays tightly filtered through Elara’s perceptual signature—ink, salt, harmonic frequencies. Rhythm modulates: clipped短句 under alarms, then slow golden rewound dawn. No head-hopping; diction never exceeds her lexicon. The only minor slip is the abstract “electric certainty,” which drifts toward diagnostic self-awareness.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm varies; no template cadence or synonym loops detected. Figurative density is high but patterned early (“storms bloomed where deserts slept”) and pays off at closure. One scaffold-like paraphrase—“exile… reversible… turned banishment into pilgrimage”—could be tightened. No artifacts touch the final image; momentum holds.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: cartographic librarian + weather-control stanzas + ancestral copper nail. The drowned sailors’ harmonic code feels specific to this world. Risk-taking—lyric accumulation rather than set-piece fight—heightens meaning without losing clarity. The “map as song” closure is inevitable yet non-obvious in hindsight.</comment>
