<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and embodied (“grease from her cheek with the back of her glove”); the lantern inheritance and arm-inked names externalize motive. The refusal to flinch and the micro-choice to leave the lantern behind crystallize earned endurance with visible cost. The only drag is a sliver of diagnostic self-awareness (“progress requires amnesia”) that momentarily lifts us out of her sensorium.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the lantern’s pulse-synced heartbeat reconfigures her stance toward the next tunnel while the city’s denial remains intact—cost is felt in the etched names and the still-glowing iron she walks away from. Causal chain holds: lantern summons memory → reveals 1852 rupture → worker’s electrocution reframed → she anchors lantern → reverberations soften. Orientation is clean by line 5; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The tunnel’s diesel grit, dripping runoff, and rusted bolts are filtered through her professional gaze; every sensory note doubles as forensic data. The lantern’s cold bite and silver flare constrain her choices—she can’t document without it and can’t leave with it—charging the final image. Micro-setting (the rail where the lantern rests) becomes the literal anchor that stills the air, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether acknowledgement of buried trauma is worth career suicide—tightens when she chooses to leave the lantern as anchor, trading evidence for resonance. The reversal (faulty wiring → memory rupture) narrows her options: she can seek justice or grant rest, not both. Cost is legible in the inked names and the foreknowledge her report will be buried.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: cities that warehouse pain become fatal infrastructure. The lantern’s reprise—cold iron to pulse-synced glow—reweights “progress” as haunted circuitry. Final rain-soaked image of oblivious commuters offers a CR that revalues every prior step: ignorance is a civic technology, and her body is now its faulty wire.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays locked to her perceptual bias—sound as data, smell as archive—without head-hop. Syntax lengthens under reflection, then fractures into staccato observations (“She doesn’t flinch.”) mirroring rising pressure. One clause drifts toward editorial voice (“the city’s refusal to remember”) but is anchored by her immediate next action, preserving distance control.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image, data, or stake. Figurative language is sparse and coherent (“shadows stretch like reaching fingers” appears once, taught by lantern-light). High information density: “runoff drips…echoing like whispered confessions” fuses sensory, historical, and forensic registers in one stroke. No artifact touches the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fusing OSHA investigation with Underground Railroad hauntology is fresh, non-obvious, and inevitable once the lantern flares silver. Risk—turning spectral testimony into electrical-code violation—heightens stakes without gimmickry. The premise could not swap names or cities; the subway’s copper rails and 1852 clay footprints are irreplaceable substrates.</comment>
