<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The chemist’s interior contradiction—clinging to control while yearning for surrender—plays out in concrete micro-choices: gloves off, notebook sketches, final hymn. Embodied grief is vivid (tears left to dry, hair whipped by wind). The enduring flaw (blaming her scaffold) converts to acceptance via river imagery; cost is felt. The shift from isolation to entanglement is earned, not declared. Voice remains coherent and specific; no therapy-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: foam patterns, chrysalis, braided streams accrue meaning until the “phase-change” Conceptual Repricing lands. Orientation anchored by ~120 words (ravine, gloves off, chrysalis). Closure is clean: she decides to design a dissolving scaffold, humming—an Earned Stasis with felt cost. One minor causality fuzz: hospital scaffold failure is recounted, not dramatized, but river epiphany retroactively powers it. No lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Ravine functions as micro-setting: braided channels physically guide her steps and metaphorically rewire her grief. Foam cells, chrysalis, and river noise are tactile tools that constrain her insight. Selective sensory hierarchy (sound > sight) mirrors her scientific ear. Final image—wind sculpting hair—charges closure. No spatial drift; weather affects action (sun breaks as she climbs out).</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: transform separation into connection. Tightening occurs when she realizes scaffolds are meant to dissolve, not endure—this narrows her scientific goal and forgives her daughter’s death. Cost is conceptual but legible: she forfeits permanent control. Agency is interior (renunciation) yet drives future action (new polymer design). No external antagonist needed; pressure is grief vs. flow.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: impermanence as architecture for love. Subtext lives in gesture—scooping foam, letting it vanish—rather than exposition. Final image (watermark of tiny handprint) offers non-literal answer: love persists as trace, not structure. No moralizing; complexity intact. River/braid motif accretes meaning without forcing symmetry.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Lyric third-person hovers close to POV, filtering through scientific perceptual signature (viscosity, surface tension, timpani of bubbles). Syntax swells and contracts with emotional cadence; no head-hopping. Diction stays within chemist’s lexicon until wobbly hymn—an intentional voice break under grief. No filter-verb stacks; metaphor vehicles (DNA braids, flute runs) are disciplined and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>High density: sentences braid science and grief without slack. Rhythm varies; no template cadence. Figurative language is controlled—one metaphor per beat, never stacked. Zero paraphrase loops; “foam” reappears only when reweighted. Opening and final lines serve as frame and cadence shift. Minor elevated register in “symphonic chaos” but justified by POV.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: polymer scientist’s grief re-read through river foam morphology. Transformation test passes—swap ravine/lab details and the arc collapses. Risk in lyric accumulative structure pays off with legible closure. Not a template grief story; scientific lens reframes mourning as material design problem. Specificity of “Chrysalis Mesh” patent feels inevitable, not gimmick.</comment>
