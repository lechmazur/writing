<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elira’s interiority is specific—her calloused fingers, the tessera biting her palm—and her “retrocognitive” conscience is dramatized through micro-choices (prying the shard, pressing it into the magistrate’s hand). The renaming litany risks performed eloquence, but each micro-rename is tethered to a survivor’s embodied moment. The magistrate’s trembling hand and whispered daughter-laugh crystallize status shift and earned cost. Flaw: the final crowd sequence flattens individual contradiction into choral assent, slightly softening the crucible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of fractured tesserae → renamed lives. Orientation anchor (“ancient plaza beneath a shattered sky”) arrives inside 15 words. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the blue shard becomes compass, mercy revalued from passive sigh to “steel that bends.” Cost is visible in the magistrate’s whispered loss and Elira’s bleeding palm. One causality micro-gap: the tessera’s supposed “key” power is asserted more than demonstrated before the magistrate beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Ash, fractured arches, cobalt glaze—sensory triage keeps every detail goal-driven. The plaza’s geography stays coherent: minaret skeleton → stepping stone → crowd perimeter. Weather (returning sun sliver) times the emotional cadence shift. Micro-setting triumph: the tessera itself functions as portable environment that constrains the final choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake: can mercy be re-forged into justice-with-teeth? Pressure escalates via accretion: each renamed truth is a tessera added to the mosaic of possible futures. The magistrate’s whisper tightens the screw—his daughter’s laughter is the first live option foreclosed by the new mercy. Cost is felt, but the crowd surge after feels slightly frictionless; one more individual relapse would have sharpened the price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the shifting valence of “mercy” rather than sermon. Subtext lives in gesture: handing over the shard = surrender of old jurisprudence. Final image reweights the concept without moralizing. The avoidance of tidy aphorism and the retention of moral ambiguity (aberrant mercy can still wound) give the piece lingering charge.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric close-up stays locked to Elira’s perceptual filter: “ash clung like powdered grief.” Syntax flexes with pressure—parallel renaming clauses mimic mosaic assembly. No head-hop; magistrate’s voice is external, filtered through Elira. Register holds elevated mythic tone without drifting into pseudo-biblical; diction stays consistent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Rhythm varies: long anaphoric rolls crash into short percussive fragments (“It must break doors”). No paraphrase loops; each sentence adds new pattern or image. One mixed-metor risk: “cradle empathy in arms of steel” compresses cradle + weapon, but the paradox is intentional and earned. Filter verbs minimal; immediacy sustained.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Freshest inflection: mercy retooled as civic engineering using literal broken tile. The shattered-minaret-into-vocabulary forge feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Risk of lyric manifesto is high, but piece grounds every abstract move in tactile object handling. No trope recycling: post-catastrophe plaza stories usually hoard nostalgia; this one weaponizes memory into legislation.</comment>
