<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Interiority is lush and idiosyncratic—“preemptively nostalgic” is a lived-in tic—but the absence of a second on-page character removes relationship crucible pressure; the only micro-choice is to keep writing, so the arc is emotional accretion rather than a tested shift. The final smile at her own erasure is earned by prior longing, yet the cost is abstract, not embodied in a beat that forecloses an alternative path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the signature along a raindrop’s edge reframes the entire quest as self-dissolution, with undeniable conceptual cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern of shadow-measurements deepens to personal erasure—though causality is lyric rather than sequential. Orientation is clear by line 5; no teleporting props or logic breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Observatory, crystal forecourt, and solidified fog function as micro-settings that constrain movement and supply the memory-reading surface; the brass telescope aimed at “echoes between stars” charges the final image. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven—archivist notices refraction angles, not tourist vistas—anchoring the speculative physics in tactile detail.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—sculpt identity from vanished cultures—tightens when each shadow measurement sharpens her awareness of impermanence; the final short shadow flinches time itself, forcing stance crystallization. Pressure is accumulative: each silhouette adds existential weight rather than narrows external options; cost is conceptual but legible on-page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme—memory as atmospheric erosion of self—emerges from the conceit that raindrops fossilize feeling; no explicit thesis is stated. The final image of signing a name along a refraction reweights prior material without moralizing, achieving resonant ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Third-person lyric voice sustains a controlled cadence, syntactic parallelism taught early (“how long… how sharply”) and paid off in the final whisper. Diction stays within archivist register—”conjecture,” “vellum,” “celestial axes”—without thesaurus drift; perceptual signature is consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>High figurative density is pattern-taught and matched to lyric mode; no mixed metaphors or simultaneity errors. One paraphrase loop (“preemptively nostalgic” repeated twice in close proximity) costs −0.2; otherwise rhythm breathes with escalating pressure and ends on crystalline image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Premise—reading grief via shadow lengths on a crystal forecourt—feels fresh and specific; risk is taken with lyric structure rather than plot twists. Shadow-as-grief-clock is inevitable in hindsight, not derivative; speculative physics is internally consistent.</comment>
