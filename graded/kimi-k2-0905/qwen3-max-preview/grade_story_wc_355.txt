<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is sensorially rich and consistent; her hierarchy of values (silence > acclaim) is shown through micro-gestures—air-tracing, breath-matching—rather than labels. The pacifist trait is credible because it costs her the option of brute-force entry and is re-expressed in her refusal to flinch at fireworks. The only minor gap: no on-page contradiction that would deepen flaw-driven tension. Earned stasis is legible in her smile at the clasp’s warmth, a quiet admission that tomorrow she will again risk exhaustion.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: pacifism → frequency tuning → clasp surrender; each attempt therefore narrows sonic options until the diary yields. Closure (Charged Poise) lands when she matches her own breath to the residual hum, crystallizing empathy as perpetual labor under exploding sky. Fireworks’ conceptual cost—world’s noise will keep coming—reweights her earlier “recovery” into an endless duty. No orientation drift; who/where anchored by line 3, when by “final stillness before fireworks.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Workshop micro-setting doubles as tool: rafter height dictates coil placement, cobweb texture absorbs stray overtones. Meteorite clasp’s residual warmth supplies the final image, fusing prop and environment. Star vault and moth wings create spatial depth that is tracked across frequency sweeps; no floating furniture. One notch down because exterior village rubble is recalled, not lived on the page—slight imbalance in sensory immediacy.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recover silence before fireworks erase it—tightens with each failed tuning; higher harmonics risk permanent clasp fracture (visible price). Agency remains hers: every switch of source (whale→child’s breath) forecloses prior timbre and consumes lantern oil/time. No off-stage rescue; fireworks complicate rather than solve. Cost is legible in her trembling fingers and tear-glint, but stakes never escalate beyond the diary’s surrender—no larger social consequence tested.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges from braid of silence-as-language and empathy-as-archivism; no character sermonizes the concept. Final image of her smiling at “symphony within” reconfigures silence from absence to plenitude without moral tag. Subtext of pacifist discipline is encoded in tactile refusal to break clasp; reader decodes ethic rather than hears dictate. Only hairline slip: “first language of empathy” flirts with abstraction early, quickly redeemed by embodied tuning acts.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person lyric floats close to Elara’s synesthetic register—colors of vibration, whispered geometries—without leaking into omniscient lecture. Syntax lengthens during frequency layering, contracts at click of surrender, mirroring inhalation/exhalation. No head-hop; moth wings and dust motes stay externally focalized. Diction stays within artisanal range except “conceptual repricing” moment—arguable POV drift but reads as earned philosophical lift after sensory immersion.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm modulates from weighted clauses (“vault of stars, the shadowed workshop…”) to staccato micro-actions—“She switched”—accelerating toward climax. Metaphors are consistent sonic/celestial hybrids; no contradictory vehicles. Information-dense lines carry triple duty: “hummingbird vertebrae” implies delicacy plus ecological stance plus wonder. Zero loops; each sentence adds frequency detail or physical consequence. Only nit: “sincerity was her only script” borders on aphorism, but is instantly grounded by tactile workshop response.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade>
<comment>Premise—archiving silence as empathy—feels non-obvious yet instantly inevitable in hindsight. Risk of preciousness skirted by metallurgical specificity (meteorite iron) and embodied physics of resonance. Transformation test passes: swapping “diary” for generic box breaks the bird-bone & star-forge metaphoric chain. No derivative scaffolding; tuning forks and whale song braid into fresh archival ritual. Final smile reframes entire fireworks spectacle as petty, achieving conceptual repricing without invented twist.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>8.7</grade></comment>Her pacifism disables lock-pick option, forcing frequency invention; later, refusal to cower during explosions externalizes stance at cost of social ridicule tomorrow. Three-beat involvement: denies force, chooses harmonics, withstands sky-bombs.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>9.4</grade></comment>Clasp appears first sentence, fractures under tonal stress, survives as warm remnant in last—its material eccentricity (vertebrae+meteorite) irreproducible. Diary’s interior layers rewire Elara’s goal from “open” to “preserve,” reweighting meaning at closure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.9</grade></comment>Empathy concept drives every sonic choice; failure to match resonance would silence another’s grief unarchived. Final breath-sync literalizes becoming “vessel tuned to ache,” making abstract concept tactile and consequential.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>8.1</grade></comment>Attribute enables her to distinguish C-sharp vs whale harmonic and to “paint” vibration as hue—decisional edge that brute-force technicians lack. Cost: sensory overload teeters on hallucination, hinted in “whispered geometries.”</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>9.6</grade></comment>Recover action structures entire arc—each failed frequency is a micro-recovery attempt; success fills archival case, redefining her night. Remove “recover” and plot collapses into mute contemplation.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>9.3</grade></comment>Method is foregrounded in first third, detailed in climb through harmonic series, and determines success condition (lullaby for locked things). Mechanics matter: wrong pitch risks clasp shatter, stakes internalized.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade></comment>Workshop rafters hold copper coil, cobwebs damp overtones—environment functions as acoustic lab. Star slit overhead supplies visual metronome for tempo of attempts, nudging her toward final breath-sync.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>8.0</grade></comment>Fireworks countdown creates living clock; each whistle escalates urgency, compressing tuning iterations. First rocket launches immediately after last silence stored, sealing time pressure with irreversible noise.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>9.2</grade></comment>Motivation named early, re-cued via rubble memory, and paid when she smiles at completed catalog—desire fulfilled yet immediately deferred to next site, revealing open-ended obsession at personal cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.6</grade></comment>Theatrical sincerity manifests in refusal of spectacle: fireworks become off-stage intrusion while interior “symphony” claims spotlight. Tone modulates from reverent hush to victorious quiet, charging final smile with poise.</comment>
