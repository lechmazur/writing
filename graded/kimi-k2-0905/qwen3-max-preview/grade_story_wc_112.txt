<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elira’s quiet obsession is cleanly dramatized through micro-choices: the glove adjustment, the 2.7-degree lever tweak, the bypass of safety protocols. The scarred adjacent self supplies a concrete externalization of internal cost, turning abstract ambition into bodily stakes. “Mechanically warm” is shown, not told, via her steady breath in icy air. One flaw: the同事们-dismiss-her beat is off-stage summary; we never feel the social pressure compound her isolation inside the scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the nexus settles, chronometers resume, yet the ozone-cinnamon scent reweights the rule-set—time now breathes sideways at visible cost. The lateral-self warning (“Don’t let go”) is the pivot that forecloses safe return; pulling the lever becomes irreversible. Causal lattice is tight: schematic from Vol. 3 → comet-iron lever → 2.7° adjustment → adjacent Elira → lingering scent. No orientation debt; who/where/when are anchored by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Environment is never backdrop. The methane sea’s titanium groan and perpetual twilight directly shape the lever choice (no daylight cues, only magnetic light-bend). The nexus itself functions as micro-setting/tool hybrid, its indigo pulse dictating tempo and stakes. Spatial choreography across the gantry is flawless; every rung and vent placement is tracked. Only missing a kinesthetic beat of cold metal on skin to hit 9.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prove sideways time—signals early and tightens once: the 2.7° adjustment is the single meaningful turn that narrows options to irreversible. Cost is legible: lateral Elira’s terror + ozone scent = permanent perceptual shift. Pressure escalates under Accumulative lens: each new layer of peeled light increases density rather than causal chain. Could use one more micro-cost (frosty glove slip, burnt fingertip) to push into 8.8 band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from premise: the map of adjacent presents vs. the hubris of singular now. Final image—“time breathes sideways”—is a conceptual re-pricing, not a moral. Subtext is carried in silence: xenomorph wings fold back into rest, indifferent to human time-models. One minor lapse: “subdued awakenings” is named in the header, not earned as lived paradox inside the scene, keeping it shy of 9.0.</comment>

<comment>Voice is an accurate scientist-mechanic filter: calibrated diction (“chroniton drift,” “holographic principles”) yet sensory and compressed. Rhythm modulates—long cadence for twilight hush, staccato for lever pull. No head-hop; perceptual signature holds (“she thrived in the quiet” anchors every observation). Filter verbs are minimal and motivated. The ozone-cinnamon neologism is the exact sensory signature that makes the voice singular.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sentence variety is high; no template cadence or synonym churn. Figurative control is disciplined—“light peeled like onion” is the only metaphor, paid off by lateral folds. High information density: one sentence often fuses sensory, technical, and emotional data. Minor scaffold: “mechanically warm” is reused four times; trimming one instance would lift to 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Conceptual freshness: sideways time as accordion-fold magnetic breathing, not multiverse travel. The nexus-as-pivot rewrites familiar portal trope through hard-science metaphor. Risk is taken and lands: the adjacent self is not explained, only witnessed, yet causality holds. Specificity of comet-iron lever + Vol. 3 schematic keeps it from feeling like generic SF puzzle-box. Transformation test passes: story collapses without these exact materials.</comment>
