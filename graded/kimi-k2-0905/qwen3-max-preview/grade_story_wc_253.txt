<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The blank-faced performer’s interior contradiction—grief versus mandated joy—is embodied in the ritual whittling and flat narration; each micro-choice (burning pamphlets, sealing the bouquet) visibly costs them. The final “I miss you” proves interiority survives the void, earning renunciation. Moral ambiguity stays credibly unresolved: they comply yet keep hollowing. Only the Officers feel generic, capping at 8.7.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: pattern of engineered quiet → hollowing ritual → sealed “Permitted” box reweights grief into sanctioned artifact with undeniable conceptual cost. Closure is a Charged Poise: the new block waits, silence resumes, options foreclosed. Turbine-stall whisper supplies the cost beat. No orientation or causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Farmhouse/turbine dyad constrains every tactic: turbines mandate quiet, stalled blades gift 3-second true silence that triggers the final whisper. The dried bouquet functions as micro-setting, its crumble marks time. Spatial choreography clean from porch to Compliance Station. Environment charges final image without symbolic overreach.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—illicit grief versus forced joy—tightens when bouquet-box must pass scanner; success forecloses authentic mourning. Each whittling stroke pays visible price (wood surrendered without dignity). Agency: choosing compliance to keep carving hollows. Cost legible in certificate traded for interior erasure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges from iterated hollowing: grief remade into tolerable artifact. Final image reweights “Permitted” as quiet indictment of sanctioned erasure. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers. Subtext in ash = amnesty, combustion = cooperation—never stated, shown.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Flat, parchment-flat diction is character-specific, not monotone; rhythm modulates with turbine hush. Narrative certainty matches blank-faced mask; inference stays modest. Distinct perceptual signature: noticing grain resistance, bouquet brittleness. No head-hop, no register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm mirrors whittling cadence; no template runs. Dense lines (“shavings curling like ghosts”) advance atmosphere without purple overload. Minor scaffold: “they’d offered tea, smiled without muscle, and lied…” could trim, but doesn’t dull closure. Metaphors stay coherent.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: grief as sanctioned wood-hollowing performance. Turbine-mandated hush transforms eco-dystopia into intimate crucible. Conceptual risk—emotional void narrator—paid off via final whisper. Not derivative; premise fully realized.</comment>
