<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elias’s obsession with “texture” is embodied in tactile scavenging; the refusal to speak and the ritual unspooling of fragments at dawn show a credible, costly renunciation. Interiority stays concrete, never drifting into label-speak. The only missing torque is a moment where contradictory impulses collide on the page; the stance is steady rather than freshly tested.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the final image of continuing to collect/layer until the tide takes him crystallizes options and cost without exposition. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each fragment adds density, the pattern is taught early (“layered, filtered, waiting”), and the last beat reweights the premise—erasure is never clean. Cost is legible in the bodily toll of scavenging and the open-ended sentence of endurance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Container 7-Alpha, the immovable stain, and the tide-calibrated alleys constrain movement and supply new whispers; the poison label micro-setting charges the final image. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven—salt-stung silence, rust groans—never touristic. Spatial choreography is clean; high/low tide toggles the maze’s throat without orientation drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserving erased textures—tightens through accretion: each fragment narrows Elias’s path deeper into the maze and farther from official life. The tide rhythm forces upward climbs and reveals fresh cracks, a meaningful external pressure that shapes tactics. No reversal, but the deepening pattern forecloses return to citizenship; cost is visible in bodily fatigue and the open-ended sentence of endless collecting.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the accrual of discarded voices: erasure leaves residue, memory is contraband. The poison label’s return in the final paragraph reweights the premise—toxicity as both threat and proof of life. No moralizing; the closing image invites multiple readings (witness, curse, stewardship) without confusion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays locked to Elias’s perceptual filter; diction (“salt-stung silence,” “groan of metal”) is consistent and character-specific. Rhythm modulates with tidal breath, no template cadence. No dialogue, so no voice convergence; the narrative voice itself carries the port’s idiom without strain.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and stress; high-density lines (“songs without composers, tragedies without witnesses”) advance atmosphere without purple drift. No paraphrase loops or scaffold. One mixed metaphor (“quilt of whispers against cold machinery”) is earned by prior layering pattern and does not dull closure clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The bureaucratic-death survivor who curates erased voices is fresh; the port-maze as memory catacomb synthesizes noir and lyric modes without echoing familiar scenes. Risky second-person address to the nameless (“you were layered”) pays off by turning reader into complicit witness. Specificity of fragments (Mandarin lullaby, smuggler’s coded prayer) prevents generic anywhere setting.</comment>
