<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s renunciation of archival permanence is earned through her tactile micro-choices with the camera and the girl; the contradictory pull between creation and erasure is held in scene, not summary. Silas functions more as choral voice than active advisor, so the “relationship as crucible” bullet is only half-met. Interiority stays concrete, but one line (“joyful sorrow of creation”) flirts with diagnostic label-speak without full embodiment. Still, the final gesture of release carries visible cost and is rooted in prior causality.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the empty click reframes the entire premise—art without archive—as an irrevocable stance, and the cost is legible in the same sentence. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of signed notes, harbor sounds, and camera frames tighten into the final vibration. Orientation is swift; moonlight, pier, and camera are anchored by word 50. One transition (girl’s arrival) is clean. No causal breaks or retroactive patches.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Harbor moonlight is not backdrop; its reflections are recruited as notation paper for the signed score, constraining where Elara can stand and what she can “hear.” Camera body, rope creaks, and lantern flickers are handled in motion, not catalogued. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from Elara → Silas → fisherman → girl without teleportation. Micro-setting (camera-as-frame) directly enables the closing reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—ephemeral creation versus permanent record—is signaled in paragraph 3 and tightened when the shutter clicks with no film, foreclosing archival safety. Agency is present-tense: each sign, count, and final click narrows options under the Accumulative lens. Cost is visible: the music “will vanish with the tide,” a forfeiture stated on-page. No coincidence resolves; the girl’s arrival complicates but does not save.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the tension between silence as lack and silence as plenitude; no character sermonizes the thesis. The empty camera reweights from prop to philosophical pivot without authorial nudge. Subtext lives in gesture: the fisherman’s ribs “feel” the music, translating concept to visceral event. Final image—“remembered by no one tomorrow… forever be felt”—offers resonant ambiguity rather than moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><grade>Third-person lyric stays tightly filtered through Elara’s perceptual bias (waves as crescendo, lantern as rest). Syntax lengthens and shortens with the musical cadence it describes; no drumbeat monotony. Silas’s whispered dialogue carries subtext (“silence is the canvas”) that advances the conceptual stakes. No head-hopping; camera-lens metaphor is taught early and paid off at closure.</grade>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm modulates from long liquid sentences to the staccato “Click.” No paraphrase loops; each sentence adds sensory or causal information. Figurative stack is high but patterned, taught by line 3 (“spilled mercury”) and justified by the musical premise. One mixed metaphor—“vessel… for translation”—is minor and does not touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise fuses ASL composition with ephemeral art; the synthesis feels inevitable, not gimmicky. Risk: choosing a mute child as echo could read as sentimental, yet her barefoot arrival and hesitant hands particularize her beyond symbol. Harbor-as-score and camera-as-frame are fresh inflections that would collapse if swapped. No close echoes of canonical scenes; the final empty click is a new emblem.</comment>
