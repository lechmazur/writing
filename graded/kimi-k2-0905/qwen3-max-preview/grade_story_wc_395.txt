<comment>The memory-keeper’s compulsion to resurrect the “de-referenced” is rendered through embodied ritual—fingering the scorched patch, mapping 0707 across petabytes—so her final refusal to document anything feels like a costly renunciation rather than mere quirk. Interiority stays concrete: “silence in the archive screamed” externalizes guilt, while the patch’s “humming” against her sleeve keeps the lost crew present. The only minor drag is the vocational label “corporate memory keeper” upfront; once we see her lie to supervisors and burn burner phones, the contradiction between duty and obsession sharpens satisfyingly.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: at 07:07 she floods the substrate with resonance, avatars flicker, and she accepts lifelong haunting—cost is the perpetual “warmth of a drive that shouldn’t be spinning.” Accumulative lens holds throughout; each 0707 breadcrumb thickens textual density until the pattern combusts into silhouettes. Causality is lyric-not-linear, but every beat obeys the rule that deletion ≠ erasure, so the final stutter of her cursor feels inevitable.</comment>

<comment>Frosted-glass server mausoleums, “ghost pixels in corrupted thumbnails,” and the janitor’s wrist-tattoo turn the archive into a tactile tomb that actively resists her search. Micro-setting triumphs: the frayed patch’s “singed” threads and dulled silver physically bridge re-entry failure and data burn. Spatial choreography stays clean—she triggers the restore “in the deepest vault” where drives shouldn’t spin—so environment directly enables the climactic silhouette reach.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—“where do deleted files go?”—tightens when 0707 shifts from glitch to temporal coordinate, forcing her to decide whether to weaponize the archive against itself. One meaningful escalation suffices: the mass-resore act can’t resurrect bodies yet guarantees corporate reprisal and perpetual vigil, a visible price paid on-page. Accumulative pressure accrues through recurrence, not multi-reversal, satisfying lens demands.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of digital afterlife emerges from negative-space imagery—pauses, gaps, ghost pixels—never abstract assertion. Final image reweights premise: absence becomes presence, silence becomes chorus, so “sensed absence” is re-priced as living haunt. No moralizing, only resonant reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is a hushed data-dirge: compressed clauses (“Files didn’t ‘go’ anywhere… They unravel”), recursive anaphora (“She lied… She lied…”), and tactile tech lexicon (“substrate,” “quarantined DM folders”) create an archivist’s incantation. Rhythm mirrors server hum—short bursts emulate packet loss, longer sentences swell like buffered memory—without ever drifting into gimmick. Perceptual signature is razor-sharp: she reads latency bars like tea-leaves, hears warmth in dormant drives, so every sensory tilt feels character-bound.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet lyrical, each sentence double-duty: “Wore it to the archive’s deepest vault” simultaneously moves body and mythologizes object. No loops, no filler, no mixed metaphors; even poetic flights (“echo of forgotten songs”) stay tethered to acoustic data. Tense and pronoun chains remain immaculate across 700+ words.</comment>

<comment>Takes the hoary “ghost in the machine” trope and makes it new by treating deletion as failed re-entry—Helios-7 patch literalizes burnt data. Risky second-person address to absent crew (“They weren’t coming back. But they weren’t gone.”) feels earned because the entire text has rehearsed their negative presence. Final silhouette-hand toward patch rather than her fuses space-age loss with digital afterlife in an image impossible to swap out.</comment>
