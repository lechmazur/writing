<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>A contradictory interior (doubt vs pull toward convergence) is active throughout, but the final “trust” arrives as label rather than embodied cost. The ring’s hum and taste cue keep motives sensorily alive. Relationship pressure is absent, so the emotional arc is solo and credible. The abandonment of the ring lands as renunciation, yet the interior contradiction dissolves a hair too cleanly.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the ring points down, storm absorbed, and she steps into dawn with surrendered doubt. Causal chain holds—each taste shift forces a spatial move that leads to convergence. Orientation—who, where, when—anchored within first 80 words. Cost is atmospheric rather than personal, but legible in the forest’s greening and her pocketed ring.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Lavender bluff, aurora, and mycelial electorate create a textured micro-setting that is more than postcard; the soil she tastes becomes the ballot box. Spatial choreography stays clean across the bluff edge moves. Weather-as-archive is a fresh environmental rule learned through action. The ring functions as micro-setting/Tool that constrains final stance.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>A single dominant stake—will she surrender the storm-bearer and her doubt?—tightens when honey taste signals chosen-ness. Escalation is accretive (taste shifts) rather than adversarial, but each sensory switch narrows options. Cost is diffused into landscape; a sharper personal price would elevate. Agency is present in every step-taste-move.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of surrender vs. control emerges through tasted air and forest plebiscite, never sermon. The final image of pocketed ring + humming dawn reweights “terrestrially cosmic” from catch-phrase to lived stance. Subtext operates in silence: his rain dries without verbal farewell. Avoids tidy moral; resonance lingers in loam aftertaste.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays close to her perceptual filter—metallic tongue, ozone lungs—without head-hop. Syntax lengthens under aurora swirl, shortens at cliff edge, mirroring breath. Diction remains within plausible lexicon of field-science skeptic. No dialogue clutter; two spoken lines carry gravel vs. nod, maintaining voice distance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; paragraph breaths match aurora pulses. Figurative density is high but patterned early (“taste changed with proximity”) so payoff justifies risk. No filter-verb clusters; metaphor vehicles stay consistent (copper-ozone-honey). Minor scaffold: “terrestrially cosmic” appears twice—accepted as thematic refrain.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mycelial democracy + taste-based compass twist familiar eco-fantasy into fresh sensorial logic. Storm-as-archive personalizes climate grief without allegorical flattening. Risk of honey twee is averted by metallic / ozone counter-notes. Image of ring needle pointing down而非 north feels inevitable yet unforeseen.</comment>
