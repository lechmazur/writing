<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Interiority is lush and embodied—her “lovingly venomous” duality plays out in tactile pollen whispers and root-language, not labels. The bead-transfer beat crystallizes her centuries-old motive into one micro-choice that costs her existence, earning the shift from haunting to heritage. No contradictory impulses are shown in-scene; she drifts rather than decides, so the renunciation feels inevitable but not wrestled-with. Still, the single visible cost—her dissolution—lands hard and scales to the piece.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each shard intensifies the orchard’s suspended sorrow until the bead’s final pulse reweights the curse into fruit. Closure is a Charged Poise—“twilight-etched fruit” reconfigures meaning with undeniable conceptual cost. Orientation is taught by line 3 (“endless night…glass panes trembling”) and paid off when night remains yet bears color. No meaningful escalation loopholes; the pattern tightens once and holds.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Glass greenhouse, frost, and spectral pollen form a micro-setting that actively resists fruition; the bead acts as portable setting-within-setting, constraining every transfer. Sensory hierarchy skews to smell and tactile chill, mirroring the bride’s attenuated body. Final image of rune-etched fruit fuses environment with theme—setting literally bears the closure. Minor drift: “iron-boned ribs” mixed metaphor is forgiven under lyric register.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: transform curse into fruit; secondary: Elara must accept ancestral guilt. Tightening occurs when the bead’s resonance forces Elara to taste mercury-kiss memory—one beat, but it forecloses denial. Cost is legible: bride loses form, orchard loses stasis. Agency is attenuated yet present—Elara’s open mouth swallows consequence, not just nectar.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of debt-as-fertility emerges from image-chain: pollen → root-script → twilight fruit. No moralizing; the final taste offers mournful elation without thesis. Subtext whispers that love curdled into duty can still germinate if passed, not hoarded. The orchard’s perpetual night stays dark yet becomes generative—complexity preserved.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person float maintains consistent lyric distance; diction (“spectral pollen,” “arsenic and absolution”) stays within alchemical register. Rhythm swells toward the final split fruit, then cuts to short clause “sweet, bitter, and alive”—a cadence shift that teaches pattern. No head-hopping; Elara’s perceptions filter through bead-resonance, keeping focalization clean. Voice is distinctive without purple overload.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>High figurative density is patterned early (“glass panes trembling under frost-laden winds”) and pays off in final fruit-rind etching, so no penalty. No synonym loops; each metaphor extends body-botanic fusion. One paraphrase hiccup: “never lingering long enough…always arriving precisely” could compress, but momentum survives. Closure image is razor-clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: alchemical orchard + ghost botanist + debt-fruit is non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Risk in endless-night stasis pays off when night finally bears color. Specificity of rune-etched citrus rind prevents trope drift. Conceptual integrity holds—no retreat from lyric botanic logic.</comment>
