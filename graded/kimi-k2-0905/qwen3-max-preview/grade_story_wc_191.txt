<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied; the lore-keeper’s “singular” drive stays legible through tactile micro-choices (counting paces, brushing petals, choosing which self to keep). Contradictory impulses surface implicitly—wonder vs. dread as steps liquefy into others’ memories—but are not dramatized in a single beat of overt tension between wants; the final ascension feels inevitable rather than torn-from. Ruby-flake hum offers external confirmation instead of forcing her to question her right to ascend, muting flaw-exposure. Still, the renunciation of dominion carries visible cost: the orchard and artifact vanish, leaving only “quiet certainty,” an Earned Stasis that fits prior “wisely adventurous” calibration.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: flake resonance → mural decode → hatch → stair → throne-sit → timeline reset. Orientation is swift—goggles, dew, orchard veil inside 50 words; no penalty applied. Sunrise clock supplies tightening escalation; each beat compresses distance to erasure. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: she re-enters pre-dawn with no orchard, no tool, only reconfigured memory—a felt cost that reframes every prior step under Causal lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Hidden orchard rendered through synesthetic compression (“mist-laced air,” “liquid starlight”) that doubles as temporal interface; setting actively gates progress—veil collapses at sunrise, hatch opens only under flake. Micro-setting (ivy nano-filaments, alloyed moonrock hatch) constrains interaction and charges final image when orchard pixelates out. Spatial choreography stays clean across spiral descent. Environment’s erasure at end directly supplies the closure cost; satisfies 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“find stair before sunrise erases it”—is signaled in first third and tightens through literal countdown; grayscale bleed supplies visible price. Agency sits with protagonist at each turn: peel mural, insert flake, choose self. One meaningful reversal: throne offers not power but perspective, forcing renunciation of artifact and orchard. Cost is legible on-page; escalation coherent under Causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of ascent-as-memory, not conquest, emerges through concrete imagery (stair of frozen moments) rather than thesis. Final reconfiguration—“wisdom and adventure must walk hand in hand”—is implied by her relinquishment of relic and dominion; no moralizing paragraph. Subtext carries in objects: throne woven from “unsent letters” reframes power as archived regret. Ambiguity lingers: which timeline now holds her? Complexity preserved.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person POV stays tight to lore-keeper’s perceptual filter: brass goggles fog, flake hums against hip, murals “shift when not directly observed.” Diction fuses archaic (“sallied forth”) with nano-tech lexis without register drift; rhythm lengthens during descent to mimic temporal dilation, contracts at sunrise fray. No dialogue, so voice carries entirely through textured, purposeful narration. Patterned elision (“spiraling into earth and ether”) is taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Prose density high—most lines perform dual duty: “petals cool against her neck” grounds body while signaling starlight drip. Figurative control consistent: no mixed metaphors or purple swell. Sentence variety avoids template cadence; paragraph cuts tight. One minor scaffold: “she moved, counting each step, heart syncing...” could trim to “she counted, heart syncing,” but artifact does not obscure causality or closure. Strong read-aloud rhythm.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Combines biopunk orchard, memetic ascension, and retro-aesthetic murals into a coherent frescoe; throne-as-nexus reweights familiar “choose your past” trope through tactile stair of literalized moments. Risk-taking in non-linear collapse (orchard pixels out) sharpens stakes without gimmickry. Specific detail—“alloyed moonrock hatch with glyphs that slide”—anchors novelty in sensory reality. Transformation would fail if relocated; originality arises from synthesis and execution rather than concept alone.</comment>
