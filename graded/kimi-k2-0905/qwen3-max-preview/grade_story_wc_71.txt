<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The noticer’s interiority is textured and embodied—her barefoot chill, the “hushed blaze” in her ribs—but the piece stops short of letting her contradictory impulses collide in a single beat; the final renunciation is earned yet emotionally monovalent, keeping her just shy of the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the shard’s dissolution reconfigures the bay’s lullaby and frees the cottage ghost, cost paid in her permanent exile from the houses she loves. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each displaced object tightens the pattern until the final cadence shift releases the lingering architecture.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The bay’s salt-cool stones, the orris root’s violet exhale, and the streetlights’ butter-yellow lean are filtered through her synesthetic bias; the shard itself becomes micro-setting that constrains the final gesture. One hairline slip—“manicured hedge three blocks inland”—momentarily floats the geography, but the sensorial scaffold re-anchors instantly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—liberating trapped house-spirits—tightens once: the shard’s placement is irreversible, foreclosing her chance to keep the remembered rooms for herself. Cost is legible in the “soft thrumming” she surrenders, yet the escalation is a single crest; a second micro-turn could have pushed the band higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges as the ethics of gentle release: memory must be honored, not hoarded. The final image—the bay’s deeper lullaby—reweights every prior placement without moralizing, achieving Conceptual Repricing that lingers like salt on skin.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is a hushed, lyric third-person intimate whose syntax lengthens and contracts with tidal breath; perceptual signature is consistent—she smells architecture, hears wallpaper sigh. No head-hopping, no register drift; the shard’s “ghost-notes” and “emotional scaffolding” stay inside her plausible lexicon of synesthetic caretaker.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet aerated—each sentence carries scent, motion, and metaphysical freight without paraphrase loops. Only one mixed vehicle—“silence pooled like spilled ink” beside “butter-yellow glow”—momentarily muddies the sensory hierarchy, but the rhythm recovers before the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The conceit of architecture as lingering affective tissue feels inevitable yet fresh; risk lies in the quiet renunciation that refuses a dramatic haunting. Specificity of orris-root-as-ritual-tool transforms a familiar “ghost release” trope into an offertory of scent and tide, rendering the story impossible to transplant without collapse.</comment>
