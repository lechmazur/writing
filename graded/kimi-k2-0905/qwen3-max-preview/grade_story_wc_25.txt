<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lena’s interior contradiction—curiosity vs. risk—is dramatized in the coin pocketing and the choice to pass evidence quietly, not confront; embodied tension in “coin pulsing like a second heartbeat.” Micro-choice hierarchy visible: silent map hand-off >暴露Delgado. Flaw (curiosity) directly enables climax; renunciation of direct revenge costs her the immediate catharsis, earned by prior pattern of calibrated silence. Status dynamics legible only with Ruiz in one beat, sufficient for length; gait motif stays individual, not stereotype.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: storm noise → scrambled gait recognition → coin discovery → map → keyhole; each beat opens the next option. Closure is Charged Poise: coin/map transfer crystallizes a new tactic (whisper justice) with conceptual cost—she forfeits loud triumph. “Whisper carried farther than shouts” reprices prior silence motif; cost legible in her relinquished agency to Ruiz. No orientation drift; spatial anchors within first 120 words: geomagnetic storm, stacked containers, Junction Gamma-7.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Container labyrinth and sodium-lit gantry actively constrain movement paths and sightlines; keyhole placement atop gantry forces stealthy climb, mirrored in prose rhythm. Geomagnetic storm narrows sensory bandwidth, heightening reliance on gait—a causal environmental pressure. Coin warmth against thigh, metal smell, static hiss—all selective, POV-filtered. Setting charges closure: the very altitude and steel canyon acoustics allow whispered confession to rise, physical logic respected.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake: prove quiet truth beats loud power. Escalation tightens when storm erases auditory gait signals, forcing her to rely on new silent tools (coin, map); stakes sharpen from personal survival to testing her philosophy. Agency: she inserts coin, then chooses indirect justice—cost is surrendering confrontational satisfaction. Price paid on-page: assumption of risk entering Theta after dark, potential retaliation from Delgado.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges inductively: silence as asymmetric power. Subtext in gesture—hand-off to Ruiz’s measured tread—speaks louder than accusation. Final line reweights “echo” from metaphor to material truth in steel canyons, resonant without moralizing. No thesis statement; concept repriced when reader realizes keyhole is ear, not door.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person close stays locked to Lena; perceptual signature in gait cataloguing—“arrogant strut of foreman Delgado.” Diction—“rust-streaked,” “sodium lamp”—precise, within maritime lexicon. Rhythm compresses under tension: “Nothing happened. No click… Then—a whisper.” No head-hops; free indirect cleanly slips back to objective for confession wind-lift, intentional distance heightens irony.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High-density lines: “She didn’t confront… instead she refolded… sealing another layer of evidence.” No scaffold; metaphors spare and coherent (coin as heartbeat). Read-aloud rhythm varies via fragments and em-dash. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances choice, object state, or atmosphere. Copy clean: pronoun “she” unambiguous, tense stable.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: port noir + zodiac lock that is an ear; trades typical thriller brawl for paper-cut justice. Gait-as-biometric idea repurposed maritime choreography into silent forensics. Risk succeeds: reader re-reads for whisper logistics, payoff legible. Slight genre familiarity in shady guild coins, but execution particularized through Lena’s vocational lens.</comment>
