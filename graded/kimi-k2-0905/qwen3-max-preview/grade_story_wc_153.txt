<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Interiority is lyrical but drifts toward therapeutic self-diagnosis (“moment before deciding,” “fierce tenderness”). Embodied emotion is strong in the moon-stitching image, yet the apology-stakes stay abstract; no contradictory impulse is dramatized on the page. The renunciation (letters dissolved) is earned, but the cost is narrated rather than felt. Voice convergence under stress is avoided because she is alone; specificity of perception keeps her from archetype.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration—Charged Poise: the path appears, shard planted, smile earned, cost legible (“tasted of salt and forgiveness”). Accumulative/Textural lens holds; pattern (leaf-messages) taught early and paid off. Orientation is clear within 120 words; no teleporting props. However, escalation is gentle—one cadence shift rather than rising pressure—so the tightening feels more lyrical than consequential.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Mangrove labyrinth is rendered through tactile roots, aerial fingers, dew-beaded leaf-windows; body, tool (shard), and micro-setting constrain every beat. Spatial choreography is pristine; moonlight as healing device is a causal environmental rule that charges closure. Selective sensory economy—salt-thick air, black water—mirrors internal stakes without tourist catalog. The setting re-prices the final image: the new path is literally revealed by the labyrinth once cost is paid.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“find the moment before deciding”—is signaled early but remains conceptual; no concrete external consequence is risked. One tightening occurs when the letters dissolve, narrowing her option to speak aloud, yet the cost is spiritual, never jeopardizing safety, time, or social capital. Agency is present—she places letters, releases shard—but pressure stays lyric, not perilous. Sufficient for accumulative design, but too diffuse for high-band escalation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of unspoken apology emerges through condensation messages and salt-forgiveness taste, never sermonized. Subtextual silence is reweighted: “afraid” smudged to “alive” crystallizes the thematic pivot. Ambiguity is embraced—no moral is stated, only the possibility of choosing differently. Final image offers conceptual repricing: love is declared by the very labyrinth that once judged.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice is lush yet controlled; perceptual signature favors liquid, lunar, arboreal diction. Rhythm swells and breathes with spirits’ songs; no filter-verb clusters. No dialogue, so no voice convergence risk. Occasional elevated register (“conceptual repricing” level diction) slightly exceeds POV lexicon, but pattern is taught early and sustained; slippage is minor.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Prose is musical, but metaphor density borders on purple in high-pressure beats (“branches curled around her wrists like curious hands”). No mixed metaphors or simultaneity errors; spatial tracking perfect. Some template cadence in anaphora (“She didn’t… She didn’t…”) but serves ritual rhythm. Minor loop: “trembling” appears three times in close proximity; does not obscure causality but dulls final image slightly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: mangrove leaf-windows as condensation-message board is genuinely new. Gargoyle shard transplanted into tidal root-system re-enchants ecological magic. Apology-as-unspoken quantum state flips familiar regret trope into lyric speculative moment. Risk—lyric over causal—pays off in resonant closure, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
