<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Eleanor’s interior contradiction—grief as quiet practicality—survives on the page (“grief had crystallized into something quieter…like checking smoke-detectors”). The carving micro-choices embody her hierarchy of values: let the kettle burn rather than interrupt the listening cut. Final renunciation (setting the half-lion in light) is earned by the prior causal string: blank → listening → vessel-not-memorial. Still, competence feels slightly too safe—no mis-cut or blood is risked, so the flaw-cap stays minor.</comment>

<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: rain, cedar scent, and wood-curls accrete until the cadence shift (“She set down the chisel…placed the carving where the light touched it”) reweights the stake from preservation to vessel-making. Closure is Earned Stasis: refusing tea and perfectionism for a visible cost—scorched pot, ash-dust hands, unfinished mane. Orientation anchored by 80 words; no lens ambiguity. Could nudge 9+ if kettle’s boil-dry left a sharper material scar on the loft or carving.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Rain-beaded skylight and cedar chest micro-settings constrain every beat: humidity warps blank, watery gold dictates placement of final object. Kettle’s steam drags scent uphill, binding time to wood-grain; ash dust sticks to sleeves—tactile, lived. Spatial choreography holds without drift; no brand-name tourism. Missing 9+ gate only because environment never physically threatens the carving (no warp-split forcing a re-cut), so constraint stays atmospheric rather than tactical.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake: turn loss into vessel, signaled early. Tightening occurs as each wood curl literalises “contain”—material stakes replace emotional ones. Cost is legible: scorched kettle, unfinished lion, forfeited comfort of tea. Agency remains internal; could edge higher with one external impediment (a splintered grain that risks splitting the mane and demands a risky re-cut), but pressure stays coherent under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme—grief as rhythm, not enemy—emerges through concrete returns of “here and gone” in wood-curls, rain droplets, kettle clicks; no final moralizing. Final image of lion “eyes closed not in death, but in trust” reweights earlier mantra without stating thesis. Subtext in tactile refusal to rescue kettle crystallises priorities more cleanly than any declaration. Complexity acknowledged: love/terror/absurdity held together, not resolved.</comment>

<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Eleanor’s perceptual filters: scent hierarchy (cedar > tea), tool-wear knowledge, carpenter micro-metrics. Diction “rain-beaded,” “ash dust,” “curve of a whip handle” remains within plausible lexicon. Rhythm flexes: long breathy clauses during listening-cut, staccato “Let the water boil dry” under stress. No head-hop; filter verbs serve voice. Minor repetition of “here and gone” mantra could vary syntax, but reads as intentional ritual.</comment>

<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Line economy high: single sentence (“She wasn’t sculpting memory; she was trying to contain it—before it spilled again”) performs three jobs—negates memorial trope, states intent, raises spill-risk. Metaphors stay coherent: time as amber/frost fits preservation motif; no mixed vehicles. One scaffold trace: “here and gone” echoed four times; still functions as mantra, not churn. Read-aloud rhythm rises to kettle scream, then hushes—propulsion intact.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: circus-widow trope + wood-carving grief-vessel + “crystallized time” concept, all fused through tactile carpentry. Risk in quiet refusal of dramatic catastrophe pays off—stakes stay interior yet palpable. Transformation test fails if widow becomes generic mourner, but specificity of lion-tamer lore and tool-wear detail prevents that. Minor deduction for familiar rain-as-grief mirror; still, overall angle feels non-obvious and earned.</comment>
