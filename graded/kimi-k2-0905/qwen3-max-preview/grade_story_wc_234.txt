<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The alchemist’s interior contradiction—holding cool shell while stepping into furnace heat—embodies her scientific-romantic creed; Elias’s micro-choice to speak while she offers the shell crystallizes status shift. Their shared flaw (guilt/resolve) compounds rather than resolves, earning the final bridge. One epiphany (“Your guilt…is the pigment I’ve been missing”) risks tidy rationalization but is immediately embodied in the glowing shell hand-off, so the causality holds.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the glowing columella pressed into Elias’s palm externalizes guilt into material bridge, foreclosing retreat. Because/therefore linkage is tight—confession → alchemic transmutation → reciprocal return—so the causal lens holds with visible cost (tears, radiant burn, shared custody of ash). Orientation is secured inside 120 words by body, dusk, and obsidian monolith. No teleporting props; phoenix-ash and solstice dew were seeded.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Ember nexus isn’t backdrop; its heat licks ankles and dictates pacing, forcing the twilight vial’s use. Shell operates as micro-setting: its spiral ridge fracturing non-prismatic hues literally supplies the palette, constraining her next move. Final image—starlight threading veins—fuses body and tool, charging closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake: can guilt be transmuted into collaborative material? Tightening occurs when Elias’s admission forces the alchemist to revalue guilt as pigment, narrowing options from forgiveness to co-creation. Cost is legible: Elias’s soot-streaked tears, her glowing arm, the cooled shell they must return. Agency resides in her decision to externalize rather than absolve.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from material metaphor: presence is a substance denser than gold, measurable in the moment of reciprocal touch. No moralizing; the final line’s “next equation” keeps question open while reweighting prior images (shell, ash, dew) into collaborative pigment. Subtext lives in shell warmth—guilt literally transferred without spoken absolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical-causal hybrid voice sustains perceptual signature: logarithmic whispers, density of presence, scientifically romantic diction. Rhythm accelerates at confession, then breathes during powder-to-paint plan, mirroring pulse of nexus. No head-hopping; alchemist’s filter verbs (“feeling its cool spiral press”) stay motive-driven.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High figurative density is patterned early (“shimmer between heartbeats”) and paid off in final star-vein image, so earns its lushness. One scaffold loop: “not loud, not dramatic, but soft…” triple negative is deliberate cadence, not churn. No mixed metaphors; physical logic of heat-to-glow holds. Read-aloud rhythm precise.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Premise—alchemy that transacts in presence-density rather than gold—feels inevitable once shell fracturing light appears. Risk: lyric confession inside active forge, yet spontaneity is directed by material protocol. Fresh synthesis of hard-SF metric and romantic aura without retreat to either camp.</comment>
