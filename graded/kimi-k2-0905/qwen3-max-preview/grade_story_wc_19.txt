<comment>The child’s hunger for “flavors of silence” is viscerally embodied—clutching the doll, crawling upward, tasting sky-hush—so motive stays legible. The final renunciation (doll grafted to trellis, refusal to descend) crystallizes a value hierarchy we watched form beat by beat. Interiority is concrete (“ribs against too-close walls,” “tongue of the soul”) rather than clinical. One hairline slip: the phrase “starvation” for silence skirts diagnostic-speak; a fresher idiom would clinch 9-band.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the child lets go of fear, not the doll, and falls sideways into a new rule-set; cost is the irreversible split from the bunker. Causal chain holds: inverted gravity → hatch breach → trellis offer → stance crystallization. Orientation anchors (who/where) arrive by line 5; no penalty. Lens is Accumulative/Textural; density of silence “tastes” reweights the stake without causal reversals. Final image of moss-rooted doll threads the motif back to concrete, satisfying cost test.</comment>

<comment>Bunker steel, condensation beads, and thumb-high doll are tactile micro-settings that constrain every move. Xenial trellis is not postcard flora—its vines curl like “affectionate cats,” actively steadying the climb and deciding the landing spot. Spatial choreography stays clean: up shafts, through hatch, onto petal, sideways fold to garden—bodies never ghost. Environment charges the final image: moss receives the gold-thread doll, fusing setting + object + closure. Meets 9+ gate: setting dictates final tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“will the child taste an uncurated silence?”—tightens once, decisively, when gravity invert opens the hatch; no further reversals needed. Escalation is textural: each tasted silence layers density rather than narrows options, reweighting rather than redirecting. Protagonist agency drives every beat: choosing up, choosing to kneel, choosing sideways fall. Cost is felt: severance from father’s bunker = permanent exile implied, no safety net.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: engineered silence = control; wild silence = nourishment. Subtext is carried in gesture (lips brushing doll) and sensory reversal (sound → taste). Final image re-prices prior motifs—doll sprouting gold threads redefines “security” as organic, not welded. No moralizing sentence mars the exit. Complexity lingers: reader can’t tell if sky garden is utopia or afterlife, yet the child’s stance is final.</comment>

<comment>Lyric-accumulative voice taught early: “Claustrophobia wasn’t just fear; it was their first language.” Pattern holds—compressed metaphors, no filter-verb sludge. Perceptual signature is child-bound: ceilings are “low,” gravity “sighs,” silence “dissolves on the tongue.” Rhythm modulates: short clauses for crawl ascent, longer breaths for trellis arrival. No dialogue to fracture voice; single POV remains pure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>High-density lyric avoids purple overload by anchoring every figure to body or action: “droplets rose like silver beads” is immediately followed by fingers breaking hatch. No synonym churn or template cadence; sentence stems vary. One micro-loop: “silence…silence…silence” anaphora is purposeful, pattern-taught, paid off in tasting sequence. Closure line lands clean: “tasted of thunderstorms and lullabies—uncontained, unafraid.” No artifact touches final beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Premise fusion—gravity invert + silence tasting + xenial trellis—is non-obvious yet internally coherent. “Silence has flavor” could feel gimmick but is grounded in palate imagery from first paragraph. Doll-become-trellis graft feels inevitable in hindsight, not contrived. Risk—lyric anti-plot compressed into 700 words—pays off via accruing sensory density rather than twist. No recognizable template echo; voice owns the sky-garden trope anew.</comment>
