<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The painter’s insomnia and compulsive archiving are vividly embodied; her “wryly earnest” shield is shown, not told, and the final renunciation carries believable cost. Interior contradiction is present—she apologizes to a brooch yet refuses to name it magic—but the turn hinges on a discovery (journal) that arrives from off-stage luck rather than from her own agency, capping the score just below 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the exchange ritual reweights the premise—loss becomes legacy, insomnia becomes sleep—at visible cost (her best brush, the brooch). Accumulative lens holds: each artifact tightens the pattern until the rain-trail final image crystallizes the new equilibrium. The journal’s appearance is coincidence, but coincidence is allowed to complicate under Accumulative rules; it does not resolve the conflict, only re-encode it.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Tidal island as micro-setting: salt-crusted floorboards, stone well that defies salinity, seaglass shard on pillow—each object constrains or charges the final image. Spatial choreography is flawless; the rain trail the painter follows is a lived-in navigation device, not scenery. One hairline slip: “the place where the tide forgets to leave” is evocative but risks postcard shorthand; still, it is immediately grounded by the painter’s own admission she “often forgot to leave, too.”</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“thresh meaning from experience”—is signaled early and tightens through each unearthed artifact. The brooch’s pulse under moonlight is the single meaningful intensifier that reweights the stake from archival obsession to reciprocal haunting. Cost is legible: she forfeits her best brush and the brooch itself, accepting perpetual uncertainty as the price of sleep. Escalation is accumulative rather than causally reversed, fitting the lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges without abstraction: grief→artifact→legacy is enacted, not stated. The final image of seaglass re-prices the entire premise—convergence is not owned, only borrowed. No moralizing; the painter’s smile is wry, not wise. Prior motif (amber glow) returns transformed, creating resonance that lingers beyond the page.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Lyric, perceptual voice—“eyes raw, brush trembling”—sustains rhythmic control under insomnia pressure. Sentence length contracts toward the climax, mirroring breath. One micro head-hop: “locals avoided her studio” slips into collective knowledge, but the slip is brief and serves atmospheric consensus rather than interior leakage. Overall, voice remains singular, sea-salt specific, and unpunctuated by filter verbs.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence carries at least two jobs (image + interior, setting + myth). Metaphors are concrete and consistent—“cathedral arches,” “librarian of loss”—without purple inflation. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image (“seaglass shard… glowing faintly gold”) that recharges prior amber motif. Read-aloud rhythm is tidal, never monotonous.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Conceptual leap—emotional imprints encoded in amber via harmonic resonance—is fresh yet grounded in cartographer Elara’s journal, avoiding magic hand-wave. Synthesis of climate-loss, insomnia-art, and reciprocal haunting feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk taken: renunciation instead of revelation, sleep instead of answers—risk heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. No derivative echo; the seaglass-for-amber swap is an image no other story owns.</comment>
