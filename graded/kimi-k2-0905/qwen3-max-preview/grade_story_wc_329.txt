<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and embodied—her blistering fingers, heaving chest, juice baptism—without label-speak. Contradictory impulses (gentle bow vs. need to “uproot silence”) play out in real time. Final renunciation—walking away with only pulse—earns its cost through prior bodily expenditure and locust dust. One hairline slip: the grandmother’s off-page whisper is slightly convenient exposition, but it’s seeded early and paid for by later shell dust.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the orchard’s pulse under her feet reconfigures stakes without tidy victory. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each resonantly soft phrase adds density until stone softens and saplings sprout. Persistent constraint—aching arm, spent shell—shapes every late tactic. No orientation debt; sky-bridge, orchard, statues anchored by word 80.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Environment actively constrains: metallic apples dictate taste, sentinels’ metronomic patrol dictates tempo, sky-bridge vibration finalizes the cadence shift. Micro-setting—locust shell pressed to violin—literally alters sound texture, charging the climax. Selective sensory hierarchy (tactile ghost, stone dew) keeps economy tight. One 9+ gate met: setting constrains final choice—she leaves because bridge now beats with orchard pulse.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reawaken beauty—tightens via tactile cost: each bow stroke drains stamina, foreclosing retreat. Escalation is Accumulative: metallic tang → blush of real fruit; ticking stone → dew → sapling. One meaningful deepening at midpoint when first statue fractures; no reversal needed under this lens. Cost visible in blistered fingers and shell dust—price alters later tactics.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from husk-to-sapling progression; no explicit thesis stated. Final image—“tarnished wonder…molting”—reweights premise: beauty was never broken, only husked. Subtext in statues’ slow spear-lower carries more force than any declaration. One faint echo risk: “beauty hides in husks” nears proverb, but it’s grandmother-voiced and immediately materialized in shell use.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyric third-person limited stays inside her perceptual filter—sound as tactile ghost, juice as baptism. Rhythm modulates: long breath-like sentences during soft pressure, staccato fragments when saplings burst. No head-hopping; statues’ interiority implied only through external fracture and dew. Distinct diction—“resonantly soft,” “quiet thunder of pulse”—anchors voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Sentence variety mirrors musical phrasing; no template cadence detected. Figurative layering (“stone softening like candle wax”) stays physically coherent. One near-loop: “note by note” appears twice—spaced enough to read as intentional motif rather than scaffold. Information density high; each sentence advances image or stakes.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses classical Orpheus trope with biomechanical orchard; synthesis feels inevitable. Risk—using music to soften stone—pays off via haptic specificity and shell amplification. Transformation test fails if violinist or locust shell swapped: both are irreplaceable. Final “molting” reconfiguration reframes entire world without breaking earlier rules.</comment>
