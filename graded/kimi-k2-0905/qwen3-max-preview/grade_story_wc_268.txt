<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The exile-princess is vividly sketched through gesture, silence, and the tactile handling of the ink pellet; her refusal of the crown lands as earned renunciation because every prior beat shows her choosing truth-over-throne. Interior contradiction is present but stays general—“hollow echo of justice delayed”—rather than a momentary clash of impulses under peak pressure, keeping her just shy of 9+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a textbook Conceptual Repricing: the font’s glow rewrites the realm’s blood-rule in a single image, cost paid by the collective shame we feel in the gallery gasp. Causal chain (ink → font → revelation) is tight; the rune-of-drift pattern is taught early and holds; orientation is anchored by line 3. No lens ambiguity, no off-stage cheats.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Library-as-body: dust between scales, starlight on cracked marble, vellum tucked under glass—every object is handled, navigated, or altered. The ink pellet’s material chemistry directly constrains the climax, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography stays clean across the shard-cuts; only the “vaulted halls” line drifts toward postcard vagueness, capping at 8.8.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—truth vs. illusion—tightens once: the ink’s deployment forecloses retreat for both titan and populace. Pressure is accumulative/textural: each planted cipher raises the societal dosage until the font stains skin. The people’s belated recognition is a cost, but it lands off-protagonist; her own tactical cost (exile renewed) is implied rather than viscerally felt, holding the score just below 9.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges as the inverse of power: sovereignty resides in refusal, not possession. The final line reweights every prior crown-reference without moralizing. Subtext of complicity—“they wept… for the years they bowed to a shadow”—is carried in collective gesture, not exposition. No thematic echo violations.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person omniscient stays distant yet tactile, mimicking archival dust; patterned elision (“days bled into weeks”) is taught early and paid off in the constellatory pause. Syntax modulates from long breathy clauses to the staccato of revelation. No head-hopping; every perception is tethered to the titan’s covert gaze. Voice remains distinct under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is high-density lyric without loops: each metaphor (ink=pellet=grief) advances stakes. Rhythm accelerates into the font scene, then cuts to ash-soft steps. No mixed metaphors, no filter-verb stacks. The single near-repeat—“rune of drift” thrice—earns its place via ritual incantation rather than artifact churn.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Takes the stale “rightful heir” trope and flips it into a post-monarchic parable about the ethics of witnessing. The library-as-time-capsule and ink-as-genetic-truth are fresh syntheses; neither device feels grafted. Risky refusal of coronation is fully committed to, not hedged. Specificity—scaled fingers, iron gall chemistry—grounds the fantastical in tactile reality.</comment>
