<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elira’s tactile obsession with “texture” gives every micro-choice a sensory stake; the moment she strokes the halo and smiles through tears, her hierarchy of values is legible and paid for with her erased past. Interiority stays concrete—no diagnostic labels—yet the absence of another on-page character keeps relationship pressure off the table, capping the crucible test. Still, her contradictory hunger for knowledge that devours its own source feels lived-in and drives the final renunciation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: each sensory layer thickens until the photograph-ash climax reweights the stake. Closure is a Charged Poise—she caresses the halo, feeling duration itself, with the cost (hollowed memory) visible in the spiral of ash. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“living bridge garden”) and never slips; causality remains intact under the lyric pattern. One hairline slip: “quaking reverie complete” edges toward label-speak, but the image instantly recovers.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The garden’s hyperbolic arches literally bend time, constraining every footstep; the halo’s prismatic shadows color the final image. Selective detail—veined leaves, chiming silver flowers—filters through Elira’s haptic priorities, never touristic. Space stays coherent: she kneels, collapses against a pillar, reaches up; distances track. Environment and body are inseparable, charging the ending with felt duration.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—map the texture of time—tightens when each photograph dissolves, turning abstract desire into visceral loss. The midpoint yew-tunnel touch escalates by stripping her of anchors; the final caress forecloses retrieval of memories, paying the price on the page. Pressure accumulates under the Accumulative lens; no reversal, but a decisive deepening that reconfigures options. Cost is unmistakable: ash spirals instead of images.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through haptic images—grief coarse, joy porous—without moralizing. The final smile reframes the garden’s predation as terrible beauty, a Conceptual Repricing that invites reflection on art consuming its maker. No thesis stated; the ash spiral is the argument. Ambiguity lingers: is knowledge worth self-erasure?</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Elira’s nerve-endings: “taste rain that hadn’t fallen” is perception, not exposition. Syntax lengthens and contracts with her vertigo; diction remains horticultural, never academic. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk is zero. The halo’s “plucked nerve” image is precise to her sensorium.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary from short shocks (“Not burned. / Not torn.”) to sinuous coils that mimic hyperbolic curves. No scaffold or synonym loops; each metaphor extends the tactile premise. One mixed moment—“bruised violet” sky might clash with later prismatic light—but the halo’s fracture justifies spectral range. Read-aloud rhythm pulses like the fragment itself.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Combining topiary, retro-cognition, and non-Euclidean geometry feels inevitable here, not gimmicky. The garden that digests memory to grow its hedges is a fresh synthesis of eco-horror and metaphysical inquiry. Risky second-person address (“you aged a minute”) is brief and functional, not intrusive. The piece commits fully to its premise; no retreat into safe generality.</comment>
