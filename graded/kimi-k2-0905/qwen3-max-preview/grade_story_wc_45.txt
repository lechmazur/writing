<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The skeptic’s interior contradiction—clinging to innocent hope while dissecting betrayal—drives every beat; her soil-pressed thumbs and whispered names dramatize “bone-setting” as lived ritual. The renunciation of vengeance in favor of constellation-making is earned through micro-choices (kneeling, leaving the tooth) that visibly forfeit retaliatory closure. Emotion stays embodied: salt-and-honey syllables, cracked-open pity, dirt under fingernails. One hairline slip: “shrewdly innocent gaze” is label-adjacent, but the contradiction is immediately dramatized, so the flaw is cosmetic.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a perfect Charged Poise: the tooth’s underground pulse reweights the whole myth, making the garden a living threshold whose cost is the permanent cleft in certainty. Causal chain is tight: substitute body → skeptic’s pity → garden ritual → tooth left as marker → future townsfolk drawn into shared stewardship. Lens is Accumulative/Textural: each lyrical shard adds density until the final cadence shift (“like a heart remembering how to beat”) reconfigures meaning. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) is taught by line 4 and paid off at exit through the shifting maze hedges.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The garden is not backdrop but tool: backward-ticking clocks and cinnamon-ozone air constrain what repair is possible, while the maze literally reconfigures as she walks out—environment mirroring internal forgiveness. Micro-setting supremacy: the tooth-on-stone altar and rooting vine are handled repeatedly, their states tracked (glow, pulse) and charged in the final image. Sensory hierarchy skews olfactory/tactile, matching the skeptic’s earth-bound mending stance. One minor breath: “maps and memory” is slightly abstract, but the next sentence grounds it via thistle thorns.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can stolen children become sacred through deliberate tending—tightens once: the town’s myth shatters when the substitute’s lavender-stuffed chest is found, forcing the skeptic to invent a new redemptive ritual. Pressure is textural: each lyrical fragment (tooth, soil, vine, maze) accrues until the final pulse makes the cost undeniable—she forfeits both certainty and personal closure. No external antagonist needed; the cleft itself is the pressure. Slight reservation: escalation is single-crescendo rather than layered reversal, keeping it just below 9.0.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: replacement grief can be transmuted into shared constellation-myth if someone first kneels in dirt and risks being wrong. The tooth’s reappearance as underground heartbeat is a conceptual re-pricing that reweights every prior “stolen” object. No moralizing—final line offers quiet invitation, not dictate. Counter-readings linger: is this merely beautiful denial? The ambiguity is purposeful and charged.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is crystalline lyric cadence, taught in opening clause “forgiving skeptic knelt” and sustained through purposeful anaphora (“She yearned… She pressed… She smiled”). Diction stays within the skeptic’s spiritual-repair lexicon—no register drift. Perceptual signature filters every image through soil, scent, and syllable; even ozone smells of regret. Rhythm modulates: long breathless accumulations yield to final short sentence that lets the pulse land.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence adds new texture (wax limbs, porcelain eyes, folded letters) while advancing the accumulative design. Metaphors are coherent—“shard of moonlight” bridges tooth and night, never contradicting physics. Information density peaks in “stuffed with dried lavender and folded letters addressed to no one,” doing three jobs at once. One microscopic filter-verb cluster (“seemed to forgive”) is voice-motivated and forgiven.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade>
<comment>Folklore of changelings is rotated 90°: not abduction horror but restorative cosmology built from dental root and whispered names. The “constellation” trope is salvaged from self-help cliché by literal soil-planting ritual that makes stars out of errors. Structural risk—lyric mosaic instead of scene—pays off when pattern is taught early and closure reweights. Specificity throughout (lavender stuffing, backward clocks) prevents generic drift.</comment>
