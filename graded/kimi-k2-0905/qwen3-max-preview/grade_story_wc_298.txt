<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elira’s barefoot tread and card-cradling hand embody “reckless idealist” without label; her lullaby to the bone-wrapped oak is a micro-choice that stakes her value system. Kael’s spite-cloak and wrist-touch show a mirrored grief, giving the relationship crucible a pulse. The final image—roots weaving both destinies—pays the cost of her gentleness and his vengeance, earning the shift.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the orchard’s collaborative surfacing of cards reweights the premise, cost felt in Kael’s loosened grip and the visible constraint of living manacles. Causal linkage holds: because Elira inlays meaning, the orchard answers; because Kael attacks, the roots restrain; therefore their stances crystallize. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“catacomb orchard breathed”). No lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The bone-laced root system is not backdrop; it supplies the living manacles that constrain Kael’s assault and the resin that welds the card to the oak, charging the final image. Sensory hierarchy favors touch and dim luminance, mirroring Elira’s barefoot faith. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from her kneel to Kael’s lunge to root surge. Micro-setting (burned card against resin) functions as setting and tool.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—how the living carry the dead—tightens when Kael’s lunge forces Elira to defend her method; the orchard’s retaliation narrows options, making the cost of her gentleness visible. Escalation is causal: her singing → root response → Kael’s entrapment → shared reconfiguration. One meaningful deepening suffices; price is Kael’s forfeited rage and Elira’s exposure of vulnerability.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the tension between carving and weaving destinies; the final image of intertwined roots offers a non-literal answer that reweights both positions without moralizing. Subtext lives in gesture: the wrist-touch anchors, not soothes. No thematic echo; the orchard’s collaboration is shown, not asserted. Complexity remains: neither stance is fully vindicated, yet both are changed.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person intimate stays locked to Elira’s perception; Kael’s interiority is read through cloak, snarl, and loosened grip, maintaining distance. Diction—“root-knuckled soil,” “inverted grace”—is character-specific, not thesaurus drift. Rhythm modulates: lullaby cadence vs. clipped exchange. No head-hopping; dialogue carries subtext (“You trammel yourself more than you trammel me”).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence. Figurative density is high but patterned early (“roots threading through femurs and skulls like lovers”), paid off in the closing root-weave. Zero paraphrase loops. Strong verbs—“surged,” “welled,” “snarled”—propel. One mixed metaphor check: “cloak stitched from funeral shrouds and spite” reads as metaphorical fabric, not literal, so allowed.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Catacomb orchard is a fresh synthesis; tarot fragments grown by roots invert the usual necromancy trope. The burned Hanged Man reconfigures sacrifice from victim to agent, a non-obvious inflection. Risk—lyric idealism versus bone-warden nihilism—heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specificity (“resin welled like slow tears”) makes the image unportable.</comment>
