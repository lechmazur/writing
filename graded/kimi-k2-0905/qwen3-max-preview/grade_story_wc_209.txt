<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is lush and embodied—“fingers tracing the brittle edges,” “quiet thunder of understanding”—but the arc is almost entirely receptive: she notices, sketches, weeps, smiles. No contradictory impulse is dramatized in scene; the final surrender is foregone, not tested under pressure. The cost is felt, yet it arrives as recognition rather than choice, keeping the beat just shy of the 9+ threshold.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a crystallized Charged Poise: she lays her own postcard on the altar, completing the cycle of hidden layers. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—each discovered bloom reweights the stake—cost is legible in the lighter satchel and heavier heart. Pattern taught early (postcard anomaly) pays off in the final image; no causality breaks or orientation drift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Sensory selection is POV-filtered—“turpentine and dried lavender,” “cold air that smelled of stone and candle wax”—and the cathedral glass micro-setting directly constrains her bodily investigation. The amber pavilion and autumn leaves recur as charged mirrors of the nocturnal bloom quest. Spatial choreography is clean; no white-room gaps. Environment, body, and tool jointly shape the final painted cereus, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—decode why flowers bloom at night—tightens through each etched discovery, reweighting her artistic vocation. One meaningful deepening: the lily beneath the saint’s robe shifts the quest from curiosity to vocation. Cost is visible—three nights of cold sketching, satchel lighter, heart heavier—yet pressure remains contemplative rather than jeopardy-driven, capping escalation just below the 8.8 band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges via accreted image: nocturnal blooming as emblem of beauty choosing obscurity. Final postcard placement reconfigures the premise—she becomes one more hidden layer—without moralizing. The hymn older than cathedrals lands as Conceptual Repricing, felt not stated. Ambiguity lingers: surrender versus continuation, perfectly pitched.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays tight to the artist’s perceptual filter—selective attention to glass veins, moonflower trails—syntax lengthens and compresses with breath. No head-hopping; diction remains within painterly lexicon. Patterned repetition (“she still…”) is purposeful, taught early, paid off in the hush-cadence of the close. Distinct rhythmic signature under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm modulates naturally; no template cadence or synonym loops. Figurative layering is dense but purposeful—vehicles stay coherent (“shadows deepen into velvet”). One minor scaffold: “she wept then, not from sorrow, but from…” could compress, yet it does not dull the closure image. High information density; every line advances atmosphere or insight.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Premise—cathedral artisans encoding lunar botany in stained glass—is fresh, specific, and historically plausible. The night-bloom obsession reframed as spiritual inheritance feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Risky lyric accumulation succeeds without obscuring clarity. Only the postcard device feels familiar, but its recursive use as both clue and offering transforms the trope.</comment>
