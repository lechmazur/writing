<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The curator’s interiority is vivid—her bones humming like an overtuned fork—but micro-choices are few until the bathroom beat. That single beat crystallizes her value hierarchy (knowledge > taboo) with a visible cost: she accepts the stigma of “forbidden” and the cameo’s irreversible split. Earlier beats mostly observe; they don’t test her under pressure, so the full arc feels front-loaded rather than progressively earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the orchard reconfigures from “gap to be filled” to “field to be harvested,” a legible before/after under the Accumulative lens. The cost is conceptual yet felt—she forfeits linear identity, embracing an unstable multiplicity of selves. Causality is lyric rather than tight; the pistachio’s split is the single on-page hinge that reweights inheritance. Orientation is taught early (asteroid, orchard, atmospheric bubble) and pays off, so no penalty.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The astral orchard is not backdrop but instrument: petal-names of unborn selves literally dissolve into skin, constraining her future options. Micro-setting (the maintenance alcove toilet) becomes the crucible where environment and plumbing conspire to force revelation. Sensory economy is excellent—ozone/petrichor, embryo-star fruit—each detail filtered through her archivist bias. Spatial anchors hold across the zero-g drift; no impossible positions.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stakes are signaled early: silence on nonlinear inheritance vs. Archive dogma. The single tightening occurs in the bathroom when the glyph appears, foreclosing the linear-inheritance paradigm and forcing acceptance of sideways theft. Cost is conceptual—she embraces existential instability—visible in the closing image of blossoms bearing her own never-lived names. No escalation loop; pressure accretes lyrically rather than through reversals.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: inheritance as resonance across possibilities, not bloodline. The final image reweights the opening “gap between pages” into a harvestable field, avoiding moralizing. Subtext lives in the cameo’s emptiness turned vessel—an elegant inversion of legacy. No thematic echo violations; the question “What did you inherit…” is character-integral, not prompt-recitation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is luminous, archival yet synesthetic: “pollen of stardust,” “embryonic stars.” Syntax stays inside curator’s lexicon—cataloging, membranes, glyphs—without academic bloat. Rhythm modulates: long horticultural sentences slow, then staccato in the toilet beat (“The pipes gurgled. She waited.”). No dialogue to corrupt cadence; perceptual signature remains singular and uncorrected.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but controlled; metaphor stacks serve pattern rather than congestion. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or knowledge. Strong verbs—“drifted,” “kicking,” “split”—carry motion. Final line “awake” is monosyllabic closure after lush preceding texture, earning cadence shift. Minor register spike (“Conceptual Repricing”) is acceptable as diegetic concept, not narration.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The bathroom-as-epiphany engine is fresh, especially welded to cosmic orchard. Nonlinear inheritance is familiar SF territory, but reframed through archival silence and sideways theft rather than tropey time-paradox. Specificity—the pistachio shell from Earth’s last arboretum—roots abstraction in tactile rarity. Risk (lyric accumulative structure) pays off because closure reweights the pattern rather than explaining it.</comment>
