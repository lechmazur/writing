<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and lyrical, the barefoot stance and trembling glasses embody conflicted impulses; remembrance vs reignition crystallizes in the aria-whisper. The final renunciation—“it was never about winning”—carries visible cost as she seeds the hum and forfeits her solitary vigil. Micro-choices (kneeling, palms to grating, downward lenses) consistently reveal value hierarchy. Hairline slip: “awkwardly confident” is asserted once but not dramatized in a visible trade-off.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds: each lyrical shard layers density until the final chord reweights the stake from war to remembrance. Causal chain is interior but legible—because she listens, the stones answer; therefore the bay exhales and others converge. Closure is Charged Poise: options reconfigure under undeniable pressure, cost is the forfeiture of violent rebellion. Orientation is taught by line 3; no debt incurred.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setting is micro-focused: body (bare soles on cold alloy), tool (opera glasses), and ancient stones beneath the grating constrain every move. Shattered dome and rusted gantries evolve from ruin to bioluminescent schematic, mirroring internal shift without overt symbolism. Spatial choreography remains clean as others approach across tarmac. Final image of bay exhaling dust charges the closing beat; meets 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reignite rebellion vs remember—tightens when downward lenses reveal living script, foreclosing violence. Escalation is accumulative: each hum-layer narrows options until only communal song remains. Protagonist’s agency is attentional; cost is audible as thunder rolls and solitude dissolves. Persistent constraint: barefoot contact with stones required to sustain frequency.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: remembrance as rebellion’s next form. Subtext lives in gesture—glasses lowered, palms flat, aria whispered—never explained. Final reconfiguration reweights rebellion from gunfire to shared listening; moral ambiguity intact. No thematic echo; resonance grows from stones’ silver script and communal exhale.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person lyric sustained; diction (“ion thrusters”, “velvet cord”) stays within stargazer lexicon. Perceptual signature—stars blink like embers, dust exhales—remains character-bound. Rhythm modulates: long accumulative sentences swell toward thunderous chord, then cut to spare final line. No dialogue, hence no voice contamination.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentence openings avoid monotony. Figurative language is selective, never spills across peak beats; metaphors (“sky bruised violet-gold”) remain coherent. No loops, synonym churn, or template cadence. Information density high: one sentence often layers sensory, emotional, and mythic weight.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: barefoot opera-gazer awakens megalithic spaceport with auric hum—ancient stones beneath sci-fi ruin. Rebellion retooled from war to communal listening feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk of lyric non-linear structure is embraced and paid off in resonant closure. Specificity of cracked lenses on mossy glyphs prevents trope recycling.</comment>
