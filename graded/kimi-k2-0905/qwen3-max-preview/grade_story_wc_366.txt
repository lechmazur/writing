<comment>Elias’s grief-trained silence, embodied in the sea-glass anchor and the stone-cairn ritual, yields a credible, earned endurance that forecloses speech as a path while charging the final hum with luminous cost. Interiority stays concrete—‘a draft where safety used to sit’—and the micro-choice to stack stones under spectral pressure crystallizes values without epiphany overload. No contradictory impulses appear on-page, but the absence of a second character keeps relational crucible and status dynamics off-stage, capping the top band. The closure image of a ‘second heart’ pulsing against ribs is fully motivated by prior object handling and grief logic.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the re-lit lantern and louder hum reweight Elias’s stoic ritual into an audible beacon whose cost—perpetual solitude—is felt without exposition. Causal chain holds: wife-loss motivates silence → silence drives anonymous-letter ferrying → lamp snuff prompts sea-glass placement → stone cairn externalizes endurance → lamp revival ratifies the act. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) appears within 50 words; no lens ambiguity. Persistent constraint—grief’s mute vow—shapes every tactical choice and the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Environment (abandoned lantern room) and micro-object (cobalt sea-glass) constrain choices: the spectral snuff forces the glass onto the sill, and the cairn mechanics depend on stone-on-stone tension. Sensory hierarchy skews to salt, rust, and velvet dark, mirroring internal hollowing. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from skiff to spiral stairs to western window. Setting detail never stalls momentum; each noun (oil drum, wick-case, cairn) doubles as tool and emotional lever.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—preserving the fragile chain of anonymous hope—tightens when the lamp dies, forcing a visible trade-off: Elias must externalize his bottled safety into public stones, risking recognition. Agency is renunciation/attention rather than confrontation; the cost is the cementing of lifelong solitude. One meaningful deepening (lamp snuff) narrows options under accumulative lens; coincidence merely flickers the light, does not resolve it. Price paid—safety externalized—alters later tactics: he hums louder, accepting audible exposure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: unnamed grief converted into nameless kindness. Subtext operates in silence, stone angles, and the final hum—no reader needs ‘grief is love with nowhere to go’ spelled out. Final image reweights the sea-glass from private talisman to public beacon without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers: will anyone read the stones? The refusal to answer keeps complexity alive.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person close sustains salt-etched perceptual signature—‘feathered tax collectors,’ ‘bruised twilight sky’—distinct from generic maritime lyric. Rhythm modulates: long cadences for ascent, staccato ‘boots echoing like heartbeats’ for climb, then open-vowel hum at release. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk is zero. Elision (‘never spoke much—not to...’) is pattern-taught early and paid off in final louder hum.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or pressure. Metaphors are precise—‘velvet dark,’ ‘ghost-light’—and cohere with lighthouse physics. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by action (humming louder) that recharges earlier motif. High density: ‘oil drums, rope coils, replacement wicks’ triples as cargo, character, and metaphor for grief maintenance.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: anonymous-letter chain + stone-cairn code + spectral lighthouse transforms familiar grief-trope into quiet coastal myth. Risk—renunciation instead of revelation—pays off via Charged Poise. Specificity of cobalt glass and three-flat/one-tall/two-leaning cairn protocol prevents swap-with-generic. No echo of famous scenes; transformation test fails if names/places changed because cairn mechanics are locale-bound.</comment>
