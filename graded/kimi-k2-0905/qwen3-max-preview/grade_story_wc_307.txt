<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elira’s paradoxical youth/memory weight is vivid; her grief‐line “colleagues who’d called her mad” lands. Interiority stays concrete (“bare feet pressed to cool stone”). Kael remains a receptive blank; his sole micro-choice—bowing—feels symbolic not crucible-forged. The earned cost is Elira’s withheld final step, a CR that forecloses her own relief; credible but faint on-page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: stone-to-ripples pattern teaches delay early, reweights at starlit symbol reveal. Closure = Conceptual Repricing: “vanishing isn’t erasure—it’s preparation” re-prices both characters’ fates with felt cost (Elira’s exile from linear time). Orientation anchored by word 80; no ambiguity. One causal micro-turn: Kael’s gaze shift from waves to time-glyphs narrows option space.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Magnetic grotto & floating slab function as micro-setting that constrains pedagogy; starlight fracture is the charged final image. Sensory triad—humming crystalline walls, cool obsidian under soles, sycamore hush—filters through Elira’s researcher bias. Spatial choreography clean; stone’s trajectory tracked. Setting evolution: ripples → temporal notation is a causal re-tooling of environment, not mere mirror.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: teach emergence-through-vanishing; signaled paragraph 1. Escalation = density of withheld explanation; each slower ripple tightens anticipation. Cost legible: Elira’s perpetual solitude implied by backwards aging; Kael’s loss of naive timeline. Agency asymmetric—Elira orchestrates, Kael endures—but the pedagogy itself is the pressure engine; sufficient for lyric/accumulative design.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from withheld physics: absence as fullest presence. Subtext in silence: Elira’s unsaid “I will never re-age with you” hurts more than confession. Final image of static star-filled pond reconfigures prior stone-throw without moralizing. Resists binaries: neither escape nor arrival is pure; complexity earned through pattern rather than assertion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited clings to Elira; perceptual signature in geologic & temporal metaphors. Rhythm escalates from languid sycamore hush to staccato “Tomorrow, you’ll throw the stone.” No dialogue clutter; single line “Why?” carries subtext. Diction stays within POV lexicon—no academic leakage. Filter verbs minimal; sensory immediacy preserved.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose loops rare; one paraphrase ripple “each slower than the last / each carrying…” but serves cadence. Metaphor chain (dust, stone, rings, starlight) stays coherent under temporal logic. Sentence variety: long breath-cadence versus fragment “Tomorrow.” Opening and closing lines anchor voice and image cleanly. No artifact touches closure.</comment>

<comment>Backwards-aging mentor withholding pedagogy of vanishing-as-emergence is fresh synthesis. Risk in lyric accumulative structure pays off: still pond re-prices entire lesson. Specificity of magnetic grotto & temporal ripples prevents template drift. Conceptual integrity unbroken—no late rule patch. Memorable imprint: stone thrown upward into starlit timelessness.</comment>
