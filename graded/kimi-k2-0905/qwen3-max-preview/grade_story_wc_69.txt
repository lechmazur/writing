<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Elara’s interiority is textured—her lifelong habit of “subtracting noise” is dramatized through the low hum she offers the empty room, a micro-choice that risks further solitude. The contradiction between her public vocation (choir) and private retreat (silence) is active in-scene, not summarized. The final assent to teach the girl is credible because the text has shown her maintaining posture, voice, and attention despite decades of non-audience; the cost is the surrender of her hard-won quiet. Only minor deduction: the girl’s dialogue is slightly too articulate for first nervous words, a faint ventriloquism that briefly thins the realism.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the girl’s question reframes the rosette table from relic to potential instrument, and Elara’s “Good… you haven’t learned how to get it wrong yet” conceptually reweights failure as prerequisite to harmony. Causality is lyrical but legible—every reflective block is anchored to tactile present (finger on wood, hum in throat) and culminates in an offer that could not occur without the prior subtraction of noise. The velvet library, autumn leaf, and rosette object constrain the final choice: they literally provide the silent chamber where new resonance can begin. Cost is felt: the last maple leaf “trembling but not yet falling” images her own enduring vulnerability now reopened to pupils.</comment>

<comment>Setting is not backdrop but instrument: the zither-carved table functions as micro-setting that absorbs and releases sound; the velvet drapes absorb footsteps, making silence a navigable medium. Autumn leaf outside window is returned in the final sentence as barometric indicator of earned stillness. Spatial choreography is minimalist yet precise—reader tracks Elara from table to window to chair without drift. Deduction only for slight over-reliance on visual; other senses (touch of grooves, low hum felt in ribs) appear later but could have entered sooner for balance.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—whether to re-open herself to the risk of teaching—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens when the girl speaks. Escalation is accumulative/textural: each memory of former students raises the tally of what she has already lost, increasing the cost of trying again. Agency is renunciation of renunciation: she does not lunge for revival, but allows the possibility to inhabit her defended space. The price is legible but low-band visible—no concrete object or time forfeited, only the fragile stasis she nursed; hence stops short of 8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without aphorism: harmony as consent rather than control is demonstrated when Elara offers vibration instead of instruction. The vanishing-arts motif shifts from lament to blueprint—the rosette’s silent grain becomes architecture for rebuilding. Final image answers the thematic question: silence is not absence but resonance waiting for permission. No sermonizing; the closest to statement (“harmony was never lost. Only waiting”) is earned by 700 words of concrete choral memory and tactile table-touch.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Elara’s perceptual filter: “dust motes suspended like forgotten notes” is exactly how a musician would see still air. Patterned elision—repetition of “expectantly resigned” and “subtracting noise”—is taught early and paid off in the final exchange, becoming rhythmic spine rather than tic. Syntax modulates: longer sentences for memory, fragment (“Sit. Breathe.”) for instruction moment. Only minor slip: one near-overwritten line “world outside grew too loud, too sharp, too certain” triples modifiers; the triple is motivating but edges toward template cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>High information density: each sentence layers physical detail with emotional acoustics—velvet “absorbed footsteps, whispers, even the rustle of turning pages” performs both setting and metaphor in one breath. No synonym churn; “subtracting noise” returns with variant inflections (verb, noun, imperative) that prevent loop. Metaphors are coherent—maple leaf as “burnt parchment” fits library of archived arts. Opening and closing lines pass paragraph-cut test: removing either would delete the story’s pulse.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Familiar trope—wounded mentor persuaded to teach again—is refreshed by inversion: the pupil arrives already humble, teacher’s resistance is to protect silence, not ego. The rosette table is not quirky ornament but literal sound-hole now repurposed as altar of listening, a fresh synthesis of craft and caretaking. Risk of lyric stasis is taken and paid off: accumulative reflections tighten into decisive moment without external melodrama. Slight deduction for autumn-library setting approaching stock; rescued by specificity of acoustic architecture.</comment>
