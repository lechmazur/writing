<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction pulses throughout: she polishes to “awaken what it already carried,” not to conquer. Embodied grief—knees damp, glass warming under friction—anchors every micro-choice. The final renunciation (she will speak no sermons) is earned by the prior vow and the tactile hours of polish; cost is visible in her cracked joints and the village burns she refuses to forget. Voice remains singular, perceptual signature tight: mist “like sleeping dragons,” glass “humming” back at her skin.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each stroke of cerium adds density until the final prismatic projection reweights the stake from private vow to communal solace. Closure is a Charged Poise: the shard floats in the basin, refracting dawn onto villagers’ faces—options reconfigured, her silence now a resource, not absence. Orientation anchored by line 3 (“serpentine grotto”), temporal cue (“every solstice”). Cost legible: she forfeits speech and fire, accepts perpetual damp knees; the glass’s glow is purchased by years of salt-scoured surrender.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Grotto’s condensation breathes with her, mist thickening in cadence with polishing rhythm; environment supplies the only light she permits. Sea glass itself becomes micro-setting—its warming surface, softened edges, and final prismatic throw constrain every tactical choice. Spatial choreography clean: basin carved into floor, droplets kissing glass, villagers stepping closer. Final image fuses body, tool, and stone: her calloused palms hover over liquid constellations—irreplaceable moment charged by setting’s prior constraints.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</question><comment>Dominant stake: can she share light without consuming anything? Pressure accumulates via tactile repetition; each cerium stroke tightens the ethical calculus—glow must emerge without fire. One meaningful deepening: when the glass first fractures dimness into living color, the option to preach or explain is foreclosed; silence becomes the only honest tactic. Cost is visible—she accepts perpetual exile from speech and flame—though escalation is steady rather than spiking; hence, 8.7 not 9+.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulate matter: salt, silica, mist, scar. “Pearl of stillness” shifts from grandmother’s aphorism to communal lens, reweighting trauma into window, not weapon. No moralizing—final image is a child cupping sky, the watcher’s smile the only commentary. Ambiguity preserved: stillness is neither forgiveness nor forgetting, but a surface through which light passes without burning.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Third-person intimate hovers at psychic distance that can feel mist on skin and glass heartbeat. Syntax lengthens during polish, contracts at memory incursions—“Go.”—mirroring breath. Diction stays within village-born star-watcher lexicon; no academic drift. Rhythm orchestrates cadence of cerium, drip, and memory resurfacing; final paragraph yields to short pulses matching child’s whisper.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Sentences do triple duty: sensory detail, emotional state, thematic freight—“Each stroke was a breath, each rotation a memory weighed not in grams, but in grief and grace.” No scaffold, no loops; every adjective earns keep. Figurative logic consistent: mist as sleeping dragon remains alive but never battles the gleam of glass. Read-aloud ear varies naturally; closing sentence dissolves into monosyllabic drip, sigh, shimmer—flawless cadence match to earned hush.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Familiar premise—trauma-healing ritual—made specific through gem-polishing as anti-pyric method; erasure of fire is the fresh inflection. Stillness recast as prismatic technology, not stasis. Risk: lyric accumulative structure could have collapsed into prettiness; survives because tactile friction keeps sentimentality at bay. Synthesis feels inevitable: erosion + intention = window, not weapon.</comment>
