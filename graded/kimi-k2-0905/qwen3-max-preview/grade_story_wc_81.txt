<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Indexer’s interiority is concrete—pressing the stamp into her palm, salt-smeared spectacles, shorthand on waterproof vellum. Active stillness is shown through micro-choices: prying the fused ledger, cross-referencing tide tables, annotating the Master Index. Motive stays legible: witness, not vengeance. Final renunciation—accepting consequence over condemnation—carries visible cost as the stamp warms in her grip.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Causal lens holds: each discovery (ledger, sealed vents, Master Index) is a because/therefore linkage narrowing options toward the final “truth reclaimed” stamp. Closure is Earned Stasis: she forecloses silence by endorsing the codex, paying the cost of future danger. Orientation clean—sunken library, blackout, Cycle 7—by line 5. Cost is legible: “the city hadn’t drowned passively—it had been allowed to sink” reweights every prior clue.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Environment constrains every move: salt-clouded lantern beam, kelp-choked skylight, hollow pillars venting air. Brass stamp, bone stylus, waterproof vellum are micro-tools that decide tactics. Sensory hierarchy obeys crisis—she notices tilted lectern, watermark on beam, not panoramic vistas. Final image—stamp clicking codex shut—fuses tool, body, and archive into one charged poise.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“give the silenced a syntax”—tightens when each artifact proves deliberate erasure. Escalation peaks at Master Index reveal: “we knew… they buried us anyway,” forcing her to risk surfacing with evidence. No off-stage rescue; her decision to stamp the codex is the irreversible turn. Price is felt: blackout persists, water colder, path out longer—options narrowed.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from sediment: archival silence as civic murder. Subtext lives in objects—stamp’s bite, ledger’s fused cover—never sermonized. Final image reweights “stillness” from surrender to sanctuary without moralizing. Reader left to parse complicity; no tidy verdict offered.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is perceptually specific: lantern glow “trembled against moss-slick shelves,” shadows “like hesitant thoughts.” Syntax lengthens during reflection, contracts under pressure (“She didn’t flinch. Stillness reclaimed here wasn’t peace; it was pause.”). Diction stays within indexer’s scholarly lexicon; no filter-verb stacks. Rhythmic control heightens final ascent without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or stakes. Figurative language is sparse, taught early (“shadows that moved like hesitant thoughts”) and paid off in finale. High information density: “grain shipments rerouted before the flood—not for famine relief, but for elite stockpiles” compresses scandal in one line. No mixed metaphors; clarity intact at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Takes drowned-archive trope but reframes archivist as post-catastrophe indexer using inverted hypotheses—fresh procedural lens. Stillness reclaimed as active insurgency reverses expected survivor guilt. Brass stamp recharged from bureaucratic relic to seal of accountability—specific transformation. Risk lies in quiet ending; earns poise by making silence costly.</comment>
