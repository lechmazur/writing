<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Interior contradiction is rich—spy turned “quiet gardener” willing to surrender retrieval. Embodied ache (“burns still throbbed beneath her coat”) grounds agency. Micro-choices (kneeling, pressing microfilm, leaving pillbox) track a believable shift from operative to caretaker. One hairline slip: late “unused courage” summary momentarily abstracts the beat that dramatized it.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each weather image thickens the same moral texture. Closure is Conceptual Repricing—pillbox left to rust becomes on-page proof she abandons personal legacy for slow earth justice; felt cost is undeniable. One smooth, taught transition from climb to hatch. No orientation debt; “zephyr bluff” taught by line 1.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Micro-setting object (pillbox) plus terrain guide choices: hatch lip, snow fold, melt path. Mist, wind, and thaw serve as both camouflage and courier, constraining her hiding method. Sensory hierarchy favors touch (rusted metal, crust crunch) aligned with her caution. Spring thaw as decryption engine is fresh; setting fully charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“fix the record”—is signaled early and tightens only once but convincingly: planting the microfilm forfeits any future use of those names. Prudently daring trait produces visible trade-off (risk of exposure vs surrender of asset). Pressure accretes via weather, not antagonist, sufficient for 750-word scope. Cost legible: she walks away lighter precisely because she gives away her last leverage.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of reclamation through surrender emerges organically from concrete beats; no statement of thesis. Final image—pillbox rusting into bluff bones—re-prices prior spy tropes into ecological time, a resonant non-literal answer. No moralizing, only implication. Micro-recurrence of “tilt of the earth” reweights from season to moral axis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric distance stable; perceptual signature filters world through operative vigilance (wind shifts, foothold tests, antenna as “broken promise”). Diction stays within practiced spy lexicon. Occasional elevated cadence (“compost for what would grow”) fits climatic release rather than authorial flourish. No dialogue, so no voice leakage.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Information-dense lines (“coiled tight, cold as forgotten vows”) carry triple duty. Rhythm breathes—short clauses underfoot during climb, longer cadence at release. Only one paraphrase loop (“not to mourn, but to find…”) forgiven for lyric symmetry. Metaphors internally consistent (snow as cipher, hatch as promise). No artifacts touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: spy thriller compressed into ecological parable. Snow-as-cipher method flips tradecraft trope; leaving intel to decay rather than retrieve upends genre expectation. Specificity—etched pillbox coordinates, soil-root route—anchors novelty. Risk taken with quiet, accumulative structure; payoff legible. One near-echo of le Carré melancholy but transformed through plant-not-steal beat.</comment>
