<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The sentinel’s calm inventiveness is shown through embodied micro-choices (aligning the gnomon, folding the vellum) rather than labels; her contradiction—smiling while guarding silence—creates interior tension. Yet we never glimpse a private stake or fear that could be lost; the mission is abstract, so the final image feels more cool than costly.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Accumulative lens: each geometric trace adds density rather than causal turn; the blackout’s slow lift supplies a resonant reconfiguration (CR) that reweights the “cradle of sparks” from abstract to imminent. Closure lands with conceptual cost: dawn exposes the conspiracy, yet the sentinel’s own fate is untouched, capping the effect just below 9-band.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Light, stone, and shadow are filtered through the sentinel’s tactical attention; the sundial’s fracture and the gnomon’s moonless shadow charge the final image. The fort’s geography is sketched more than mapped—no distances or directions are fixed—so spatial clarity is approximate, not exact.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—the revolution’s ignition—tightens once: blackout + dimmed lanterns = single chance to plant ciphers. Cost is conceptual (exposure at dawn) rather than personal; no live option is foreclosed for the protagonist herself, so pressure plateaus rather than spikes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges as “meaning is a quiet weapon”: geometry replaces gunfire, silence replaces shouting. The sundial’s shadow reprises as a reweighted motif—what once told time now tells revolt—avoiding overt thesis. The final silver seep answers with understated inevitability rather than moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person intimate sustains a hushed, percussive rhythm; diction (“winking hush,” “cradle of sparks”) is character-anchored, not decorative. Compression is taught early (“She wasn’t guarding treasure…”) and paid off in the final blush of light; no head-hop or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>High information density: each sentence layers image, tool, and stake. Occasional poetic overlap (“sharp as dagger points, gentle as lullabies”) risks mixed-metaphor clutter but stays legible; no scaffold, loops, or filter stacks. Rhythm accelerates naturally as she slips below the sentries.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Revolution-by-sundial-angles is a fresh angle on insurgency; the blackout-as-opportunity inverts the usual “light of rebellion” trope. Specificity resides in the geometric cipher mechanics rather than in world lore; premise could transplant to another fortress with minor edits, limiting uniqueness.</comment>
