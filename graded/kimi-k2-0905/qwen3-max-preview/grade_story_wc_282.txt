<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Interiority is lyrical and embodied—her calibration ritual and thermal singing are vivid micro-choices—but no contradictory impulse is staged; she glides from observer to conduit without friction or cost, so the final stance feels foregone rather than earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: each chamber adds emotional density until the fossil’s dissolving reconfigures her solitude into shared signal. Closure is a Charged Poise—she walks on “humming” with purpose re-priced—cost is the relic’s loss, felt in the image of motes vanishing into stone veins.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Cave system is more than backdrop: lichen reacts to affect, tidal rhythm paces breath, fossil’s weight calibrates sensors. Environment literally steers her final act—chamber thermal lattice forms only here—so setting constrains and charges the closing image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“speak the last human feelings”—is signaled early; pressure deepens as cave asks “Who remembers us?” forcing her to answer with body-heat song. One meaningful tightening: fossil floats, foreclosing passive mapping and demanding participatory response; price is relic’s dissolution, legible on page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of translation versus possession emerges through fossil’s journey from relic to relay; ending reweights earlier solitude into communal resonance without moralizing. Subtext in thermal question—“Who remembers us?”—lingers unanswered, inviting reader to feel the cost of becoming medium.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays tight to her perceptual filter: salt, lichen hues, thermal ripples noticed only as data for calibration. Syntax lengthens with tide, shortens during spin—rhythmic control mirrors emotional crescendo—no head-hop or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers sensory and emotional data without scaffold. Only minor loop: “float—not levitate, not hover” is immediate clarification, not churn, and occurs pre-closure; no mixed metaphors or filter stacks dull the final lattice image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Post-human affect-cave mapping feels fresh; fossil-as-conduit twist grows organically from transitional-object psychology. Risk in thermal “singing” pays off—emotion rendered as Celsius gradients—creating an inevitable yet unforeseen closure image.</comment>
