<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied (“fingers trembling,” “joints stiff”); her calm expertise is credibly strained by the blackened knot, producing a visible cost. Motivation stays coherent—balance, not redemption—yet the absence of any contradictory impulse or personal stake keeps her just short of 9.0.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each knot’s release layers spectral density until the blackened knot detonates, reweighting the stakes; the final sanctuary sigh reconfigures meaning with undeniable conceptual cost. Causality is intact, escalation is legible, closure lands on-page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prism sanctuary and net function as micro-setting: light fractures and thread tension physically constrain her technique and charge the final image. Selective sensory detail (salt-swollen knots, liquid whispers) stays filtered through her professional eye; no filler.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—quiet itself—tightens as each knot’s silence is relieved; the blackened knot delivers the decisive intensification that forecloses her detachment. Cost is visible: sanctuary dims, her body slows, the fisherman’s raw confession lingers.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges inductively: silence as palpable residue that must be gently unknotted, not condemned. Final image of “lucid unrest” reweights the premise without moralizing, inviting reflection on communal grief stewardship.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric voice sustains a consistent perceptual signature—salt, starlight, hush—modulating cadence to match knot-by-knot ritual. No head-hop; diction stays within her artisan lexicon; micro-shifts in syntax mirror rising spectral pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentences carry double duty (action + atmosphere). No loops, scaffolds, or mixed metaphors; figurative language is patterned early and paid off. High density without clutter; final line earns its cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: spectral knot-unraveling as grief conservation. Ritual mechanic is specific to maritime culture and optics; premise could not swap names or places without collapse. Risky lyric structure stays coherent under accumulative lens.</comment>
