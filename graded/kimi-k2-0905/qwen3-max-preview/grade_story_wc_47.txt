<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Interiority is sensorial and embodied; the amber pact, moss-pressed palm, and “not fixed but becoming” credo give us a credibly flawed, non-performative arc. Micro-choices (photographing icicles, offering nectar, placing the print-out) steadily re-weight the stake. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene, so the 9-bar isn’t quite hit, but the quiet renunciation lands with felt cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: each moss-covered server and thaw-drip pattern thickens ambience until the final amber streak re-configures meaning. Orientation is anchored by word 50; the confession print-out placed under moss supplies visible cost. One tightening—confession swallowed by green—deepens rather than narrows, satisfying the single required intensification for this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Moss as living carpet, shattered skylights, rusted console—every tactile detail is filtered through her restorative gaze, constraining her ritual choices. The micro-setting (clay dish, pendant, print-out) literally occupies the same plane and is handled in motion. Final amber streak across the wall re-cycles the pendant’s glow, charging the closing image with earned resonance. No spatial drift; geography stays legible throughout the sweep.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</question>
<comment>Dominant stake—reclaiming her violated story by cultivating a green sanctuary—is signaled in paragraph two and deepens through each tactile offering. No antagonist is needed; pressure is the public shame she metabolizes into quiet acts. Escalation is tonal accretion: each moss stitch heightens the cost of exposure should she be discovered. The final burying of the viral page is the visible price that forecloses public rebuttal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</question>
<comment>Theme of reclamation through decay emerges via lived ritual rather than thesis: moss over servers, nectar over data, green over words. No moral is spoken; the closing “honeyed glow on the path ahead” offers charged poise that re-weights vulnerability as strength. Ambiguity lingers—she might still be found, the gate left ajar—preserving complexity. One near-abstraction “patient, quietly proactive tracing of beauty” is cushioned by surrounding concrete action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</question>
<comment>Lyric third-person hovers at intimate distance, sustaining a hushed, cathedral register that mirrors the “honeyed hush.” Syntax elongates in calm beats, then tightens into single-line paragraphs at threshold moments (“Tomorrow, she’d bring seeds.”). No dialogue, so voice distinction is intra-narrative: consistent diction, no filter-verb stacks, perceptual signature fixed on light, texture, and rot. Metallic chime image teaches the sonic pattern early and repays it at exit.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</question>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with scene pace—long sensual clauses for moss creeping, staccato fragments for the gate clang. Metaphors are internally coherent (server racks as “ancient monoliths swallowed by emerald moss”) and physically faithful. No synonym loops, no template cadence; each sentence adds either new sensorial layer or forward motion. Information density high: “She didn’t burn it” carries both secular rejection of purification and acceptance of slow decay.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</question>
<comment>The “abandoned data-center-as-monastic-ruin” is a fresh synthesis; icicle-drip cryptography as healing method feels non-obvious yet inevitable after setup. Pendant-as-contract rather than shield sidesteps talisman cliché. Risk is taken with almost-no-plot lyric structure, but coherence under accumulative lens keeps it from gimmickry. Could tip higher if one more beat showed the outside world’s possible intrusion, sharpening the sanctuary’s fragility.</comment>
