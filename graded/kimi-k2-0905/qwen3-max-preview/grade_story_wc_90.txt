<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Elira’s pacifist interiority is vivid—floating under joy, magnetized under grief—but the “shadow work” is declared more than dramatized; the mirror-self appears only at the threshold, so the internal contradiction never complicates a mid-story choice. The final embrace is moving, yet the cost feels cosmically distributed rather than personally foreclosed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure is a luminous Resonant Reconfiguration: the gate opens, the Tear dissolves, Elira crosses with earned lightness. Causality is poetic—emotional gravity calibrates the stitch—but the rule-set is taught only retrospectively; earlier beats rely on lyric declaration more than visible constraint, so the lens feels Accumulative/Textural rather than tight Causal.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>The ship is sketched in rust, solar wind, and failing gravity plates—each detail filtering Elira’s body and choices. Kwan Yin’s Tear and the viewport act as micro-settings that charge the final image; the birthday-photo tear re-anchors the entire dimensional logic, so the environment materially shapes closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—reaching the Echo-Realm—tightens once: the birthday-party tear provides the exact joy-frequency needed, forcing the final stitch. Cost is conceptual (her shadow detaches, the ship sighs into obsolescence) rather than tactically paid; the escalation is lyrical density, not narrowing options, fitting the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as compassion-as-nonviolent-persistence; the refusal to treat darkness as enemy reweights the premise at the threshold. The lullaby lyric and dissolving Tear reprice the concept of healing without moralizing, achieving understated resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric-technical, precise yet weightless—“needle-fine intent,” “gravitationally lighter”—with rhythmic clauses that mimic breath-based stitching. Perceptual signature is consistent: every image is filtered through Elira’s emotional barometer; no filter-verb stacks or register drift under peak pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Sentence music is controlled—varied cadence, strong verbs, zero paraphrase loops. One mixed metaphor (“lullaby made of rust and solar wind”) is permissible in lyric mode; it does not obscure causality or dull the closure image, so the read-aloud ear test passes.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The fusion of Buddhist relic, quantum tailoring, and emotional gravity feels fresh yet inevitable; the pacifist astronaut who sews spacetime with her own exhalations is a memorable synthesis. Risk-taking lies in the lyric anti-causal structure, but coherence holds, so the inventive core elevates.</comment>
