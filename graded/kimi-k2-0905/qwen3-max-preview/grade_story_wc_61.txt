<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The sentimentalist’s refusal to repeat ancestral fire-burning is strong motive, but interiority drifts into cosmic lyric rather than dramatized contradiction; no micro-choice is visible when the gear is laid down, so the renunciation feels asserted, not earned. Embodiment is gorgeous (“shimmering like heat-haze”) yet monotonous—no corporeal limits or fatigue under pressure. The gear’s transformation is credited to singing vibration, but the causal link between song and bronze feeling is asserted off-page; the cost is aesthetic, not personal.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the gear’s new soft pulses reweight the generational rule “burn to be bright” with visible conceptual cost—no flame, but glow. Lens is Accumulative/Textural; cadence shift from falling petals to dancing petals reconfigures meaning without causal chain, valid under lyric mode. Orientation is clear by line 3, but the single-scene default is stretched by iterative pings that read like mosaic loops; transitions are legible via refrain, so Track B holds. Cost is felt in the final image; trouble remains poetic, not tangible, keeping score sub-9.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Nebular petals, ionized plasma, and hydrogen clouds are lavishly sensory yet always filtered through the POV’s patience and glow-schema; selection is purposeful, not touristic. Micro-setting is the gear itself; its rust-flake and sighing teeth constrain the sentimentalist’s gentling tactic and charge the final lighthouse image, satisfying 9+ gate. Spatial choreography drifts—no clear ground plane—but the garden is intended as dream-space, so impossible positions are rule-consistent. Weather equals falling petals; descent slows in direct response to successful ping, proving environment evolves with event.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“share light without burning”—is signaled early; tension tightens once when the gear’s teeth begin to sigh, foreclosing the ancestral fire-path. Escalation is textural: each returning echo thickens warmth until the garden brightens; cost is diffuse—loss of blaze, gain of shimmer—visible but low-heat under Accumulative lens. No credible resource loss or tactical alteration occurs; serenity dominates, so pressure feels aesthetic rather than endangering. Closure reweights options, yet the trade-off is conceptual, not visceral, keeping score below 8.2.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the gear’s transformation: illumination without incineration. No character sermonizes; the final lighthouse whisper is image, not moral. Ambiguity is preserved—gentle light may be ignored—so complexity lingers. Recurring petals shift from elegiac to dance, recharging prior material without symbolic convenience.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is lush, compressed, and pattern-taught: “quiet sigh of falling petals” becomes refrain, paid off when petals slow to listen. Syntax mimics collapsing-star rhythm—long anaphoric clauses that exhale, then fracture into single-word pulses. No head-hopping; cosmic diction stays within POV’s patience-lexicon. Filter-verb stacks (“began to,” “continued to”) appear but serve cadence, not drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm is hypnotic, yet density of metaphor in every sentence creates micro-bloat; three adjacent “of” phrases recur four times, a template cadence that dulls peak beats. Mixed metaphors—petals as punctuation, nebula as cathedral—coexist without contradiction but accreting ornament. No scaffolding or synonym loops inside single beats, yet paragraph breaks follow identical arc (action / reflection / image), producing visual monotony. Closure sentence is clean, so artifact cap stays −0.4.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Fusion of cosmic garden, bronze gear, and emotional sonar is non-obvious and inevitable in hindsight. Generational trauma recast as stellar horticulture feels fresh; trope of light-without-fire is inverted through bioluminescent moss rather than moral plea. Risky lyric accumulation succeeds without causality break. Specificity—rusted teeth, ozone scent—anchors abstraction, preventing template drift.</comment>
