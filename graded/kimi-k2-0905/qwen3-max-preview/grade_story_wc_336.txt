<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elira’s interior contradiction—her quiet refusal to let wonder die—drives every micro-choice; the seed’s pulse against her ribs literalizes the cost. No stock labels; even “tears” arrive after concrete sensory memory. The closing tuck of the seed into her tunic is a renunciation that forecloses retreat, fully earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the seed’s glow answers dawn, reweighting all prior filaments of memory into an anchored future. Causality holds—each distilled memory tightens the weave until the crack of the shell is inevitable. Cost is visible in the sealed seam; she can never cross back.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The mossy parapet, waterfall mist, and obsidian seed are not backdrop; the seed’s iridescence is impossible without the spray-cooled air and ley-line tremor underfoot. Final image of the seed against her ribcage makes the body itself the micro-setting that charges closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single dominant stake—keep wonder perceptible—tightens through each filament she spins; every memory spent is an option foreclosed. The crack of the shell is the decisive intensification; no coincidence required. Price is the permanent expenditure of private memory now woven into shared world-fabric.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the accretion of specific memories into a collective chromatic resource; no character sermonizes. Final image re-prices wonder as something that must be bodily carried, not merely observed. Ambiguity lingers: whose memories will color the next child’s first snow?</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Third-person lyric remains locked to Elira’s perceptual sieve—wind “carries lullabies between realms,” seed “dreams.” Syntax lengthens and contracts with breath of her humming; no head-hop. Every noun is filtered through orchardist ontology: “graft,” “stanza,” “ley line.”</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops; each sentence advances weave or wonder. Figurative layer is patterned early—“each snip a stanza”—and paid off in the mother-of-pearl shimmer. No mixed metaphors; vehicles stay botanical or luminous. Read-aloud rhythm pulses like quiet breath, accelerating at shell-crack then subsiding.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The “color of wonder” as literal endangered hue is fresh, yet grounded in orchardist botany and grandmother comet-song. Risky lyric accumulation could have collapsed into purple, but disciplined sensory economy keeps it new. Transformation test fails if Elira becomes generic mage; her pruning hands make the concept singular.</comment>
