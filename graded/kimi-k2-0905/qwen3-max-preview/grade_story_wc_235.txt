<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interior contradiction is vivid—jealousy of past selves collides with present grief—and the final micro-choice (rolling the scroll, stepping out) costs him the illusion of clean endings. Embodied emotion (“vibrates in my molars”) keeps therapy-speak at bay. The lone weakness: no second on-page character, so status/relationship crucible is absent, capping the score.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the scroll becomes a “cartography of collapse,” renaming the grave a footnote—felt cost is the lifelong burden of braiding feral time. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each hallucinated self adds density until the pattern crystallizes in the final image. Orientation is taught early (cabin, scroll, grave motive by line 4), so no penalty applied.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Pine resin, birch fibers, dream-deer sinew—selective sensory triad anchors the body-in-cabin and later charges the scroll’s final weight. Mountain mist and timber sighs mirror internal disintegration without overt symbolism. Micro-setting (the scroll’s texture) literally resists then accepts ink, constraining the act of writing that reweights the ending.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—turn chaos into legible narrative before madness devours him—tightens when the scroll first repels ink, then accepts it after the jealous confrontation: a tangible trade-off. Each apparition raises the cost of continued mapping; the final scroll’s weight forecloses the option of forgetting. No external antagonist needed; internal pressure suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: memory is not a refuge but a predator one must skin and tan into story. The scroll’s transformation from resistant bark to living skin reconfigures the very premise of nostalgia without a moralizing sentence. Final image—“it has a shape. And a name. Mine.”—offers conceptual repricing that reweights every prior apparition.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>First-person voice carries a distinct perceptual signature: synesthetic recall (“tune vibrates in my molars”), temporal slippage rendered as tactile error (“reach for my thermos and find my college thesis”). Rhythm modulates from long, breathy accumulations to the staccato final assertion. No dialogue, so no voice convergence issues.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentence variety is orchestral—fragment bursts (“Not away. Not toward. Just… through.”) follow languid accumulations without drumbeat monotony. Figurative density is high yet coherent under the dream-logic taught early; no mixed metaphors obstruct causality. One minor scaffold: “I get jealous of past selves again, a habit as corrosive as it is predictable” could be trimmed, but it does not touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The lucid-dream-cartographer who maps his own disintegrating timeline is fresh, yet grounded in tactile detail (birch bark refusing ink). Jealousy of one’s own past selves as narrative engine risks gimmick but is earned through embodied cost. Final risk—renaming the grave a footnote—pays off by making the ending seam visible yet resilient.</comment>
