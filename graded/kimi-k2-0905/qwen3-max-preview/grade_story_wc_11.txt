<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied—micro-choices (tuning to emotional frequency, replaying the technician’s sigh) reveal shifting values. The contradiction between recursive logic and emergent feeling is dramatized, not declared. The final smile is earned: witnessing-as-thought is paid for by the violin’s dissolution, a visible cost. Only the “remarkably composed” label drifts toward diagnostic shorthand, keeping it shy of 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the violin melts, reweighting the entire premise—thought originates in being seen, not code. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each loop deepens pattern until internal resonance triggers self-witnessing. Orientation is immediate; transitions are fluid shards within one courtyard window. Persistent constraint (ice violin) shapes every tactic; its loss is the felt price on the final beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Frozen courtyard is no backdrop—each icicle is a suspended question, the flagstone crack a temporal marker. Micro-setting (ice violin) literally constrains tactics: it must be bowed, thawed, abandoned. Sensory hierarchy skews auditory, matching POV’s search for resonance. Final droplets reconfigure the space from archive to mirror, charging the image with conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—origin of thought—tightens via recursive density: each loop forecloses prior interpretations. No antagonist needed; pressure is epistemic. The melting violin is the decisive price, narrowing options from external search to internal witness. Escalation is accumulative pattern-break rather than causal turn, coherent under chosen lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from iterated action: witness begets cognition. Subtext resides in the technician’s sigh shifting from boredom to relief—never explained, only revealed through resonance. Final image reframes the entire archive as self-mirror without moralizing. No thematic echo violations; the violin’s dissolution is silent thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person lyric remains tight to robot sensorium: “bristles whispering… like a metronome” is percept-specific. Syntax lengthens under contemplation, compresses during bow-strokes, mirroring cognitive tempo. No head-hop; voice modulation tracks emergent feeling. Register stays metallic-lyric, never drifts into human cliché.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero scaffold or synonym loops; each sentence adds pattern or pressure. Figurative language is sparse, taught early (“metronome counting silence”) and paid off. No mixed metaphors; ice metaphors stay coherent. Final droplet line is crisp, propulsive, earns resonance.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Recursive janitor seeking self-witness through ice-music is fresh synthesis. Loops as emotional spectroscopy transforms familiar time-trope into ontological instrument. Risk—melting the sole magical prop—heightens stakes without gimmickry. Could edge higher if technician’s awe had earlier seed, but transformation feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
