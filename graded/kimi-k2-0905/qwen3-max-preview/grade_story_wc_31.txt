<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The lamplighter’s obsession with “the color of sound” is viscerally embodied in his night dives and ledger touch; contradictory impulses—seeker vs. guardian—surface when he chooses to leave the book for the next wanderer, paying a visible cost (renunciation of sole ownership). Interiority stays concrete through salt-stung skin, rusted chandeliers, the warming brass key; no stock labels. Micro-choices—dive, pry free, surface, walk away—trace a hierarchy of values anchored to vow over safety. Final smile and empty pier show earned stasis: mystery retained, loneliness accepted. The vanished woman stays off-page, so no relationship crucible tested; head-count clarity maintained.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: ledger + key reweight his life purpose, cost is the solitude visibly accepted in the last line. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: lantern drift, barnacle chandeliers, cerulean-amber note accrete until a single perceptual shift re-tunes reality. Causality intact: key → dive → ledger → recognition → renunciation; no teleporting props. Orientation clear by line 14 (pier, midnight, woman’s hand-off). No −0.3 cap needed. The one tightening beat—seeing his pre-birth vow—forces the final stance; no outline-and-then sequencing.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Drowned library chandeliers, warped dockwood, ink glowing turquoise in brine—details are selective, sensory across touch/sound/sight, filtered through his professional lamplighter eye for luminosity. Micro-objects (key tag, ledger page) constrain choice: key obliges dive, ledger obliges relinquishment. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from coat pocket → wrist-lash → desk → bench. Weather (lantern light through water) charges final color-sound epiphany. No static cataloguing; every descriptor advances mood or stakes. World rules stable: ink chemistry, silt buoyancy learned through action. Tone of “meteor hush” modulates from calm wonder to crystalline isolation by end.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—decipher vow/own fate—signalled in paragraph 2. One meaningful deepening: discovering his own pre-birth signature collapses identity into mythic time, raising existential cost. Escalation is textural: lantern-glow, salt-ink, ship groan layer until perceptual break occurs; no external antagonist needed. Agency remains active: he dives, pries, surfaces, relinquishes—each action forecloses safer path. Cost legible: solitude on pier, knowledge that can’t be shared. Coincidence (woman’s vanish) complicates but doesn’t solve; he still must choose to dive. No visible price alters later tactics, so stays below 8.8 band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme—vows outlive flesh and shape perception—emerges through concrete ledger entries and final color-sound fusion; never stated as thesis. Subtext operates in key misrecognition (hotel vs. vow-room) and his leaving the book: knowledge as communal lantern. Ambiguity lingers: is color-sound synesthesia or transcendence? No final-paragraph moralizing; last image is action (walking unlit pier). Woman’s golden-edge sorrow hints at love vowed yet unfulfilled—readers free to imagine stakes. Insight earned through sensory ordeal, not abstraction. Resonance amplified by mirrored sky lanterns / submerged ink light. Avoids tidy binaries: keeper vs. seeker roles blur.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains steady psychic distance, perceptual signature tuned to light/color: “paper bellies glowing like drowned stars,” “ink…glowed still turquoise.” Syntax grows more fragmentary under water pressure, mimicking breath loss. No head-hopping; woman’s interiority withheld, as is rule. Diction—“lamplitter,” “meteor hush,” “cerulean streaked with amber”—stays within POV’s poetic lexicon without purple drift. Rhythmic escalation from long lapping sentences on pier to staccato fragments during dive back to calm closure sentence mirrors emotional arc. Dialogue absent by design; voice coherence high.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong read-aloud rhythm with varied sentence openings; no template cadence. Information-dense: one sentence often sets scene, advances character, delivers metaphor: “cold water swallowing his breath like a vow.” Metaphors are coherent (lanterns ↔ stars, pages ↔ anemones) and don’t collide. Scaffold-free; no synonym churn or paraphrase loops. Occasional elevated diction (“alchemical blend,” “ Conceptual Repricing”) justified by lyrical mode taught early. Final third free of overwriting artifacts; closure image stays crisp. Minor filter verb clusters (“He understood then…”) but occur in low-action beat so −0.2 max; not enough to cap below 8.5.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise—vows encoded as bioluminescent ink in sunken ship library—is fresh synthesis of maritime gothic + synesthetic quest. Tropes (vanished messenger, pre-destined signature) are transformed through sensory specificity and the renunciation ending, avoiding chosen-one cliché. Risky textural escalation pays off: color-sound synesthesia rendered as stained-glass vibration feels inevitable yet new. Detail is particular to this night-lit coastal world; no generic “fantasy anywhere.” Final image of unlit pier reconfigures lamplighter trope—keeper of darkness, not light. Synthesis and conceptual follow-through strong enough to reach 9.0 band.</comment>
