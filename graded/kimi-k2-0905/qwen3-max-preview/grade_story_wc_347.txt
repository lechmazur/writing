<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The caretaker’s weary pragmatism is etched into every micro-choice—heel-dragging arrows, pebble-clusters, the off-hand surrender of the nut—while the interior contradiction (refusing to be heroic yet counting souls like ledger entries) stays live under pressure. The moment he relinquishes the nut costs him his only map of safety, paying the price for endurance in visible forfeiture. Voice remains singular, never sliding into archetype; even the girl’s single line sharpens his idiosyncratic gait. No safety-hedging: his flaw (resentful obedience) directly enables the rescue and seals his return to solitude.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the orchard’s frost feathers the branches as the caretaker’s invisible path system re-weights the curse’s rules—he can still walk back, but without the mnemonic nut, tomorrow’s navigation is already costlier. Causal lattice holds throughout: because he deciphers the nut, therefore he can leave subliminal trails; because he surrenders it, the chorus of ghosts is stopped but his own silence deepens. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are fixed by the second paragraph; the labyrinth’s spatial logic remains coherent as trails are laid and read. No late-rule patches; every mechanical bird and shale scrape is set up and paid off.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The cliffside labyrinth is not backdrop but tactical terrain: moss-patches, pebble gravity, and willow-sap function as mutable signposts that the protagonist weaponizes without touching. Mechanical birds act as surveillance infrastructure whose indifference sets the trap threshold—this constraint shapes the “leave no fingerprint” method. Sensory economy is biased toward the caretaker’s professional fatigue: brittle shale under boot, silver sap dripping on the girl’s trembling sleeve. The nut’s micro-grooves collapse orchard and architect into one portable tool, charging the final image when surrendered.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—preventing one more ghost-voice—tightens exactly once: when the caretaker decides the arithmetic of souls outweighs his own safety, foreclosing the option to keep the nut. Escalation is situational: atmospheric frost plus the girl’s visible tremor crystallize the cost of delay, forcing the nut’s surrender. No reversal is needed; the single deepening re-weights the rule-set so that tomorrow’s maze is already harder for him. Price is legible on-page: loss of the blueprint he spent weeks decoding.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as the economics of invisible labor: caretaking measured not in glory but in withheld ghosts, paid in forfeited memory-tools. Subtext resides in the silence—no thanked heroics, no tearful farewell—only the girl’s shiver and the orchard’s indifferent sigh. The nut’s migration from cipher to gift re-weights the moral ledger: knowledge hoarded vs. knowledge spent. Final image reconfigures value without moralizing: frost on branches = undeniable conceptual cost for the caretaker’s chosen arithmetic.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice carries a resigned minerality: “boots crunch brittle shale,” “ground’s earned it”—diction stays within the caretaker’s plausible lexicon. Rhythm mirrors trudge-and-pause motion; long sentences carry uphill fatigue, abrupt fragments mirror frost snap. Perceptual signature is exact-yet-offhand: he notices twilight-only arrows and auditory breadcrumbs because they are tools, not poetry. No head-hopping; the girl’s interior is unknowable, seen only through shiver and speech that sharpen his stance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</question>
<comment>Line density is high: single sentences layer gait, geology, and mythic surveillance without padding. Metaphors are controlled—“sun bled orange into violet” sets elegiac tone, then cede to concrete pebble physics. No synonym loops; “mechanical birds” stays exact, never morphs into brass drones. Rhythm modulates with climb exertion and frost deadline, propelling to the final sigh.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Familiar trope—cursed orchard, labyrinth, mechanical sentinels—reframed through logistical caretaking and subdued arithmetic morality. Blueprint-inside-nut is fresh world logic; surrendering it reverses the usual “key keeps you safe” pattern. Specificity of method (untouched impressions) and cost (loss of future navigation) transforms stock elements into inevitability in hindsight. Risk in quiet refusal of heroic theatrics pays off with earned weariness rather than spectacle.</comment>
