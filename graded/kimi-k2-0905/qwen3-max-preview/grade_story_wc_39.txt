<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The poet’s interior contradiction—survival-through-beauty versus altruistic sound-hoarding—surfaces in embodied beats (jar-by-jar labor, gifting without signatures). His final renunciation of penny-selling is earned by the causal chain of sonic gifts, and the cost is felt: physical disappearance, loft left humming. Micro-choices (handing the jar to the child) crystallize values hierarchy; flaw (restless vagrancy) becomes virtue that forecloses traditional success. No stock label-speak; perception stays salt-and-glass specific.</question>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each jar adds density until the music-box resurrection reweights meaning; closure is a Charged Poise—the loft humming at sunrise—where options (poet present vs absent) are reconfigured with undeniable conceptual cost. Orientation anchored by sentence 4 (loft, dunes, dawn). Escalation is the pattern break: from solitary hoarding to communal echo-gifting; the girl’s jar mirrors his own orphan moment, tightening the generational relay. Persistent constraint: every gift subtracts a sound from his private archive, a price legible in his thinning presence.</question>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Micro-setting of glass jars and music-box gears constrain choices: sounds must fit vessel geometry; repair limited to captured sighs. Salt-etched loft beams, frozen puddle, threadbare quilt—all filter through poet’s sensorium, never tourist-catalog. Final image of wind-teased jars humming recharges earlier “salt-wind slipping through cracks,” proving environment alters outcome. Spatial choreography clean: jars travel from dunes to doorsteps without teleport; weather (ice, dawn wind) directly halts or enables gifting.</question>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake: can ephemeral beauty outlast bodily death? Pressure accumulates via finite jar capacity vs infinite loss; each gift narrows poet’s private archive. Tightening occurs when music box—previously inert—demands his best capture (“Last Note of a Broken Church Bell”) forcing the choice to expend irreplaceable sound. Cost is visible: he grows literally lighter (disappears) as archive disperses. No coincidence; resolution is Earned Stasis—his absence forecloses future poems, loft left as resonant reliquary.</question>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges from pattern: translation across generations via non-verbal echo. Subtext operates in silence—the unlabeled jars are speech-acts of care. Final wall poem is CR: it reweights “vagrant” to “vessel,” making conceptual cost (erasure of author-name) undeniable. No moralizing; resonance is the girl clutching jar like heartbeat, proving continuity without thesis statement.</question>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyric-accumulative voice taught early (“salt-wind…like a whispered secret”) and held. Perceptual signature: auditory obsessions, glass timbre, salt taste. Syntax mirrors breath-catching labor—clause-stacking calms, then short fragments at gift-giving. No dialogue, so voice convergence risk waived. Filter verbs minimal; “he understood” is earned after dramatized epiphany. Tense stable; diction stays within poet’s plausibly self-taught lexicon.</question>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm: varied sentence lengths, paragraph breaths that accelerate at gifting, slow at repair. No paraphrase loops; each sentence adds new sensory cargo or causal beat. Metaphors (sonic reliquaries, lonesome splendor) remain coherent and physically rooted. Minor scaffold: repeated “still, he rose…” used twice for mantra effect—pattern taught and pays off, so waived.</question>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Premise—capturing sound in jars—feels fresh yet inevitable, borrowing from field-recording art but grounded in salvage poverty. Transformation: music box revived by atmosphere rather than mechanics reframes restoration as memory-transfusion. Risk of magical device accepted because rule (only captured air works) is early-taught and constrains tactics. Emotional specificity: echo of grandmother knitting needles could not swap with generic “lullaby.” Final image of loft humming alone is non-obvious payoff to salt-wind ingress.</question>
