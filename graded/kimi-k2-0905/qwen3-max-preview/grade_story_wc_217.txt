<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elira’s contradictory impulses—clinging to the feather yet letting it warm the child—are dramatized in a single, wordless gesture that costs her the talisman. Interiority is salt-cured and specific: braille-reading tide-ripples, the feather’s “humming barbs.” The final renunciation (empty hands, full heart) is the earned payoff of her “incomplete > beauty” credo, visible in sand on her knees and the boy’s changed gaze.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the patched kite’s “jubilant ghost” reframes loss into asymmetrical flight, with the conceptual cost that Elira forfeits her compass-feather. Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout: each ripple, feather-warmth, and paper fold accrues until the final image re-weights incompleteness as gift. No causal gaps; every beat (snap of string → feather laid → paper re-fold) is legible under the same lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The cobalt lagoon trembles in real time—storm-memory shards mirror the boy’s torn kite, constraining Elira’s choice to weave rather than mend. Body-as-setting (bare feet in wet sand, feather against breastbone) doubles as tactile geography. Final image—lagoon breathing beside her—crystallizes the new kite’s asymmetry; environment participates in the closure beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—beauty through incompleteness—tightens when the string snaps; Elira’s agency is to re-narrow options from “mend” to “weave,” visibly forfeiting the feather. Pressure is textural: each layer of torn paper intensifies the cost of letting go. One deepening suffices; the kite’s wobbling ascent is the earned reversal that makes incompleteness fly.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: asymmetry > symmetry, loss as lift. The drake feather’s re-weighting (talisman → gift) performs the conceptual repricing without exposition. No moralizing; the final whispered line is an image, not a lesson. Subtext hums in the boy’s laugh “like a bell ringing over wet stone”—beauty discovered in the incomplete, heard but not explained.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays within Elira’s perceptual range—salt-cured silence, braille-ripples—without ventriloquizing the boy. Syntax lengthens and breathes with tide rhythm; fragments (“Not the kite. / You.”) compress under pressure without head-hopping. Register never drifts into self-help; the grandmother’s lullaby is recalled, not quoted, preserving coastal idiom.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud cadence mirrors wave-sets: long sentence swell, then crest-cut fragments (“It’s crooked. / It’s glorious.”). No looped stems or synonym churn; each metaphor is single-layer and physically grounded (ink, bruise, twine-star). Only hairline slip—“burnished hush” appears twice, but the reprise is purposeful, charging the final line.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fresh angle: kite destruction as call to asymmetrical art; dragon feather repurposed as human compass. Risk—quiet, nearly wordless intervention—pays off in earned hush rather than heroic rescue. Synthesis feels inevitable: coastal poet + drake cast-off = patched dawn. Could notch 9+ if the boy’s voice had one broken syllable to sharpen the counter-point.</comment>
