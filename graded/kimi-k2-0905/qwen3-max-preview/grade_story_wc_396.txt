<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The peacekeeper’s interiority is concrete—her contradictory impulse to both hide and heal shows in micro-choices (pressing shard to mirror, whispering the question). The endurance stance at the end is earned through the slow accrual of mirrored glimpses; cost is visible in the shard’s hum and her “small surrender” breaths. No secondary character appears, so relationship bullets are waived. Flaw is present—she accepts incompleeness—but is not dramatized as a mistake that compounds; still, the renunciation carries felt weight.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the oval mirror returns her childhood self, reframing the shard from war relic to lens of mercy; cost is legible in the shard’s warmth and the open ice channels. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of glimpses builds density until the final reprise. Orientation is clean (lighthouse orchard, frost, night) by line 4. No causal breaks; the “weighted breath” functions as taught pattern, not coincidence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Environment (rusted lighthouse, salt-fogged mirrors, groaning ice) constrains pace and mood; the skeletal apple trees act as spatial grid for the mirror hanging. Micro-setting honored: the shard’s jagged edge and the beam’s rotation are tactile tools. Cold, salt, and creaking ice layers sensory input without checklist cycling. Final image of open channels is charged by prior ice-threat, reconfiguring danger into possibility.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—reconstitute her own capacity for empathy—signals early. Escalation is accretive: each mirror glimpse deepens the pattern, tightening the internal demand to “choose differently.” Cost is visible: shard warms, breath fog clears, ice literally opens—options narrow to act or retreat. No external antagonist needed; pressure stays coherent under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from iterated particulars: mirrors shift from nostalgia to moral challenge, crystal from wound to lens. Final whispered question is not moralizing but conceptual re-pricing of peace as active mercy. No reader-facing thesis; subtext resides in reflective surfaces and groaning ice. Ambiguity lingers—world may still harden—but the reconfiguration is legible.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays close to her perceptual filter: “brittle frost,” “skeletal apple trees,” “scar-map of lost futures” are idiosyncratic. Rhythm modulates—long breath-like sentences calm, fragment shards punctuate. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk zero. Compression in “weighted breath before reply” is taught early and paid off in final whisper.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; no template cadence or synonym loops. Density high—single sentences layer time, body, and metaphor: “boots crunch brittle frost as shifting ice floes groaned below like ancient beasts turning in sleep.” Only minor scaffold: two adjacent “never rushing, never hesitating” could trim one. Closure beat clear of figurative muddle.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses post-war peacekeeper with scavenged fortune-teller shard and orchard of mirrors—fresh synthesis. Risk taken: no plot beyond walking and looking, yet pressure holds through accumulative design. Specificity anchors novelty—salt-clouded oval mirror, diner-counter hand. Removing “lighthouse orchard” or “crystal shard” collapses the entire frame.</comment>
