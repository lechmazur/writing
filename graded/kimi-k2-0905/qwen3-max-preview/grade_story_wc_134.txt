<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation is legible—she wants to magnify small wonders—and the pearl’s pull on her is felt in trembling fingers and withheld breath. Interiority is character-specific: her noticing “laughter lingers after the joke is forgotten” is concrete, not diagnostic. The final smile-and-hand acceptance is a credible renunciation of control, cost paid in surrendering the pearl’s silence. No secondary character exerts pressure, so relationship crucible is N/A.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: pearl’s glow → shadows thicken → cave sings → memory restored → renunciation. Closure is Charged Poise: the cave’s ongoing song reweights magic as inclusive of darkness; cost is the clairvoyant’s loss of predictive certainty, visible when her hands tremble and the pearl goes dark. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“the clairvoyant didn’t see it coming… in the cave”). No因果 breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Crystal acoustics, mineral-light, and body-scale choreography (“palms flat against the crystal floor”) are vivid and filter through her mystic sensorium. The cave’s refracted light literally bends choices—she hides the pearl because illumination here is never direct. Final image of overlapping shadows charging the light feels earned, not symbolic garnish. Spatial tracking holds as pilgrim kneels, rises, crosses to her.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake: will she keep command over small wonders or admit darkness into her magic? Mid-scene tightening: pearl’s glow invites the shadows, narrowing her option to surrender. Cost is legible—loss of foresight, pearl extinguished. Agency is internal (acceptance) yet forecloses future certainty. Coincidence absent; escalation is because/therefore chain under causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: magic includes the unseen, the pause, the dark. No final-paragraph thesis—idea is crystallized in cave’s continuing song. Subtext in gesture: her fingers twitch toward pearl, later relax into pilgrim’s hand. “Brightness made brighter by darkness” is reweighted through sensory particulars, not assertion. Ambiguity lingers—are the shadows friend, foe, or both?—inviting reflection.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise; syntax lengthens in wonder, shortens under shock (“She hadn’t planned this. / She hadn’t seen this.”). Perceptual signature filters world through mystic metric—pendulums, quartz, mineral tears—never drifting into purple. Compression like “compressed silence” is fresh, taught early, paid off when pearl dims. No head-hopping; pilgrim’s gaze shift is observed from her POV.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with scene: long hypnotic clauses during cave’s song, staccato fragments at reveal. Information density high—one sentence often does description + interior + foreshadowing (“She hadn’t intended to use it. / Not yet.”). No loops or mixed metaphors; “overlapping shadows” stays consistent. Closure line “The cave sang on” is spare, resonant, unobscured.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Trope inversion—clairvoyant blindsided by her own magic—is non-obvious. Cave as resonant instrument, shadows as benign residue feel fresh yet inevitable after early cues. Risk of lyrical obscurity is taken but clarity holds. Specificity anchors fantastical: barefoot pilgrin in moon-woven cloak is tactile, not ornament. Without these exact images, thematic reweighting would collapse.</comment>
