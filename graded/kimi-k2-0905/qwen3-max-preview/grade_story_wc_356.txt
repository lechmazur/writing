<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interiority is lush and embodied—Elira’s olfactory world is rendered with granular, character-specific detail. Motivation (serenity within motion) stays coherent and drives every beat; her final act of replanting the husk is a quiet but costly renunciation that forecloses the bloom’s return. Micro-choices under pressure—inhaling the stench while villagers gag, sketching root-systems on wrapping-paper—reveal hierarchy of values without exposition. No contradictory impulses dramatized in-scene keeps this just under 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as earned Conceptual Repricing: the wilted flower reweights the village’s emotional rule-set, cost legible in the collective apology and “softer steps.” Causal chain holds—seed dormancy → collective doubt crests → bloom → societal shift—each because/therefore link tightens options. Orientation anchored by line 30; no teleporting props. Minor slack: the “tide’s thought” turn is declared more than dramatized, but the pattern is taught early enough to waive penalty.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The greenhouse, rope bridges, and wrapping-paper journals are not backdrop but tactical objects: the seed’s crimson tendril coils up the very shelf that holds bark-fiber journals, charging the final replanting image. Olfactory micro-setting—wet iron, distant lightning—constrains Elira’s timing and forces her barefoot sprint. Spatial choreography is immaculate; no floating boughs. Environment directly shapes the decisive act: she buries the husk in the same recycled paper that once mapped root-systems, completing the setting-to-closure circuit.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—equilibrium via bloom—signals early and tightens once: the stench forces a collective stance crystallization with visible social cost (villagers gag, apologize, soften steps). Protagonist agency is present but passive; she surrenders to the bloom’s teaching rather than steering the village shift. No tangible personal loss beyond the ephemeral stench; price is conceptual rather than felt. Escalation is atmospheric, not tactical, yet sufficient under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from olfactory metaphor: decay as fertilizer, fear as root-depth, wisdom as undercurrent. No explicit moral; final image of replanting in recycled paper reweights prior motif of “stillness within motion.” Subtext operates in gesture—her tears while others gag—rather than statement. The wrapping-paper archive returns as both literal and symbolic compost, integrating theme with object without sermon.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is consistently lyric-accumulative, with rhythmic, scent-forward diction that never drifts into tourist-catalog. Perceptual signature—Elira’s synesthetic taste of dawn moss—remains stable and character-bound. No dialogue to test, but internal monologue avoids diagnostic labels. One micro compression under stress: “velvet scream” is allowable peak shorthand; pattern taught early via “petals unfurled in silent symphonies.”</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>High information density: single sentences carry scent, philosophy, and foreshadowing (“corpse flower seed…when the tide’s thought turns”). No scaffold loops; metaphor vehicles stay internally consistent (roots/neurons, petals/palms). Minor purple tinge in “velvet scream” and “wildflower hush” but justified by lyric mode and paid off in closure. Rhythm breathes with paragraph variation; opening and closing lines anchor and re-charge.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: olfactory herbalism + corpse-flower revelation + wrapping-paper journaling creates a singular portrait. Risk in lyric accumulative structure pays off—no conventional antagonist yet societal shift feels earned. Specific detail (chlorophyll-stained bark-fiber, market-parcel paper) prevents abstract anywhere-setting. Transformation test fails if relocated to ground village; boughs and bridges are irreplaceable. Minor echo of “wisdom beneath chaos” trope, but grounded in scent-drunk specificity that feels new.</comment>
