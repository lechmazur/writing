<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The tuner’s sole agency is walking; her interiority is only the word “patient.” That limits contradiction and cost to a single, almost stoic register, yet the embodied rhythm-as-language is so consistent that the flat affect reads as stylistic vocation rather than under-written character.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a perfect Charged Poise: the fork left in the dry fountain crystallizes the transfer of agency from woman to town; rain, bell-swing and “next tuner” prove the cadence has become self-sustaining. Causality is lyric-accumulative: each footstep is a because/therefore beat that thickens the sonic field until the archway re-knits—cost visible in her final silent steps and the fork relinquished.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The archway keystone, fountain rim, and tuning fork operate as micro-settings that literally constrain footing and vibration; their return in the charged final image satisfies the 9+ gate. Broader town descriptors are selective and filtered through sonic noticing rather than tourist catalog, keeping density high.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“rebalance through collapse”—tightens via accumulating resonance: each new ghost-sound is an audible price paid for revival. The backward-ticking clock and tongueless bell’s first swing are visible escalations; the final silence of the tuner’s feet shows the option of continued presence foreclosed, satisfying cost legibility.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Theme of continuity-through-cadence emerges purely from footfall pattern and sonic imagery; no sentence moralizes. The fork’s stillness in the basin re-prices the premise: restoration is not ownership but passing the baton, an answer legible only in the final image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric maintains perceptual signature—sound-first noticing, tactile vibration, synesthetic “laughter brushed past her ear”—without head-hop. Syntax lengthens and compresses with walking tempo; ellipses in “backward, then forward, then true” teach the reader to read by cadence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary from short percussive heel-strikes to long rolling clauses that mimic echo-decay; no scaffold or synonym loops. Figurative language is sparse enough to avoid purple overload yet precise—“vibration traveled up her arm like a root seeking water”—and never muddies causality at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade>
<comment>The premise—foot-steps as tuning technology—is non-obvious and fully committed; ghost-revival via acoustic resonance rather than séance feels freshly synthesized. Risk of lyric repetition pays off when the final bell-swing is learnable only through the established cadence pattern.</comment>
