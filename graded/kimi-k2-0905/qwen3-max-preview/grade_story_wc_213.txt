<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The tester’s vocation-driven interiority is concrete—her distrust of sirens, her glacier patience, her refusal to rush “after the glue dries.” Yet the climactic bell-ring is triggered by sensor thresholds, not an active choice that visibly costs her; the moment remains observational. No contradictory impulse is staged in the final beat, so the renunciation feels mild rather than charged. Still, her perceptual signature is distinct and consistent, anchoring the lyric arc.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: micro-climate data accrete until atmospheric density literally pulls the rope. Closure is a Charged Poise—the bell’s single toll reconfigures valley trust without declarative moral. Orientation is secure by line 4; spatial anchors (mountain spine, belfry, rope) remain coherent. The cost is conceptual but undeniable: seventeen years of silence traded for one calibrated sound that reweights all future storms.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The wind-lashed sanctuary, hemp rope, and barometric levers are not backdrop but actuator: rope thickness determines trigger tension, altitude shapes ion counts, stone dust coats journal pages. Sensory hierarchy matches POV—she notes cirrus curls before color, salt-fray before sentiment. Final image of slack rope “like a contented cat” crystallizes earlier tactile handling, fulfilling 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</question><comment>Stake—restore trust in warning—tightens through atmospheric density, not interpersonal clash. One meaningful deepening: clouds “bruised purple and silver” cue sensor twitch, narrowing options to wait or intervene; she waits, visible price paid in breath held. Agency is attentional endurance; cost is deferred but legible in village pause. Escalation is textural, coherent under chosen lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges from pattern, not assertion: listening > noise enacted in every beat—boot whispers, journal swell, bell sigh. The final toll reframes prior false dawn without moralizing. Subtext carries in rope’s dormant serpent imagery, ion alignments—never named as redemption yet felt. Minor docking for near-aphoristic “favor listening over noise” refrain, but it is embedded in sensor mechanics, not tacked summary.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</question><comment>Third-person lyric achieves perceptual signature: “stained-glass eyes gazing into infinity” stays within her metier of attention. Rhythm modulates—long breathless clauses climb stairs, then shorten at sensor twitch. No dialogue, hence no voice convergence. Patterned elision (“after the glue dries”) is taught early and paid off in final raindrop promise. Diction remains within mountain-weather lexicon without register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Read-aloud cadence mirrors ascent: sibilant whispers mirror wind, then bronze resonance. Metaphors are coherent—rope as dormant serpent maintains tactile continuity; no mixed vehicles. High density: one sentence does scene work (“She mounted her sensors…”) while layering barometric, thermal, electrostatic threads. Minor filter verb cluster at sensor “twitch” line but immediacy regained in next breath. Closure image untouched by artifact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</question><comment>Premise—storm siren replaced by atmospheric bell—offers fresh angle on disaster narrative. Risk is structural yet pays off: climactic toll depends on 3.2-knot wind + 7° dew drop, a rule taught and honored. Transformation test fails: swap mountain for lighthouse and story still works, but specificity of ion counts and hemp braid keeps it here. Not genre-redefining, but avoids safety middle.</comment>
