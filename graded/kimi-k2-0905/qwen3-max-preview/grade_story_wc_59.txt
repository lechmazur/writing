<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The prince’s contradictory impulses—yearning for beauty while welding brass petals—are shown in scene, not summary. His interiority is concrete: “beauty was oxygen,” not a slogan but a lived panic that drives micro-choices like threading gramophone filaments. The final renunciation of certainty lands with visible cost: palace chains singing, mirrors shattering, his knees bloodied on marble. Single-POV baseline met; no stock labels, no voice leakage.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the world’s frequency literally retunes from steam to birdsong, the cost the palace’s physical collapse and the prince’s enduring not-knowing if the egg will ever hatch. Causal lens holds: every beat is a because/therefore link—egg → copper veins → tuning forks → resonance → skylight explosion. Orientation anchored by line 3 (“Below him…”). No lens ambiguity; persistent constraint (acid rain, mockery) shapes tactics until final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Micro-setting (brass cradle, velvet moss) constrains the final palm-press; palace chains and stalactites supply both physical vibration and acoustic metaphor that charge the closure. Selective sensory triage—mineral tears, rust perfume, “steam-whistle shrieks”—mirrors the prince’s narrowed attention. Spatial choreography survives the single scene; no floating bodies. World rules stay consistent: mechanics cannot birth life until grief is wired into circuit.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reawaken beauty—tightens when each calibrated pendulum forecloses another escape route; the egg’s glow is the visible price paid. One meaningful escalation: hypothesizing → wiring → palm-press → world retune. Agency remains prince-originated; coincidence absent. Cost is palpable: acid scars on fingers, chandeliers exploding, laughter of ministers now silenced by live birdsong.</comment>

<comment>Theme emerges from circuitry and feathers: creation is flawed, human, trembling. No moral stated; final mirrors floating like migrating cranes reweight earlier “winged myths” without commentary. Subtext in silence: the egg never speaks, yet its translucent shell refracts the prince’s grief into song. Emotional aftereffect is concrete—reader hears imaginary birds for minutes after closing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Voice is lush yet precise, syntactic rhythm mimicking pendulum swings: “if rust could be persuaded… if silence… might birth melody.” Diction stays princely—archaic “tunic,” “gramophone,” “chandeliers”—without lapsing into faux medieval. No head-hopping; perception remains body-anchored (“trembling fingers,” “barefoot on marble”). Micro-shifts in psychic distance compress under pressure: long cadences collapse into staccato “He pressed his palm.”</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>High density: “velvet tunic frayed and stained, his crown dented like a crushed beetle shell” performs characterization, visual, and metaphor in one breath. Occasional overwrought stack (“chromatic pulses, like dawn breaking through stormclouds”) but metaphor family stays coherent—light, sound, mineral. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances. Rhythm modulates from lullaby cadence to vibration hum matching climax. Closure line clean: “But that was genesis enough.”</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Familiar trope—last bird egg—made specific through clockwork obstetrics and grief circuitry. Risk of baroque excess is embraced, not hedged; extravagance serves the theme of excess needed to restart life. Transformation test fails if prince becomes generic visionary; here his beetle-shell crown and rust perfume individuate. Synthesis feels inevitable: only a dented prince could tune a broken world.</comment>
