<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Silas’s obsession with residue-driven memory is vivid and embodied; the micro-choice to pin the flower to his own coat shows interior contradiction and stakes. The “softly persistent” trait surfaces only in summary, not under pressure, so the final renunciation feels slightly under-cooked—no visible cost is dramatized on him. Still, his perceptual signature is sharp and consistent, and the closure’s Earned Stasis is believable within the lyric frame.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens is declared early via residue imagery and held throughout; closure is a Charged Poise where the lantern beam reweights meaning with conceptual cost. One transition (dock → lighthouse) is legible; no orientation debt. The flower’s reprise in the final drawer image cleanly reconfigures prior material, proving closure on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Opal dock, mist, and salt-cold planks are filtered through Silas’s collector gaze; the Edelweiss itself functions as micro-setting that constrains his final choice. Sensory hierarchy obeys his priorities—sound of gull pause, texture of brittle petals—never tourist catalog. Final lantern beam cutting mist is the charged image that reweights stakes, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—decode the stranger’s breadcrumb—is signaled in paragraph four and tightens once when the alpine shard arrives; options narrow from “what did he mean?” to “do I pass it on or bury it?” The price is conceptual—Silas accepts custodianship of an unreportable truth—visible in the lantern image. Agency is observational rather than active, fitting the lyric mode, so escalation is a deepening, not a reversal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of memory-as-inheritance emerges through concrete handling of objects rather than assertion; the Edelweiss shifts from clue to covenant without authorial comment. Final image of lantern guiding “only ghosts” offers resonant non-literal answer. No thematic echo or moralizing; ambiguity about Elara and the stranger’s pact lingers legitimately.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-limited adheres to Silas’s collector-perceiver diction—“echoes,” “gaps,” “residue”—syntax grows shorter under shard reception. No head-hopping; free indirect style is clean. Rhythm modulates: longer winding sentences for misty buildup, clipped fragments during memory shard. Distinct perceptual signature sustained; lyric compression is pattern-taught and paid off.</comment>

<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; no template cadence or synonym loops. Information density high—“opal dock shimmered under a veil of mist, its pearlescent planks slick with salt and silence” does three jobs in twelve words. Figurative language is selective; no mixed metaphors. Minor scaffold: “close his eyes, let the gap to speak” could lose “to speak,” but artifact never touches closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: maritime Gothic plus alpine memento in 700 words; residue-memory as plot engine is non-obvious. Risk of quiet observant ending is embraced and earned. Specificity—“sigh in a rusted hinge,” “ghost-song in warped floorboards”—prevents generic lonely-lighthouse tale. Transformation test passes: story collapses without Edelweiss and alpine shard.</comment>
