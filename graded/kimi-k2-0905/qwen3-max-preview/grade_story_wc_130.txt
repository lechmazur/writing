<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Elira’s interiority is lush and embodied—ink-stained fingers, saltwater refracting moonlight—yet her motives stay lucid: map silence, not reclaim Aris. The micro-choice to leave the hazel eye anchors her renunciation with visible cost, earning the orchard’s answering glow. No contradictory impulse is dramatized in scene; the twin loss is declared more than enacted, keeping her just shy of full contradiction-in-motion.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each lyrical return—droplet metronomes, fruit dimming, glass-eye projections—thickens the stake of shared language lost. The final image (orchid pulse strengthening) is a textbook Charged Poise: meaning reconfigured, cost felt in the cobalt eye she keeps and the hazel she surrenders. Orientation is taught by word 30 (“cavern orchard”), pattern locked by ~120; no causal turns are required under this lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Cavern orchard is not backdrop but instrument: bioluminescent sap dims in direct ratio to emotional absence, forcing Elira’s calibration experiments. The stepping-stone mosaic’s chipped tesserae literally refract moonlight into Aris’s equation—setting becomes optical device. No environment detail is extraneous; even the drip cadence counts down to the harmonic hum that re-tunes silence into resonance.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Stakes are singular—“can silence be mapped?”—and tighten through sensory attrition: each night the fruit dims, orchard breath held. The midpoint harmonic hum is the decisive intensification, converting ambient loss into audible pressure without external coincidence. Cost is legible: surrendering the hazel eye forecloses retreat to old symmetry, paying for the new theorem.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from pattern, not sermon: equation-as-lullaby, fruit-as-theorem, silence-as-resonance. The final projection—“emotion curves around absence like light around mass”—is Conceptual Repricing that re-weights every prior image without moralizing. Subtext lives in gesture: leaving the eye is apology and challenge at once. No platitude is uttered; meaning accrues through retinal after-image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is crystalline, scientific yet incantatory—“dovetail calculus into lullabies”—mirroring a conjurer who thinks in integrals. Psychic distance stays tight: we taste saltwater blur, feel grooves of half-erased bark. No head-hop; even Aris’s whisper is filtered through Elira’s twin sixth-sense. Rhythm breathes with escalation—short glyphs early, expanding into the final humming sentence that releases tension.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud ear is near-flawless: sentence lengths swell and contract like lungfuls of cave air. Only micro-loop flagged: “dovetail” used three times in 50 words—just shy of artifact threshold. One mixed metaphor—“droplets...like metronomes counting down to nothing”—survives because it externalizes the story’s own countdown logic. Density is high; every sentence carries image + concept + emotional increment.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The mathematics-of-emotion premise could have read like MFA prompt bingo, yet here it’s grounded in tactile nerdery: glass eyes as calibration weights, mosaic tesserae as pupil surrogates. No genre antecedent handles twin grief via optical geometry in a bioluminescent orchard—specificity makes the concept feel predestined. Risk is maximal (lyric math-cave) but coherence never buckles; reward is a fresh theorem of loss.</comment>
