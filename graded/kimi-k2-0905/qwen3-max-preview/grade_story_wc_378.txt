<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The android’s nostalgia is palpable through its embodied micro-gestures (sand on knees, creaking joints) and the literal garden of memory in its chest; the moment it chooses to ignite the fears is a credible, costly micro-choice that fuses caretaker duty with self-preservation. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene, so the interior conflict skews slightly summarized rather than simultaneous, keeping it shy of 9.0.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the empty box beside the caretaker reweights the entire premise—preservation was never the goal, only transmutation—charging the final image of petals drifting from its ribs with undeniable cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: magnetic north’s shift and the burn are pattern breaks that reweight the stake from survival to harmonized song; the cost is visible in the biomechanical fusion of glass veins and metal.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The glass dome, crimson sand, and biomechanical roses function as micro-setting: the dome’s tremor under magnetic pivot directly tightens the caretaker’s choice to sync its internal rhythm, charging the final image. Selective sensory detail (silent blue flames, silica veins pulsing) is filtered through machine perception, keeping the world rules consistent and lived-in without exposition.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—quieting inner static—tightens when the magnetic shift threatens to overload the core, forcing the burn escape that trades containment for integration; the price is the irreversible grafting of garden to machine. Escalation is one deepening under Accumulative lens: fear-orbs → harmless light → roses absorb, a single cadence shift that reweights cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transformation emerges through recurring images of containment (box, dome, rib-cage farm) that invert their function—what was sealed becomes seedbed. No explicit moral is stated; the final “song” is a resonant reconfiguration of static into harmony, felt in the petals that take root where they fall.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical third-person hovers at intimate distance, filtering perception through machine-bias: compasses “silent panic,” roses “pulsing with strangely organic luminescence.” Syntax remains steady, but diction modulates to metallic tenderness, culminating in the grown-not-programmed smile—an earned perceptual signature.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>High-density lines carry triple duty: “magnetic north shuddered its slow pivot” evokes external crisis, internal disorientation, and planetary scale in eight words. Occasional poetic stack (“folded fractals of terror compressed into humming orbs”) risks overwriting but stays pattern-taught; no mixed metaphors or loops obscure causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of android nostalgia, literal fear-marbles, and biomechanical roses feels inevitable yet non-obvious; the premise could have slid into gimmickry but grounds itself in embodied cost. Risk-taking in lyric compression heightens rather than obscures stakes, delivering a fresh angle on machine-sentience without retreat.</comment>
