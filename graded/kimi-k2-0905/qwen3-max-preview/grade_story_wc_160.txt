<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The machinist’s interiority is vivid (“she trembled—not from cold, but from the weight…”), but her contradictory impulses are told more than acted; the single on-page choice—copy equations onto her forearm—feels more emblematic than transformational. The cost is poetic yet diffuse; no durable constraint is left in her body or future. Still, the embodied tremble and the charcoal transcription give us a credible, if modest, Earned Stasis.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the surveyor’s chain, volcanic breath, and adhesive trace layer density until the harmonic recalibration reweights the floodgate purpose. Closure is the quiet CR—compassion encoded into metrics—paid for by the earlier tremble and the risk of overseer censure. Causality is lyrical rather than sequential; the envelope glue → ash → amphitheatory itinerary is acceptably motivated. Orientation is complete by line 5; no teleporting props.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Setting is the story’s engine: the eye-shaped fissure, geothermal sighs, and stone ribs all constrain how the chain is laid and what frequencies she can harvest. The volcano’s breath acts as a literal clock and acoustic amplifier, charging the final harmonic calibration. Sensory hierarchy obeys her engineer gaze—rust powder, brass tension, condensation drip—never sliding into brochure prose. Spatial choreography is immaculate; we track every foot of chain and every tier climbed.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reconcile mechanical control with mercy—is declared early; pressure tightens when the chain snags on the fish-and-woman relief, forcing her to translate erosion into actionable data. Escalation is textural: each new inscription or resonance adds ethical weight rather than external jeopardy. Cost is conceptual—she risks being judged mad—but invisible to downstream children; the price is felt more in cadence than in plot. One meaningful tightening suffices under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through recurring water imagery diverted from mouths to gears; no moral is preached. The encrypted compassion is re-priced when mercy is disguised as efficiency metrics—a sly, resonant answer to the opening “world had forgotten how to listen.” Ambiguity is productive: reader must decide whether stealth compassion is enough. Closing dappled light mirrors her inner compromise, avoiding tidy equivalence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Third-person omniscient hovers just above the machinist’s sensorium, filtering metaphors through her engineer lexicon—geothermal sighs, harmonic ratios—without breaking POV. Rhythm swells and contracts with the volcano’s breath, mirroring her own. No dialogue, so voice remains pure perceptual signature. Elision of downstream scenes is purposeful and paid off by the final covert calibration.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Generally high density, but occasional metaphor stacking (“caramel smear…bergamot and regret”) edges toward purple in a low-pressure beat. One paraphrase loop: “She trembled…She trembled again.” Otherwise syntax is varied, verbs muscular, no filter-verb clutter. Opening and closing lines anchor and recharge motif cleanly. No artifact touches the harmonic closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Floodgate compassion smuggled as engineers’ lullabies is a fresh angle; volcanic amphitheater as acoustic archive feels inevitable once revealed. Risk lies in the oblique climax—no valve cracked open on-screen—but the conceptual repricing justifies the quietness. Could be transplanted to another setting only with loss of acoustic specificity, so transformation is partial. No close echoes of canon scenes.</comment>
