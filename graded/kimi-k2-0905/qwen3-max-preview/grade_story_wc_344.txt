<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Interiority is lyrical but drifts toward cosmic self-explanation (“not to fix the world, but to understand…”) rather than embodied contradiction. No micro-choice under pressure tests her resolve; the gear-alignment happens *to* her. The earlier “solitude over love” backstory is recalled, not enacted, so the final renunciation feels foregone, not freshly paid.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Closure is a quiet Charged Poise: she leaves “empty-handed but full-hearted,” a credible RR. Yet causality is loose: the prophecy scraps appear once and never constrain tactics; mirrors supply memory montage but no because/therefore turn. The eclipse-forged keys arrive as fait-accompli, so the decisive breach—touching the constellation—lacks a prior test that failure could have met.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Frozen library above clouds is sensuously anchored—boots crunch marble, frost breath, moon-crescent keyholes—and the Hall of Mirrors reconfigures space into memory, charging the final image. Gear-as-micro-setting satisfies the 9+ gate: the levitating cogs constrain her gesture and become the ceiling engine she gifts to the archive. Spatial logic stays clean across the one-scene ascent/descent.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Stakes—“to learn the rhythm of repair”—stay abstract; no concrete price (tool, relationship, physical risk) is foreclosed when she accepts insight. Pressure accumulates texturally (mirrors, gears) but never tightens options: failure cost is never legible, so the final “understanding” feels like graceful receipt rather than earned renunciation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges as repair ≈ reharmonization, not restoration—an elegant Conceptual Repricing. Yet the insight is delivered in abstractions (“every broken thing holds a song…”) rather than a single re-framed image. Mirrors and gears carry it, but the emotional after-effect is diffuse because no specific personal loss is revisited with new weight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Third-person lyric sustains a consistent moon-cold register; diction favors liquid consonants and eclipse metaphors without crowding. Perceptual signature—“moonlight woven into fibers,” “driftwood nostalgia”—is distinct and POV-bound. No dialogue, so voice purity stays intact; syntactic rhythm modulates across ascent/descent, mirroring her lightening stance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Read-aloud cadence is fluid; sentences vary in length and avoid template churn. Occasional poetic lift (“silent symphony,” “blue-white gloom”) flirts with overwriting but stays within pattern taught early. No paraphrase loops or filter-verb stacks; final image is clean. Metaphors stay coherent—gears as constellation scars—though “time’s own fractured heartbeat” nudges toward mixed personification.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Combines eclipse locksmith + frozen sky-library + mirror-memory + gear-orrery in a synthesis that feels inevitable rather than collage. The core inversion—“repair is not restoration but reharmonization”—is fresh, and the letting-go ending avoids triumph cliché. Risk is moderate: concept-heavy lyric mode could collapse into tableau, but coherence holds.</comment>
