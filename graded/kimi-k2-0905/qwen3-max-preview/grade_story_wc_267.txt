<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The bellhop’s trembling hands, bolt theft, and final re-seating of the bench are concrete, embodied choices that externalize his internal war between safety and sound; the contradiction is dramatized, not declared. The mute vow “stitched into his marrow” risks a touch of label-speak, but the regenerating nerves give every tactile moment a cost that keeps the arc credible. The arrival of the child with whistle in mitt forces the decisive micro-choice that re-opens the piano, earning the renunciation of silence with a felt price. One more beat of visible hesitation at the keys would have pushed this into 9-band territory.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the single struck middle C shakes loose the fortress’s frozen heart and reweights every prior silence with audible cost. The bolt’s removal and return is the taught causal spine; the stain on the stair works as accumulative oracle, its color shift paying off in the final amber flush. Orientation is clean—fortress, snow, bellhop, and muteness are anchored within the first 120 words. The only restraint from 9+ is a hairline wish for a sharper because/therefore linkage between the child’s whistle threat and the exact moment he decides tonight is the night.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The cobalt walls, bolt-less bench, and color-shifting stain are not picturesque flourishes—they are the machinery of choice: the bolt physically prevents music, the stain meters psychological winter. Sensory triage is POV-filtered (“cold bite his skin” regenerates nerves), guiding every action. Spatial choreography is immaculate; we track his spiral ascent, the hollow bench leg, the bolt’s screw-back. Environment constrains the final image—middle C rings against cobalt glass, reconfiguring both atmosphere and meaning—meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“is safety worth silence?”—is signaled in paragraph one and tightens through the bolt’s absence. The single meaningful intensification occurs when the child’s whistle makes the abstract threat concrete, forcing the bolt’s restoration; this narrows options from perpetual silence to singular note. Cost is legible: the first piano sound risks literal structural collapse, a price foreshadowed by the east-wing cave-in memory. Under causal lens, escalation is efficient; one decisive turn suffices, though a mid-story micro-complication could have lifted it into 9-band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the bolt itself: safety purchased by self-silencing becomes its own mausoleum. The final note re-prices the premise—sound now includes mortal risk, yet silence is “unpardonable.” Subtext lives in gesture: the bench sighs as it regains its bolt, wordlessly confessing years of theft. No moral is stated; the lingering resonance is the space between notes where safety and sacrifice coexist, fulfilling the 9+ test.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person POV remains tightly latched to the bellhop’s perceptual filter: “seraphically mundane grace,” “frostbitten hope,” and the synesthetic color of a stain are his idiom, not the author’s. Syntax lengthens and softens during his ritual ascent, then fractures into fumble-clauses when hands meet cold metal, mirroring nerve re-awakening. No head-hop, no filter-verb clutter; every image is somatic. The voice modulates with pressure while retaining singular texture—precise control earns the 9-band.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is lyric yet propulsive: “walls humming with the memory of warmth” performs double duty—atmosphere and backstory—without scaffolding. Metaphors are coherent (frozen hymn, mausoleum of safety) and internally consistent; no mixed vehicles. Rhythm varies strategically; long clauses spiral up the stairs, short clauses click the bolt home. One paraphrase loop—“safety worth the silence” vs “silence unpardonable”—is thematically purposeful, not artifact. Line-level craft is near-flawless; the final middle C sentence could lose one adjective without damage, keeping it just outside 9+ perfection.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The bolt as linchpin of both piano and moral silence is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis; removing it collapses both music and theme. The color-shifting stain oracle converts a static castle into a living barometer, transforming familiar gothic snowscape into perceptual clock. Risk is taken—an almost entirely mute protagonist in a nearly empty hotel—yet specificity of nerve regeneration and child whistle keep it from arid experiment. The concept commits fully, never retreating into safe sentimentality, earning high-band originality.</comment>
