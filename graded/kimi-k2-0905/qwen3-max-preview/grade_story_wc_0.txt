<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is rich and character-specific; the neutron-star mind reframes dust as cosmic code. The renunciation of her old field is legible, but the “strip needless drama” motive is stated more than dramatized in moment-to-moment choices, keeping the final turn slightly intellectual rather than viscerally costly.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the butterfly-slide aurora reweights her prior life under the new lens of dust-as-cosmos. The Accumulative/Textural pattern (dust sediment → spiral) is taught early and lands with undeniable conceptual cost; the lens never wavers.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The greenhouse’s broken panes, wet-rot air, and micro-climates actively filter every beat; humidity and draft govern dust geometry that mirrors neutron disks. The butterfly slide becomes the micro-setting that charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single dominant stake—decay as revelation—tightens through each dust-layer observation; the spiral arrival forecloses the option that patterns are random. Price is felt as the surrender of her astrophysics identity, visible when she hangs the slide instead of a pulsar print.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges wholly from the accumulation of dust images; “poetry is physics with fewer equations” is the only near-statement, yet it is earned by the spiral epiphany. The ending image gives a non-literal answer: cosmology is here, not in telescopes—resonant, unsummarized.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice carries a scientist’s precise perceptual signature: “fractal spirals,” “quantum lattice,” “gravitational spin-downs” yet modulates into breath-mapped chalk with schoolkids. Rhythm compresses under data, then widens into awe at the spiral—never a generic drone.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Sentences layer job and texture—information density is high without purple drift. One scaffold trace: “she wept then, not from sorrow, but kindled humility” edges toward label, but the next clause grounds it. Rhythm accelerates from tweezers to aurora without loops clogging closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: neutron-star physics × butterfly-wing nanostructures × post-flood eco-phenomenology. The premise is non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight; risk-taking (abandoning astrophysics for dust-reading) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specificity of “Morpho imperialis, final flight” anchors originality.</comment>
