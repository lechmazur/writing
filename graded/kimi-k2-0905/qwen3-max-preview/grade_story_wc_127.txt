<comment>Vael’s interior contradiction—calibrating vials yet yearning to feel—is dramatized through micro-choices: the trembling lift of the petal, the deliberate smash of her inventory. The embodied arc from dealer to conduit is specific and earned, though the pivot to “lighter and heavier” leans slightly abstract.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the petal’s dissolution reweights her world,_cost visible in the blue-gold flare and the vow to “hold them until they remember how to breathe.” Causal chain holds—petal → static map → subsume → smash → vow—under Accumulative lens; no orientation debt.</comment>

<comment>The amber grotto is no postcard; its exhalations, honeyed hollows, and resonant pulse constrain her ritual and mirror her lung-like transformation. Micro-setting (the workbench, copper bowl) becomes the crucible where vials become rain-scent; environment actively enables the finale.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—can she bear real feeling—tightens when the static storm surges under her ribs, foreclosing the option to bottle and sell. Cost is legible: decades of inventory burn in a single paragraph, leaving her commercially “ruined.” One meaningful deepening suffices for this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without sermon: forged joy vs. fractured truth reweights itself in the final image of orphaned comfort reclaimed. The half-truth motif migrates from product label to existential stance, charged by the chemist’s shards now her marrow—quiet, undeniable.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays tightly fused to Vael’s perceptual filter—amber breathing, static crawling—syntax waxes and wanes with electrical tension. No head-hopping; diction (“kiln of her craft,” “sternum”) remains within her sensual lexicon. Distinctive rhythmic signature holds under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>High density: each sentence layers sensory, emotional, and conceptual work without purple drift. Occasional elevated phrases (“conceptual repricing” zone) flirt with register drift but stay justified by the perfumer-scientist substrate. Zero loops or scaffold; pronoun tracking clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Forged-emotion dealer who chooses to feel is fresh; blotter-petal-as-empathic-circuit is specific and non-obvious. Risk—lyric compression of entire existential commerce into one dusk ritual—pays off via charged closure. Synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight yet newly minted.</comment>
