<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Interiority is lush and embodied; the lunar-tide skin pulses with contradiction and cost. The final renunciation—bleeding into moss to finish the verse—earns its charge because every pirouette earlier rehearses the same wager of body against law. No head-count penalty; villagers arrive only after the arc completes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the moonstone fused to her throat rewrites the world’s rule-set while dawn witnesses a new economy of memory. Lens = Accumulative/Textural; density of image and cadence shift (garden leaning in, petals “taking dictation”) reweights the stake from private survival to communal re-opening. Orientation is taught lyrically—barefoot, dew, crescent count—so waiver applies.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Twilight garden functions as micro-setting: no walls/no clocks lets time bend and constrains her choreography to moss and starlight. The moonstone itself becomes portable geography, charging every spiral she stamps into the soil. Final image—asterisk on throat—crystallizes body-as-setting, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—memory versus outlaw—tightens once: finding the dust speck under the third waning crescent converts solitude into inscription. Agency is continuous; each dance stroke forecloses surrender and raises the price of capture. Cost is visible when feet bleed pigment the world tried to erase.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through negative space: absence (gaps, silence, banned lullabies) births the cosmic verse. No moralizing; the final invitation—“you must first learn to fall into the gaps”—is offered as stance, not sermon. Resonance lingers because the body, not argument, carries the proof.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyric third-person achieves obsidian grace: syntax lengthens and contracts with breath-line cadence, mirroring tidal pull. Perceptual signature is consistent—earth whispers, gravitational sighs—without POV leakage. Patterned elision (“she danced… she danced…”) is taught early and paid off in the dawn collapse.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Figurative density risks purple glare (“velvet hush of petals folding”) yet stays purposeful because every image services the accrual of pressure. No loops or synonym churn; sentences vary in length to mimic Choreographic phrasing. One mixed metaphor—“time bent like reeds in estuary winds”—barely grazes clarity but occurs pre-closure, so minor.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Familiar dystopia of outlawed memory is transmuted through kinesthetic cosmology: dance as planetary text, moonstone dust as punctuation. Risk choice—lyric accumulation rather than causal reversals—heightens coherence and pays off when the village shifts from hunters to pupils. Specificity of lunar-tide skin and “gravitational sighs” prevents template drift.</comment>
