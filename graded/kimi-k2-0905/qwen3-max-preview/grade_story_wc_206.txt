<comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied (“his fingers moving with the rhythm of forgotten lullabies,” “made his teeth ache”), but the single micro-choice—singing the lullaby—while credible, is not complicated by visible contradictory impulses; the moment of redemption feels gently inevitable rather than wrested. The cost is felt (he weeps), yet the character’s flaw (the old lie) is confessed only in retrospective summary, not tested in a present-tightened dilemma. Still, his perceptual signature is consistent and the arc from guilt to reclamation is legible.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands cleanly: the dancer’s motion reclaims light and unmake shadows—an unmistakable Resonant Reconfiguration with conceptual cost (truth reclaimed, not forced). Causality is Accumulative/Textural: song→resonance→stone revives→light defeats midnight; the “covenant of rust” rule is taught early and paid off. Orientation is anchored by line 3. The only slack: the backstory block (mother/music-box lie) is 18 % of wordcount and slightly delays present pressure, but it tilts the chip’s wilt and thus primes the climax; no cap triggered.</comment>

<comment>The resonance chamber is not backdrop but instrument: copper pipes and glass bells vibrate responsively, constraining how the repairman can test truth. Micro-setting (the dancer’s hollow chest) becomes the exact site where stone and song fuse. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true—he smells oxidation, feels amber warmth, hears chords in his teeth. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible object drift.</comment>

<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“reclaim the light stolen by midnight”—is signaled in the wax-sealed note. Pressure tightens once: stone wilts → he must sing truth → dancer spins → light reclaimed. Agency is present; his song is the causal lever that transforms stone and shadow. Cost is conceptual but visible: the song seeps into his bones, implying perpetual vigilance. No second reversal, but one meaningful deepening satisfies scope.</comment>

<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from concrete pattern: rust as revealer, not ruiner. The dancer’s re-formed arm of “condensed resonance” is the non-literal answer that reweights earlier images of wilt and bloom. No final-paragraph moralizing; the last line leaves ambiguity—“another chance”—inviting reflection without sermon. Subtext resides in gesture (pressing chip to chest, closing lid gently) rather than assertion.</comment>

<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with tactile musicality (“syllables worn smooth by generations,” “spilled mercury”). Syntax mirrors cadence of lullaby and gear-turn. No dialogue, so no register clash. Perceptual signature is consistent—he notices patina, oxidation, harmonic overtones. Experimental compression (“Not shattered, not broken—just… softened”) is taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with scene needs: short fragments under pressure, longer sinuous sentences during resonance swell. No synonym loops; “resonance,” “rust,” “light” accrue new meaning each appearance. One mixed-metor risk—“shadows grew teeth” beside “sunflower toward dawn”—but the fairies-vs-flora clash is brief and does not obscure causality. Information density high; every sentence advances image or stakes.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Fuses clockwork, alchemy, and lullaby into fresh synthesis; the “covenant of rust” as truth-binding mechanism is non-obvious. Dancer regrowing arm from resonance rather than metal feels inevitable yet surprising. Avoids steampunk décor for its own sake—each gear serves emotional stakes. Risk: lyric accumulation could tip into lush overload, but restraint (no exposition dumps) keeps it earned.</comment>
