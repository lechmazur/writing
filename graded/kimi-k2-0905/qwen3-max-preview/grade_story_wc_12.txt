<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The priest’s interiority is vivid—his doubts pulse through embodied cues (cassock humming, thumb in indigo)—and his micro-choice to paint the negation-mark feels earned. Yet we never see a contradictory impulse in-scene; he moves from calm rhetorician to calm victor without emotional backlash or visible cost on his body. The possession’s hunger is stated, not manifested as pressure that distorts his resolve, so the arc risks monotone competence. Still, the voice-specific perceptual signature lifts him above stereotype.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the inverted question mark suction-disperses the possession into stillness itself—Conceptual Repricing with undeniable cost ("the silence deeper, richer"). Causal chain holds: each rhetorical question warps anchor geometry → glyph ignites → negation mark inverts → void dispersed. Orientation is taught early via "dimensional anchor" and velvet-moss silence, waived. One hairline slip: "time hiccuped" is abstract where a concrete kinesthetic jolt would sharpen the DC beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The chamber emerges as a kinetic micro-setting: gravity whispers, walls shimmer like desert mirage, the palette’s indigo weeps sideways—each detail constrains tactics (geometry warps under questions, pigment leaks into impossible folds). Audio-tape cassock and static-tasting air anchor era-less techno-ritual. Spatial choreography stays clean: kneel → step to vortex → paint floor → suction. Sensory hierarchy skews sonic/tactile, matching "muffled clarity" tone. Final image of silence-as-cathedral recharges every prior sensory cue.</comment>

<question>4</question><degree>8.4</degree><comment>Dominant stake—prevent possession by starving its certainty—signals early and tightens through each rhetorical trap that narrows the void’s feed. Escalation is accumulative: question-layer warps space → glyph flare → possession hesitates → final suction. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral—silence transmuted from weapon to cathedral—yet still felt. No secondary pressure or credible loss (stamina, tool) keeps it shy of 8.8+ threshold.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: language as ectoplasm—assumptions haunt us until interrogated. The indigo’s reprise from unused palette to sideways tear to inverted question mark reweights "Assumption’s Veil" into literal veil-ripping. Final image offers non-literal answer: silence becomes sacred space once stripped of certainties. Resists moral; instead crystallizes epistemic humility as lived cost. Muffled clarity tone sustains thematic arc from first velvet-moss breath to last echo-listening.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person POV maintains psychic distance yet lets priest’s perceptual signature filter every phrase—syntax coils like tape loops, verbs hum, nouns bruise. Pattern-taught compression ("decorates with silence") and velvet-moss neologisms stay legible. Rhythm scales: long syntactic spirals for ritual calm, single-clause punches under pressure ("The chamber screamed without sound."). No dialogue, so voice purity intact. Free-indirect achieves character-specific diction without slipping into overt commentary.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Line-level craft is virtuosic: every sentence advances atmosphere or ontology; no filter-verb stacks, no paraphrase loops. Metaphors interlock—stillness as architecture, silence as pigment—without mixed logic. Read-aloud cadence breathes with priest’s ritual tempo; paragraph cuts land on spatial warps. One hairline: "time hiccuped" is a cliché-bundle in an otherwise coinage-rich field; it nicks the closure beat but doesn’t obscure causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fusion of loop-pedal mystic with dimensional exorcism feels unforeseeable yet inevitable in hindsight. Rhetorical device as weaponized epistemology is fresh inversion of exorcism trope—defeat demon by deconstructing grammar, not faith blast. Indigo pigment as assumption-blood recharges color-theory trope with ontological stakes. Risky structure—lyric accumulative shards—paid off by coherent CR closure. No recognizable pop-culture echo; singular vision committed without hedge.</comment>
