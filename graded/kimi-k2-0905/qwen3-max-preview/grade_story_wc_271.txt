<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and sensorily anchored; the somatic-marker mechanic is lived, not labeled. The arc from survival-anchored noticing to sketching-for-witness is a credible, earned renunciation. Minor dip: “drone-strike wedding survivor” risks headline shorthand; the body memory compensates but the phrase itself leans diagnostic.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: each return to the arboretum thickens texture until the found dew-drop reweights all prior grief. Closure is a Charged Poise—the pulse-carried pearl—whose conceptual cost (joy can be housed in ruin) is undeniable. Transitions are legible, pattern taught early; no orientation debt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Seaside-cliff arboretum is no backdrop: salt-stung glass, ivy-swallowed bench, dewdrop in web all constrain where the body can sit/see/draw. Micro-setting (the body’s sole pressure against soil) doubles as therapeutic tool; final image requires this exact cliff greenhouse for the pearl’s evaporation to reprice meaning. Gate passed.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</question><comment>Dominant stake—can joy be tolerated without betrayal?—tightens once: the freeze beat flips photograph from relic to compass. Cost is legible: tears un-counted, drawings left as gifts, future paths (revenge, suicide) silently foreclosed. Agency is attention/renunciation rather than external action; sufficient under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</question><comment>Theme emerges from reversal of ruin/regrowth binaries; no moral is stated. “Pearl of stillness” reprises as both noun and pulse, reweighting grief without commodifying it. Subtext in silent gift-sketches invites reader to witness rather than console—an elegant, non-sentimental aftereffect.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>First-person voice owns a perceptual signature—spiral-noticing, gull-timing, synesthetic scent of jasmine-gunpowder. Rhythm breathes with tide cadence; no head-hopping. Compression (“I name it. / The Pearl of Stillness.”) is taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</question><comment>High-density lines do triple duty: “ivy has swallowed the slats” paints scene + body + metaphor in five words. No loops, no mixed metaphor; only two adjective stacks, both motivated. Filter verbs minimal, used only when voice requires slight distance.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</question><comment>Fusion of drone-trauma with decayed arboretum feels inevitable, not grafted. Risk: lyric freeze-frame instead of external showdown; reward: emotional specificity that transcends war-story template. Dew-drop pearl transforms familiar grief-into-awe trope through site-specific botanic physics.</question>
