<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The gardener’s interiority is sensorially grounded (smoke in lungs, soil under nails) and her micro-choices—angling each prism, feeling the tooth’s ridges—reveal a hierarchy of values where beauty is measured in millimeters of risk. The lockmaster’s note and her brother’s fire backstory are conjured only when they tilt the present task, so the 17-year gardening history never becomes expository freight. A small flaw: the emotional crescendo is slightly over-articulated (“she did understand now”), nudging the reader instead of letting the embodied gesture speak. Still, the final renunciation—walking away leaving the light to work—pays the earned cost of her vulnerability.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single-scene causality is clean: because she finds the tooth → she gauges barriers → she installs prisms → the neighborhood’s stance shifts. The 120-word orientation gate is met: fire escape, moonlit harbor, rose’s last petal all surface by line 4. Closure is a crystallized Charged Poise: the city’s exhale and the child’s laugh make the conceptual cost—her perpetual vigilance, her brother’s absence—undeniable without exposition. One hairline slip: “tonight, though” is an external narrator nudge that momentarily leaks the pattern before it is fully taught.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The rusted grating, sagging awning, and chipped theater prism are tactically leveraged: the prism’s fracture angles literally determine where light falls and therefore where people walk. Harbor moonlight is not postcard scenery; its shifting reflections supply the working surface for her light-seeding mission. Micro-setting (the hook, the fishing line, the tooth’s ridge count) constrains the final placement and is recharged in the last image. Meets the 9+ gate: the environment’s material specifics shape every tactical move and the final charged poise.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—can she seed wonder without being caught or crushed—is signaled in the first paragraph’s “quivering hush.” Escalation is textural: each new prism raises the cumulative exposure until the neighborhood’s awe becomes the felt price. No reversals are needed; the tightening is the growing visibility of her presence. The cost is legible: she forfeits anonymity, leaves the prisms behind, and accepts the dawn that will expose her footprints.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: light as measured hope, barriers gauged not forced. The final rainbow-streaked alley reweights the lockmaster’s cryptic note without moralizing. Subtext resides in silence—she never names her brother’s death, only lets the smoke in her lungs speak. The refusal to heal the world, only to offer moments, sidesteps sentimentality and invites the reader to calibrate their own millimeters of hope.</question>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet restrained: compressed syntax (“moonlight fractured into a dozen trembling beams”) mirrors the precise work of light-measurement. Perceptual signature is consistent—she notices rust, petal-drift, and ridge-counts, never tourist vistas. No dialogue, so no register clash. Minor over-patterning of participle openers (“kneeling… feeling… pressing”) but the cadence teaches the oar-rhythm and pays off in the rowing simile.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Lines are dense: “crimson sigh marking the end of an era” collapses botany, color, and epoch into one breath. No synonym loops; each prism placement uses fresh verbs (fixed, angled, suspended). Metaphors stay coherent—spilled mercury, oars in water—without mixed vehicles. One scaffold trace: “She moved… She paused… She reached…” could vary sentence openings, but the cadence serves the rowing motif and does not obscure causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Premise—illicit gardener-turned-light-smuggler—is fresh yet inevitable for a harbor city. The lockmaster’s tooth repurposed as feeler-gauge for social barriers transforms a mundane prop into metaphorical instrument. Risk is taken: no antagonist, no dialogue, yet pressure holds through visibility alone. The payoff justifies the risk—the final image of a child chasing emerald cannot be transplanted to another plot without collapsing the whole.</comment>
