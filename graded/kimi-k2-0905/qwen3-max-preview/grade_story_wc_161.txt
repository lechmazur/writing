<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s preservation motive is vivid and embodied in every pigeon-harness tweak; the three reinventions are label-summaries rather than dramatized contradiction, but the final refusal to keep forging ledgers shows earned stasis with visible cost—her laughter that hurts her ribs. Interiority is specific to her cartographer-like attention and grief, never drifting into diagnostic speak. The only gap is the off-stage vanished client whose absence doesn’t pressure her in-scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the attic becomes a living broadcast studio, the meteorite-tuned lullaby returns as payable song, and Elara stops reinventing—cost is the exposed authenticity of her tears and the unsealed ledgers. Causal chain: meteorite → dust mapping → harness redesign → bird song → letter from Reykjavik; each because/therefore tightens options under the skylight. Orientation is anchored by word 40; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The attic’s foxed paper, cedar scent, and leaning shelves are filtered through Elara’s tactile rituals; the skylight’s dust choreography literally constrains her final calibration of the meteorite harness. Micro-setting (the meteorite balanced on Keats’ spine) functions as fulcrum where gravity and grace converge, charging the climactic image. Spatial choreography is immaculate—no floating props.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve lost songs—faces one decisive tightening: risk exposing her mother’s fire-scarred melody to strangers. The meteorite experiment escalates from skepticism to embodied resurrection, foreclosing the option to keep archiving in silence. Cost is visceral: the cracked-open ribs, the unsealed ledgers. No external antagonist needed; internal fear of exposure supplies coherent pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the transmutation of paper trails into living song—archival loss becomes generative broadcast without a moralizing sentence. The meteorite’s cosmic solitude reweights personal grief into communal gift; the Reykjavik letter confirms the conceptual repricing. Ambiguity remains: will future songs also burn? That uncertainty lingers honestly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays tight to Elara’s cartographer perception: “dust motes swirled like forgotten alphabets” is her metaphor, not authorial flourish. Syntax lengthens during mapping, then fractures at the musical resurrection—“cracked open Elara’s ribs like a music box”—mirroring pulse of discovery. No filter-verb stacks; every image is action-anchored. Voice modulates from archival hush to awed release without register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry triple duty: sensory, emotional, and causal—“she balanced the chip on the spine of a first edition Keats” advances experiment, reveals value hierarchy, and foreshadows fulcrum. Figurative density peaks only at the climax where it’s earned; earlier beats stay lean. Zero paraphrase loops, zero scaffold. Final line (“The attic breathed”) is monosyllabic release after cascading clauses—rhythmic mastery.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fusion of Mars meteorite, carrier-pigeon MIDI, and dust-mote musical notation is utterly specific; remove any component and the resurrection fails. The concept risks gimmick yet grounds itself in tactile harness work and Keats’ spine. Risk: trusting a lyric mode to deliver sci-fi resonance without exposition—successfully paid off by the Reykjavik letter. Fresh synthesis makes prior archival grief feel inevitable yet new.</comment>
