<comment>Interiority is concrete—her boots scuffing damp stone, breath caught, smile at the oak’s gift—showing embodied contradiction between technician reflex and pilgrim wonder. Micro-choices (deconstruct-with-patience, set sextant on root, sit to sketch) visibly cost her prior identity and foreclose the “fix-it” path. Motivation stays rooted in arboreal witness desire, intensifying when dreams force her to trade calibration for memory cartography. No secondary character on page, so status/relationship bullets waived; single-POV voice coherent throughout.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: she renounces repair and instead “remembers for them,” mapping sorrow onto rings she now vows never to cut. Causal chain intact—moonlit healing enables dream projection → compels her stance crystallization with felt cost (forests now own her labor, she owns their grief). Orientation anchored by line 3 (stormlit tower, moonlight, labyrinth worker). One minor scaffold: “not with tools, but with patience” echoes next sentence’s “not with heat, but with resonance,” but cadence serves lyric pattern and does not obscure cause.</comment>

<comment>Micro-setting (sextant, brass seams, mossy root) constrains every tactical move—she can’t wrench parts, must wait for moonlight, must set device on root to receive oak’s offering. Stormlit tower and rain-slick parchment provide sensory hierarchy filtered through maintenance-worker eye: damp stone, gutter song, silvered rooftops. Spatial choreography clean: spiral stairs → workbench → slit-window → forest gate → first arch of oaks. Environmental mirroring (leaves tremble though no wind) externalizes her interior shift without overt symbolism.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—can sorrow be mapped like stars—tightens when sextant overloads with arboreal dreams, forcing her to trade calibration for memory cartography. One meaningful deepening: “She didn’t need to fix it anymore. She needed to follow it.” Price paid on-page—she forfeits technician identity and accepts open-ended guardianship of witnessed grief. Under Causal lens, each because/therefore linkage holds (moonlight heals → dreams project → she renounces repair → forest claims her). No coincidence resolves tension.</comment>

<comment>Theme emerges organically: grief as communal biomass, trees as living archives, mapping as act of mercy not measurement. Subtext operates in silence—her smile, not tears, at oak’s offering; soldier/flower/lock speak louder than eulogy. Final image of notebook sketching rings “no axe would ever split” offers Conceptual Repricing that reweights mapping from colonial extraction to vow of non-violence. Avoids sermon; resonance arises from concrete particulars (birch cradling mute girl’s star paintings).</comment>

<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to worker’s perceptual signature—selective attention to brass seams, root crevices, leaf tremble. Rhythmic control: long cadences for ascent, staccato “She paused, breath caught” under peak wonder. No dialogue, so evaluation focuses on narrative texture: syntax mirrors technician precision early (“Each screw, each lens…”) then softens to pilgrim cadence (“She sat cross-legged… began to sketch”). No head-hopping; knowledge strictly character-bound.</comment>

<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>High information density—single sentences layer job, motive, sensory cue: “rain-slicked parchment and forgotten equations.” Figurative language disciplined: “grief… etched in hairline fractures” sustains metallurgy metaphor without muddle. Minor template cadence in “not with X, but with Y” pair; repetition serves incantatory effect and does not obscure closure. No paraphrase loops, no filter-verb stacks. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves with image that recharges “mapped” motif.</comment>

<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: maintenance tech + astrolabe + arboreal grief quantification feels inevitable yet unforeseen. Risk in lyric accumulative structure pays off—each tree dream reweights prior metaphor until oak physically splits to offer relics. Specificity (yew behind chapel, birch near schoolyard) prevents abstraction. Transformation test fails if names/places swapped—labyrinth, stormlit tower, and sextant are irreplaceable. No trope checklist; originality arises from emotional stakes of witnessing via botanical archive.</comment>
