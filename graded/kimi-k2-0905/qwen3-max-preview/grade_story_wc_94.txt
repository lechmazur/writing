<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Interiority is rich, lyrical, and sustained; the poet’s contradictory impulses—“furiously tranquil,” writing vs. sealing—are alive in every beat. Micro-choices (timer reset withheld, envelope pressed to chest) dramatize value hierarchy under pressure. Endurance is earned: the refusal to open the archive today carries visible cost in the storm-lit final image. Flaw: the “cartography of scars” motive is stated more than tested; no new wound or map-choice complicates her stance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Single-scene causal spine: because the poet’s voice is excised, she charts scars → therefore hoards the last poem → therefore suspends the vigil rather than break it. Closure is a Charged Poise: the unopened envelope reconfigures the stake from “Will she read?” to “She will decide when the sky says,” with felt cost in the timer’s silence. Orientation perfect: observatory, storm night, lone actor anchored by line 3. No meaningful escalation after midpoint—pressure plateaus rather than tightens—so misses 9.0 gate.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Stormlit observatory is rendered through brass, glass, lightning forks that rattle lenses—selective, tactile, bias-rich. The envelope’s bus-timetable hiding place is particularized down to vanished neighborhoods; this micro-setting constrains later tactics (mundane camouflage vs. state scrutiny). Weather directly alters stakes: thunder howls like exiled muses, shaking the dome as she chooses stillness. Final lightning flash charges the envelope, turning setting into mirror of inner atlas—meets 9+ gate but overripe adjective strings (“ink in milk”) slightly blur spatial clarity.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—control over her own archive—signaled early. Pressure tightens once: timer hits zero → she renounces immediate release, embracing suspended breath as tactic; this narrows options under causal lens. Cost is legible (she swallows the poem’s oxygen), but no secondary constraint or loss reshapes tactics afterward; storm peaks yet doesn’t further complicate her stance. Sufficient for 8-band, but lacks a second ratchet or material forfeiture that would push 8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: censorship → cartography of scars → self-as-atlas. Subtext lives in gesture (envelope held to ribs = heartbeat she’s not allowed to utter). Final image reweights premise: silence is not absence but sovereign territory. Avoids explicit moral; however, one near-echo of prompt language (“when masks slip”) is italicized in thought, slightly diluting organic emergence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is utterly specific: meteorological diction fused with darkroom lexicon, syntax lengthens then fractures under stormlight. Perceptual signature consistent—poet sees galaxies in bruises, bus routes as exile vectors. No dialogue, so no convergence risk. Compression taught early (“rarefied her grief”) and paid off at timer zero. Minor over-lyric bursts (“quartz fractured to reveal its inner fire”) flirt with purple but remain legible; still deserves high band.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with storm gusts; sentence length swells then snaps at crisis. Information density high—each line layers image + interiority + metaphor. No paraphrase loops, but two adjacent “each” anaphora clusters verge on template cadence; not quite three, so −0.2 only. Metaphors coherent (storm as artillery, clouds as ink) and don’t blur causality. Clean grammar, pronoun tracking perfect; opening and closing lines are ear-perfect.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Freshest synthesis: darkroom timer + observatory dome + bus timetable create a privacy tech for the censored. Stakes are interior yet geopolitical; lyric essay form feels inevitable. No close-plot echoes; concept commits fully. Risk—suspending climax on non-opening—pays off in Charged Poise. Slight familiarity of “storm as freedom” trope keeps it from 9.5.</comment>
