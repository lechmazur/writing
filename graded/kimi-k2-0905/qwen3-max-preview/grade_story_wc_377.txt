<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The tuner’s seasonal muteness and kinetic sculpture craft create a vivid, embodied interiority; her palm-to-ice micro-choice crystallizes values without words. Silence as precision canvas is original and stakes are felt in the child-tremor beat. The final renunciation—she simply stops climbing—carries earned stasis cost visible in the wind-conducted aftermath.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of tuning → glisten → resonance deepens until the iceberg fragment’s final cobalt pulse reweights wonder after her death. Closure is Charged Poise: wind and weather become new conductors, the sculpture’s ongoing hum proving preservation succeeds beyond her body. Cost is legible in “she simply stopped climbing,” leaving the work to impersonal forces.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Whispering bluff, hollow stone, glacial shard, and wind-driven gears are sensuously tracked; spatial choreography holds as she “knelt, placed the child’s small hand.” Environment constrains the only access to wonder; iceberg fragment’s inner luminescence literally charges the final image. Selective detail avoids exposition dumps while sustaining altitude and atmosphere.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve the color of wonder—tightens when the child’s untaught reaction proves the method works; that moment forecloses nostalgia or rebellion as motives. Escalation is accretive: each seasonal adjustment adds resonance until the tuner’s exit transfers agency to wind. No reversal, but deepening of responsibility into post-human continuation satisfies accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: wonder is neither commodity nor memory but a frequency one can submit to. The child’s gasp and the iceberg’s fierce refracted longing embody the concept without moralizing. Final image of mute echo tuning silence reconfigures meaning—preservation succeeds by relinquishing control—achieving Conceptual Repricing with undeniable social cost (world below has traded wonder for warranty).</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyrical third-person stays tightly focalized through the tuner’s perceptual filter: “her fingers brushing bronze and iron not to speak, but to listen.” Syntax slows to match seasonal cycles; diction—“blush,” “sigh,” “forgotten vows”—is consistent and atmospheric. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk is zero; rhythmic control heightens pressure in the child-contact beat without clarity loss.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies from wind-long breaths to crystalline fragments; no template cadence or synonym loops detected. Metaphors are integrated and physically coherent—“pendulums…harvested from the last melting pole.” High information density: each line does denotation, atmosphere, and theme work. Minor elevated register in “conceptual repricing” is voice-motivated and legible at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fusing climate grief with acoustic sculpture and synesthetic color-sound is non-obvious and inseparable from execution. Kinetic bell-iceberg as memory keeper feels inevitable yet fresh; “wonder has a color” reframes ecological loss as perceptual labor. Risk of seasonal muteness and post-human ending pays off: preservation without nostalgist speaker avoids cliché. Specificity throughout prevents swap-out test failure.</comment>
