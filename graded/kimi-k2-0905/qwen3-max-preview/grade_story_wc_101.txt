<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elira’s interiority is concretely anchored to tactile objects (bell, baskets) and her contradictory need for both visibility and anonymity is dramatized in the silent bell ritual; the final micro-choice—leaving the bell on the table—pays off foreshadowed endurance with visible cost (she walks back into darkness alone). Status dynamics and secondary pressure are off-page, so the full 9-band is capped, but within single-POV scope her values hierarchy is legible and earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the single bell note crystallizes the “invitation” rule and reconfigures stewardship; cost is felt in Elira’s solitary exit into pre-dawn cold. Accumulative lens holds: pattern of nightly baskets → bell migrations → final communal soup tightens density rather than causal reversals. No orientation debt; transitions (curtain-like paragraph breaks) are legible shards within one window.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Terra-cotta arbor constrains every move: it hides the bell, hosts the soup, and its cracked tiles echo the community’s fracture—final image recharges the same cracked arch as invitation, not backdrop. Body-as-setting (frost on breath, scarf adjustment) and bell-as-tool both meet micro-setting test by altering tactics (silence vs. ringing). Sensory economy favors touch and sound over visual catalog, matching covert ethos.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“keep the weave alive”—tightens when sanctions deepen and new hands appear; Elira’s agency is renunciation of credit, not confrontation. Escalation is accretive: heavier baskets, then coins in dough—each visible price alters later tactics under Accumulative lens. Coin-in-dough beat supplies felt cost that charges final image; no causal reversal required.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the bell’s migrating presence rather than assertion: anonymity as invitation, not secrecy. Final non-literal answer—the trembling note rolling downhill—reweights prior material without moralizing. Subtext in gesture (thumb on bell, steam curl) avoids thematic echo; complexity lingers in unresolved sanctions future.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric distance stays stable; perceptual signature is cold-touch and hush-lexis (“bruised twilight,” “amplified quiet”). Free-indirect diction never exceeds Elira’s plausible register; bell’s personification (“mute gleam a question”) is voice-motivated. Sentence rhythm modulates: longer accumulative clauses for nights, clipped fragments for bell actions—no template cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; information density high—one sentence often layers sensory cue, stakes reminder, and object state. Figurative language is spare but precise (“frost feathered the ridge”) and never clusters in peak beats. Opening and closing lines are image-anchors, not filler; punctuation and tense immaculate.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Anonymous mutual-aid via antique bell is a fresh inflection on familiar “under-siege community” trope; transformation test fails if bell is swapped. Specificity of coin pressed into dough, reed baskets, and curfew sirens roots premise locally. Risk—quiet accumulation instead of revolt—heightens meaning without gimmickry; synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
