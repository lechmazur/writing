<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elira’s “purpose” is asserted, not dramatized; she never makes a hard choice that costs her. The settlers’ shift from skeptics to family is summary, not shown in contradictory micro-choices under pressure. Kael and Liora function as emblematic roles rather than individuals with clashing motives. The ending’s “walking together” lands as collective mood, not personal renunciation or visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the nebula appears only when unity is achieved, reweighting prior chalk-and-bell set-ups with conceptual cost—the orchard they leave behind. Causality is accumulative/textural; each chalk message and the bell-ringing deepen density until the pattern crystallizes. No teleporting props; bell and nebula are consistently tethered. The lens holds cleanly to the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Floating root-vein sidewalks and gravity-marbles are tactile, lived-in, and filter through settler use. The Glass Canopy’s crystallized pollen constrains the bell’s placement, shaping the climactic gathering. Sensory hierarchy favors touch and sound over visual catalog. The orchard’s “sigh” at the end mirrors the collective choice without overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—collective survival via migration—tightens once: chalk summons → bell rings → nebula appears. No reversible reversal, but the single deepening suffices for 800-word scope. Cost is conceptual (abandoning the orchard) rather than viscerally felt on-page, keeping it below 8.8. Pressure is coherent under the accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of “trust as ecological catalyst” emerges through pattern, not thesis: chalk messages root, bell memory coaxes dew, unity summons nebula. Final image of the orchard “sighing in pride” reweights loss as continuity. No moralizing line articulates the theme; it remains legible yet porous. Ambiguity between migration and abandonment invites counter-readings.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lyric third-person floats like Elira herself: syntax elongates, verbs soften (“whispers didn’t echo; they rooted”), matching orchard gravity. No head-hopping; focalization stays with communal sensorium. Register remains consistent, avoiding sci-fi jargon overload. Distinct perceptual signature sustained to the final “bridge” line.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm modulates naturally; no template cadence or synonym loops. Figurative language is selective—“chime like liquid glass” appears once and pays off. Occasional elevated diction (“conceptual repricing”) risks register drift but stays within ghost-narrator lexicon. Zero scaffolding; each sentence advances image or pattern.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Combines pastoral orchard, ghost orchestrator, and migratory nebula in a synthesis that feels inevitable yet fresh. Chalk-and-bell coordination subverts standard exodus tropes by making memory the engine. Risk-taking in upside-down trees and spectral tears is fully committed, not ornamental. Transformation test fails if names change—specific gravity and pollen-canopy logic are irreplaceable.</comment>
