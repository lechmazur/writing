<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The tutor’s interior contradiction—scholarly precision versus occult receptivity—animates every gesture; her micro-choice to trade lies for masonry-grammar is specific and costly. The “patiently nimble” hands earn their keep twice: folding origami from trash-receipts, then pocketing a key that will make her complicit in the building’s sentience. What keeps this from 9+ is that the final ascent into full reciprocal conversation is stared at rather than physically risked—she never tests the clay seal in a wall, so the cost is still conceptual, not embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a crisp Resonant Reconfiguration: the key sliding across the bench crystallizes a new reciprocal contract—she can now “write back” to the building—priced by the immediate forfeiture of every previous lie. Causality is lyric but traceable: each sugar/tea swap accretes data until the archivist must reciprocate with the key, a because/therefore linkage held under an Accumulative lens. The meteor’s “unfinished thought” reweights the prior scar-image, making the cost atmospheric, not abstract.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Selective sensory hierarchy rules: meteor trails are “fleeting silver scars,” a visual echo of the seal’s patina catching identical starlight—an image-pattern that later constrains her acceptance of the key. The rooftop garden is sketched only by what the tutor’s fingers can actually touch (moss between flagstones) so environment stays inside body-scale, satisfying micro-setting rules. Brass weight vs. key-cold on thigh creates tactile bookends that charge the final descent.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Stakes tighten from epistemic (can she decode walls?) to existential (will the building claim her?) through a single deepening beat: exchange of seal for key forecloses retreat to mere observation. Agency is intellectual—she risks complicity by carrying the cipher downstairs—yet the price is tangible: eternal Tuesday tea-truce is forfeited, “no sugar borrowed, no lies exchanged.” No reversals are needed; the hinge is the moment brass touches iron key, a cadence shift that makes silence louder than speech.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without pronouncement: language as mutual habitation—scholar learns to be colonized by the text she once解剖. The serpent-swallowing-tail seal silently re-prices the premise: translation is not mastery but digestion. Final image of “rooftop garden sighing recognition” answers the core question—can buildings speak?—with an audible exhalation that feels earned because every brick-groan was seeded early.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice achieves lyric compression without sacrificing clarity: “grammar in their gables” teaches the reader to expect architecture-as-syntax, a pattern paid off when walls ‘read’ clay tablets. Perceptual signature is precise–retired professor notices Latinate roots inside wind-hiss; no filter verbs intrude. Dialogue indirection is minimal but exact: “third-floor joists sing in winter” carries subtext that music is syntax—she nods as if conjugating a verb.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Prose density is high: one sentence pitches receipt-origami, dew-pluck, soundless doorknob turn—three tactile reveals in eight words. Metaphors stay coherent within one domain (astronomy ↔ scarring ↔ metallurgy) so “meteor scars” and “patina catching starlight” echo later key-metal without mixed logic. No loops, no scaffold; cadence modulates from long breathy accumulations to the clipped final line “Only truth, steeped and waiting” to mirror kettle-lid tension release.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses dead-language pedagogy with architectural animism—fresh synthesis that could collapse into gimmick yet stays grounded in sensory specificity of clay pressing. The agreed-upon-lies scaffold morphs into a plausible social ritual that enables exchange of forbidden knowledge, a reversal that feels both surprising and inevitable. Risk is structural—sentient-building tales abound—but idiosyncratic compression (Latin, meteor, serpent seal) refreshes the trope without explanatory bloat.</comment>
