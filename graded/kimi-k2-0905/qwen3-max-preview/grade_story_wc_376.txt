<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The calligrapher’s “wilt” is a vivid, embodied cost that scales with pressure; her choice to keep reading aloud is a micro-choice that reverses it, legible on the page. Interiority is concrete (“colour returned to her cheeks”), avoids diagnostic labels. The final renunciation—becoming the archive—earns its cost through the prior wilting pattern. Missing a second character prevents status-dynamics crucible, keeping this just below 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative lens: each found note tightens the stake of “ candor in small moments” via density increase; closure is Charged Poise—she steps back into “ emerald haze” now reweighted as living archive. Orientation is anchored within 120 words (“humid gloom of the greenhouse city”). No lens ambiguity; the humming plate teaches the pattern early. Cost is felt in the final image: toxic sky still presses, but she carries the letters—conceptual price unmistakable.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Environment supplies persistent constraint: toxic sky, dripping corridors, moss-vents that make the plate hum—each filters her bodily state. The zinc fragment itself doubles as micro-setting, constraining route. Sensory hierarchy obeys her craft: she notices ligatures, paper scent, condensation on ink. Final image of “ emerald haze” is recharged by the letters she now embodies.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recover lost confessions—tightens with every found slip; escalation is textural accumulation, not causal reversal. One meaningful deepening: chest of origami letters shifts map from route to responsibility. Cost is visible: each reread reverses wilt, making archive role inevitable. Coincidence absent; pressure coherent under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particular paper slips, not assertion: a mother’s toy apology, soldier’s brother-note. Final image reweights “ oasis” from water to truth—Conceptual Repricing without moralizing. No thesis statement; silence of pooled conversations becomes ethical demand. Ambiguity lingers: toxic sky still there, archive unpaid for.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is calligrapher-specific: she sights ligatures, smells ink, hears echo as “ pollen.” Rhythm modulates—short clauses under wilt, longer cascades during reading. No head-hopping; single POV stable. Compression (“ She packed the letters gently”) taught early and pays off in measured cadence of final line.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>High information density: one sentence often does three jobs (“ She pressed a damp cloth to her forehead, breathed through her sleeve, and kept walking”). No loops or scaffold. Figurative language is sparse and purposeful; no mixed metaphors. Final line’s “ drop by drop, word by word” is earned repetition, not template.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: wilt-as-lie-detector + calligrapher-as-archive. Premise avoids stock dystopia; greenhouse city, ligature-map, origami letters are particular to this voice. Risk in quiet ending pays off—Charged Poise rather than set-piece. Conceptual integrity intact: truth as scarce resource under toxic sky.</comment>
