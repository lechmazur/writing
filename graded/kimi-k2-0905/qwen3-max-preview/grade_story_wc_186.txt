<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The custodian’s interiority is rich—her belief that “coincidences have meaning” is dramatized by the meticulous star-alignment ritual. Embodied emotion (boots crunching silica, breath held) keeps diagnostic label-speak at bay. The final self-recognition (“she had been summoned”) is earned by seven winters of mapping and the prism’s pulse, so the renunciation of randomness carries visible cost. Flaw: no contradictory impulse is staged in-scene; she never doubts the quest, so the arc is single-note.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the prism’s warm heartbeat reweights her past from accident to summons, undeniable conceptual cost. Causal chain—star map → prism → vision → self-revision—holds across every beat. Orientation is anchored within 60 words (“glass humming pavilion,” “powdered silica,” “after the collapse”). No lens ambiguity; Accumulative pattern (echo → echo → crystallization) is taught early and pays off in the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The pavilion is not backdrop but instrument: its fractured glass sings under starlight, constraining the exact angle she must adjust. Micro-setting (the prism’s fracture depth, the fused-glass tripod) determines success or collapse of vision. Weather (wind scrubbing sky clean) is causal—without it Polaris would not strike true. Final image of thistles “bowed in reverence” recharges the setting with transformed meaning.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“prove coincidences have meaning”—is signaled in paragraph 1 and tightened when one misalignment could “collapse like sand under tide.” The micro-turn is the star-thread striking true: options narrow from search to revelation, cost is the fragility of the vision. Agency is cerebral (adjusting tripod by chalk on forearm) yet stakes feel visceral because the pavilion literally hums with pressure. No secondary pressure or antagonist, but at this length one tightening suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the inversion of randomness into convergence; no character ever names the theme aloud. The scholar→soldier→child chain is shown, not asserted, letting reader complete the tapestry. Final image of broken prism glowing like a heartbeat reweights “broken” from loss to conduit. Thistle-blown hope is earned because the weed metaphor was seeded early and returns as reverence, not sermon.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays inside the custodian’s perceptual filter: she notices “jagged arcs” of glass, smells “dry thistle,” feels harmonic “through bone.” Syntax lengthens and compresses with tension—long polysyllabic star-names vs. the staccato “She held her breath.” No head-hopping; diction never exceeds a loner-astronomer lexicon. Compression like “shard of hush” is pattern-taught early and pays off in the final pulse.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm variegates: fragment (“The glass pavilion shivered.”) against sinuous cumulative sentences. Figurative density peaks at the vision beam yet remains coherent—“kaleidoscopic shards across inner walls” is precise, not purple. Near-loops (“between…between…between”) are purposeful, patterned, paid off. Only micro-drag: “retrocognitively blessed” is a five-syllable mouthful used twice; a pronoun substitution could quicken the beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Post-collapse star-tracker who rekindles meaning via cracked prism feels fresh; the trope of salvaged tech is inverted into spiritual astrolabe. Synthesis of astrolabe + retrocognition + thistle metaphor is idiosyncratic and inevitable in hindsight. Risk: lyric second-person address to stars (“Show me the next thread”) could read as plea-ex-machina, but it is prefigured by seven winters of mapping, so the gamble succeeds.</comment>
