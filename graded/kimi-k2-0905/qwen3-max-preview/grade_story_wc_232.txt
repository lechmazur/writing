<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elias’s “empirically intuitive” trait is more label than lived; his sister vow is told in one reflective block, not dramatized. Still, the matrix-chip burn fuses an embodied cost to his choice, and the shop-left-forever beat shows credible renunciation. Interiority is atmospheric rather than contradictory-in-scene, but the closure carries felt price, satisfying the 9- gate for earned change.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Decisive Change: the letter with future coordinates materializes, sister alive, chip absorbed, shop abandoned—cost is the life he dissolves. Causal lens holds: chip pulse → ants → arch → rewrite. No orientation debt; who-where-when anchored by line 3. Cost is legible in “locked the shop for the last time.” Persistent constraint: the new timeline cannot be undone.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Dust-hung shop, creek murmur rising, phosphorescent fungi, and twilight-seal letter are vivid, selective, POV-filtered. The arch as micro-setting constrains the final step; the receding creek glistens like “polished promises,” charging the exit image. No spatial drift; geography tracks. Falls 0.1 short of 9 because no environmental detail actively obstructs an alternative choice—setting decorates rather than dictates.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: rewrite regret vs. redemption via the doorway. Tightening occurs when ants foreclose refusal—follow or stagnate. Agency is Elias’s step through arch; price is his erased past life. Escalation is single but meaningful; coincidence (ants, matrix) complicates, does not resolve. Creek rise parallels pressure yet doesn’t contract clock—time felt abstract, not tactical—keeps score from 8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: maps as exteriorized regret, doorway as self-reinvention. The sister vow reweights from guilt engine to redemption compass without overt thesis. Final image of glimmer-bearing ants reframes earlier solitude into legacy of guides—Conceptual Repricing with quiet social cost. Resists moralizing; ambiguity lingers about what new timeline costs others. No thematic echo penalties.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Voice is textured, antiquarian, rhythmically controlled: “continents whispered from yellowed parchment.” Perceptual signature sharp—Elias notices ink under moonlight, compass-rose tilt. No dialogue to judge. Compression taught early (“midsummer sun… dust-hung quiet”) and paid off in clean open-window sunlight. Filter verbs minimal; diction stays within dealer’s lexicon. No head-hop; third-person limited stable.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentences open with differing structures. No loops, scaffold, or synonym churn. Metaphors (“lodestone,” “page turning”) stay coherent; no mixed vehicles. Information density high: one line can set, characterize, and foreshadow. Minor elevated diction (“petrichor”) fits antique dealer; not jarring. Closure image “smooth stones gleaming like polished promises” is crisp, propulsive. No artifact touches final beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Combines map-dealer solitude with magical ants + type-matrix chip + timeline rewrite—fresh synthesis. Vane’s trait of reading charts by moon ink particularizes trope. Ant-as-guide repurposes natural trope without fantasy cliché. Transformation test fails if swapped to generic collector. Risk in lyrical cavern passage heightens awe without losing causality. No close echoes of famous scenes. Not 9+ because conceptual daring is modest within slipstream norms.</comment>
