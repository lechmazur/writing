<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elira’s interiority is concrete—burn scars, trembling fingers, ink’s scent—and her micro-choices (humming lullaby, vertical “breathe” stroke) visibly alter the moment. The contradiction between scholarly rigor and childhood superstition is enacted in real time, not summarized, and the final earned stasis—scars shimmer into waypoints—carries felt cost. No head-count or relationship pressure to test, so only the single-POV criteria apply; all satisfied. A hairline slip: “lattice of old burns” skirts label-speak, though the next clause rescues it with sensory immediacy.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the vertical “breathe” rune + wind exhaling reweights prior failures into living story with undeniable conceptual cost. Accumulative lens holds—density of rune-strokes and mirrored natural pauses tighten until the cadence shift releases. Orientation anchored by line 3 (who, where, when); no causality breaks. The cost is legible in the final line: “stories… alchemize,” a CR that makes the new rule undeniable.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Floating rock platform is not postcard backdrop—its tremor mirrors her pulse and constrains her kneeling posture, directly feeding the ceremony’s stakes. Micro-setting (tea surface, quill, scars) doubles as environment and charges the final mirror-image. Sensory economy is extreme—only four named objects—yet each returns with reweighted meaning. Gate satisfied: platform’s vibration cues the climax beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—turn scars into stories—signaled in paragraph 4; pressure escalates via ink-crystallization risk that could re-burn her. One meaningful tightening: when ink threatens to crystalize, she hums the lullaby, forcing a tactical shift that forecloses the safe scholarly path. Cost is visible—she finishes with liquid ink and scar-shimmer, proving the transmutation succeeded under live risk. Accumulative lens: each rune adds density until “breathe” releases the built pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges solely through image-pattern: spiral/crescent/eye/root/breathe—no explicit thesis. Final CR reweights scars from shame to narrative waypoints without moralizing. Subtext lives in silence: tea untouched until victory sip, wind held then freed. No tidy moral; ambiguity lingers—scars remain, now readable.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyric third-person hover stays tight to Elira’s perceptual sieve: “library dust and dried chamomile,” “midnight moss” ink—idiosyncratic, not ornate. Syntax lengthens during rune-drawing, then snaps to single-stroke “breathe,” mirroring breath control. No dialogue, so no voice-convergence risk. Patterned elision (held breath/time freeze) taught in line 2 and paid off in final exhalation—legible under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence adds new sensory or causal layer. Metaphors stay consistent—ink as bird’s beak, clouds as silk—no mixed vehicles. No filter-verb stacks; action verbs drive. One tiny scaffold: “She did not rush. She did not flinch.”—but the repetition is pressure-motivated and sits before climax, not in closure beat, so allowed.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</question><comment>Fantasy tea-ceremony on levitating rock is fresh, yet grounded in tactile rune logic rather than generic magic. Synthesis of childhood superstition with scholarly rigor feels non-obvious and specific to Elira. Risk taken—time-freeze lyric—is taught early and paid off. Without the rune/stitch concept the arc collapses, satisfying irreplaceability test.</comment>
