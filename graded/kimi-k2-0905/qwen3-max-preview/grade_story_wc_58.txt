<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The traveler’s compulsion to map absence through “intimate cartography” is credibly internalized; the wrist-thread as memory-totem recurs and physically pulses at the climax, grounding motive in body. No second on-page character means relationship crucible is N/A; micro-choices are confined to writing/folding the crane, a quiet but earned act of renunciation that forecloses public witness. The flaw: emotional state is sometimes labeled (“lonesome splendor”) rather than embodied, and the interior contradiction—write to keep alive yet accept permanent gone—stays abstract until the final line. Still, the mapping drive stays consistent and the thread’s final warmth gives a felt, if modest, cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory layer of autumn garden and parchment deepens the dominant stake—how to keep the gone present. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: folding the crane and burying it beneath the dying rosebush reweights the act of writing from private salvage to gift-for-stranger, cost paid in exposure and relinquishment. Anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 3; orientation test waived because twilight garden disorientation serves the lyric closure. No causal plot turns, but pattern of densifying images (leaves, lichen, ink, thread) tightens once when thread glows—sufficient escalation under Accumulative mode.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Shadowed autumn garden is rendered through selective, POV-filtered detail (brittle gold-rimmed leaves, marble nymphs weeping lichen) that mirrors internal desolation without overt symbolism. Micro-setting objects—thread, parchment, rosebush—constrain final gesture: folding paper against thorny roots literalizes the map-as-offering. Spatial choreography stays clean within a single cross-legged locus; weather (bruised twilight, breeze lifting parchment) affects paper and ink, hence choice. Palace-carpet backstory is seeded early and paid off when thread pulses, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—how to keep the gone present—signals in paragraph 1 and tightens when traveler folds the obituary into a crane, shifting from private archive to public offering; this narrows options (can no longer hoard memory). Cost is visible: relinquishing the written life to wind and stranger risks eternal erasure. No antagonist; pressure is situational-lyric—garden’s autumnal decay and silence of departed ships. Under Accumulative lens, single meaningful deepening suffices; here the glow of thread plus burial of crane supplies felt escalation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges obliquely: memory as geography one must walk rather than own. Subtext lives in gestures—thread glow, crane burial—never thesis. Final line “every step stitches sky to sea” offers non-literal, imagistic answer that reweights prior mapping obsession into continuous becoming. No final-paragraph moralizing; avoids sentimentality by keeping Elira’s fate open. Complexity: writing both preserves and relinquishes, a paradox left unresolved.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person lyric remains distant yet saturated with traveler’s perceptual signature: synesthetic nouns (“bruised twilight,” “lichens weep”) and sentence rhythms that mimic slow breathing of someone seated cross-legged. No dialogue, so naturalism test N/A. Register stable—elevated diction suits a mind translating grief into map-grid poetry. Patterned repetition (“each adjective a landmark / each verb a path”) is taught early and paid off in crane-fold cadence. Psychic distance tightens only at thread pulse, a deliberate modulation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Read-aloud ear is strong: syntactic variety, no template cadence; information dense—one sentence often does two jobs (e.g., “They did not pray. / They did not hope. / They mapped.”). Figurative layering is controlled; metaphors stay coherent (map/grammar/sea). Minor scaffold: “each descent a quiet elegy… each crunch…” risks paraphrase loop but differs in object (leaf vs foot) and serves rhythm, so forgiven. Pronouns, tense, punctuation clean. No artifacts in closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Freshest angle: obituary for the living as cartography—conceptual, not gimmick. Thread from coup-carpet and nursemaid whisper supplies specific backstory fuel absent from generic grief tales. Autumn garden as map-table converts cliché into working studio. Transformation test fails if Elira becomes “any exile,” but her salt-wind cliffs/coves/roots imagery is too sensorily particular to swap. Risky lyric accumulation succeeds because closure re-gifts the map to unknown reader, opening rather than hoarding meaning.</comment>
