<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Gamma-7’s interiority is vivid—drumming as embodied rebellion, the 27-ghost chorus behind her eyes—but her moment-to-moment decisions are mostly drift, not fork. The arc lands on Earned Stasis (she accepts the entangled choir), yet the cost feels pre-paid by the experiment rather than freshly forced by a visible choice in the scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each drumming beat layers density until the garden itself takes up the rhythm, delivering a Charged Poise closure—wholeness felt, not explained. Causality is lyric rather than plot-engine; the lagoon’s lift is legible as conceptual repricing of solitude into shared being. Orientation is swift; starlight and garden anchors arrive by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mossy stone, sonic sculptures, liquid-light lagoon—sensory triangulation is selective and POV-slanted. The auric lagoon re-appears at climax as the literal lifting medium, passing the 9+ gate. Spatial tracking is clean; no impossible body hops.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will she surrender to calibrated peace or keep the entangled alive—is signaled early. Escalation is cadence-deepening: garden frequencies almost lull, but her drumming re-ignites the internal choir, narrowing options to embrace rather than erase. Cost is conceptual (perpetual shared skull-space) rather than a new on-page loss.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme—borrowed belonging vs. self-authorship—emerges through the drumming motif shifting from desperate tic to collaborative creation. No final moral; the sky painted in “hues only the entangled could name” reweights isolation into plural vision. Sentiment is avoided by razor-sharp sensory edge.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lyric compression taught early (“rhythms only the dead would recognize”) stays legible. Perceptual signature—the marrow-tide of foreign memories—remains character-bound. No head-hop; garden’s hum is filtered through her skin. Final choral “theirs” is syntactic risk that pays off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong rhythmic variance; sentence lengths breathe with the garden’s pulses. Minor scaffold: “she drummed for…” anaphora risks loop, but each line names a distinct memory, so momentum survives. One mixed metaphor—“auroras trapped in glass”—is forgiven by closure’s reprise. No filter-verb clusters.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Collective-consciousness graft is familiar sf territory, but the refusal to dramatize scientists and instead focus on post-traumatic lyric synthesis feels fresh. Drumming as both rebellion and communal heartbeat turns cliché into lived ritual. Risky cadence structure holds coherence.</comment>
