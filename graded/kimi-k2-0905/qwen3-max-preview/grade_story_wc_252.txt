<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira’s dancer-poise dock work, calloused palms, and whale-bone-hearing micro-choice under cold water give embodied, contradictory interiority. The scrimshaw’s dissolve and her return to kiss a war-orphan’s forehead dramatize a renunciation with visible cost, earned by prior song-syntax. One hairline slip: “taught to fight before she learned to feel” drifts toward diagnostic shorthand, not lived contradiction in scene, capping at 8.7.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/lyric lens holds: bioluminescent kelp → scrimshaw warm → whale-song → island light → salt-kiss. Each recurrence tightens texture and reweights the stake from self-escape to soul-mending. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration: the scrimshaw dissolves into sea-foam, Lira’s grace becomes invitation, conceptual cost undeniable—“violence couldn’t return.” Orientation anchored in first 120 words; no teleport or plot amnesia.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Sublittoral fringe, tide-worn crates, whalebone ridges, and bruised indigo sky are filtered through Lira’s dock-worker gaze, constraining every step she takes toward the water. The bioluminescent kelp and receding island physically guide her choice to wade; the final salt on her lips recharges the opening “salt and surrender.” Setting literally supports her body at climax—no ersatz backdrop.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—freedom through surrender—signals early; pressure tightens each time the scrimshaw warms, the island flickers, and the whale-song peels her armor. One meaningful intensification: the bone flares hot, water at chest level, forcing the redefinition of self. Cost is visible—scrimshaw lost, cold regret endured, new path foreclosed to violence—under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</question><comment>Theme emerges from salt, surrender, and song repetitions that shift from escapism to vocation. Final image of kissing the orphan’s forehead offers non-literal answer: true freedom is tender conduit, not retreat. No moralizing; the whale’s hymn reconfigures meaning without pronouncement. Complexity preserved—violence is impossible yet memory of war still clings like salt.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Third-person lyric sustains dock-worker diction: “calloused palms,” “haul cargo,” “mend nets,” never drifting into academic register. Rhythmic escalation mirrors tide: long clauses tighten into fragments—“And then—the call.” Whale-song syntax breaks into hyphenated seismic pulses. Perceptual signature stays intact under stress; no head-hopping or filter-verb stacks.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Almost zero scaffolding; each sentence layers job, body, and myth. Occasional flourish—“lover’s reproach,” “bruised indigo sky”—but metaphor stays coherent and pattern-taught. One micro-loop: “not from shore, not from sky” could compress, yet serves drum-beat summoning. Closure image crystal-clear, propulsion uninterrupted.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Fusing dock-worker naturalism with whale-summoned vanishing island feels inevitable in hindsight; trope of magical island repurposed as compassion seismograph. Combative tenderness as tonal engine is fresh risk that heightens stakes without gimmick. Specificity—bioluminescent kelp, whalebone ridges—anchors the surreal in tactile labor. Loses 0.2 for faint echo of familiar “island appears to chosen one” scaffold, though inversion (island = resonance, not rock) redeems.</comment>
