<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elias’s interior contradiction—clinging to a burned letter while preaching asymmetry—remains embodied in gesture and micro-choice; the final refusal to re-touch Mara’s hand crystallizes earned stasis with visible cost. Only minor slip: Mara’s late admission “I thought I was rejecting you” drifts toward therapeutic paraphrase, blunting the momentary edge.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the burned edge passed back becomes a conceptual re-pricing of failure into fertile difference, cost felt in the un-walked row between them. Causal chain holds—letter → vineyard parable → parallel vines → final silence—each beat tightening the asymmetry stake without external coincidence. Orientation anchored by word 60; no lens ambiguity at exit.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The amber pavilion’s shifting light literally guides Elias’s hand movements and final positioning; the Merlot/Prunot soil shift at mid-scene forces a tactical pause that reframes the mismatch metaphor. Micro-setting (grape skin under frost) constrains Mara’s taste-test choice, charging the closing image with tangible proof of late sweetness.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—can asymmetry be honored without merger—tightens once: from letter confrontation to vine parable to shared silence that forecloses reunion. Escalation is Accumulative/Textural: each vineyard detail layers density until the frost-sweet grape forces a sensory re-cognition of difference as value. Cost is legible in the deliberate space they finally leave uncrossed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges via shifting vine metaphors rather than assertion; the burned edge reweights from relic to map without authorial commentary. Final image of “vineyard row—fertile, intentional, alive” offers resonant non-literal answer: love’s value lies in the cultivated gap. Avoids sermon; only hairline slip is Elias’s “invitations” line, a touch didactic.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays welded to Elias’s perceptual lens—wind “like secrets,” grapes “taut and purpled by frost”—syntax lengthens and softens during parable, then fragments at the hand-off. No head-hop; Mara’s interior accessed only through gesture and withheld touch. Distinctive rhythmic control: parallel horticultural clauses mimic trellis structure without drumbeat monotony.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>High information density: single sentences fuse sensory, metaphoric, and causal work (“Juice stained her fingers. ‘Sweet,’ she said, surprised.”). No scaffold loops; figurative language thins during peak emotional hand-off, preventing purple clutter. One near-miss: “poetry wrapped in dirt” risks aphorism, but immediately grounded by tactile vineyard step.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Asymmetry-as-fruit trope feels inevitable yet fresh because viticultural specifics (Merlot resists pruning, Pinot welcomes it) are non-generic and tied to tactile payoff. Risk taken: quiet refusal instead of reunion, but coherence preserved. Minor deduction: burned-letter relic nods to familiar epistolary ghost; vineyard recontextualization mostly, not wholly, transforms the trope.</comment>
