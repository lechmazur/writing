<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Deckhand’s grin-scrubbing mantra never cracks; interiority stays sensory, not analytic. His only micro-choice—tune the radio—carries the entire climax, so the arc hinges on a single beat. Lyrical endurance substitutes for contradiction, keeping the score shy of the 9-band where a costlier internal split is required.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Causal chain is thin but legible: disappearances → radio tuning → merged ferries. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—permanence renounced, transience embraced—felt cost is the deckhand’s eternal vigil. Mosaic shards (deck, grotto, deck again) are taught by salt-spray refrain; transitions clear, lens stable.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Salt-corroded brass, dripping starlight, and phosphorescent pebbles are filtered through the deckhand’s polish-and-hum attentions. The radio’s glyphs and hourglass frame serve as micro-setting that literally steers his final tuning. Sensory economy is high; no postcard dump. Environment constrains the choice—only in this grotto do the symbols glow—meeting the 9- gate but not pushing past it.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes—give the vanished riders one solid world—are declared late but tighten fast; each ferry loss is a pressure click. Escalation is via pattern density, not reversals: tuning clicks sync with lunar pulses, foreclosing retreat. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral—he accepts eternal re-weaving—keeping it from the 8.8+ band where a felt price on the body is typical.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</question><comment>Theme emerges as the quiet acceptancy of impermanence; no moral is spoken. The refrains of “sideways clocks” and “braided time” reweight from mystery to vocation. Final cap-tip image crystallizes the stance without preachiness. Lacks the final sting that would push it into 9-territory.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lyric, salt-crusted diction stays inside a deckhand’s sea-shanty lexicon. Rhythmic parallelism (“didn’t sleep. Didn’t eat much. Just worked”) is taught early and paid off in the mantra-like climax. No head-hop; distance stable. Compressed cadence mirrors the oscillating pressure. Minor template echoes (“vanishings weren’t accidents. They were corrections”) hold it below 9.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Sentences carry dual duty—image + concept—without scaffold bloat. A few metaphor stacks (“liquid starlight,” “spectral grotto”) flirt with purple but stay purposeful. No loops or synonym churn; pronouns clean. Opening and closing lines anchor and re-cast the motif. Lacks the last increment of rhythmic surprise needed for 8.8+.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Quantum-ferry vanishings braided by a whistling deckhand is a fresh angle on time-slip tropes. Specificity of maritime tools (hourglass, radio, tide tables) grounds the concept in lived labor. Risk—lyric mosaic instead of causal plot—pays off in resonant closure. Slight dock in final decimals because the premise nods to well-trod “lost commuter” tropes before transcending them.</comment>
