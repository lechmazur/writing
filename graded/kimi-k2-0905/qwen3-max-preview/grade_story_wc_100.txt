<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The undertaker’s stubbornness is more declared than dramatized—his single decisive act (dismantling the lens) is voiced as inevitable rather than fought-for. Interiority is evocative (“his molars ache”) yet slides into abstraction (“he would not ignore this”). Still, the embodied burial ritualist turned beacon-builder carries a coherent, haunted identity that charges the closure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the lens stops broadcasting distress and begins broadcasting belonging—an unmistakable before/after for the dead and for the undertaker himself. Causality holds: each prism placement tightens the harmonic lullaby until unrest is literally re-housed. The cost—his life now spent “deeper” in impossible stacks—lands in the final line.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The underwater library is not backdrop but instrument: silt floors accept prism shards, ceilings arch like ribs, brine currents carry souls. Micro-setting (the statue’s missing eye) becomes the final ignition point. Spatial choreography stays clean as he “carries” shards “into the deepest stacks.” Environment directly enables the closure beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—give unrest a home—tightens once: from receiving distress to becoming its address. Escalation is accumulative: each shard placement deepens the harmonic lullaby, reweighting the stake from “ignore or answer” to “house forever.” The price—permanent self-exile deeper underwater—is legible in the final kneel and rise toward “unsent love letters.”</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from image-pattern: burial vs. beacon, grave vs. library. The lens’s re-tuned signal offers a non-literal answer: rest is not a grave but a broadcast of being seen. No moralizing—just the re-weighting of “permanent address” from stone to light. Ambiguity lingers in the cost of eternal caretaking.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is salted, water-logged, priestly: “he’d spent his life giving rest a permanent address.” Syntax lengthens and softens underwater—no drumbeat. Perceptual signature is mortuary-nerve: noticing bloated spines, pressure against eardrums. Compression in “he would not ignore this” hits like a struck match in the dark—taught early, paid off in cadence shift at the end.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm breathes with pressure—sentence length swells then fractures like glass. Figurative language is selective: “frozen lightning,” “cathedral ribs.” One scaffold loop: “he couldn’t bury it. Couldn’t ignore it.”—but the anaphora serves the beat. No mixed metaphors; diction stays within undertaker’s lexicon. Final image is lean, letting the amber pulse carry weight.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Inverts the rescue-beacon trope: the living answer the dead, not vice-versa. Underwater mausoleum-library as afterlife post-office feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk—lyric escalatio via harmonic shards—pays off in conceptual re-pricing. Specificity of mortuary tools re-purposed for light-work transforms familiar grief lore into fresh ritual.</comment>
