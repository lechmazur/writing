<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The exorcist’s contradictory impulses—columnist sensationalism vs. reparative humility—are dramatized in the moment she uncaps the bottle and clips the coil; the apology costs her public persona and Elias’s silence the price. Interiority is concrete (“she trembled”) and embodied, not diagnostic. The micro-choice to hand over the restored manuscript (with every wrong bar memorized) earns the understated closure of “a small, cracked” smile. Only the occupational detail of “induced currents” feels slightly under-cued for motive credibility.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the orchard will still fall, the relationship not healed, but the shared flawed melody now exists as visible cost (“it was alive. / And it was theirs”). Causal linkage holds: the perfume scent → memory conjuration → manuscript return → acceptance of imperfection. The 120-word orientation anchor is clean (archive, marble floor, orchard clock). No off-stage resolutions; every beat is on-page under Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The archive, perfume bottle, and orchard function as micro-settings that constrain choices: only here can the scent be electrically re-animated; only now, before the axes, does the apology carry weight. Sensory hierarchy obeys POV—yellowed paper, firefly smoke—rather than catalogue. Spatial choreography is precise: bottle chimes on table, coil clipped to lamp, threads braid above. One minor slip: “ Restoration Room” is named late, but the marble floor already anchored location.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—apology acceptance—tightens once: from certain rejection (“he didn’t look up”) to conditional truce (manuscript accepted). Cost is visible: her humiliation, his grief, the orchard’s scheduled death. Agency lies in her decision to expose the imperfect symphony rather than polish it. Under Accumulative lens, the golden threads’ intensification reweights the emotional stake without requiring causal reversals.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme—“imperfect miracles” emerge through shared art and loss—arises from concrete particulars (the sour notes stay in the restored score). No final moralizing; the last image of the orchard “waiting” re-prunes meaning without commentary. Subtext carries in silence: neither embrace nor cry, only the hush. The shifted value of flaw over perfection is earned, not asserted.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet grounded: “quiet rebellion against the silence” marries grit to ethereal. Syntax mirrors musical phrasing—fragment, em-dash, rest—without drumbeat monotony. Perceptual signature is specific: she notices “forgotten crescendos,” he “magnified by spectacles.” No head-hopping; distance stays tight to her sensorium. Register never drifts into academic meta-commentary.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm alternates between long breath and staccato beat; openings vary. Information density high: “tweezers in hand, eyes magnified by spectacles” delivers profession, tension, intimacy in one stroke. No loops or synonym churn; “crumbling score” is the only near-repeat but justified. Metaphor vehicles stay coherent: scent as “golden threads” obeys the electrical reveal. Minor scaffold: “she said / he replied” could be pruned, but does not dull closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fusion of exorcist-as-music-critic, perfume-as-time-machine, and orchard-as-deadline is fresh yet inevitable. The “induced currents” device literalizes metaphor without gimmickry because emotional logic precedes it. Risk—the unresolved orchard, the unhealed relation—heightens meaning. If swapped to another setting the emotional engine collapses, proving specificity.</comment>
