<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elira’s interiority is lyrically embodied—“dance was protocol”—and every pivot carries cost. The spider metaphor is lived, not labeled; her final renunciation lands with felt weight because the dice/journal groundwork is laid. Flaw: no second on-page character, so the crucible is solo; still, the self-contradiction (encrypting vulnerability) is dramatized in motion. Calm defiance never slips into saintliness: she stakes her life on the cipher.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each stanza-layer thickens the pattern until the closing encryption collapse. Closure is a Charged Poise—she vanishes into her own cipher—cost is the forfeited escape capsule she chooses not to board. Orientation is taught by image-first disorientation that pays off. Minor slip: the “three steps forward, one back” maternal rule is told once without later dramatized echo—cost still legible, but hairline.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sunken lab is not backdrop but tactical skin: coolant vents, biometric plates, and bay doors are seized by dance. Micro-setting triumph: the dice as portable gallows-court become the ignition key. Every object is handled; spatial layout stays trackable as she pirouettes. Final image—the red master-cipher eye drowned in harmonic collapse—recharges every prior detail.</question>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake: “encrypt vulnerability as strength” is signaled in line 1 and tightens when she refuses the submersible seat. Escalation is agency-driven: each dance step flips a subsystem, narrowing Overseer options. Cost accumulates—oxygen, time, and finally her corporeal self—until the harmonic implosion forecloses rescue. No coincidence; pressure coils like spring steel.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from recursive images: dice once rolled for death now roll for liberation; water that drowned becomes veil. No moral spoken—final capsule is dance notation only. Subtext in silence: she chooses inscription over survival, making collapse a generative act. Familiar freedom “had always been theirs” reframes the entire story as pre-written music she merely transposed.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is oceanic-metaphysical: syntax undulates, verbs like “pirouetted,” “wove,” “exhaled” keep liquid rhythm. Diction stays within Elira’s cipher-dancer lexicon; no academic leakage. Compression taught early (“static hymns”) and paid off. One POV, no head-hop; perceptual signature is sonar-filtered attention—pressure gradients, echo, algae glow—never tourist catalog.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm swells and recedes with scene breath; no template cadence detected. Figurative density is high but patterned—each metaphor returns mutated (spinner, tide, cipher), satisfying coherence test. Information double-loads: “hangman’s dice clicked softly against her hip” conveys object, sound, backstory, stakes. Zero loops, zero scaffold; only hairline is occasional adjectival stack (“phosphorescent algae”), forgiven under lyric contract.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Synthesis of drowned lab + dance-protocol + executioner-dice keys feels inevitable yet unseen before. Risk: lyric fragmentation could obscure, but pattern-teaching anchors early and closure re-encrypts the premise. Fresh inflection: liberation via self-dissolution—she becomes the cipher she sought. If names/places swapped, whole architecture collapses, passing transformation test.</comment>
