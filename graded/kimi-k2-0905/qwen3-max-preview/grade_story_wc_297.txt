<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority is lush, embodied, and idiosyncratic—“purposefully curious gaze,” “roots deeper into her soles”—showing a mind fused with world. Contradictory impulses (hunger vs. reverence, rootedness vs. forward pull) act simultaneously, propelling every beat. The final surrender to the glade’s exhale is foreshadowed by scar-mapped conduits and clipping-as-key, so renunciation carries visceral cost. No safety-hedging: flaws (oath-breaker lineage, time-stranded chaos) stay live and complicit in the ritual.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: image-density coils tighter until the cobalt helix re-prices the covenant’s meaning. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) taught by second sentence; disorientation is functional and paid off in final merge. Closure is a Charged Poise: the ground exhales, light spirals, options rewire without exposition. Cost is legible in the instant her roots lock—body as final currency.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Cobalt glade, dusk bruise, moss-dais, and clipping function as micro-setting: every tactile detail constrains the ritual steps. Cobalt hue returns in the helix, re-weighting the palette at closure. Spatial choreography is immaculate—feet fuse, clipping sinks, sky darkens with memory—tracking body-prop-environment as one circuit. Sensory hierarchy narrows to scent of iron/incense and root-pressure, mirroring internal eclipse.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: resurrect the eclipsed covenant before the glade “forgets itself.” Tightening occurs when clipping sinks—only one chance, no redo. Agency is continuous: mapping scars, pressing key, breathing with earth—all foreclose retreat. Cost is her body locked into the node; options narrow to permanent fusion.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges from pattern: vows buried by bureaucracy sprout again through vegetal nervous system. Subtext in “dreams are private” lie vs. scar-threads that make dreams communal property. Final cobalt helix visually answers the thematic question—privacy disintegrates into shared rootwork. No moralizing; resonance lingers in afterimage of collective dreaming.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyric, incantatory rhythm mirrors glade’s pulse; cadence swells then exhales with the ground. Diction stays within visionary’s esoteric lexicon—no corporate register drift. Perceptual signature is consistent: every noun is filtered through synaptic vegetal metaphor. Compression taught early (“future arrived early”) and paid off in collapse of time at spiral.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High-density lines carry triple duty—e.g., “clutched…snipped…mirrored” packs action, backstory, neurology in one stroke. No mixed metaphors; cobalt as color, light, and covenant return builds coherent palette. Rhythm accelerates into final spiral without scaffold loops. Opening and closing sentences anchor and release with mirror-echo precision.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Eclipsed dream-covenant enacted through vegetal neural network is non-obvious synthesis. Risk of root-immobility accepted and paid—body becomes modem. Specificity of maze topiary clipping as biometric key prevents trope drift. Final cobalt helix reconfigures familiar eclipse trope into communal nervous-system rebirth.</comment>
