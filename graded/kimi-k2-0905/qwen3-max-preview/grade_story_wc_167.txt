<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The glazier’s interior life is vivid—tracing prisms, listening to ripples—but his only micro-choice is dropping the stone; the rest is observation. No contradiction or visible cost is dramatized; the stance at the end is the same as at the start, so renunciation feels assumed, not earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the stone-drop tightens the pattern and yields a resonant reconfiguration—“a ghost-map of forces briefly made visible.” Closure is a Charged Poise; cost is conceptual (mundane world will soon erase the vision) but still feels rather than dramatized, keeping it just under high-band.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Harbor mist, damp pier, prism frame, tide-pool rings—every sense detail is filtered through the glazier’s glass-maker gaze and steers attention. The prism constrains the final image, reweighting the alley view; setting actively shapes the closing beat, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“illuminate value in the mundane”—is declared, but no credible obstacle or trade-off ever materializes; pressure is atmospheric, not tactical. Escalation is a single texture-deepening (stone rings meet prism light) rather than a narrowing of options, so cost remains conceptual, not viscerally felt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: the sacred hidden in scraps of glass, laundry lines, cormorant drops. Final image of Widow Hargrove’s soon-transfigured alley reweights prior motifs without moralizing, achieving a quiet Conceptual Repricing that lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person intimate carries a glass-bent perceptual signature—light fractures, spectral shards, silent ledgers—held start-to-finish. Rhythm modulates with misty elongation then sharp prism flare; no head-hopping, no filter-verb bloat; voice propels atmosphere rather than stalls it.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lyric density is high yet patterned; metaphor vehicles stay optical (refraction, spectral shards), preventing internal contradiction. Sentences vary in length and cadence; only minor scaffold—“the bay would wake soon, loud and brash and ordinary”—but it pays off the hush/ordinary tension, so artifact touches not closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>“Communing via pond rings” freshens the familiar dawn-on-the-pier vignette; prism-as-micro-atrium gives concrete specificity. Conceptual turn—physics as prayer—feels inevitable yet non-obvious, lifting the piece above nostalgic harbor cliché without gimmickry.</comment>
