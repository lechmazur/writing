<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The dye master’s interiority is textured—her borrowed pulse, stolen wing, and tear-warmed dye ground her in embodied contradiction. Yet her pivot from replication to self-fracture is more declared than dramatized; we see the insight (“she understood”) rather than a micro-choice that costs her on-page. The old man’s scarred throat and humming offer a perfect secondary crucible, but their magnetism is observed, never tested in a visible decision that risks her new stance. Still, the arc of letting her own fractures gleam is credible and character-particular.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the fabric that “responded to gaze… like a heartbeat caught mid-sigh” crystallizes her new ethic of authentic fracture under the Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality is lyric rather than plot-driven—each sunrise observation thickens pattern until the tilt of light reweights meaning; no orientation debt. The cost is felt in the patrons’ wordless tears and her own silence—an earned stasis that forecloses the old quest for imitation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The floating tea house, moss ledge, and valley mist are never backdrop: the hovering “tethered by belief” mirrors the protagonist’s suspended identity, while the mist curls “like a question” to charge the final image. The morpho wing serves as micro-setting—its ridges mapped by breath and memory—constraining her method and final dye. Spatial choreography is immaculate; light angle, body position, and silk motion track cleanly. Sensory hierarchy tilts to the visual, but that bias is POV-true for a dye master.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stake is early and singular: learn why some lives catch light. Pressure accumulates through pattern, not plot—each sunrise observation tightens the weave of possibility until the oblique-glance insight reweights options. No external antagonist is needed; the tightening is the shift from replication to self-fracture, paid for in public exposure of her tear-scaled cloth. Cost is legible in the patrons’ wordless weeping and her own relinquishment of explanation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges refractively: magnetism is structural, not pigment—authentic cracks bend light. The morpho wing, donor heart, and scarred hummer are particulars that refuse moralization; the final image of flickering cloth offers a conceptual repricing rather than a maxim. Subtext lives in silences, trembling hands, and the angle of gaze; no late thesis statement mars the resonance. Ambiguity is purposeful, inviting re-reading without confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Voice is lush yet disciplined, its periodic cadences mimicking light ridges on a wing. Diction stays within the dye master’s sensorium—hue, breath, lattice—without thesaurus drift. Compression is taught early (“quiet explosion of insight”) and paid off in the heartbeat cloth. No head-hop; focalization remains tight to her noticing, even when children whisper.</question>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</question><comment>Sentence rhythm varies from long light-tracking sweeps to fragmentary bursts that mimic micro-lattice breaks. Figurative density is high but patterned, not purple; every metaphor bends back to iridescence or pulse. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; information is layered—“sun trails across the wing’s scales” does world, tool, and metaphor in one stroke. Copy-clean; only a single minor tense wobble (“had become”) under pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of donor-heart memory, morpho structural color, and floating tea-house belief system feels inevitable yet fresh. Risk is taken in the lyric accumulative structure—no conventional plot turn—yet coherence holds. The conceit that authenticity is angle-dependent refracts both textile science and human charisma. Specificity throughout (moss ledge, chrysanthemum, powdered scales) prevents abstraction; removal would collapse the entire prism.</comment>
