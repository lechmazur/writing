<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete, particular, and embodied (“dull, heavy kind that settles in your joints”); the contradictory impulse to hoard regret while yearning to stop is kept in simultaneous tension. The micro-choice to hand the camera to the ghost and accept the empty film is earned by the prior accumulation of fragments and defeats, and it visibly forecloses her obsessive archiving with the phrase “frame it,” not fix it. Flaws—gullibility, solipsism—compound throughout and are accepted, not cured, in the Earned Stasis on the spire. No therapy-speak; voice stays idiosyncratic and sensorily anchored.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of fragment-gathering and camera-clicks builds density until the final flash reweights meaning. Closure lands as Charged Poise—she sits, legs dangling, camera empty, silence “thick as cloud,” cost felt in relinquished illusion of control. The envelope’s single line “frame it” re-prices the entire premise: regret is to be composed, not erased. Persistent constraint (no film, no pictures) shapes every late tactic and the final stance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Micro-setting of the rusted calliope ribs and the corroded flash unit anchor bodily action and choice; the salt-crusted planks under boots return to echo memory and pressure balance. Spatial choreography stays clean across the climb to the central spire, with the drawer reveal plausibly embedded in the carousel machinery. Sensory hierarchy privileges touch and sound over panoramic vistas, keeping attention tight. The lagoon’s stillness and twin moons function as atmospheric mirrors of stilled inner time rather than tourist spectacle.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Dominant stake—whether she will keep collecting ghosts or confront her own—is signaled early and tightens through each fragment-finding beat. The camera hand-off is the meaningful turn: it narrows her options from endless scavenging to single-frame acceptance. Cost is visible: empty film, dissolved ghost, silence instead of archive. Coincidence (drawer opens) is accepted because it delivers conceptual repricing, not causal rescue.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</question><comment>Theme emerges without statement: regret is not a puzzle to solve but a composition to frame. The shift from “capturing echoes” to being captured by an empty flash reconfigures ambition as stillness. Subtext operates in gestural code—ghost adjusting an invisible lens—clarifying that perspective, not possession, is the only exit. Final image resists moralizing, offering quiet, earned resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</question><comment>First-person voice maintains a distinct lyrical cadence and metaphoric density (“salt-crusted planks that remember music”) without monotony. Syntax mirrors temporal distortion—ellipses, en-dashes, clause layering—taught early and held to closure. No filter-verb stacks; perception stays embodied. Diction stays within scavenger-poet lexicon; no register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</question><comment>Rhythm varies naturally; sentence lengths swell and contract with breath of discovery vs. sparsity of ending. Figurative language is selective, not carpet-bombed, and avoids mixed metaphors. One paraphrase loop—“I remember… I also recall…”—is purposeful pattern, not scaffold. Information density high: each sentence layers image, emotion, and world rule.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.4</question><comment>Fresh synthesis: regret-as-exposed-film that can only be framed, not developed. Carousel-as-time-pool transcends trope via tactile specificity and rule-driven stillness. Risk in second-person address to self (“you were never meant…”) lands without gimmick because handwriting is objective prop. Conceptual payoff feels inevitable yet non-obvious in hindsight.</comment>
