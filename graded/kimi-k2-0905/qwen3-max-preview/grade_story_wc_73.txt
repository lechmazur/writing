<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The grim optimist’s marrow-deep contradiction—climbing to capture the texture of not-climbing—remains vividly embodied; every footfall and whispered proof is a micro-choice that keeps regret alive. The chipped die’s click and eventual vanishing externalize the interior fault-line; his laughter when the stairs keep moving while he sits is a perfect earned stasis. No epiphany resets him; instead the staircase digests his equations and he keeps ascending, now carrying the captured texture inside—cost felt in the empty pocket. Interiority avoids therapy-speak; embodied tension between hope and futility stays specific to this body, this step.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the liquid-glass ripple lets him touch the unlived moment, the die disappears, and the ascent rewrites itself from mourning to material. Causality is accumulative/textural—each carved equation is swallowed, digested, and returned as propulsion; the final image reweights the rule-set so perpetual motion now includes him as carrier rather than victim. Orientation is taught by deliberate disorientation early and paid off when geometry liquefies; cost is palpable in the empty pocket and the taller stance. No teleporting props; the missing corner of the die is the persistent constraint that shapes tactics until it vanishes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The staircase functions as micro-setting: its refusal to acknowledge up/down and its 37-step rhythm directly constrain tactics—counting, carving, rolling. Stone that turns liquid glass for three seconds supplies the climactic tactile mirror; the velvet/ozone arcade fragment is conjured through sensory recall anchored in present touch. Spatial choreography is immaculate—he sits, is carried upward scraping, stands again; no impossible positions. Economy is extreme yet selective: “hollow promise of progress,” “geometry of infinity” deliver world-rules in two phrases.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—capture the texture of missed opportunity—is signaled in paragraph three and tightens when equations vanish and the die keeps rolling non-sevens. Escalation is accumulative: each absorbed proof digests intellect into propulsion, narrowing options to either keep bleeding math or accept absorption; the liquid moment forces a trade-off—touch the past, lose the die. Cost is visible in the empty pocket and the taller stance that follows; perpetual motion is re-priced from sentence to sentence. Agency remains credible—he chooses to speak proofs aloud after carving fails, then to touch the reflection—each shift alters tactic under rising pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges without dictation: perpetual motion as regret engine, mathematics as both scalpel and sustenance. The final image—climbing now “carrying the captured texture”—reweights every prior equation and roll into a non-literal answer: regret becomes propellant rather than weight. No moral is stated; the paradox that ascent requires internalizing stasis is left humming. Subtext lives in gesture: die clicks, equations vanish, staircase digests—all imply the system runs on unspent choice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is crystalline, compressed, rhythmic: “balancedly daring, grimly optimistic” becomes iterative drum without monotony because syntax keeps compressing—noun phrases stack into new propulsion. Perceptual signature filters every detail through a mathematician’s regret: steps are theorems, die is metronome, void is geometry. No filter-verb stacks; immediacy is absolute. Register never drifts; diction stays inside a man who proves and gambles in the same breath.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sentences do triple duty—advance image, compress philosophy, maintain rhythm: “The staircase absorbed them without protest, the symbols vanishing within minutes, as if the structure itself were digesting his intellect, converting proof into propulsion.” Zero paraphrase loops; every clause adds new conversion. Metaphors stay coherent—geometry, engine, digestion—no mixed vehicles. High-pressure beats favor short, percussive fragments that sync with pulse. Opening and closing lines anchor and re-charge motif: echo of hollow promise becomes captured texture.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The infinite staircase as perpetual-motion regret engine feels inevitable yet wholly fresh; no familiar template matches this specific synthesis. Chipped die whose missing corner equals absence of seven is a concrete particular that could not swap with any other object. Mathematical proof as both weapon and food, swallowed by architecture, is a non-obvious escalation. Risk—lyric compression, absent antagonist, no traditional plot—heightens rather than obscures meaning; closure reconfigures physics into felt absence.</comment>
