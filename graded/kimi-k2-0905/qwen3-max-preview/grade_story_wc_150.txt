<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s gently stubborn, tactile curiosity is credibly diaspora-anchored; every micro-choice (kneeling, brushing moss, cradling artifacts) flows from the same soil-under-nails identity. The internal contradiction—seeking faith yet fearing demanding wonder—stays alive in scene, not summary. The final decision to remain as “quiet compass” costs her the chance to declare victory, an Earned Stasis that the text has quietly prepared. The only bar to 9 is a trace of explanatory lullaby shorthand that tells us her people’s exile rather than letting us overhear it.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens announced in the first paragraph with the orchard exhaling; each unearthed object adds density until the re-assembled dial reframes the whole pattern. The closure is a Charged Poise: the villagers arrive but choose not to wake her, crystallizing a new social contract—faith as shared listening. Cost is palpable: she forfeits hero-centrality, surrendering narrative spotlight to communal seeds/candles. Orientation, causality, and pattern all pay off in that final communal hush.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Catacomb orchard is simultaneously grave, grove, and clock; the biomechanics of roots curling around her wrists makes the place an active agent. Bones, petals, rust-blades, and locket build a sensory ladder that peaks when “petals rained down…in slow spirals” under last amber light. Spatial choreography is impeccable—each dig site, niche, and drip echo keeps the 3-D map legible. The sundial qualifies as micro-setting that physically constrains the climax, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recover communal rhythm—threads every beat; each unearthed object intensifies the cost of failure. The dial’s re-assembly is the single decisive tightening that forces communal arrival and her silent abdication. Pressure stays internal/textural, yet the forfeiture of heroic acclaim is a visible price. Slight shortfall: no external antagonist or time limit means escalation is more accretion than narrowing.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from pattern, not sermon: diaspora, rupture, repair re-weighted when sundial’s shadow aligns and villagers choose reverence over spectacle. Final image of “shadow cast anew each dawn” reframes earlier root/bone motif without declaring a moral. Subtext operates in gesture—roots steadying her wrists equals ancestral consent. No thematic-expo lines, no tidy binaries; complexity lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lyric-accumulative voice sustains a hushed, incantatory rhythm that matches cautious enchantment. Syntax favors prepositional pile-ups (“breathed in twilight, its gnarled roots threading…”) yet stays legible because pattern is taught early. No head-hopping; perceptual filter stays tethered to Elara’s skin-level curiosity. A hairline slip—“time itself bent like roots around relics” flirts with abstraction—keeps it shy of 9.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentence music is deliberate: cadence breathes with dusk-light and petal-fall, accelerating only during dig beats. Figurative density is high but patterned; mixed metaphors are avoided. Two micro-loops (“roots…roots”; “faith…faith”) are forgiveable echoes inside incantatory design. No scaffolding or filter-verb stacks; every clause advances image, pressure, or insight.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fusion of necropolis + arbor + horologe feels inevitable yet fresh; no genre template matches this root-licked catacomb clock. Diaspora return as quiet archaeology of communal time is non-obvious and culturally specific. Risk—lyric stasis—pays off because closure reconfigures stakes. The transformation test fails: swap bones for generic ruins and the emotional calculus collapses, proving idiosyncrasy.</comment>
