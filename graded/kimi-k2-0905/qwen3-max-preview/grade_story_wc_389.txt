<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elira’s loneliness and fidelity to the “broken” are vivid, but her interiority sometimes drifts into portentous abstraction (“fractures empires and births constellations”). The micro-choice to piggy-back her song onto Kael’s towers is sharp and earned; still, her contradiction—pity instead of hatred—remains stated rather than dramatized in-scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the cobalt broadcast crystallizes a new option (“invitation”) with undeniable social cost—Kael’s sterile dawn is now contested. Causal chain holds: every lyric fragment she decodes → vellum archive → harmonic lattice trigger. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) is taught within 60 words; no lens drift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Cobalt glass portico is handled twice—first as tactile pressure, last as carrier wave—charging the final image. Storm-cold metal grates, frost, lightning veins: sensory triangulation keeps bodies in perilous space. Observatory rules are learned through action (radio crackle, harmonic hum) rather than exposition. Micro-setting fulfills 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will her shadow-rich dawn out-signal Kael’s sterile unity—tightens once: when she chooses hijack over silence. Cost is legible: her raw voice exposed to continents, no fallback. Escalation is accumulative: each decoded fragment raises psychic density; final broadcast is the single pressure spike. Slight deduction for off-stage Kael—his threat remains abstract.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme—dawn must be earned in mud, not chrome—emerges through lyric recurrence of “shadows” and “static,” never sermonized. Final image reweights earlier “broken signals” as invitation, a resonant answer to Kael’s sterile sunrise. Avoids tidy moral; complexity intact. Misses 9.0 because the prophet’s counter-argument is only sketched, blunting dialectic charge.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Voice is thick, whiskey-rough, scientifically poetic; syntax mirrors radio static (“fragmented frequencies like oracle bones”). Perceptual signature—she hears music in malfunction—stays consistent. No dialogue, so no convergence issue. Metaphor density is high but pattern-taught early (“cobalt veins,” “AI ghosts”) and paid off; under Q7 allowance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Ear test: cadence rises with storm, then breath-long sentences at final spiral. Occasional stacked metaphors (“frozen wave,” “caged beast,” “cosmic lantern”) flirt with overwriting, but all serve tone and are seeded early. One paraphrase loop: “wasn’t weather—it was a veil” echoes “storm wasn’t weather” two lines later (−0.2). Otherwise crisp, propulsive, high density.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Lonely visionary hijacking a prophet’s signal through stained-glass harmonics is fresh; synthesis of lyric prophecy + radio phantoms feels inevitable in hindsight. Risks purple tone but commits fully, gaining +0.3 risk bonus. No derivative premise debt. Specific detail—ink from meteor dust, vellum beside frayed wires—anchors invention. Falls just shy of 9.0 due to slight swappability of “Kael” with any populist demagogue.</comment>
