<comment>Silas’s grief is rendered through embodied ritual—soot-stained fingers, thumbnail cranes—and the micro-choice to polish the final sapphire in silence crystallizes his arc; the cost is felt when the basilica trembles and the isle drifts sideways. Interior contradiction is present yet subtle: he both feeds and starves the shadow. The origami crane that hovers at the end is a credible Earned Stasis: he accepts a living warmth that can never replace her. A hairline slip: “luminous torment” veers toward label-speak in the climactic paragraph, nudging down from 9-band.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the shadow becomes mirror, the isle drifts into grief-grace dimension, and the sideways motion reweights every prior lantern. Causality holds under Accumulative/Textural lens—pattern of folded grief, gem-polished dreams, cranes descending-while-ascending—culminating in the sapphire’s silent polish that collapses the world. Orientation is taught early via “gravity wept” and “time curled,” waiver applies. Cost is legible in the final chord that folds pain into lift.</comment>

<comment>The basilica’s prismatic spires, tea cups that never cool, and camellia roots drinking sky are not backdrop but tactical: they constrain Silas’s ritual and charge the final image when petals unfold in reverse. Micro-setting dominance—dream-glass, gem essence, paper wings—functions as environment-body-tool hybrid. Spatial choreography remains clean through the nave-to-window crane ascent. One hairline slip: “into a dimension where grief and grace share the same breath” abstracts momentarily, but the next sentence re-grounds via the falling sapphire.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—preserve wife’s last dream vs. release it—tightens when the basilica hums a new key, forcing the choice to shatter lanterns. Escalation is textural: each lantern shard adds refractive weight until silence itself becomes the decisive polish. Cost is visible: the shadow drinks, the isle detaches, the cranes fly counter-physics. Agency is renunciation rather than triumph; the sideways drift forecloses return.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the inversion of containment: grief folded into cranes refuses to stay sealed. Subtext lives in gesture—steam, shards, silence—never sermon. The final image of the glowing crane holding air still offers a non-literal answer: memory becomes lift, not tomb. One micro-dip: “luminous torment” flirts with thematic echo, but the context re-anchors it in visual physics.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric-accumulative, patterned through synesthetic color-sound (“refracted light humming”) and compressed paradox (“stars fell upward”). Filter verbs are voice-motivated (“he saw her smile” mirrors the mirror). Syntax tightens under pressure—final paragraph drops to single clause beats mimicking folding. No head-hopping; perceptual signature remains locked to Silas’s fingertip weight and silence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</question>
<comment>Line-level craft is dense yet breathable: “each sip a memory steeped too long” performs triple duty—sensory, metaphor, backstory. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or pressure. Metaphors are coherent within dream-logic physics. Minor cadence overlap in triple adjective runs (“heavier, sharper, folded tighter”) but the escalation justifies the rhythm.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Synthesis of lantern-making, gem-polishing, origami, and anti-gravity tea garden feels inevitable yet uncatalogued. Risk-taking in the “descend while ascend” mechanic pays off at closure when space itself folds. Fresh inflection: sorrow’s echo is optically cut, not psychologically described. The premise could not survive name-swap; dream-recording via facet-angle is story-specific physics.</comment>
