<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Silas’s yearning for music in silence is viscerally embodied—his “phantom chords” and moss-cradling of the insulator—but his interior contradiction (listening vs. imposing) stays abstract; no micro-choice visibly risks failure until the final strum, so the renunciation feels slightly gifted rather than paid for in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: silence → found object → crack-analysis → carved resonance chamber → grove re-awakens; each step tightens options toward the final hum. The insulator’s “stress-rungs as score” is a taught pattern that pays off when fractures become literal frets of sound, delivering conceptual cost: brokenness = voice.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Sensory triage is POV-driven—dew-laden spines, frost-humming bark, “silver shimmer” alder—while the porcelain’s tactile fractures and the hedgehog’s nose-twitch anchor scale. The grove evolves from vacuumed silence to wind-threaded instrument; spatial choreography stays clean as Silas kneels, cradles, hollows, steps back.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—break silence or endure it—tightens when analysis of cracks replaces carving wood; agency is cerebral but active. Cost is conceptual yet felt: the insulator’s former failure becomes the grove’s lung, foreclosing Silas’s old solitary listening; the price is the permanent exposure of his private symphony to the living network.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through material metaphor: fracture → frequency, isolation → resonance. No capital-T thesis; the final image of the grove “humming with memory” reweights earlier silence without moralizing. Subtext in gesture—tears as recognition, not triumph—keeps complexity: empathy is reciprocal sculpture.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Silas’s synesthetic ear; diction (“sap-rush,” “creek chuckle”) is idiosyncratic yet consistent. Rhythm swells with prepositional cadences that mimic musical phrasing, then fractures into shorter beats at the hum-release, mirroring tension resolved. No head-hop; perceptual signature sustained.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>High density—most sentences carry image + motion + metaphor; yet occasional stacked qualifiers (“green, slow mouth”) verge on purple. No loops or scaffold; pronouns track cleanly. The final “softer than a moth’s wing” line earns its hush through prior sonic build, avoiding sentimental overwrite.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Premise—sculptor who carves resonance into living wood via cracked porcelain—is fresh synthesis of eco-music and kintsugi. Hedgehog as witness rather than device avoids twee; risk-taking in lyric causality pays off. Could tip toward familiar “artist heals nature” arc, but the stress-crack score mechanic rescues specificity.</comment>
