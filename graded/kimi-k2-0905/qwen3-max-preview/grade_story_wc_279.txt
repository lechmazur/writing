<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Artist’s interiority is sensorily rich—palming the humming tile, tracing spirals “like iron filings”—and her renunciation of the mural to the mist is earned. Yet the “socially perceptive” trait is asserted more than dramatized; we’re told she once “read crowds,” but no live social field tests that gift here, muting the trait’s payoff.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the tile cracks, the hush crystallizes into “presence,” and she leaves the mandala to dissolve—an Earned Stasis with felt cost. Causal chain holds: each fingertip swirl visibly alters the emergent voices, tightening options until silence re-weights meaning. Orientation anchored within first 120 words; lens (Accumulative/Textural) stays coherent.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Grotto as micro-setting is tactile—dripping stone, scent of wet limestone, mist curling like “second skin”—and directly shapes action: the absorbent walls squeeze sound into the mandala. Final image of rain on her window reprises the grotto’s water-mandala, re-weighting meaning. Tool (tile flake) handled and cracked on-page, fulfilling 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“learn to hear meaning inside mess”—tightens when the mandala’s voices synchronize into one tone, foreclosing her old reflex to fix chaos. Cost is visible: tile fractures, mandala surrendered to erosion. Escalation is textural density, not causal reversal, but pressure stays coherent under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without sermon: meaning is not imposed but listened from patterns we create. Final rain-window image reprises mandala motif, re-pricing silence as generative. Ambiguity lingers—she smiles at off-key violin—inviting reader resonance beyond the page.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Lyric third-person floats close to skin, diction poetic yet controlled: “mist clinging like second skin,” “lilac unease.” Rhythm modulates—long breaths for mist, clipped fragments when tile cracks. No head-hopping; perceptual signature stays consistent and charged through closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Information-dense lines: “Each line was a question; each curve, a hesitation” advance both craft and philosophy. Metaphors stay coherent (magnet/iron filings). One paraphrase loop mid-page (“whispers…whispers…whispers”) slightly dulls momentum, but artifacts don’t touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Fusion of acoustics + sand mandala + spiritual unlearning feels fresh; not a trope checklist. Risky lyric density pays off when tile cracks and silence sings. Specific detail—pilfered cathedral flake, lilac-tinted discomfort—anchors novelty in sensory particulars.</comment>
