<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied—“sinew thread pulsed warm as a sleeping vein,” “she stepped over thresholds that didn’t exist until she crossed them.” Motivation stays coherent: map connection, not escape. The final renunciation—she releases the thread—pays off prior stitching beats with visible cost (gallery ruptures, mirrors show truer selves). Minor slip: no genuine flaw or contradiction compounding mistakes; her calm never cracks under pressure, so arc is more revelation than struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the thread’s release re-stitches the gallery into a new possible space, cost felt in the “older, quieter” mirror-self. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern of stitching intensifies until environment ruptures and reweighs meaning. Causality intact: each memory-woven stitch thickens the thread and provokes gallery resistance. Orientation anchored by second sentence; no teleporting props.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Optical gallery is not backdrop but engine—walls “rippled like muscle,” staircases “dissolved into ribbons,” forcing her footfalls and threading tactics. Micro-setting = the thread itself, whose pulsing warmth anchors bodily attention and charges the final image when it floats rather than falls. Sensory hierarchy mirrors POV bias: she notices warped perspective, temperature of memories, not tourist catalog. Environment constrains—doorways swallow reflections, limiting her paths to the next fold.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><answer>Single dominant stake—map the texture of connection—signaled early. Escalation is textural: each stitched memory tightens the gallery’s resistance until the ceiling splits; the thread’s hum shifts from faint to blazing, a felt price. Agency remains hers—she chooses to keep weaving despite mirror-warnings. No reversal, but the rupture/self-reweave constitutes a meaningful deepening that forecloses the old gallery and opens the corridor of “half-remembered birthdays,” cost visible in her aged mirror image.</answer>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particular stitched moments—bridge kiss, salt rain—rather than thesis: connection is the friction of longing against loss. Final image reweights premise: gallery exhales, corridor of unsent letters opens, answering “what holds us when memory unravels?” with texture, not objects. Subtext resides in gesture—she hums a lullaby never sung, implying inherited absence. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in “something between sorrow and satisfaction.”</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is distinct: “thresholds that didn’t exist until she crossed them,” “rational enchantment,” “grammar of consciousness.” Syntax stays compact, rhythm breaths with corridor folds. No dialogue, so no register clash. Internal distance stable; no head-hop. Lyric pattern (stitch, thread, weave) taught early and paid off in airborne self-repair. Compression (“she wasn’t lost; she was mapping”) advances stakes without exposition.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High information density: “Marble cracked into lace. Staircases dissolved into ribbons of shadow.” Metaphors stay congruent—fabric/vein/stitch lexicon coherent. No synonym loops; each sentence advances image or pressure. Minor scaffold: repeated “she remembered” anaphora thrice; serves cadence but slightly visible. Final line anchors motif: “bare feet silent on the threshold of what came next,” echoing barefoot opening.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fever dream architect who maps by weaving memory-threads into a breathing gallery—fresh synthesis of body, space, emotion. “Realistically imaginary” object obeys internal rules yet remains nonexistent to others, transforming familiar surrealism into tactile craft. Risk of over-lyric density is embraced and paid off when the gallery literally un-stitches itself. Conceptual integrity: rational enchantment insists magic follow deeper grammar, satisfied by geometric memory anchors.</comment>
