<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The bell-ringer’s synesthetic gift is vivid, but her interiority drifts toward poetic self-diagnosis (“midwifing awe”) rather than embodied contradiction. No micro-choice after the first strike visibly risks or costs her anything; the cavern, not the protagonist, does all the changing. The ending’s “beacon” is asserted, not dramatized, so the arc feels bestowed rather than earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: each chromatic strike layers density until the hush itself is re-sculpted, delivering a legitimate CR at the end (“wonder certified as oxygen”). Orientation is crisp by line 3; transitions are unnecessary in the single scene. The only causal slack is that the amber sheet melts without prior causal seeding, a minor teleporting prop.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Ice cavern functions as both cathedral and instrument; prism-bell, quartz veins, and aurora concretely constrain how sound becomes color and vice versa. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven—she tastes G-minor as burnt caramel—never touristic. The final image of “sculpted hush” breathing is inseparable from the setting’s physical transformation, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“certify wonder as essential”—is signaled early and deepens through each chromatic chord that rewrites the cavern. Escalation is textural: the hush thickens, thaws, then dances; options narrow to “sing daily or let wonder brittle.” Cost is conceptual rather than personal; a visible physical price from the ringer would push this into 8+ band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through synesthetic translation of silence into living color; no moral is declared. The child’s laughter thawed by resonance reweights earlier ice-entombed memories without commentary. Final image—“every snowflake hummed”—offers a CR that re-prices wonder as atmospheric necessity, not luxury.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lyric third-person hovers at psychic distance 2–3, flexing with pressure; syntax grows shorter at each strike (“She struck again…”). Synesthetic metaphors are consistent, never purple, and the POV never leaks omniscience. The aurora-light in her hair at exit is a taught pattern payoff, not ornament.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Rhythm modulates from cathedral-long sentences to shard-like fragments during strikes; no template cadence detected. Information density is high—one sentence often does scent, color, and emotional temperature. A single mixed metaphor (“silence…woven from silence and starlight”) is forgiven because it reifies the hush as fabric, supporting closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The synesthetic bell-ringer midwifing color-into-sound inside an ice-cathedral feels inevitable yet uncopied. Risk is taken in near-pure lyric mode; the piece teaches its pattern early and pays off with a conceptual re-pricing of silence as living medium. No recognizable prompt-template or trope echo; the synthesis is sui generis.</comment>
