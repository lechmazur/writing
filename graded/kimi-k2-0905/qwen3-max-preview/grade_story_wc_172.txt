<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Vorne’s contradictory impulses—corporate destroyer vs. elegiac mourner—are rendered in concrete, body-level beats: the velvet box tucked like contraband, salt crust biting his knees. Each micro-choice (buying, not stealing; placing, not burying) externalizes the split. The final release carries real cost: he forfeits the egg, the map, and the fantasy that private guilt can balance public plunder. Sentimentality stays subcutaneous; his mother’s lullaby is recalled through tactile memory, never named as “trauma.”</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal logic is clean: because he drained the sea, the flat is now the perfect acoustic chamber; therefore he brings the egg there. The map (cracks = memory) teaches the pattern by 25 % and mechanically guides the glowing fissures to the egg. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the salt absorbs the echo, pricing his legacy as audible absence. Cost is visible—he drives away lighter because the irreplaceable object is left irreversibly behind.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The salt flat is not backdrop but instrument: its crystalline crust amplifies the ghost-song and literally cracks open under the map’s choreography. Micro-setting inside the coat—velvet nap, box weight—functions as tactile conscience. Weather (bruised sky, distant thunder) times the release beat and modulates threat without cliché. Spatial choreography is clean: every crunch, glow-vein, and tire track is trackable.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can he buy back an echo—tightens once: the egg placed on salt equals irreversible gift. No reversals needed; the single deepening (cracks glowing, song rising) escalates via resonance physics, not external antagonist. Cost is visceral: the egg’s iridescence dims as its memory diffuses into terrain he formerly sterilized. Agency remains his; coincidence merely watches.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from oxymoron: extinction as philanthropy. Subtext operates in silence—the unheard song is the only product he can’t monetize. The final image reweights his entire portfolio: rivers remain diverted, yet the basin now holds an asset that can’t be audited. No moral is stated; the echo itself is the repricing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person intimate stays locked to Vorne’s perceptual filter: “salt crunching like shattered glass” is heard through his guilty ear. Syntax lengthens in elegiac arcs, then fractures into short beats that mimic cracked earth. Diction—“aquifer he’d auction,” “engineered sun”—carries corporate chill counter-pointed by the archaic Skywren trill. No head-hop; unreliability is hinted (he calls purchase “legal”) but never explained.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Sentences are dense yet never congested: each noun is specific (iridescent, lichen, aquifer) and verbs drive (“routed,” “razed,” “absorbed”). Metaphors stay physically coherent—sky bruised, salt veins—no mixed vehicles. Rhythm modulates: long liquid clauses for memory, staccato fragments for the ritual placement. Only hairline flaw: two thunder echoes feel proximate; still, the cadence underscores retreat, not repetition.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: eco-elegy meets hostile-takeover memoir. The premise that guilt can be acoustically uploaded into a dried seabed is non-obvious yet inevitable given prior hydraulic sabotage. Risk—lyric escalation without physical antagonist—pays off via resonance physics as climax. No template echo; the closest cousin is Bolano’s deserts, but the corporate-bioacoustics angle is new.</comment>
