<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Molt’s interiority is concrete and embodied—her cynicism peels under grief, shown through the nail-pried tin and dirt under thumbnails. Monthly molting stays label-only; no on-page contradiction of skins or cost attached. Relationship with Elias is memory-only; no live status shift to test. Final renunciation of sardonic skin is legible and earned by the candle-and-seeds beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens: image-density (tin, candle, seeds, poem) reweights the stake from coin-survival to beauty-in-ruin. Closure is a Charged Poise: candle burning beneath the poem + seeds pressed into cracks = undeniable conceptual cost; world is already changed before dawn. Causality intact: each object returns with new freight, no props teleport. Orientation anchored by word 50; no penalty.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Rusted library, broken glass, moonlit gutters—selective sensory triage mirrors Molt’s scavenger eye. Micro-setting (tin’s false bottom, candle wax pooling like starlight) constrains the final ritual; seeds in floorboard cracks literally grow from the ruin. Spatial choreography clean: she moves from door → kneel → center → exit; no impossible positions. Weather (cold breath, wind that doesn’t snuff flame) is choice-affecting.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake: can beauty be planted in anarchy? Pressure tightens when poem replaces coins—material survival traded for symbolic survival. One meaningful deepening: candle + seeds make the trade irreversible; a physical forfeiture paid on the page. No antagonist needed; situational pressure of ruin plus grief suffice. Cost is visible: she forfeits her last coins and her protective cynicism.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete reversals: “broken” re-priced as “seeds” via Elias’s charcoal line. No thesis statement; final lullaby about dammed rivers lets reader feel the re-pricing. Subtext in gesture—pinning poem with bent nail—suggests fragility of beauty under state violence. Avoids sermon; complexity preserved: arson innocence, prison transfer, vagrant future all stay morally knotted.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person close adheres to Molt’s perceptual signature: alley argot, scavenger metaphors, sardonic compression. Rhythm modulates—long lyrical clauses for starlight cathedral, staccato seeds list for ritual beat. No head-hop; knowledge stays vagrant-bound. Register stable; no academic drift. Distinct idiom: “molted personalities,” “liquid starlight,” “gardener of the impossible” all voice-true.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>High information density: single sentences do triple duty (e.g., “coffee tin with secret false bottom clinked... heavier tonight not with coins but with folded poems”). No loops or scaffold; each image advances. Figurative language purposeful—moon as liquid starlight paid off by wax pool. Read-aloud rhythm varies; paragraphs breathe with emotional cadence. No mixed metaphors; physical logic intact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: vagrant poet + prison library + seed sabotage feels inevitable in hindsight. Monthly personality molt could be gimmick but here becomes metaphor for grief-driven shedding. Risk of lyric overload is embraced yet controlled; payoff is cathedral of decay. No derivative echoes; closest cultural touchstone is DiPrima’s “Revolutionary Letters” but voice is original.</comment>
