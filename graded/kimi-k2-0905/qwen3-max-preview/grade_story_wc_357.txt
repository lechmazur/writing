<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elira’s curiosity and grief-hardened competence feel lived-in; the moment she presses the arrow to the Grandmother’s bark crystallizes her shift from observer to participant. Interiority stays concrete (“She wept. / Not from awe. / From recognition.”) and her final renunciation of harvest in favor of listening carries visible cost. Missing: a sharper early contradiction to amplify the later surrender; the “six dead orchards” backstory is told not shown, muting the internal stakes at the inciting skim beneath the arches.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the planet-wide chord reweights her mission from management to echo, with the arrow fused to the trunk as permanent, costly marker. Causality holds: dew-spiral navigation → arrow → accelerated bloom → planetary song, each beat a because/therefore linkage. Minor waiver: orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive late (~130 words) but the lyric delay pays off in the final sonic image, satisfying the waiver condition. The cost is legible—the orchard will never be harvested—and the lens stays causal throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The planet’s physics—floating boughs, lichen-glow, inversion hour—constrains every tactical choice: she can only fly and plant while gravity is upside-down. Sensory triage is POV-sharp: “mist pooled like liquid memory” anchors setting inside her professional attention to water flow. The broken arrow itself functions as micro-setting, its warmth and thrumming guiding the final insertion beat. One slip: “granite arch slick with inverted runoff” momentarily confuses spatial orientation during the landing, a hairline glitch that does not derail closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—uncover why the orchard refuses to die—tightens when the arrow’s bio-resonance property is revealed, converting mystery to responsibility. A single meaningful escalation: her decision to plant the arrow in the Grandmother narrows her future from exploitation to stewardship, with the planetary chord as undeniable price. Agency is continuous: every skim, sprint, and stab of the arrow is hers; coincidence is absent. The hourglass of inversion supplies live clock pressure, forcing the final commit before gravity reverses.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: memory as agricultural technology, resilience as collective recall. Subtext lives in gesture—her gloved fingers hesitate before touching warm iron, acknowledging ancestral guilt. The echo motif accumulates force: from atmospheric metaphor to literal bio-acoustic archive, reweighting the premise in the final chord. Avoids moralizing; the closing “echo with them” is invitation, not sermon.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays soldered to Elira’s pilot perceptual grid—every image is flight-relevant, every noun filtered through orchard craft. Syntax mirrors altitude: long vapor clauses at cruise, staccato bursts (“She banked. / She knelt.”) under peak g-load. Zero head-hop; lyric elision (“whirling silence”) is pattern-taught in paragraph two and paid off in the final vibrating hush. Dialogue is absent by design; voice remains coherent and particular.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Line-level craft is lean and propulsive: no filter verbs, no scaffold, high information density (“scanner flickered, useless; tech stuttered here”). Metaphors are grounded in her profession—“liquid compass needles”—and never overrun the physics. Micro-rhythm varies: caesura fragments under inversion stress, then settled cadence as gravity returns. One mixed image—“petals swirling in slow, silent cyclones” juxtaposes speed vs. silence in a way that slightly blurs, not enough to dull closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The orchard-planet/inversion-hour pairing is fresh SFF synthesis; the arrow-as-seed reverses weapon iconography into archival agriculture. Specificity anchors novelty: dew-spiral navigation, Grandmother bark etched with sonic scars—details that would collapse if swapped with generic equivalents. Risk is taken in lyric causal compression yet coherence survives. Final reconfiguration feels inevitable: the orchard always needed an auditor, not a mechanic.</question>
