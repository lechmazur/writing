<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s undercover identity, scar, and marrow-bound entity create a vivid, contradictory interior life; her choice to press SEND crystallizes a credible renunciation of bitterness. The final tattoo-compass shows lasting cost, but the prior static-phone “confessions” are skimmed rather than dramatized, so the emotional groundwork feels slightly abstract. Micro-choices (hiding the scar, gripping the phone) embody motives, yet Moira’s pressure stays ornamental. Still, the arc from bitter exile to gravitational giggles is legible and paid for.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the shattered phone, vanished arrowhead, and new skin-map re-weight gravity and grief with undeniable cost under an Accumulative/Textural lens. The mossy greenhouse anchors who/where by word 50; causality holds because each bioluminescent pulse foreshadows the final auroral dissolve. No orientation or lens debt. Persistent constraint: the glyph-tattoo forecloses return to ordinary physics, shaping the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The underground greenhouse’s clay pots labeled “Patience”/“Regret” physically constrain choice—Elara must place the arrowhead among them, catalyzing metamorphose. Bioluminescent vines and quasar-lens ceiling evolve with emotional beats, their flicker tightening as stakes rise. Spatial choreography is clean: arrowhead on moss → phone mid-air → teacup settles. Sensory hierarchy skews haptic (condensation-slick receiver, vibrating flint) grounding abstraction in tactile risk.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will Elara release the Gravity Dancer or keep hoarding bitterness?—tightens when the arrowhead hums and gravity hiccups, forcing the SEND decision with visible price: phone shatters, boots never touch ground again. Agency is her finger on SEND; luck complicates but does not resolve. Cost is legible—loss of anchor to old grief, gain of orbit-bound glyphs—but a single beat middle could have sharpened the trade-off earlier.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges: grief transmuted into cosmic play; no moral stated. The joke lands subtextually as Moira’s teacup settles and Elara laughs—bitterness spat back as confetti. Recurring “frostbitten hope” accrues through vine-glow, thyme sprig, and final warmer pulse. Ambiguity lingers: the missing hikers remain missing, now constellations—reader must decide if this is mercy or erasure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays pinned to Elara’s perception; no head-hop. Diction—“gravitationally playful,” “cosmic dust motes”—mirrors her scientist-poet hybrid mind. Syntax lengthens during weightless pirouette, then snaps短 when boots regain earth, rhythm matching physics. Dialogue sparse, distinct: Moira’s “wind through hollow reeds” timbre contrasts Elara’s taut interior vowels.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or stakes. Mixed metaphor risk—“vine glow dimming as gravity hiccuped”—but physical logic holds because hiccup is literalized physics. Information density high: “patience”/“regret” pots compress time-bending botany into two nouns. Final chord sentence propels to closure without syntactic stumble.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: cryptid hunt + harmonic archaeology + gravity-offload through antique telecom. Flint arrowhead as pre-Columbian modem feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk of lyric weightlessness paid off by grounding glyph tattoo. Not a retread; could not swap “cosmic joke” for any other punch-line without collapsing meaning.</comment>
