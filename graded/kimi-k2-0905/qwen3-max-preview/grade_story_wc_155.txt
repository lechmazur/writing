<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elira’s interiority is concrete—her micro-touch of moss, the sudden unguarded laugh—and her motivation (to re-awaken joy) is dramatized through the courtyard projection choice. The shift from preservation to creation is legible, but the cost is collective warmth rather than a personal path foreclosed, so the renunciation feels soft.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each oral history adds chromatic density until the scaffolded light burst reweights the stake. The “child’s smile dissolving like breath on glass” is a Charged Poise that reconfigures meaning with felt cost; no causality breaks, though the projection climax is slightly luck-dependent on noon sun.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fog-as-emulsion, orchard bones as canvas, and the copper reflectors as tools all constrain tactics and charge the final image. Sensory selection is POV-driven—moss-caked stone read like braille—and the weather (centuries of fog) directly enables the optic restoration. Spatial choreography is immaculate; distances and lens angles track cleanly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—recovering lost creative joy—tightens once via the fragment’s emotional gravity; the projection is the visible price. Escalation is textural (density of color and memory) rather than causal narrowing; the sun’s cooperation is coincidence, not protagonist agency, so the cost is atmospheric, not tactical.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: art as communal re-enchantment rather than archival worship. The reprojection reweights the fresco from relic to living warmth, avoiding moralizing. Subtext lives in gesture—fog swirling “like a contented cat”—and the final image invites reflection without platitude.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is lyric, rhythmic, and fog-soaked; syntax lengthens and contracts with emotional swell. Perceptual signature is vivid—“photons with handheld prisms”—and no filter verbs dull immediacy. The occasional elevated diction (“cerulean whispers”) stays within artist-POV lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentences layer job—image, motion, emotion—without scaffold. One mixed metaphor (“apples that would never rot” beside “breath on glass”) is minor. No loops, no template cadence; information density is high and propulsive.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Freshest synthesis: fog-as-emulsion + oral-history network + optic scaffold to “develop” memory. The ruined orchard re-illuminated via cider-honey pigments feels inevitable yet un-borrowed. Risk—lyric accumulative structure—heightens resonance without obscuring closure.</comment>
