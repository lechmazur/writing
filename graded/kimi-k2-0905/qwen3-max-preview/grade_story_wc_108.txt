<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied—"trembling certainty is my armor"—and the contradiction between physical panic and mental resolve is kept live in scene. The final act of burning the reel is credibly foreshadowed and costs her the last relic of her old identity, so the change is earned. One minor slip: the phrase "rewired my bones" drifts toward diagnostic shorthand, blunting embodiment a hair.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: shell whisper → decrypt cast → locate reel → burn reel → liberation, each step a because/therefore. Orientation is anchored by line 3 ("kneeling here, on splintered floorboards") well inside the 120-word window. Closure is a Decisive Change with visible cost—the reel’s destruction and the library’s slow burn—so lens and cost tests pass clean.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The rusted library’s rafters, moth-eaten trunk, and projector room are tactile and filtered through her phobic attention; the shell’s curved lip brushing skin doubles as micro-setting that constrains the next move. Starlight through holes and the slow fire’s gold provide an evolving environmental mirror without overt symbolism. One more sensory compression under peak pressure could have nudged it into the 9 band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—erase the mentor’s theft and reclaim her image—is signaled in paragraph 4 and tightens when decryption proves premeditation. The single reversal—learning he left guilt-trail while still letting her fall—forces the choice to burn rather than expose, trading public vindication for private release; price is the reel itself and the risk of fire. Pressure escalates under causal lens; coincidence is absent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of "vulnerability as power" emerges from the shell’s whispered injunction and the final image of walking out "baptized in trembling certainty," never sermonized. The reel’s cremation reweights the earlier leap—what was stolen becomes fuel—delivering a Conceptual Repricing that makes vulnerability the agent of destruction, not its victim. No moralizing line mars the exit.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>First-person voice is distinctively phobic-poetic: "move like fear given legs," "salt and second chances." Syntax tightens under pressure—fragmented clauses mirror shallow breathing—yet stays legible. No head-hopping or register drift; the elevated diction is justified by the narrator’s cinematic imagination. The shell’s chant is the only voiced line and its cadence differs from narrative texture, marking it as other.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative layers ("celluloid curling like a dying snake") are selective, never crowding a single beat. No loops, scaffold, or synonym churn; each sentence advances image or stakes. One mixed micro-metaphor—"constellations older than lies" beside "rusted library groaned"—barely grazes coherence, keeping the 9 band in sight but not quite secured.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The stunt-double-ghost-in-a-starlit-library premise is fresh, yet the emotional engine—betrayal by mentor who weaponizes vulnerability—grounds it. Burning the evidence instead of exposing it flips the expected revenge arc, turning self-erasure into self-creation. Specificity of the child-cast cipher and shell-whisper tech makes the concept irreplaceable; swap any element and the plot collapses.</comment>
