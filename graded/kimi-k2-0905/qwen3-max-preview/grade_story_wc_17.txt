<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The cartographer’s inherited sensitivity is shown through embodied action—bare feet on stone, ribcage listening—rather than label-speak; her renunciation of the film strip and sketch in the hearth is earned by the accumulated witnessing of diaries, so the cost of legacy’s burden is legible. Interior contradiction is quiet but present: she arrives to extract dreams from walls yet ends by giving her own trace back to them. The only bar to 9.0 is that the micro-choice to leave the sketch is under-dramatized in a single sentence; a beat of hesitation or sensory pull would have sealed motivation fully.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each artifact (ivy, negative, diaries, hearth) layers density until the final gesture reweights the stake from “take” to “leave.” Orientation is achieved by word 60 (“ivy-veiled passage”), well inside the 120-word safe zone. Closure is a Charged Poise: the cartographer rises lighter/heavier, the passage exhales, and the reader feels the conceptual cost—she now carries the dreams she sought to map. No causal gaps; every object is present before it matters.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The ivy is not backdrop; its tendrils dictate silence and pace, while the hearth’s blackened mouth literally swallows her final gift. Micro-setting (the film strip curled like a serpent) constrains her choice—its faint moonlit glow is the moment she decides against developing it. Sensory hierarchy is POV-loyal: she reads mortar by touch, not sight. Missing 0.1 to 9.0 only because the climate-shift era is atmospherically signaled rather than tactically exploited; a single humid breath or cracked foundation underfoot would have sealed the world-rule.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“what walls dream”—is signaled in paragraph two and narrows from discovery to surrender when she leaves her own echo inside them. Escalation is textural: each found fragment (negative, diaries, hearth) raises the emotional tariff of carrying legacy. The decisive tightening is the moment she rolls her fresh sketch and places it with the diaries; this forecloses the option to keep mapping outward and forces her to become part of the archive. Cost is felt but could be sharper—an explicit ache in hand or breath-catch would have pushed to 8.8+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges entirely through image and action: the shift from mapping absence to becoming part of it. Subtext is carried in silence—the unreadable negative, the unburned diary pages—so meaning accrues by what refuses articulation. Final image of the passage exhaling reprises the early “walls learning to breathe,” reweighting legacy from burden to shared respiration. No moralizing; the reader is left with the physical after-echo of stone breathing, not a thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person POV remains紧贴 her perceptions; no head-hopping. Diction stays inside her sensorium—“ribcage listening,” “curled like unborn birds”—creating a distinct perceptual signature. Rhythm modulates: longer clauses for ivy’s slow time, staccato fragments for the sob/sob/silence sequence. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk is zero; the absence is apt. Register never drifts into academic distancing; even “conceptual cost” is rendered as bodily weight.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero scaffold loops; each sentence advances image or stakes. Figurative vehicles are consistent (ivy=veins, negative=serpent, diaries=unborn birds) and never mixed inside a clause. Information density is high: “She lifted one gently, as though cradling a wound” performs tactile care, stakes (fragility), and metaphor in twelve words. Opening and closing lines are sonic bookends—“corridor echo cartographer” vs “walls dreamed. And now, so would she”—creating legible pattern without template cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The echo-cartographer who maps walls’ dreams is a fresh folkloric figure; the twist that she must deposit her own echo reframes archive as organism. Climate-shift world is sketched by ivy-eaten masonry rather than exposition dumps. Risk-taking—renunciation instead of revelation—pays off by making absence the final artifact. The synthesis feels inevitable: of course the listener ends up listened to.</comment>
