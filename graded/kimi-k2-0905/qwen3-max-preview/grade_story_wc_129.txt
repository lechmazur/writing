<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Lira’s loneliness-to-bridging arc is embodied in tactile sculpting, but interiority drifts toward poetic labels (“luminescent ache”) that dull contradiction; the climactic name-dedication carries cost but is slightly under-causal because the arbor’s rules are revealed rather than tested under pressure. Still, her micro-choices (feather pointer, hollow-reed clue) visibly braid want vs. fear, earning the mythic mantle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the obsidian loom reconfigures Lira’s sigil with felt communal cost; lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of tags, sculptures, and visitors reweights belonging. Transition from reed plea to arbor weave is legible; only nit: Vesper’s late reveal of the arbor’s purpose is slightly external, not protagonist-forced. Orientation is anchored by line 4; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Crater-rim, quartz orchard, and obsidian arbor are vividly filtered through Lira’s sculptor eye; crystal drips and reed breath constrain her material choices. Spatial choreography is clean; distance between arbor and weeping grove is tracked by moon-shadow path. Final image of glowing paths walked side-by-side recharges setting as social tool, meeting 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</question>
<comment>Dominant stake—belonging—tightens when each sculpture shifts from plea to welcome; the arbor’s glyph-swirl is the visible price/foreclosure. Agency is accumulative rather than one decisive pivot; escalation is density of collaborators, not risk spike. Sufficient for length, but second beat of possible rejection is gestured not tested, capping entry to high band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of chosen kinship emerges through loom metaphor and communal art, never sermonized; final image of handing a reed to newcomers offers non-literal answer. Subtext of “names earned” vs. “names given” quietly complicates identity politics. No late thesis statement; avoids sentimental glow by keeping cost visible—Lira’s solitary dawn sculpting persists.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person lyric voice maintains reed-and-crystal perceptual signature: “spirals that trembled like breath,” “trees of faceted quartz humming.” Rhythm modulates—long breathy sentences at crater rim, shorter fragments when tags appear. No head-hopping; Vesper’s dialogue is distinctively cracked-bell idiom. Diction stays within sculptural lexicon; no filter-verb clutter.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Generally high density, but occasional stacked metaphors (“murmur of lost languages,” “crystalline orchard glowed—trees of faceted quartz humming with trapped starlight”) flirt with overwriting in tight space. No loops or scaffold; transitions are clean. Opening and final lines anchor and resolve with imagetic punch. Minor register drift toward poetic inventory keeps it from 9-band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fusion of wetland reed craft with alien crystal orchard feels non-obvious; obsidian arbor as memory-loom reframes graffiti trope into communal tapestry. Risky lyric compression is taught early and paid off. Conceptual freshness trumps plot familiarity; transforming “tag” into weave glyph is specific inflection that would collapse if details swapped.</comment>
