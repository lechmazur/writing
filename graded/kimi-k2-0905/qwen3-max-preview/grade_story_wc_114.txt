<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elira’s interiority is concrete—her trembling fingers on the smudge, the hollow behind her sternum—but the swallowed truth stays abstract; we never learn what it is, so its gravity feels calculated rather than earned. The oracle’s voice is distinct, yet it acts only as chorus; it never risks error or revises its own code, so “fault-tolerant” stays label-only. The final stance crystallizes—she will speak—but because the silence itself was never dramatized in-scene, the cost is implied, not felt.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Closure lands cleanly: the quartz-pinning of the smudged orchid is a visible renunciation of perfection, charging the aurora-lit final image. Causality holds under the Accumulative/Textural lens—each sensor reading, each gust, thickens the psychic snowpack until endurance itself becomes the decisive change. Orientation is anchored by word 50 (granite spine, reinforced glass). The swallowed truth remains a black-box MacGuffin, but the story reweights silence as glacier rather than refuge, so the conceptual cost is legible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The station’s windscreen, rusted railing, and auroral violet are not backdrop but instruments that press against skin and paper; the orchid-as-micro-setting literally curls under pressure. Cold is rendered through ink that warps, breath that fogs glass—details that constrain the final act of pinning the vellum outside. Professional weather jargon (barometric drop, wind shear) is accurate yet filtered through a botanical illustrator’s gaze, tightening credibility.</comment>

<comment>The dominant stake—whether to keep or release the unnamed truth—tightens once, when the oracle reframes silence as gravity. Because the truth’s content is withheld, the escalation is abstract; the only tangible cost is the orchid’s exposure to wind, a proxy rather than a direct test of disclosure. Still, the protagonist’s agency is visible: she chooses rupture by pinning the flawed art outside, a concrete gesture that forecloses perfection.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through the orchid’s smudge: distortion as honesty, error as integral to function. The oracle’s definition of fault-tolerance becomes the story’s moral calculus—endurance without erasure. No character sermonizes; the aurora’s “mourning light” reprises the orchid’s pallor, letting image carry the reweighting. The ending resists a moral, offering instead a charged poise between speech and storm.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The prose carries a scientific lyricism—ink curls like burnt parchment, wind gnashes like alpine rage—yet diction stays within an illustrator’s sensory lexicon. Rhythm accelerates with paratactic gusts, then slows into the oracle’s measured clauses, mirroring fevered breath versus algorithmic calm. No head-hopping; the oracle’s voice is interface, not consciousness. The final pinned image is a syntactic release, ending on monosyllables that echo quartz grit.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Sentences are dense but propulsive—“snowflakes stung her cheeks, sharp as regret” compresses sensation and metaphor without scaffold. Only one paraphrase loop: “silence was a glacier—slow, crushing, inevitable” restates the oracle’s earlier gravity metaphor. Figurative muddle avoided; auroral sorrow is minted once and left to resonate. No artifacts in the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>The fault-tolerant oracle as interlocutor refreshes the hermit-with-machina trope; its poetic output feels inevitable once we learn it reroutes around broken logic. The smudged orchid pinned to a weather gantry is a specific, non-obvious fusion of art and meteorology. Yet the swallowed truth remains generic—any secret would suffice—preventing a higher score. Risk is present but localized; the global premise is familiar.</comment>
