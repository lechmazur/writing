<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Interiority is evocative—“glass mountains…in her marrow” shows embodied vocation—and her remembered sleepwalker source cues past wound. Yet the dream’s surrender feels foregone; no live contradiction forces her to test or revise her stance under pressure, so the renunciation reads as serene rather than costly.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the dream flows into the void mirror, thick fog returns, and the orchard’s rebloom is left suspended—an earned stasis that visibly costs the dream its freedom. Causal chain holds: sextant shards → harmonic breathing → boundary dissolution → capture, all on-page and irreversible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The ruined orchard, frost-timing, and broken sextant shards together constrain every ritual move; fog thickness dictates visio-spatial limits and the breathing cadence is keyed to twilight frost. Micro-setting (obsidian disc, brass fragments) functions as manipulable terrain that directly enables the final fusion—no descriptive detail is idle.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—retrieve the dream—tightens once when the harmonic breathing begins to re-open the sky, raising the risk of exposure or failure. Cost is present (dream loses autonomy, maker loses future chase), but escalation is single-step; no mid-process complication forces her to adapt tactics, keeping pressure elegant rather than surging.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Emergent theme: creation demands ingestion of the very thing one pursues—freedom traded for permanence. Subtext rests in the sextant’s brokenness (failed navigation) repurposed into a compass for liminal space, and in the orchard’s blossoms returning only where prismatic light touches, hinting that art’s beauty is collateral damage.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays close to her corporeal rhythm; clause lengths mimic inhalation/exhalation counts, diction favors glass-and-metal consonance without purple drift. Perceptual signature—silvered, reflective, fracturing—never leaks into explanatory exposition; voice modulates into hush at the moment of fusion, matching fog’s re-thickening.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary from frost-bite fragments to longer breath-units; no synonym loops or filler filters. Figurative load is high but patterned—light, glass, frost—teaching the reader early, so density feels purposeful rather than cluttered. One mixed micro-image (“wings of folded parchment”) barely grazes clarity yet occurs pre-closure, leaving final beat pristine.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Merging astrolabe relic with dream-trapping craft reframes both maker and astronomer as cartographers of impossibility; the breathing-metric ritual feels novel and specific to her trade. Risk is taken in near-static lyric escalation, but it coheres: originality lies in treating respiration as calibration tool, not metaphor.</comment>
