<comment>The tracer’s interiority is rich—her “syncopated ache,” her refusal to ignore the summons—yet the girl remains a cipher of grief, not a contradictory child. The tracer’s micro-choice to broadcast rather than listen crystallizes her vocation, but the girl’s consent is too quiet to register as a full relationship shift. Closure is earned: the tracer kneels in damp marble, pays the cost of witness, and forecloses her own exit until the echo stills. Still, the girl’s passivity keeps the dyad just shy of crucible heat.</comment>

<comment>Accumulative lens holds: each object—photograph, hearing aid, mist—layers emotional density until the mist thins and the pulse calms. The arrival of the living girl is the single deepening that reweights the stake from “trace” to “release.” Closure lands as Charged Poise: tracer and child walk toward glowing exit, the photograph now calm, its frequency shifted. Cost is legible in the tracer’s soaked knees and the girl’s first footstep forward.</comment>

<comment>The atrium’s veined marble and weeping glass are not backdrop but antennae—every droplet refracts the tracer’s task. The cracked fountain serves as tuning basin; the lily “surrendered hands” mirror the girl’s crouch. Spatial choreography is flawless: tracer kneels, device pressed to temple, condensation puddling at her boot-toe. Environment constrains the final choice: only when the mist thins can the exit glow become legible path.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—liberate a stranded child-echo—tightens once: from decoding pulse to transmitting lullaby. The girl’s panic flutter is the visible price; the tracer’s steady counter-pulse is the agency that forecloses abandonment. No reversal, but a meaningful deepening that swaps observation for intervention. Cost is felt in the tracer’s aching knees and the girl’s first tear-track.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges obliquely: love as frequency shift rather than immortal presence. The photograph’s final calm reweights the premise—memory is not archive but tuning fork. Subtext lives in gesture: girl’s palm over tracer’s hand is silent assent to changed frequency. No moralizing, only the resonant image of two silhouettes exiting under bruised twilight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is tracer-biased, lush with cardiac metaphors yet precise: “syncopated ache,” “lullaby hummed through cathedral walls.” Perceptual signature is consistent—she maps emotion as wave-form, reads marble as EKG. No head-hopping; girl’s interiority surfaces only in tear-track and palm twitch, filtered through tracer’s instrument. The final image keeps distance: “together they walked” maintains POV while allowing shared resonance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose breathes: long breathless clauses for pursuit, then short declaratives at release. Metaphors are controlled—no spillage between “liquid gold puddles” and “surrendered hands.” One scaffold spotted: “they’re not coming back... but that doesn’t mean you’re forgotten” tells what the photograph in the girl’s hand has already shown. Otherwise density is high; every sentence advances atmosphere or choice.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: emotional contact-tracing as psychic hospice, tuned through obsolete tech. Hearing-aid-as-crystal-radio transforms familiar ghost-story into tender engineering. Risk—child ghost who isn’t horror—pays off in quiet heroism. The concept commits fully; no retreat into spectacle.</comment>
