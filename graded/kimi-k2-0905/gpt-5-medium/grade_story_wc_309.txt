<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The protagonist’s contradictory impulses—hunger for magic while flunking glamour exams—are dramatized in the mist-walk stumble. Micro-choices (inserting the keystone, refusing to own it) visibly foreclose paths with felt cost: permanent outsider status and perpetual apprenticeship. Interiority stays concrete, never sliding into diagnostic labels. The only drag is the off-stage city automatization, so the social stakes are asserted more than tested.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a perfect Conceptual Repricing: removing the “joke” keystone dims the light yet leaves a hush that seeds new creative pauses in the city. Causal chain holds—keystone question → platform flex → luminous concession → renunciation—each because/therefore tightening options. Orientation is anchored by line 3 (stairs, spire, clouds). Cost is legible in the final line: the sky closes around its question mark, surrendering ownership forever.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Icebound spire, broken steps, and the keystone notch constrain every move; environment literally flexes under the protagonist’s test. Selective sensory hits—cold ringing in teeth, fog braiding like rope—mirror internal hesitation without tourist catalog. The body becomes micro-setting when burnt hands decide the stone is set. No object or place is described without altering next tactical choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—access to unautomated imagination—tightens when the platform flex shows the cost of asking instead of owning. Mist-walk failure physicalizes the risk of public ineptitude, foreclosing the “perfect mage” path. Escalation is accumulative: each luminous color returns a discarded, unmarketable whisper, reweighting failure as fodder. Price is visible when the hush stays on his hands, forcing him to tend strangers’ blanks.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without thesis statement: automated creativity vs. sacred, unprofitable pauses. The keystone’s “joke” and the spire’s refusal to know names reprice success as accommodation of error. Final blank-paper table answers the initial quest—finding the sacred in simple—without moralizing. Every luminous color is a particular discarded memory; universals grow from specifics.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>First-person voice owns a distinct perceptual signature: synesthetic cold that “rings like a tiny bell,” doubts exhaled as white moths. Compression (“mist walking worked badly”) teaches elliptical pattern early; payoff lands when descent uses the same skill for feeling, not skipping. Syntax coils like stairs, mirroring climb cadence. No register drift; lexicon stays within an underachieving mage’s plausible range.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Rhythm varies naturally; sentence length flexes with platform sail. High density (“light spills out as if it had been waiting behind me the whole climb”) advances both image and causality. Only minor paraphrase loop in “mist walking…worked badly…mist walking not to skip steps but to feel them” costs −0.3; still sharp enough for closure. Zero filter-verb stacks; metaphors stay coherent.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Fusing anti-automation critique with a keystone-comedy spire is a fresh synthesis. The “lingering luminance” as non-commodified creativity is a non-obvious conceptual twist. Risky lyric compression is taught early and paid off in final hush. Template risk is high, but particulars (useless arch, tongue-in-notch) transform heritage fantasy into intimate manifesto.</comment>
