<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The narrator’s interior contradiction—using ambiguity as shield yet needing to edit grief—is embodied in micro-choices (borrowing Maris, selecting Caslon, leaving the fragment). The final renunciation of borrowed courage costs the safety of ventriloquism; the earned stasis lands. Maris-ghost stays slightly abstract, but the halo fragment’s warmth/cool cycles give the flaw tactile consequence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the narrator signs with the “smallest name,” accepting editorial guilt for translating cosmic loss into human arithmetic; cost is the blank sky that “washes my hands cleaner than solvent.” Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of print-shop imagery and star-catalogues reweights the stake until the final absence reconfigures meaning. No orientation debt; transitions from couple to solitude are cleanly anchored.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The topaz grit, oil smell, and halo fragment function as micro-setting that constrains typographic choices and conducts emotional charge. Star-maps and the observatory dome serve as tangible pressure sources, not postcard backdrop. The final absent star is environmental evolution that charges the closure image. One hinge: “metal logic becoming breath” links tool to body, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can grief be typeset—tightens when the couple’s unmailed letters force the narrator to test transposed empathy. Escalation occurs via the halo fragment’s brightening: it demands the narrator risk personal exposure instead of hiding behind Maris. Cost is legible: surrender of protective ambiguity and the blank sky that follows. Slight overlap with Q2, but pressure trajectory is coherent under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Theme emerges from the premise without sermon: editing the sky’s grief into human ledgers is an unethical translation that nonetheless offers fragile mercy. Subtext lives in typographic diction—register, ligatures, proof—that reweights “forgiveness is a rotating mirror.” Final question reprises the arithmetic motif but refuses a moral, achieving resonant ambiguity. No echoing of prompt language.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</question><comment>Voice is a sustained lyric register whose syntax mimics press mechanics: clauses lock, ink, register. Perceptual signature—“I listen as them”—compresses empathy into a typographic act. No head-hops; borrowed voices stay in quoted interiority. Non-standard punctuation (em-dashed interruptions) is pattern-taught early and paid off in the final cadence. Rhythm accelerates under pressure then settles into the sweep of grit, matching emotional exhaust.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</question><comment>High information density: one sentence often sets type, names emotion, and maps cosmos. Figurative layering is dense yet coherent—no mixed metaphors. Minor scaffold: “the room becomes the Topaz workshop under stars they imagined” is a touch recursive. No loops in peak beats; final line resolves by image. Read-aloud cadence clicks like metal logic.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</question><comment>The fusion of letterpress minutiae with astrophysical grief feels inevitable yet unseen before. Transposed empathy as a reprinting of nerves is a fresh synthesis that grows from causal particulars (halo fragment, Caslon choice). Risk—lyric density, absence of overt plot—heightens coherence because closure still lands. Not gimmicky; the conceptual leap is earned, not grafted.</comment>
