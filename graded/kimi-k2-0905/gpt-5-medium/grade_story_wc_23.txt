<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The navigator’s grief-riven agency stays concrete—wrapping the censer foot, walking the flats, choosing to keep building—yet interiority occasionally stoops to label-speak (“the ache,” “raw solace”) that flattens embodied contradiction; still, the final micro-choice to draw the line over the heart costs him a future of certainty, earning the turn.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the censer foot and needle fuse into a compass that reweights loss from destination to traveling-with; the because/therefore chain holds—each midnight call tightens the build, the full moon locks the shape, the inland pointing forecloses retreat—though a faint lens wobble between causal and accumulative never quite declares itself until the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Starlit station, salt pans, and feral gardens are filtered through repair-tuned perception; the patina bronze foot acts as micro-setting that pivots the needle and final image; spatial legs stay tracked as the narrator crawls the shelter frame, though tidal chronology could be anchored one beat earlier.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—mapping loss instead of coastline—tightens when the beacon locks inland, foreclosing the coast-return option; the censer foot’s weight and the narrator’s walk across mirrored flats pay a visible price in fatigue and exposure; escalation is steady but singular, not amplified by a second reversal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Reverse migration emerges as lived geography rather than thesis: vowels on driftwood, inland light, and the final “together we will follow it home” reconfigure exile into accompaniment; no moralizing sentence intrudes, letting the censer foot’s stillness speak the cost of perpetual return.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Compressed lyric syntax (“Night dons its hammered blue”) stays inside the tinker-poet lexicon; perceptual signature is consistent—tide as memory, tools as bones; no head-hop; the single voiced line (“Keep moving”) carries subtextual command without dialogue clutter.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Rhythm breathes with scene tempo—short pulses during climb onto censer foot, longer clauses crossing flats; no synonym loops; one near-mixed metaphor (“surf rises through stones”) but clarity holds; final line cadence reprises early steam-exhale image with earned restraint.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The hydraulics-failed station as wounded creature, incense hinge becoming compass pivot, and loss-mapped migration synthesize into a fresh emotional instrument; the moon-phased pulse and midnight call pattern feel inevitable, not gimmicky; risk in lyric ellipsis is paid off by legible closure image.</comment>
