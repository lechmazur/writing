<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is vividly embodied—“staggering grace of someone who has practiced falling and rising”—and every micro-choice (sorting keys by rust-tones, knotting her chain as seed-sling) grows from her liberator/chained contradiction. The final endurance image—palms lined with seed dust—pays the cost of her vow without epiphany overload. No secondary character exerts pressure, so relationship crucible is N/A; headcount clarity is clean. One hairline slip: “patient strategy moving like weather” drifts toward abstraction, but the metaphor is brief and anchored in her weather-beaten body.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds throughout: wall-collapse roar → cover → piano-bench decode → trapdoor → seed cache → escape via ticket-jam. Each therefore-link narrows options and raises visible price (the chain she must keep wearing as pouch). Closure is Earned Stasis: she forecloses personal safety to plant futures, chain still ghosting her wrist—cost made legible in the final line. No orientation debt; anchors (who/where/when) land by line 3 and the collapsing wall keeps the metronome clock explicit.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</question><comment>Dust-colored air, cracked-mouth soil, and the piano’s ivory-less teeth are selective, pressure-filtered details that mirror Mara’s drought-tuned eye. The carnival prize hall constrains movement—plush avalanche buys escape—meeting the 9+ gate: setting alters tactics. Spatial choreography is immaculate: bench → trapdoor → conveyor gears → side door breach tracked without drift. One micro-slip: “tired circus elephant” is familiar but brief and earns its place by signalling the building’s slumped weight.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—liberate drought-proof futures—tightens when scavenger-enforcers breach, forcing her to spend the arrow and risk capture. A single meaningful turn suffices: the ticket-jam buys descent time and visibly costs her the arrow’s future use. Price is legible (chain as sling, seeds as weight), though the enforcers’ threat is brief; the wall’s roar supplies ambient but not personal cost. Meets 8.8 band; would need a sharper personal stake (injury, betrayal) to breach 9.0.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete reciprocity: chained woman frees seeds as proxy freedom, reconfiguring “liberator” from personal to generational scale. Final image—vows weigh best when carried—offers CR that reweights the chain from bondage to chosen burden. No moralizing; the prompt’s “resilience” is dramatized, never named. Subtext in ticket-jam (citizens’ playthings impeding looters) quietly mirrors seed-jam (future citizens impeding famine) without exposition.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</question><comment>Voice is lyric-causal: compressed metaphor (“dust freckles a forgotten upright piano”) yet causal clarity preserved. Perceptual signature is drought-attuned—everything measured by thirst, rust, or interval—consistent under pressure. Rhythmic control peaks in the descent beat: paragraph of short, unlinked images (“library in husks and paper”) mimics her breath-tight focus. No dialogue, so naturalism exemption applies; no head-hop or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</question><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “she sorts them by size and rust, hears intervals in their teeth” performs three jobs—tactile, auditory, world-logic—in twelve words. Figurative layering is high but patterned (music ≈ survival) and paid off at closure. One near-loop: “staggering grace” appears opener and closer; repetition is purposeful, reweighting grace from physical deficit to moral steadiness, thus waived. No mixed metaphors or scaffold sentences; ticket-ribbon image is fresh and coherent.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</question><comment>Premise fuses three non-obvious elements—piano-bench cipher, carnival seed vault, chained liberator—into an inevitable-feeling whole. The arrow’s drought-feather fletching re-invents the genre trope of “found weapon” as agricultural tool, a fresh inflection that charges the final image. Risk-taking in lyric compression heightens stakes without obscuring causality. Transformation test fails if any ingredient is swapped: piano keys must be metal, not ivory, to echo rusted seeds; carnival must be abandoned to justify unguarded vault.</comment>
