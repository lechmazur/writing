<comment>The sculptor’s interiority is vivid—"tenderized by strangers" is a perfect, embodied contradiction—and every micro-choice (answering with a reed ear, sliding obsidian shards like teeth) is character-particular. Status dynamics with Farrin and the townsfolk are legible and shift as the ring of bodies forms. The final renunciation—"not a statue, but my practice"—is earned and forecloses the easier path of solitary art. Only the "boldly sympathetic" label is asserted once without visible cost on the page, a hairline slip that keeps it from the 9-band.</comment>

<comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The orchard’s mirrored grammar is taught by line 4; each new fragment (baker, diver, seam of fused leaves) increases density until the "repeatable curve" reconfigures meaning. Closure is a Charged Poise: the living arbor crystallizes when bodies lean ribs-to-ribs, felt cost visible in the narrator’s promise to "tend as long as the crater keeps shimmering." Persistent constraint—the orchard must be re-leaned whenever forgetting returns—shapes future tactics and lands on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Environment as tool: the crystalline panes literally mirror faces, forcing self-recognition and recruiting townsfolk; the obsidian shards become the lattice’s teeth, constraining how the arbor must be built. Spatial choreography is immaculate—bodies pivot at the ribs, flour drifts on wind, crater sings or quiets in causal response. Sensory hierarchy filters through the sculptor’s reed-sculptor hands: stardust sugar grit, mineral sigh, humming nets of light. Only the "void-sun" physics remains un-anchored, a hairline abstraction that stops it at 8.9.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—community graft—tightens when each rumor-fragment adds weight until the seam rewrites the search: the tag is a posture, not an object. Agency stays with the sculptor: answering with reeds, sliding shards, finally dedicating "practice" rather than object. Visible price is the lifelong tending promised at the end; open-ended cost is felt. A micro-turn from seeking object to enacting posture supplies the required deepening under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges solely through the orchard’s mirrored grammar: reflection → recognition → collective stance. No character ever moralizes; the final promise is an image, not a lesson. The repeatable curve reweights "Together" from graffiti to anatomical hinge, a conceptual repricing that lingers. Ambiguity stays alive: the crater may cease shimmering, the graft may fail, but the posture remains possible.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>First-person voice is distilled, reed-spare, yet lyric: "luminous ache I could not name" is both synesthetic and humble. Perceptual signature is sculptor-specific—every noun is material: grit, glaze, lattice, dust. Rhythm modulates: long breathless accumulations tighten into the final short sentences that let the arbor hold. No head-hopping; collective "we" remains a single focalized stance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Zero loops; every sentence either advances the search or thickens the crystalline grammar. Metaphors are consistent—orchard as glass organ, crater as singing bowl—and never mixed. Opening line anchors voice and stakes in one stroke; final line resolves by re-charging "lean together." Sparse use of "like" keeps similes sharp; no scaffolding or filter-verb stacks.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The communal arbor built by leaning bodies is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis of sculpture, sociology, and crater cosmology. Transformation test: swap orchard for forest or arbor for monument and the whole moral calculus collapses. Risk—letting the climax be a collective posture rather than artifact—pays off because the orchard’s mirror-logic has been taught from line 1. Specificity of "marsh-reed sculptor" and "obsidian teeth" roots the concept in unrepeatable particulars.</comment>
