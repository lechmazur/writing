<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The genealogist’s self-loathing and reflexive falsification are viscerally embodied (“the ledger aches with forgery”); each micro-choice—offering the archive, kneeling to read planks—exposes a hierarchy of guilt over safety. The withheld memory that Abel saved the narrator, not abandoned Mara, crystallizes a credible, costly renunciation that could not swap with any other backstory. Interiority stays salted with brine and ink rather than therapy-speak. The only minor abrasion: the rapid transit from beach to terrace after the reveal slightly dilutes the embodied aftermath.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Causal lattice is taut: because the narrator forged driftwood records, therefore Mara’s grief was misnamed, therefore he must return to the shore to unmake the lie. The watch hand acts as both prop and proof, turning the final beat when Mara lifts it and the past flips. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the city’s future “inheritance is spoken and cooked,” not archived—cost is the surrender of counterfeit authority. Transitions (terrace → beach → terrace) are cleanly lit by dusk and lamp-light anchors.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The cobalt terrace and Parliament of Wood beach are not picturesque postcards; their dusk light and salt-stained planks physically constrain how secrets can be read or erased. The watch hand micro-setting charges the final image when its wet dusk glint refuses to drown. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: the archivist notices ink, salt, and gulls as “commas” overhead. No orientation drift; geography stays trackable across the single transition.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—ownership of the past—tightens when the narrator realizes he carved the very plank that names both families, foreclosing denial. Agency is continuous: he kneels, gathers, offers, burns; each act pays an incremental price (microfilm surrendered to tide). Cost is visible: the forged archive literally dissolves into “clean syllables.” No coincidence resolves; luck only complicates when an unread plank turns out to bear his surname.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as the unspeakable cost of engineered forgetting: “what forgetting costs” is shown, not told, when paper becomes sea-salt syllables. Subtext lives in gesture—Mara lifting the watch hand—rather than exposition. The final image of “lantern with shutters” reweights inheritance from parchment to voice without moralizing. No thematic echo clichés; the closest—“belief, like time, can lose a hand”—gains resonance because the literal watch hand is now missing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is a sustained salt-stained cadence: “the sea breathing like a tired archivist” marries metaphor to vocation in one breath. Compression is taught early (“trade salts every hour”) and paid off in the final “clean syllables.” No head-hopping; interior access stays strictly with the narrator. Dialogue, though sparse, carries subtext—“You invented me” lands as both accusation and liberation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm flexes from long tidal sentences to the staccato of planks being named. Information density is high: each driftwood line carries birth, debt, or surname. No mixed metaphors; vehicles stay maritime and archival. Minor template cadence in “the terrace wore its evening blues / the city unrolled its lamps” but it echoes the panoramic sweep and does not touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Forged driftwood census records as black-market genealogy is a fresh, conceptually tight invention that could not survive a name-swap. The watch-hand compass reprises without feeling gimmicky because it once literally pointed lighthouse time. Risk is taken in lyric elision rather than plot convolution, and coherence holds. Specificity of “Parliament of Wood” and “sieved hush” anchors universals of guilt and restitution.</comment>
