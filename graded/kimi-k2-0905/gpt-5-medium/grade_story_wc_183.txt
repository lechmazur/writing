<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The interiority is lyrically dense and consistent—"chimera twin inside my own tongue" embodies the split—but micro-choices are largely symbolic rather than causal; the decision to plant the empty jar is poetically charged yet not foreclosed by prior stakes, so the renunciation feels atmospheric, not paid for.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the garden’s silence re-weights identity without naming. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern of mirrored returns (card, soil, carousel) tightens meaning rather than plot. Orientation is taught by deliberate fog-disorientation that pays off in the final hush. Cost is felt in the unclasping of the discoverer-self, though lightly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Abandoned carnival ship is not postcard scenery: salt-furred prizes, leaning ferris-wheel compass, and dim bulbs that project green constellations all constrain direction and metaphorically steer the walk. The emerald micro-setting (card-as-lantern) literally maps the path, charging the final image when it is laid above the heart as new compass.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—find the garden—remains coherent; pressure deepens via memory-slippage rather than external obstruction. Escalation is textural: each mirrored return reweights the cost of naming. Agency is lyrical—speaking history aloud—but the price (losing the twin) is announced more than dramatized, keeping the tightening just sub-threshold for 8+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of self-fragmentation emerges from the garden’s refusal to name: silence = wholeness. Subtext works through image (soil jar, empty carousel horses) rather than assertion. Final silence reconfigures identity without moral, achieving resonance. One-line thematic echo ("trapped freedom") is soft enough to avoid heavy penalty.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>First-person voice sustains a lush, hypnotic cadence; perceptual signature is consistent—everything filtered through synesthetic metaphor ("bay folded back time"). Compression and elision are taught early and paid off in the quiet final unclasp. No head-hopping; diction stays within surreal but coherent register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Rhythm modulates with breath-control; sentences carry dual duty (image + motion). Occasional stacked metaphors ("bruise-colored circle of hush") flirt with overwriting but serve atmospheric pressure. No loops/scaffold; pronouns clean. Final line lands with imagistic snap. One hairline slip: "the bay opened into a bruise-colored circle" momentarily confuses scale.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mnemonic carnival-garden fusion feels fresh; memory-echo rule set is taught early and followed through. Risk in lyric accumulative structure heightens dream logic without breaking clarity. Could edge higher if the garden’s silence carried sharper social or conceptual cost beyond personal identity.</comment>
