<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The root-bound visionary shows embodied contradiction—literally grafted, figuratively bound to futures not yet tallied—and the final refusal to restore the covenant is earned through the scar-linking sequence. Interiority is concrete (“questions in my ribs”), yet the emotional layering flirts with lyric abstraction just past the 8+ threshold. Micro-choices (tucking clipping, pressing wrist to bark) visibly tilt tactics. Cost is felt when gardeners’ shears lower and sundial “agreed to tell time again, sometimes,” sealing Earned Stasis.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the braided vow replaces the sun-bound circle, recorded in cambium with palpable cost—“sometimes” time is the forfeiture. Causality holds under lyric-accumulative lens; each scar-exchange and hedge-word tightens options toward that final concession. Orientation is taught early via surreal anchor (“cobalt glade… residual lightning from tomorrow”), waiving penalty. One missed opportunity: the gardeners’ capitulation could carry sharper physical consequence to dramatize cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Setting is micro-focused on graft, bark, wax paper, and reflective pool—each object constrains movement and charges the final image when the pool rises “like a plate.” Selective sensory triangulation (scent of clipped decisions, scar tingling) keeps economy tight. Place anchors remain surreal but internally consistent, supporting lyric mode. The glade’s cobalt hue and eclipse function as environmental pressure without drifting into postcard tourism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</question><comment>Dominant stake—renegotiating the eclipsed covenant—surfaces by line 5 and tightens through each hedge-word door and scar-exchange. The gardeners’ demand presents final opposition, forcing explicit refusal with forfeiture of perpetual noon. Escalation is accumulative: density of living language increases stakes rather than causal twists. Visible cost registers in the sundial’s conditional time, though emotional toll on narrator could be sharper.</question>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges as the ethics of promises under unreal time: circular oaths fracture while braided, skin-bound vows adapt. Subtext operates through vegetal imagery—pruning, rooting, grafting—culminating in an open, non-moral resonance. Final image of “border of waking and dreaming blurred” reweights prior material without sermonizing. One hedge-line short of 9 because theme flirts with abstraction before fully anchoring in body-cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Voice carries lush, rhythmic compression—“a ribbon pulled from a mouth”—taught early and paid off in floating maze beat. Perceptual signature is visionary-botanic, filtering events through chlorophyll-tinted attention. No head-hopping; POV stays bound to root-bound narrator. Occasional syntactic overload (“labyrinth nested within chlorophyll, a blueprint for escaping the garden by walking it”) slightly dilutes clarity under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose shows high information density: metaphor stacks advance atmosphere while doubling as world-rule exposition. Rhythm modulates from breath-held openings to urgent sentence fragments at maze entrance. Two mixed-metaphor patches (“blue hour would not be unmade”; “sundial agreed to tell time again, sometimes”) mildly blur physical logic. No loops, scaffold, or filler; each sentence adds texture or stakes.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Premise fuses arboreal grafting with time-slippage covenant politics—fresh synthesis that feels inevitable once begun. Vegetal language grows literal power, avoiding pure ornament. Risk in lyric compression heightens stakes without sacrificing clarity. Missing half-step toward 9+: gardeners’ transition from antagonists to cape-wearing guardians could carry sharper conceptual flip to amplify surprise.</comment>
