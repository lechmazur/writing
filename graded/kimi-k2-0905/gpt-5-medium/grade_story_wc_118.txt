<question>1</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The historian’s porous, listening nature is vividly embodied—he strokes walls, whispers to axes, lets tapestry dust bite his palm. Internal contradiction is present yet soft: he both craves witness and surrenders to endless influx, but this tension is stated more than dramatised. His rearranging of shelves along the new ‘pull’ is the single micro-choice that visibly costs him balance and time, forging the needed causal link to closure. No second character appears, so relationship/status bullets are rightfully N/A; the arc is renunciation/acceptance, fitting Track A scope.</comment>

<question>2</question>
<grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The closure is a Conceptual Repricing: by returning the brass disk and whispering “steady now” to an unseated axis, the historian reweights the world-rule—stories will replace dreams. Cost is palpable in the image of him kneeling in a lopsided silo, volunteering to be the conduit for echoing walls. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: cadence and motif density (bronze quiet, dust, dragons, axis) tighten until meaning tilts rather than plot chains. No orientation debt; place/time are anchored within two sentences and the pattern is taught by line three.</comment>

<question>3</question>
<grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The reclaimed silo library, ladder-spined and salt-stripped, is not backdrop but instrument: its slanted floor dictates where tragedies and hopes must be shelved, constraining the historian’s final gesture. Micro-objects—brass disk, tapestry fragment, half-burned diaries—are handled, flipped, returned, their temperature and texture guiding tempo and memory retrieval. Dragons chalked by children on the outer skin become a counting lesson, binding play to future catastrophe. Environment thus steers both tactics (where to place books, where to kneel) and the closing image of “something like weather” shifting inside the silo.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Stakes—“collect stories before silence forgets their grammar”—are signalled in paragraph three and tighten when the historian realises the axis displacement unseated dreams themselves. The single meaningful escalation occurs when he rotates shelving along the new gravitational skew: this act narrows his future to lifelong custodianship, pays a physical cost (palms bitten, knees ground). No antagonist required; pressure is ontological and accrued through textured repetition. Coincidence is absent; escalation is purely agency-driven under an Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as: when collective dreams die, custodial listening becomes the last human vocation. It is never named; instead, bronze quiet, spindle wells, and dust moths accrue metaphoric weight until the final whispered “steady” reconfigures their meaning. Subtext resides in gestures—touching warm brass, stitching jagged tapestry into a logbook—implying that ruin must be sewn into record, not solved. The ending’s charged poise invites multiple readings (sacrifice, solace, futility) without moralising, satisfying the complexity clause.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The third-person lyric voice stays porous yet controlled: “dust flurries like moths, each wing a different year returning” teaches the reader the textural pattern early. Rhythm flexes with emotional temperature—short clauses when he kneels, flowing anaphora when walls recall winter hymns—without dropping perceptual signature. Vocabulary (“grain spine,” “corrugated skin,” “unlatched gate”) feels specific to this narrator’s hybrid diction of archivist and mystic. No dialogue appears; therefore dialogue bullets are N/A and voice purity is judged solely through narrative music, which sustains idiosyncratic consistency to the last cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry high density—each image simultaneouly advances atmosphere, stakes, and tactile detail: e.g., “dust flurries like moths, each wing a different year.” No synonym loops; metaphors stay coherent within their domains (time ↔ wings, axis ↔ fevered child). Register remains elevated-lyric but is motivated by the historian’s archivist-romantic sensibility. Minor overwriting in “bronze quiet that even dust learns to honor” is the only purple moment, but it is pattern-establishing and thus exempt under the overwrite check; it does not obscure causality or dull the closing image.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>9.5</grade>
<comment>The synthesis—post-dream world + silo library + gravitational axis slippage—feels inevitable and fresh, reframing apocalypse as archival calling. Risk is taken in using accumulative texture rather than plot, yet coherence holds. Specific turns (axis as fevered child, brass disk returned to dark) are unforeseeable yet, in hindsight, seeded by tapestry spindle and diary heat. The concept “walls that listened when dreams ended” is genuinely new, emotionally specific, and could not swap settings without collapse; this secures the high-band bonus.</comment>

<question>9 A</question>
<grade>8.7</question>
<comment>Setup: paragraph 2; development: shelf-rearrangement along new gravity; payoff: whispers axis steady, volunteering for lifelong echo-conduit. Trait of porous listening visibly costs him physical comfort and forecloses ordinary human future.</comment>

<question>9 B</question>
<grade>9.2</question>
<comment>Handled twice—found folded in hearth, later stitched into logbook spine, its rough edge biting palm awake. Dragon image foretells the brass-disk spindle, reweights at closure when disk returns to flue, charging tapestry’s prophecy with realised cost.</comment>

<question>9 C</question>
<grade>8.9</question>
<comment>Shapes entire world logic and shelving tactic; brass disk literalises the off-kilter axis. Axis displacement is cause of dream-death and source of historian’s custodial call; “steady now” addresses it directly in closing beat.</comment>

<question>9 D</question>
<grade>8.4</question>
<comment>Trait enables discovery of diaries and brass map but also dooms him to absorb infinite stories; sensibility is dramatised in palm-bite and whispered lullaby to gravity itself, not merely labelled.</comment>

<question>9 E</question>
<grade>8.8</question>
<comment>Probe action drives whole middle: rusted flue search yields brass disk that redefines mission; same verb “probe” recurs, linking tactile investigation to conceptual breakthrough at climax.</comment>

<question>9 F</question>
<grade>7.9</question>
<comment>Diaries appear early, guide heat-reading of past, and justify historian’s trust in ash-stained evidence; mechanics matter—singed fragments dictate elliptical knowledge, shaping his partial understanding of dream-end night.</comment>

<question>9 G</question>
<grade>8.6</question>
<comment>Slanted floor dictates where to place books/tragedies; ladder-rung shelves become tactile memory palace. Silo’s shifted gravity supplies the final kneeling gesture and “weather” heartbeat, inseparable from resolution.</comment>

<question>9 H</question>
<grade>9.1</question>
<comment>Post-dream epoch is the causal vacuum that creates his vocation; timeframe tightens when he dates the men’s midnight terror to “hour after last dream,” making timeline legible and linking brass discovery to that very moment.</comment>

<question>9 I</question>
<grade>9.3</question>
<comment>Desire declared paragraph 3; tested when he chooses custodianship over departure, pays with porous openness to wall-echoes. Conflict between limitless influx and finite self is embodied in palm-bite and whispered lullaby, fulfilling cost clause.</comment>

<question>9 J</question>
<grade>9.0</question>
<comment>Bronze quiet modulates—dusty, rustling, whispered—yet remains coherent color. Tone charges final image when “something like weather shifts” inside the silo, transmuting mute stillness into living pulse, closing the cadence on the promised quiet now made animate.</comment>
