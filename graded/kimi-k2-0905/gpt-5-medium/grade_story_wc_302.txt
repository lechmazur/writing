<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The veiled dreamer’s interiority is vivid—breath-syncing with the watch, copying spirals by pulse—but remains curiously frictionless: no contradictory impulse ever jeopardizes the quest. The “confidence man’s lie” and “truth I would need” promise a flaw that never complicates action; the protagonist glides from threshold to corridor without error or sacrifice. Because the ending’s cost is purely atmospheric (a library that “travels with me in intervals”), the arc feels completed yet unearned. Still, the embodied micro-choices—turning screws degree by degree, breathing fog onto the page—keep characterization above mid-band.</comment>

<comment>Causal chain: letter → map → watch → cipher → slit → corridor → desk → echo. Each step is driven by the protagonist’s interpretive labor, not luck. The cyclically-reversed watch elegantly teaches its own rule early (“kept perfect time when you looked away”) and pays it off in the final tick that “clicked satisfied.” Closure lands as Charged Poise: the second letter will arrive “by echo” only when the narrator makes room to hear—an open future re-weighted by the visible cost of patience already paid. Orientation is lyrically delayed yet coherent; the library’s geography abstracts into gesture, but that serves the accumulative/textural lens confessed in “propagation delays.”</comment>

<comment>The glowing library in mist is no backdrop; its breathing windows and legible curls of fog actively negotiate entry, forcing the protagonist to translate pauses into proof. Micro-setting inside the watch—gears etched as cipher—constrains every tactical choice (turning screws by degree, matching breath to stuttered ticks). Sensory hierarchy favors hush and glimmer, narrowing perception to what can be heard or half-seen, exactly fitting a quest for unspoken words. The final image of a corridor “shining like an unwound spring” recharges every prior mechanical detail, fulfilling the 9+ gate.</comment>

<comment>Stake—access to unspoken words—tightens once yet meaningfully: the library will open only for proof of readiness measured in withheld breath. That single deepening trades hurry for patience, foreclosing the option to force entry. Agency remains interior but visible: each calibrated turn, each fog-breath onto the page, pays an on-page cost of time and uncertainty. The price is subtle (delay, silence) yet legible under the Accumulative lens, satisfying the ≥8.0 threshold.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the paradox of speaking silence: words exist only before they are spoken, and their preservation demands renunciation of utterance. The watch’s reversed time and the ash-map’s self-immolating answer literalize this paradox without abstract sermon. Subtext lives in gesture—copying spirals with pulse rather than ink—so the insight feels discovered, not declared. Final image of echo-arrival reweights the whole quest: the library was never a place but a temporal stance, a resonant reconfiguration rather than a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>First-person lyric maintains perceptual signature throughout: attention to micro-intervals, synesthetic mist-light, cyclical syntax mirroring reversed gears. Compression is taught early (“time… slowed enough to gather meaning”) and honored at closure; any elision is paid back in the breathing-page beat. No head-hopping, no register drift; diction stays within the dreamer’s wrought-iron vocabulary. Rhythm accelerates or brakes with propagation delays, achieving textured propulsion without monotony.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty: “Numbers budded from the etched teeth, then letters, then little arrows” seeds both cipher and future action. Figurative layering is dense yet patterned—fog as listening breath, corridor as unwound spring—so the lyric excess feels earned rather than purple. No loops, no scaffold; pronoun and temporal tracking remain clean across shifting scales. Only a single paraphrase flutter (“promise I dared to believe” echoed four lines later) stops this short of the topmost band.</comment>

<comment>The “library of unspoken words” could have been twee, but here it is temporalized: a repository that exists only in delayed breath and reversed ticks, making the concept feel newly risky. Watch-as-cipher and propagation-delay-as-key transform familiar steampunk-adjacent imagery into epistemic machinery. The final corridor of salvaged futures reframes the con-man trope as time-debt collector, a fresh inflection. Risk is coherent: no explanation overload, no late rule bend; the conceptual integrity holds from first ash to final echo.</comment>
