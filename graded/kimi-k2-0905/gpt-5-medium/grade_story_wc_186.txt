<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The custodian’s retrocognitive gift and obsession with meaningful coincidence drive every action; interiority is sensory, concrete, never diagnostic. The renunciation of certainty at the end—accepting stitch over proof—costs him the comfort of closure and is earned by every prior alignment of shard, star map, and prism. Relationships act as crucible only with Lio, but that single bond forces a shared tuning that alters both stances. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in scene, so the arc feels inevitable rather than wrestled.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the beam’s “exhaled” ribbon reconfigures the wasteland into a community of shared music; cost is the custodian’s surrender of solitary proof. Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout—each star-etched pane, shard-cut silence, and traveler’s map layers density until the final alignment reweights belonging. Causality is lyric but legible: shard fits prism because silence was always the seam light needed. No orientation debt; who/where/when is anchored by the second sentence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Glass ribs, fused silica struts, and wind-threaded hum function as micro-setting that constrains tuning choices; the pavilion’s diary of etched star paths physically guides the final alignment. The broken prism and milk-pale shard are tactile tools whose evolving fracture and fit alter tactics. Sensory hierarchy is tuned to sound and light—silence as near-stone, beam as exhaled dream—mirroring the custodian’s retrocognitive ear. Final image of “ribs feel threaded by the same music” charges the setting with communal body.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—proving coincidences carry meaning—tightens when the missing constellation is found inside the shard, forcing the choice to cut silence into the prism. Escalation is textural: each alignment of mirror, pane, and star path increases density until the beam’s hum reweights solitude into fellowship. Cost is visible: the custodian trades private proof for public song, foreclosing the option to remain the lone watcher. No reversal, but the deepening of pattern is sufficient under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: meaning is not proven but stitched, a grammar of belonging woven from glass, silence, and shared star maps. Subtext lives in gesture—cupping the shard, trimming it with heated wire—where mute cries are felt in wrist bones. Final image of the pavilion “writing us back into its diary” offers Conceptual Repricing: the building itself becomes co-author, reweighting authorship from solitary keeper to collective choir. No moral is declared; resonance is visceral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>First-person retrocognitive voice sustains a compressed, lyric syntax—“scenes like dew suspended on spider silk”—that remains legible and taught early. Perceptual signature is auditory and crystalline: wind threads ribs, glass remembers laughter, beam exhales. No head-hopping; Lio’s interiority is inferred only through shared tactile acts. Register never drifts into pseudo-academic; diction stays within the custodian’s plausible lexicon of light and silence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Information-dense lines—“stories snipped by winds that sounded like scissors being cleaned”—do triple duty: atmosphere, sonic specificity, and metaphoric foreshadowing. Rhythm accelerates naturally during prism-trimming beat, then exhales with the beam’s release. No scaffold loops; each sentence advances image or pressure. Minor elevated diction (“near-stone,” “retrocognitively”) is voice-motivated and consistent, never jarring.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Post-collapse beacon rekindled by sewing silence into broken light is a fresh synthesis; familiar wasteland tropes are inverted into acoustic communion. Shard-of-hush concept is non-obvious and functions as both tool and metaphor without gimmickry. Risk—lyric accumulation replacing causal reversals—pays off because the final image reweights all prior pattern. Specificity of “star paths scratched into the pavilion’s underside” anchors originality in tactile detail.</comment>
