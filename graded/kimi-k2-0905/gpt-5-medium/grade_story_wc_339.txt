<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The narrator’s calm, analytic patience under lethal pressure is vividly embodied; every micro-choice (filming the globe, copying Morse, pocketing the artifact) externalizes the internalized “physics of letting go.” The contradiction between forensic detachment and tender caretaking gives the voice its charge. No stock phrasing; even the snow-globe crack is felt as a capillary of ruin. The only minor slip is the slightly abstract “surrender of reference frames,” which leans label-speak, but it is offset by the immediate cost of leaving the ship behind.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the snow globe’s second weather reweights the entire dive from retrieval to release. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of salt-ruin, paper sighs, static-knotted voices—culminating in the charged image of the globe ascending toward “light.” Cost is legible in the final line: “time for air and sorrow,” a finite currency split between survival and grief. No causality breaks; every object threads back to the keeper’s hands and the narrator’s promise.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The drowned library is not backdrop but pressure system: silted chairs, swollen logbook, algae-laced globes all constrain posture, visibility, and the ethics of removal. Spatial choreography is immaculate—rope line, doorway, chart table—each touch alters buoyancy and choice. The cracked snow globe uniquely charges the final image; its glass lighthouse becomes the miniature beacon the narrator now carries outward. Environment literally weighs on lungs and conscience.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can the narrator let go of the archive and still honor its voices—tightens when the globe drifts into gloved hands, forcing the choice to pocket versus catalogue. The Morse margin words (“steady, waiting, light”) act as micro-turn, shifting goal from documentation to rescue. Escalation is textural: each salt-inked letter adds weight until the final ascent costs “sorrow” alongside air. Agency is steady, renunciatory: the narrator refuses to take the whole library but salvages one fragile planet.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges as the inverse of archive: forgetting as curated act. The physics of letting go is not abandonment but re-buoyancy—objects must be re-homed so storms can finally precipitate. Subtext lives in the silence inside paper, inside voices that never asked to be saved. Final image of the globe rising toward daylight reconfigures grief into caretaking without possession—no moral stated, only salt water and light.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is crystalline—technical, maritime, yet haunted: “salt had started to learn the alphabet of ruin.” Syntax mirrors pressure: long, clause-laden sentences underwater; final ascent breaks into shorter, breath-metered phrases. No head-hopping; the “chorus trapped between pages” remains external, overheard. Filter verbs (“I felt,” “I thought”) are minimal and earned, serving as calibration rather than insulation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Line-level craft is near flawless: each metaphor is also instrument—“capillary in glass” simultaneously describes fracture and vascular leak of memory. No scaffold loops; every sentence advances image or stakes. Rhythmic variation mirrors nitrogen narcosis—dreamy elongation below, staccato tugs on ascent. Only one faint echo of “physics of letting go” edges toward thesis, but it is absorbed into the lyric register.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses three rarely conjoined archives—Earhart, 1939 library, snow-globe cosmography—into an inevitable meditation on spectral custody. The freighter captain’s clipped plea and the keeper’s unvisited harbors feel discovered, not invented. Risk is maximal: a wholly passive protagonist whose only outward act is preservation, yet the interior stakes dwarf action. Synthesis of maritime, archival, and cosmological imageries yields a fresh elegiac physics.</comment>
