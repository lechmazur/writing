<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Iri’s renunciation of speech and guarded silence are embodied in micro-choices—salting bells, smudging ledger, trembling fingers—showing interior contradiction and cost. Archive Keepers’ one-beat shift from grasp to bow dramatizes external pressure that alters their stance. The seasonal muteness trait is label-heavy until winter arrival; earlier dramatization would push higher.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Iri refuses to surrender the shard, stamps the ledger star, and the Keepers leave unburdened, visible cost in her tremor and their slowed gait. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: iceberg refraction, bell resonance, and cloud pause crystallize meaning without causal reversals. Orientation is anchored by line 5; disorientation is lyrical, not disruptive.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Whispering bluff, iceberg shard, and kinetic sculpture constrain every decision—salt sticks only on cold brass, sunlight angle is tactical, wind is the instrument. Micro-setting (chalk, mallet, ledger) and weathered body (trembling gloved hand) charge the final image. Spatial choreography is flawless; Keepers traverse the array without drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—preserve wonder vs. archive order—tightens when Keepers reach for the shard; sunlight refraction deepens knowledge and forecloses seizure. Cost is legible in Iri’s tremor, the shard’s rope cradle, and Keepers’ slower descent. Single meaningful intensification fits length; no reversal required under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from sound vs. ledger, not lecture: wonder is a color words scuff, preserved only by refusal. Final image of “tuned day” reweights prior motifs without moral. Subtext lives in gesture—bow, smudge, tremor—never exposition.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric-crystalline, syntax mirrors bell delay: “clouds paused their muffled rearrangements.” Diction stays within Iri’s artisanal lexicon; no filter verbs dull immediacy. Patterned elision (“seasonally mute”) is taught early and paid off at closure. Perceptual signature—graphite scent, powdered ice—remains singular.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary from short percussive strikes to long resonant clauses; no scaffold or synonym loops. Metaphors are integrated—“bluff whispered like a sleeping throat”—without purple swell. Information density high: one line can anchor time, body, and tool. Closing line recharges “tuned day” without redundancy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Kinetic orchestra of bells, chimes, and iceberg fragment feels inevitable, not gimmick; premise follows acoustic logic to refusal-of-archive. Risk—seasonal muteness as lyric device—pays off in crystallized silence. Specificity of “ledger of weather in tiny marks” prevents template feel.</comment>
