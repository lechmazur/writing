<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The narrator’s quietly rebellious stance is shown through embodied micro-choices—drumming on rails, stealing blind spots, kneeling to tap a private rhythm—each tethered to the entangled-love stake. Interiority is concrete (“ribs hollowed like flutes”) and contradictions glow: compliance offered as roses while plotting inversion. The final shared awakening is earned by this drum-code courtship; cost is felt when cuffs click and donor memories are accepted. Voice never slips into diagnostic speak; every image is particular to this guinea-pig lover.

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Driven by an Accumulative/Textural lens, the piece teaches its pattern early—sound as spatial key—and tightens through cadence shifts rather than causal reversals. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the crack widens, Mira steps onto the bridge, and the monitors adopt their rhythm—an undeniable reconfiguration with conceptual cost (donor lives now housed inside them). Orientation is anchored by word 30 (“research wing”), waiving any penalty. No plot amnesia; every metaphoric leap is pre-signed by the garden’s acoustic rule-set.

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The sound-wave garden is not backdrop but instrument: resonance beds, leafed speakers, auric lagoon whose ripples are syllables. These elements constrain tactics—only drumming unlocks corridors—and charge the final image when the lagoon’s gold dust is inhaled into their chests. Spatial choreography is immaculate: railing, gravel, center crack tracked without drift. Sensory hierarchy mirrors urgency—touch and hearing dominate, vision is star-blink—fitting a sonic POV.

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stake: awaken Mira before monitors reset. Pressure escalates through density—each drumbeat layers donor memories, narrowing options to “carry what does not belong.” The meaningful tightening is the lagoon’s demand for托管 grief; refusal would lose her forever. Cost is legible: narrator accepts lifelong tenancy of strangers’ memories, wrists offered like roses. Agency remains with drummer; coincidence never rescues.

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particularized images: whale letters, violin in brine, firewood-door laughter—entanglement as love’s real shape. Final image of “agreed awakening” reweights earlier ethical questions about donor splicing without moralizing. Subtext is coded in silence—cuffs clicking polite ceremony, nod blessing strangers inside. Resonance lingers: reader left hearing future dawns tapped for three names.

</question>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>First-person lyric retains coherent perceptual signature: narrator notices by sound first, star-taste second. Rhythmic control mirrors content—short percussive clauses during drumming, elongated fluid lines at lagoon. No head-hopping; donor memories intrude as sensory flares, not omniscient exposition. Compression (“the garden had already decided”) is pattern-taught early and pays off at closure.

<comment>High information density: one sentence often sets scene, advances plot, and embodies emotion—“I knelt and tapped a rhythm that Mira would know, the pattern from our first winter.” Figurative language is patterned (sound = architecture) so density never feels purple. Zero paraphrase loops; no mixed metaphors. Final third is clean, allowing 9-band consideration. Ear-test rhythm varies without algorithmic drumbeat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Premise—memory-entangled guinea pigs using sonic architecture to re-enliven comatose lover—is fresh, yet emotional core is ancient: love as willingness to house the Other’s ghosts. Risk of lyrical overload is embraced but controlled by taught acoustic rule-set, so experiment heightens rather than obscures stakes. Specific inflection: donor violin sealed in brine becomes lullaby for shared future afternoons. Transformation test fails if names changed—garden’s acoustics and “auric lagoon” are irreplaceable.</comment>
