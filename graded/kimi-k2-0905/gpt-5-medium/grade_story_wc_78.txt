<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The prophet’s vocation (“turn obstacles into instruments”) is stated early and dramatized throughout: every strike of the mallet tests this creed and visibly costs sweat, time, and risk. Interiority stays sensory—sound of apples like “small bell noises”—never abstract self-analysis. The final quiet sit-down among pears shows earned stasis: the orchard survives, but the body is spent and the mallet laid down, a lacquered witness to the price paid. No contradictory impulse is allowed to complicate the prophet’s drive; the absence of that friction keeps the score just shy of the 8.5 band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the orchard still afloat, the prophet seated among humming pears, the sky’s “greener note” reweighting every prior beat under the Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality holds—each dub and strike visibly steers drift, timbre, and finally the storm’s mouth—so the cost is audible in the exhausted silence that follows the tower of crates. Orientation is taught immediately (“At the blue hour the orchard drifted…”) and repaid when the same blue folds into the resonant hush at the end. No teleporting props or retroactive patches; the lattice of fractal holes and the net of knives are both set up and played.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The floating orchard is never static backdrop; its hull chalk, slosh timbre, and leeward angle constrain every tactical placement of crate, oar, and pineapple. Micro-setting—the lacquered mallet head, the bee swarm ceiling—directly shapes the final acoustic shield. Sensory hierarchy obeys the prophet’s ear-centric vocation: sound leads, sight follows, touch arrives via vibration. Because the driftwood circle’s physical limits steer the climax (the tower of crates must fit the deck), the 9+ gate is satisfied; the slight reserve reflects a wish for one more smelled or tasted detail to widen the bandwidth.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—survival of the drifting orchard—tightens when the cloud-mouth’s “D grown from pressure” forces an audible reply; the octave drop is the single decisive escalation that turns threat into duet. Cost is visceral: the prophet’s palms, the bruised pears, the knives converted to rattling sistrum—each conversion a visible forfeiture of safety. Agency stays acoustic; no off-stage rescue, only stacked resonance, yet the luck of the wind shifting into the perforated tower is marginally convenient. Still, the music acts, the deck tilts but holds, and the price is etched in the exhausted final sit-down.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as the alchemy of peril into pattern: “walls made noise, noise became map.” No character moralizes; the only sermon is the orchard’s own hum after the storm. The final image—prophet listening to clouds rewrite letters into silence—renders the theme wordlessly, inviting the reader to hear survival as an act of re-notation rather than conquest. Ambiguity lingers: the orchard is safe, yet the sea still waits, so the moral stays complex, unsentimental, and charged.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>First-person lyric I remains tightly ear-bound; diction—“euphony,” “timbre,” “fractal”—never exceeds the prophet’s craft lexicon. Syntax coils and releases like wind through rigging, mirroring rising pressure without drumbeat monotony. No head-hopping; the collective “we” appears only after the prophet’s choreography has earned communal follow, keeping focalization pure. The voice’s perceptual signature—clouds as letters, apples as bells—feels singular and indispensable to the piece’s identity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Rhythm modulates naturally from long breathes of description to staccato strike sequences, matching the storm’s surge. Figurative layering is dense but purposeful: each metaphor extends the acoustic premise; no mixed vehicles break physical logic. Occasional scaffold—“I dubbed… I dubbed…”—is minimal and pattern-taught, so momentum never stalls. A single paraphrase loop (“the music gathered ruin and returned it as push”) slightly dulls the climax, holding the score just outside the 9-band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The concept of a musical ark that literally plays itself clear of tempests is fresh, yet grounded in tactile detail—sap-lacquered mallet, pineapple metronomes—so wonder feels earned rather than gimmicked. Risk is high: the entire plot hinges on audible physics, but consistency never breaks, and the payoff reconfigures survival as collaborative composition. The synthesis of maritime ordeal with live sound sculpture produces a specific, irreplicable emotional signature. Transformation test passes: swap any element and the whole chord collapses.</comment>
