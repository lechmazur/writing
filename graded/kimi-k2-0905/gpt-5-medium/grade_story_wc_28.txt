<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The gentle radical’s contradiction—steel arms cradling empathy—remains embodied in every beat: kneeling to tesserae, trading bottle caps for a name, forcing renamed men to kneel. Interiority stays concrete (“my memory opens like a wound”) and the final loosening of the past is earned by the mosaic ritual that precedes it. The only bar to 9+ is that the boy and the four men are sketched more as functions than crucibles; the protagonist carries almost all contradiction alone.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the tessera returned, the past loosens, cost visible in the steel arms that must keep working. Causality holds: because the boy brings caps, the mosaic speaks “Sila,” which in turn enables the renaming of the arsonists—each step because/therefore under the Causal lens. Orientation is taught by line 3 (“ancient plaza beneath a shattered sky”) and never breaks; the single transition from boy to accused men is cleanly handled within the continuous scene.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The plaza’s ash, broken columns, and chipped tesserae are not backdrop; they dictate method (reading patterns), resource (tessera as oracle), and moral temperature. The shattered sky and slow ash constrain visibility and movement, while the bottle-cap scatter provides tactile micro-setting that literally shapes the new name. Environment charges the final image: placing the tessera back into the ash-strewn ground reconfigures both protagonist and place.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can empathy survive after atrocity—is signaled in paragraph 1 and tightens when the boy’s mother needs a non-burning name. The renaming of the four men forces a public, irreversible trade-off: they receive social re-entry but only by accepting lifelong labor tied to their crime. Cost is legible on-page: the protagonist’s “arms of steel” tremble as the past loosens, and the plaza’s breath-held silence shows the crowd’s uneasy purchase on this aberrant mercy.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the pattern of naming: Asha→Sila, arsonists→Bearer/Tanner/Chisel/Watch. No character states a moral; instead the mosaic’s “stone grammar” reweights the idea that repair can coexist with memory. The final image—tessera returned, past loosening—offers a resonant, non-literal answer: mercy is not erasure but a bridge that still bears the scorch marks.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>First-person voice is relentless in its perceptual signature: “wind moved like a careful surgeon,” “breath so careful it could survive underwater.” Syntax lengthens and compresses with emotional heat; the diction never drifts from the narrator’s wrought, prayer-like register. No head-hopping; the boy’s and men’s interiorities are implied only through gesture and silence, preserving distance control.</comment>

<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: every sentence advances atmosphere, moral calculus, or ritual step. Figurative language is patterned—ash, steel, bridge, pause—so the lyric surplus feels earned rather than overwritten. Only a single mixed metaphor (“warm coat of frost”) momentarily jars, but it does not touch the closure beat. Rhythm modulates from long incantatory lines to the staccato of naming, mirroring the plaza’s held breath.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The fusion of post-war memorial ritual with mosaic divination via bottle-caps feels utterly specific to this narrator and plaza. Renaming as restorative justice rather than absolution is a fresh inflection on a familiar theme, and the “aberrant mercy” concept reframes the entire parable. Risk—lyric density, no physical combat—heightens coherence without obscuring clarity. The synthesis could not survive transplantation to another setting without collapsing its moral architecture.</comment>
