<comment>The narrator’s interiority is consistently specific—e.g., “sensibly eccentric, preferring lists and boots”—and the micro-choice to float the compass-shoe is a credible renunciation that clicks open grief. Internal contradiction is present but subtle; the flaw (clinging to failure as map) could be more actively hazardous on-page. The scarf-memory knot is a lovely embodiment of love → courage, yet the father-widow reveal is delivered in flash exposition rather than forcing a present-tense choice. Overall, a strong arc of Earned Stasis, but the emotional cost is more declared than dramatized in the final beat.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the lagoon returns the boots, refusing explanatory logic, and the narrator accepts the hush—cost is the forfeiture of certainty and the compass itself. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each psychometry flash thickens the pattern of industrial guilt / filial loss until the water’s silence reprices it. No orientation debt; who/where/when are legible by line 10. Causality is soft—coincidence of seam-opening—but fits the situational pressure rule. The final image crystallizes options without emotional over-explanation.</comment>

<comment>Micro-setting triumph: the compass, jars, and boardwalk planks function as extensions of the wetland cave, constraining every step and the final offering. Sensory selection is POV-driven—“smells like pages turning in a salt library” is both olfactory and metaphoric, yet stays in character. Spatial choreography is flawless; no impossible bat or plank placements. The lagoon as breathing lung recharges the closure, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—failure as map—is signaled early and deepens when each psychometry flash proves memory unreliable. One meaningful tightening: the laughing-man memory collapses into the father id, forcing the narrator to decide whether to keep seeking maps. Cost is legible but conceptual (forfeited compass); a visceral price (cold, wet, risk) would sharpen 8.8+ eligibility. Escalation is accumulative: each scent/image layer reweights the stake rather than narrows external options.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: industrial extraction vs. subterranean patience, love as the only non-failing map. No moralizing; the final “hinged awake” is image, not lesson. Subtext lives in objects—compass ticks like a disagreeing heart—never explained. The salt-scarf knot reconfigures grief without abstract labels, achieving CR.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Lyric first-person maintains a distinct perceptual signature: time is measured in “drips of stone patience,” thoughts degrade under cave darkness. Compression taught early (“I am sensibly eccentric…”) and paid off in the stripped final breath. No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens smoothly. Filter-verb stacks absent; rhythm modulates from long breathy sentences to the final short “I walk home lighter, hinged awake.”</comment>

<comment>Prose is dense yet lucid: “black with inquiry” twins color and concept in four syllables. One metaphor muddle: “lamp coughing itself out” momentarily anthropomorphizes hardware, but the coughing pays off in the later human cough-memory, so forgiven. Zero loops; no scaffold. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with cave hush. Final line is carved clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The petrichor-collector psychometrist in a post-industrial cave is a fresh synthesis; risk is taken with lyric ellipsis and pays off in closure. No stock phrasing; “salt library” and “dark currency” are coinages that feel inevitable. Transformation test fails—core emotion could survive relocation—but the sensory palette is irreproducibly anchored. Bold structural brevity heightens rather than obscures.</comment>
