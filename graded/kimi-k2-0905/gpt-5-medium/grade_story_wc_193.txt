<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The survivor backstory fuels the narrator’s distrust of easy profit, but the interiority stays lyric-abstract (“IOU scars that itch”) rather than dramatized micro-choice until the final signature. Embodied emotion peaks when “thumbs shake” while texting; prior beats rely on atmospheric label. The late decision to sign the console and donate the crop earns credible renunciation, yet the flaw-compounding that precedes it is told, not shown. Voice remains consistent, but emotional specificity slips into metaphoric shorthand mid-scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the signed console and edible diamonds reweight “promise” from scam logic to communal value, cost legible in the donated harvest. Drive is Accumulative/Textural—lyric repetitions of pressure, glow, breath tighten the cadence until the final image reconfigures meaning. Causality holds: each text-command is obeyed, tightening the chamber until the caps crystallize; no coin flip resolves the stake. The bolt’s threaded “mouth” is teleported in without prior spatial map, a minor orientation wobble that does not rupture closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The mushroom rows function as micro-setting: their pulsing glow counts down the narrator’s fright and literally feeds the diamond output, satisfying the 9+ gate. Dew-slick floor and “breathing” caps anchor body in motion; spatial choreography stays clean as the chamber is wheeled ninety degrees. Technical rule—“compress long enough and value crystallizes”—is learned through action, never dumped. Only lapse: the bolt’s mystery port appears without prior visual cue, a miniature teleport.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“keep the quantum promise or repeat the scam”—is signaled early and deepened by each backward-stamped text. One meaningful tightening: turning the chamber ninety degrees per the kindest-me text forecloses doubt and enables the diamond bloom; cost is the signed legal exposure on the console. Pressure accumulates through lyric density rather than sequential reversals, coherent under Accumulative lens. The price (donating the harvest) is visible but understated; a sharper visceral loss would punch harder.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: value created through shared trust versus extracted profit. Subtext lives in gesture—signing the console replaces the earlier IOU ledger without sermon. The edible diamond ledger image reweights “promise” from monetary to communal currency, a resonant non-literal answer. No overt thesis states the moral; ambiguity lingers in the engineer’s shrug.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>First-person voice owns a distinct perceptual signature: maritime-mechanical lexicon (“submarine porthole bolt,” “valve finding its note”) fused with fungal luminescence. Rhythm modulates from long tide-swell sentences to clipped valve-turn commands under pressure. No head-hopping; ghosts remain reflective overlays, not interior invasions. Compression like “valve finding its note” is taught early and paid off in the final laugh, earning the high band.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Lyric density is high yet propulsive; metaphoric layering (“mushrooms pulse like patient lanterns”) never stalls motion. No mixed metaphors or synonym loops; each figurative image advances atmosphere or stakes. Sentence variety is wide, breath-mimicking. Minor scaffold: repeated “I [verb]” openings in the climactic sequence could trim for even tighter music.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The bioluminescent mushroom farm as capitalist alchemy factory feels fresh; the edible diamond ledger reinvents value creation without didactic sci-fi. Pressure-to-diamond trope is literalized through fungal biochemistry rather than abstract tech. Multi-verse texts from alternate selves risk gimmick, but their clipped emergency diction keeps stakes grounded. Final image of wheeling light through town recharges “virtue without mischief,” a non-obvious synthesis of scam-survivor wisdom.</comment>
