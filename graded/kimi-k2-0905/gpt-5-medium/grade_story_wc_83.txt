<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The narrator’s “bruise that never quite fades” identity is vivid, but interior contradiction is narrated rather than dramatized in scene; the geode’s ache is repeatedly declared (“oracle,” “cathedral”) without fresh micro-choices under pressure until the final tilt against glass, so the closing vow feels more asserted than earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Causal chain is present—blast → geode → hunt for slack → perturb valley → mark basin—but the mid-story sags into accumulative lyric loops; the closure beat (“I swear I can feel it lift us”) is a resonant reconfiguration with cost, yet the lens ambiguity (causal vs. accumulative) persists until the final paragraph, slightly blunting the turn.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>“Jagged storms,” “iron ribcage,” “moth-colored light” render the observatory and valley tactile; the geode-as-micro-setting constrains the final image, passing the 9+ gate. Sparse but precise spatial anchors keep the floating deck coherent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—harvesting unused potential to keep the heart from burning—tightens once when the basin appears and the commander is dared; the price is the vow to “remain awake,” a credible forfeiture of rest, but no live option is foreclosed on-page, so escalation stays poetic rather than tactical.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of reclaiming waste energy emerges through geode light, valley lights, and the final “wounded hymn”; no moral is preached. The ending reweights the premise via Conceptual Repricing—slack energy can almost buoy the craft—yet the abstraction keeps the resonance just shy of piercing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Voice is utterly distinct: compressed syntax, coinages (“drone-strike wedding survivor”), rhythmic parallelism taught early and held. No head-hopping; psychic distance compresses under pressure; the diction stays within the narrator’s wounded lexicon, earning the 9+ band despite minor lyric loop echoes.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Metaphor density nears overload in places (“purple cathedral under skin,” “cold machine choir”), risking coherence, but each image advances atmosphere or stakes; no mixed metaphors break physics. A few template cadences (“I came… I am… I hunt…”) dull momentum, yet propulsion survives to the final line.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The drone-strike wedding geode oracle is audacious and specific; perturbation theory as lantern is fresh, not gimmick. Synthesis feels inevitable: waste energy, bruised sky, and geode light converge in the closing “wounded hymn,” transforming familiar post-war grief into a lift of uncanny potential.</comment>
