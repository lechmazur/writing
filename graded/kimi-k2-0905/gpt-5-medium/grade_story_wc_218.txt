<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The caretaker’s interior contradiction—accepting death yet sweating to remake the orchard—surfaces in every micro-choice (copper loop, otter ramp, diary smudge). Embodied emotion (“my breath grew thin”) and mineral taste of almond pollen ground the arc. The final renunciation—laying the diary under the oak—pays the full cost of mortality while enshrining interspecies respect. Voice stays individual, never drifts into caretaker cliché.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the orchard’s “slow chord” reconfigures the caretaker’s death from exile into continuity. Causal chain intact: six-month sentence → copper grammar → otter handshake → mineral silence, each step narrowing breath and widening pattern. The cost is legible in the final copper circle and the diary relinquished to roots. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds from first mineral hum to last woven map.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Living stone pillars function as both environment and tool: their appetite for almond pollen dictates the graft, their shade steadies the caretaker’s failing lungs. The orchard’s breathing cadence anchors every beat; spatial choreography is clear from gate to kelp raft. Micro-setting (copper wire, volcanic pores) constrains tactics and charges the final image. Weather, tide, and mineral scent evolve with events—no static postcard prose.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes—mortal time versus ecological legacy—tighten when each copper loop forecloses alternative shelter-building or self-pity. The orchard’s answering hum is the deepening that reweights death as collaboration. Visible price: breath thins, afternoons vanish, diary is surrendered. Agency stays with caretaker; storms and gulls complicate but do not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges as “listening as architecture”: interspecies respect built from reciprocal appetite, not charity. Final image of silence-as-trust reprises early mineral hum without moralizing. Subtext lodges in gestures—kelp raft as comma between human and otter sentences. Complexity preserved: death remains loss even as legacy rootles.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is caretaker-specific: tide as metronome, stone taste as hunger, copper as slow electricity. Rhythm modulates from long tidal sentences to clipped “I waved when it blinked” under death’s gaze. No head-hopping; lyric compression taught early (“weather made visible”) and paid off in final woven map. Diction stays within islander lexicon; no academic intrusion.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sentences carry triple duty: “The copper sang faintly, an insect choir corrected by the living stone until pitch met pulse” advances tool, atmosphere, and metaphor in one breath. No synonym loops or scaffold; paragraph cuts are clean. Minor overworlding in “brazen calm etched into errands” but cadence justifies the flourish. Closure beat free of figurative muddle.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Premise fuses mortality with mineral botany—fresh synthesis beyond eco-elegy. Copper-wired oak grammar and otter council feel inevitable yet unforeseen. Risk: lyric orchard that “sails like a slow ship” paid off by grounded kelp raft and tangible shell offerings. Transformation complete: swap caretaker or island and the pattern collapses.</comment>
