<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is concrete—her laughter soft to avoid waking the seed, her hand cupping darkness—yet the “puzzle grew in her” beat drifts toward abstraction. The contradictions (profit vs. stewardship, spectacle vs. quiet) live in her micro-choices (pot from prop shelf, timer set to bracket). Closure cost is felt: she bows, literally curating wonder, foreclosing a louder-money path. Still, her flaws stay slightly safe; no misbelief visibly derails her.

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: timer chimes, she bows, the brook keeps the shadow—cost is the quieter profit foregone. Causal chain is intact: seed arrives → Mara plants it → rules drafted → parallel ledger conceived → bow = vow. No orientation debt; anchors (annex, brook, night) land by line 40. Lens (Accumulative) holds: each image layers silence-as-value until the final cadence. Only hairline slip: “certificate…forge only in metaphor” momentarily winks at the reader.

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Selective sensory triage—damp planks, cedar-ozone breath, gutter rattle—mirrors Mara’s narrowed attention. Micro-setting (seed pot) constrains her final gesture; its prior black-light life recycles into new stakes. Spatial choreography flawless: envelope → floor → window → soil → pot tucked beneath note. Brook as metronome threads throughout, recharging the last image (“kept her secret”).</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—preserve quiet innovation against louder profit—tightens when inspectors/landlord are imagined, then again when she rehearses pitch aloud. One visible price: she locks the annex against dilution, accepting slower trickle. Escalation is accumulative: each hush-layer (storm, brook, timer) deepens the wager on meaning over money. No reversal, but deepening suffices under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from pattern: silence as cultivated commons vs. spectacle. Subtext lives in gesture—bow instead of speech, seed kept dark instead of shown off. Final image reweights premise: stewardship is the new escape. No moral spoken; the river keeps the secret answers the thematic question.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</question>
<comment>Voice is tactile, brook-ribbed, storm-rinsed: “moonlight braid with current,” “timer…to bracket the moment.” Syntax reflects Mara’s puzzle-designer mind: conditional clauses stack like nested riddles. No head-hopping; POV stays inside her perceptual bias. Register never drifts into corporate even when ledger is mentioned—she reframes it as “parallel challenge.”</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Lines carry triple duty: sensory, metaphoric, causal (“she cupped the seed and felt her own nerves sink beside it”). No loops; each sentence advances image or tactic. Rhythm modulates from elongated brook lines to staccato timer beat. Figurative language stays coherent—no mixed metaphors in peak beats. Only micro-slip: “orthogonal approaches” is slightly jargony but justified by her profession.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Premise—escape-room designer grows corpse flower as real puzzle—feels inevitable yet fresh. Storm-born silence trope is inverted into business plan. Risk taken: quiet ending with no bloom, only promise. Specificity of props (black-light pot, napkin rules) prevents generic transplant. Not quite 9+ because core metaphor (silence = profit) edges familiar; still, synthesis is memorable.</comment>
