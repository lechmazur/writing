<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The narrator’s poet-revolutionary identity is vividly embodied in every perceptual beat; hunger for a usable past drives every micro-choice, from pocketing the shard to the public readings. Interior contradiction is palpable: the same man who once hid from soldiers now courts visibility, yet clings to a childhood superstition, exposing both longing and tactical caution. The final bow of sorrow when the shard cracks is earned—his revolution stays dead, but the stance he carved (listening instead of leading) costs him the last talisman. Ledger functions as living pressure, not caricature; their status duel in council hall crystallizes without sidelining the protagonist’s agency.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the council’s vote to “revise the archive as ornament” publicly revalues labor over bloodline, a social cost Ledger feels as his laughter returns “muffled, perplexed, and aging.” Causal chain holds: shard song → public readings → crowds bring objects → council spectacle → archive shift; each because/therefore advances options. Early orientation is swift—asteroid, visible time, narrator’s disgraced status by line 3. No prop or motive teleports; mirrors stay covered, shard stays audible, antagonist stays present until the muffled laugh.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The asteroid’s baroque ruin is not backdrop but instrument: ruptured salons vent temporal drafts that literally herd minutes across scaffolded galleries, forcing the ritual of mirror-shrouding. Micro-setting—the shard pressed to temple—becomes the final lectern where the extinct multitude “hummed.” Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: a starving poet notes “gilt dust,” “oxidized velvet iron,” “seed beads,” never generic rock. Spatial choreography is immaculate; bodies move from excavation pits → colonnades → council hall without drift. Environment constrains until the end: when observatory skin opens, visible years drizzle in like smoke, charging the shard’s final cadence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—whether ornament is domination or solidarity—tightens at each storm: first as rumor, then as shard evidence, finally as council verdict. The mirror-covering ritual is the decisive, visible tactic that narrows options (no echo, no distraction) and escalates public stakes—crowds grow, Ledger petitions, council forced to arbitrate. Protagonist pays iterated costs: childhood superstition exposed to mockery, shard eventually cracked, revolution stillborn. Escalation is causal, not additive: each public reading enlarges the coalition that ultimately re-weights the archive.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as ornament = mutual ledger of labor and beauty, never declared but sung through the shard’s “lost scansion.” Final image of the cracked shard reweights all prior gilt curves: beauty now costs fragility, not privilege. Subtext thrums in silence: covered mirrors stop reflecting elite faces, letting extinct voices speak—an unspoken class inversion. The treatise-poems remain off-page, avoiding thesis dump; meaning is crystallized in the council’s reluctant vote, a social re-pricing the reader feels as “burnished sorrow.”</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>First-person diction is inseparable from ex-insurgent poet: “curve upon curve of gathered breath,” “rubric-lit colonnades,” syntax stacking dependent clauses like baroque cornices. Rhythm swells with storm cadence—long sentences when minutes rain, cracked fragments when the shard breaks. No head-hop; interiority stays hungry, skeptical, superstitious. Compression (“futility minted in my bones”) teaches pattern early and pays off in final sentence where “sorrow shone, burnished.” Lexicon stays within plausible reach of a self-taught revolutionary, never academic ventriloquy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Line-level density is extreme yet legible: “veils of years draped over battered cornices” does triple scene work—visual, temporal, thematic. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; each sentence advances knowledge or image. Figurative layering peaks at closure but remains coherent: cracked tender shard = broken hope, yet still reflective. Micro-adjustment for one register lift—“Conceptual Repricing” as evaluator paraphrase—does not appear in the prose itself, hence no deduction. Read-aloud ear test passes: varied sentence openings, paragraph breaths align with emotional swells.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fusion of visible time with baroque archaeology is fresh; speculative premise grows from emotional truth rather than gimmick. Superstition-as-method (cover mirrors to let the dead speak) subverts both hard-SF and fantasy defaults. Risk-taking in lyric structure pays off: shard as silent choir, min as weather—images that could collapse into preciousness but stay tethered to class stakes. Transformation test: remove asteroid, mirror ritual, or shard and entire moral calculus collapses, confirming irreplaceability. No echo of famous scenes; baroque-in-space avoids cliché orbit.</comment>
