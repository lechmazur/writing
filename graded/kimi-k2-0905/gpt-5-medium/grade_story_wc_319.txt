<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The narrator’s “dimensionally homesick” ache is lived-in from line 1; every beat of fold-and-carry interiority grows from that flaw and forecloses the old idea of home. The guardian’s wolf-taught tenderness is shown through gesture (pendant weighing, circle-draw) rather than label, so both characters feel singular. The final renunciation—carrying the garden instead of occupying it—pays the cost of permanent exile in a single, embodied image.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the narrator accepts perpetual borderlessness and the bead keeps a sliver of breath as tithe—cost is visible and irreversible. Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout; each repetition of “interiorize” tightens the weave until the world outside fits inside. No causal contradictions; the frozen sundial and refused dawn are consistent physics.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The frozen garden, mist, and arrested sundial shadow are not backdrop—they are tools that force the waiting stance and make exile tactile. The bead’s “small sunrise refuses to cross the line” literally draws the boundary the narrator must internalize. Every descriptive stroke is filtered through the POV’s homesick perceptual lens, so setting and body are indivisible.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</question><comment>Dominant stake—make friends with uncertainty—tightens once: the guardian’s test (“what will you give to stay?”) forces the narrator to trade rootedness for portable thresholds. Cost is legible in the bead’s kept breath and the final image of the day “thinner for a breath.” Escalation is quiet but sufficient for lyric mode; one meaningful deepening, not multiple reversals.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the pattern of carried thresholds and refused dawns; no character sermonizes. The final image of uncertainty sitting “beside me like a new friend” reweights the entire motif without moralizing. Ambiguity is purposeful—home as a room of unlocked thresholds—yet emotionally precise.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Voice is a sustained lyric whisper: syntax elongates, then snaps (“I leave by not leaving”) to mimic folding motion. Perceptual signature is consistent—everything is translucence, breath-on-glass, dawn that will not spill. No head-hop; the guardian’s interior is only guessed at, keeping POV modest.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Sentences vary in length and rhythm; high density—“little climates clinking like secret glasses” does three jobs in six words. A few abstract clusters (“address edited out,” “conceptual repricing”) are tolerated because they serve the concept-driven lens. Zero paraphrase loops, no mixed metaphors, clean grammar.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</question><comment>The library of unwritten books guarded by a wolf-tender woman who teaches exile by frostbite is a fresh synthesis of dream-logic and bibliophile myth. The trope of threshold-as-home is inverted: the protagonist wins by refusing to cross any final door. Risky lyric compression pays off—the bead’s kept breath feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
