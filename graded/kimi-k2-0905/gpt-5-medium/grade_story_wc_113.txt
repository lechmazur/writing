<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Interiority is lyrical, embodied, and consistent with musician POV—“shivering beside a cracked viola case,” “cold nibbling my shins.” Micro-choices (turning pages like pond lilies, stepping on glints) align with stakes. Flaw: no visible cost after taking baton—water lifts instantly, portrait heals, musician exits unchanged; renunciation is asserted, not dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens taught early via water-bloom imagery; closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—silence becomes breathable bridge. Orientation anchor (musician, flooded pit, night) appears by line 3. Causality is lyric, not procedural: blot → score → map → door → baton → silence. Cost is conceptual (house rests), but lacks bodily or emotional price on page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Setting is protagonist: “the whole place is a flooded opera house…tired moons.” Lantern-star constellations on ceiling, swollen door exhaling perfume—details constrain movement (must step on reflections only). Micro-setting (baton box of bone-white sticks) charges final image. One geography slip: “pocket no architect would claim” risks abstraction, but lyrical license holds.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake: break drowning-loop by conducting silence. Tightening occurs when score-of-rests appears; options narrow to “step on reflections only.” Agency is attention-based, yet price is off-page—musician leaves dry, loop broken by baton raise alone. Still, silence-as-bridge reweights stakes under accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme: music lives in negative space between notes/sounds. Emerges via water-damage shapes, rests-as-score, silence-as-coda. Final image (lanterns brightening “in between spaces until they are less between, more bridge”) offers non-literal answer. Avoids thesis statement; resonance lingers. Slight deduction for abstract closure lacking bodily cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>First-person musician voice is textured—percussive consonants (“cracked viola case,” “beads throw constellations”) mimic pizzicato. Syntax lengthens underwater, contracts on land. Diction stays within artist lexicon; no filter-verb bloat. One rhythmic stem repeat (“between” used 9×) is pattern-taught, paid off in final bridge image.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Lyric density justifies itself: every figuration advances atmosphere or causality—no purple loops. Mixed metaphors avoided; water-as-mirror, light-as-score stay coherent. One paraphrase loop (“the code says…”) could compress. Final third clean; no artifact touches closure beat. Read-aloud rhythm pulses like submerged waltz.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Flooded opera-house-as-instrument, silence-as-score is fresh synthesis; ghost conductor premise inverted—protagonist conducts silence to free ghost. Water-damage creating readable notation feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking (lyric causality, no antagonist) heightens coherence. Minor proximity to “phantom” tropes is transformed through negative-space concept.</comment>
