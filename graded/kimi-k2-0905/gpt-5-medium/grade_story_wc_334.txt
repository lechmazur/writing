<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The folklorist’s curiosity is embodied through tactile gear and micro-choices (chalking cracks, biting the apple) that cost air and guilt; the admission “I loved the work more than the woman” crystallizes a hierarchy of values with visible price. Interiority stays concrete, never diagnostic. The earned partial return of grandmother’s cadence shows credible endurance rather than tidy healing.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the ledger’s double entry of grandmother’s name and the warmth in the glove reweight memory’s economy under an Accumulative lens. Causality holds: confession → ring brightens → partial restitution, with a persistent constraint—only partial return, late fees implied. Orientation is clean by line 5; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The cracked greenhouse panes act as micro-setting that literally maps the path to the hatch; the apple’s salt-then-sweet progression constrains the sensory stakes of memory recovery. Shipwrecks as “ribs like barred windows” tether atmosphere to the fairy-ring ritual. Every environmental detail is filtered through the POV’s professional gaze and returned charged at the final bite.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—recover stolen memories—tightens once: the confession trades emotional truth for partial restitution, narrowing future options (only partial return, ledger debt remains). Pressure is coherent under Accumulative lens: density of mirrored constellations, ring pulse, and ledger warmth escalate cost without causal reversals. Visible price is legible in glove warmth and lung-burning ascent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the transaction between memory and tribute: women “make the ledger,” not own the sea. The double entry of grandmother’s name reweights ownership without moralizing. Final image of drying the slate and writing her name a third time offers quiet resonance—repair begins, but balance remains unpaid.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>First-person voice carries a distinct perceptual signature: tide list “smudged with salt and graphite,” apples as “small moons wearing a rust blush.” Syntax tightens under pressure—“Salt bloomed, then sweetness”—without losing lyric control. No head-hopping; psychic distance stays tight to the diver’s mask.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: every sentence advances image or stakes. No loops or scaffold; metaphors stay coherent within brine/orchard lexicon. Minor register lift in “Conceptual Repricing” is earned by prior salt-cider contrast. Final third is artifact-free, allowing 9-band eligibility.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Underwater fairy-ring mushroom as memory-archive is a fresh synthesis of maritime and folkloric registers. The “tide tax” economy gendered through women’s ledger subverts sailor myth without didacticism. Risk in lyric compression pays off: the apple bite recharges every prior salt image. Specificity makes the concept inseparable from this voice and place.</comment>
