<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The thief's quietly savvy trait and interior contradiction ("late but exactly on time") energize early beats; his micro-choice to crack the jar open anchors causality. Reflection stays anchored to present stimuli and tilts next moves. Mentor’s re-entrance is thin—no bodily change or status shift—so relationship crucible only half-fires. Closure cost (mentor returned to body, thief accepts stewardship) is legible but not foreshadowed by prior flaw or debt, so renunciation feels slightly gift-wrapped rather than wrested.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens: density of light-and-flower imagery reweights the dominant stake from stealing to keeping/returning; final “old craft reinterpreted” supplies Resonant Reconfiguration with conceptual cost. Orientation clear by line 6; transitions (bouquet → freight door) legible via scent-guided path. No meaningful reversals, but deepening pattern tightens once when moonbeams re-animate blank negatives. Cost visible—“You came because you could hear destiny without believing it”—though price is intellectual rather than visceral, keeping score sub-9.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Station, jar, bouquet, and mentor’s hidden room are tactile, lived-in, and supply tactical resources (wire fragment, moonbeam light). Emerald tiles, sycamore turnstile, oil-cold air give multisensory density that tracks across moves. Roof “warned the night but not the moon” is an image that later recharges when jar-light re-opens photos. Setting constrains final choice—only within oil-starred room can negatives be revived—meeting 9+ gate; capped at 8.6 because spatial layout of “freight door → hidden room” shift is compressed into one sentence, blurring geography momentarily.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: can one “own” an illuminated moment without theft? Pressure escalates texturally: bouquet’s warning, disused track, locked door, blank negatives—each layer heightens consequence of mis-use. Protagonist’s agency is reactive until final jar-opening; prior steps follow mentor’s trail rather than force active trade-offs. Cost legible—mentor’s vanishing, thief’s vocation re-defined—but price is off-loaded onto mentor earlier, muting felt stake for narrator during ascent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</question><comment>Theme emerges organically: theft transmuted into custodianship via light that “admits darkness.” Flower grammar and moonbeam jar accrue meaning without authorial commentary. Final line “what I had always stolen” reweights premise, offering Charged Poise rather than tidy moral. Subtext in bouquet’s “voice quavered” suggests transmission loss but never fully explored; slight under-delivery keeps score sub-9.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>First-person voice owns a photographic perceptual signature—light skims, copper threads, silver rails—with rhythmic, controlled lyricism. Syntax compresses under pressure: “I obeyed, counting breaths as the sun thinned to copper threads.” No dialogue, so no convergence risk. Elision (“the station hummed like a heart tuning itself”) is pattern-taught early and paid off at closure. Diction stays within narrator’s sensibility; no filter-verb stacks; voice distinct and sustained.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lyric metaphor density is high but purposeful—the pattern teaches the reader to read light as ethic. Mixed metaphor check: “cold with oil and stars” is physically coherent. No synonym loops; each sentence advances knowledge or image. Minor scaffold: two “pressed” in successive clauses at climax; doesn’t touch closure image. Final two sentences achieve crystalline cadence, fulfilling read-aloud ear test.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fusion of moon-photography, Victorian flower code, and freight-yard noir yields fresh angle on art-as-theft. Light-as-custody concept commits fully; implications followed to end. Risk in dense lyricism heightens coherence rather than obscuring. Lacks singular cultural punch to reach 9+ but remains memorable and specific.</comment>
