<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mara’s understated competence and filial loyalty are vivid; her quiet micro-choices (pocketing the key, humming the shutdown) embody “carefully resourceful” with cost. Interiority stays concrete, never diagnostic. The hinge-line “she would be the hinge, the turn” crystallizes earned identity shift. No contradictory impulse on-page keeps this just shy of 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the lagoon signal is live, captions already “sweating,” Mara’s hum a measured new threshold—cost is the irreversible exposure she welcomes. Causal chain (key → hinge → broadcast) holds without gaps; the puddle-map is taught as mystical but rule-consistent. One soft ellipsis—how the museum circuit actually links—doesn’t break legibility. Lens: Causal, held to final line.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Flooded tram yard, reedy maintenance box, and penny-metal reek are tactile and selective; every described object is handled or stepped through. The lagoon’s “not gold, but seemed to remember gold” reframes both setting and theme in one stroke. Spatial track from archives to shore remains clean; no floating rooms. Micro-setting (the brass key, the sagging cables) constrains access and timing, nudging this into 9-range.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—restoring erased voices—locks in at caption erasure and escalates with each beat: discovery, traversal, broadcast. One meaningful tightening: when moths thicken into “soft bodies that spell… grammar,” the risk of detection becomes visceral, foreclosing retreat. Cost is implicit but legible—once the signal opens, Mara can never again be “harmless.” No reversal, but steady because/therefore rise satisfies causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of memory-as-resistance emerges through circuitry, water, and moth-swarm, never slogan. Final image of “honest edge” reframes earlier “hinge” and “caption” into a single conceptual repricing: history now has two contesting texts. Subtext in guard’s yawn vs. backpack weight efficiently exposes complicity. No moralizing statement—just ripple-letters and a hum—lets ambiguity linger.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays pinned to Mara’s perceptual filter: “smelled of penny metal,” “slightly older, slightly braver.” Syntax grows clipped under pressure—“killed the lights, lowered her voice”—mirroring risk. No head-hop; free indirect slides are clean. Distinctive cadence (folded risk, auric lagoon) is consistent yet never cloying, earning high band.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but propulsive: “a drift of moths swirled around a maintenance box half swallowed by reeds” does three jobs in twelve words. Figurative layering is controlled; only one mixed metaphor (“stitch poised to draw two torn edges”) grazes overreach. No scaffold loops, no filler stacks. Rhythm modulates from long reflective sentences to staccato closure, supporting momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fusing telephone-archives, lagoon circuitry, and erased histories feels fresh; the puddle-map as mnemonic GPS is an inventive twist on psychogeography. Moths-as-alphabet reweights natural detail into insurgent text without forced symbolism. Risk is taken—mystical tech hinge—yet causality and emotional stakes remain coherent. Specificity of “defunct phone company” key and “stained index cards” prevents template drift.</comment>
