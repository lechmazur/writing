<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Protagonist’s softly-adaptive music therapy stance is embodied in every micro-choice (kalimba pulse matched to Ada’s locket tick); interiority stays concrete, conflict is grief vs. willingness to let sound in, and the final low-key lullaby request is credible renunciation of despair. Only nit: “wondering is a form of love” drifts toward therapist aphorism; still, Ada’s tracing the question-mark curl supplies visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single continuous scene under Accumulative/Textural lens; orientation (where/when/who) nailed by sentence 4, eclipse mechanics seeded early, closure is Charged Poise—Ada’s steadier breath and locket return reconfigure grief from isolating weight to shared vibration. Cost is audible: the guitar/locket hum during totality makes silence communal, foreclosing solitary mourning.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Sage ridge courtyard acts as resonant instrument: heat, stone, ravens, crickets, and the dreaming-root tree supply sensory hierarchy that narrows to the locket-on-wood soundboard. Micro-setting (tree-as-stage, body-as-brace) constrains the final musical gesture; no environment swap possible without breaking the acoustic closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake: can shared sound keep Ada’s grief porous? Pressure tightens once moon bite audible → temperature drop → locket passed to strings; Ada’s micro-choice to reclaim it steadied crystallizes the single meaningful turn with felt cost (her whispered request for a lower key).</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from tactile particulars: ordinary magic = noticing acoustic grief become communal resonance. Subtext in gesture—Ada tracing question-mark curl—reweights “question” from pain to ongoing love without moralizing. Final image of “notes closer to the ground” offers earthy, non-literal answer to lifelong wonder prompt.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical first-person voice owns perceptual signature: “ravens write cursive,” “kalimba teeth,” distance calibrated to mellow therapist ear. Compressed diction mirrors musical phrasing; no head-hop, no filter-verb clutter; rhythm accelerates into breath-length sentences at totality then exhales with returning light.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Zero loops, high density: one sentence often does three jobs (sets atmosphere, advances beat, reveals interior). Figurative language internally consistent—moon “patient moth,” shadows “paper cuts”—all propelling rather than decorating. Final line cadence mirrors lullaby descent; no artifact near closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Eclipse-as-acoustic-therapy is fresh synthesis; locket-hair as portable question-mark turns keepsake trope into living motif. Risk of quiet lyric ending paid off by audible cost. If relocated to generic hill, entire acoustic stakes collapse—irreplaceable specificity achieved.</comment>
