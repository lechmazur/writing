<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is embodied and character-specific—“cracked cup” voice, fire-forged hands. Bargained innocence drives every beat; micro-choice to open box with her rewrites his debt. Cost is felt: empty porcelain now lighter than guilt. Voice stays singular; no status shift needed—only two people on stone.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative lens: each image (porcelain click, paper-breath, resin hand) tightens the emotional spring. Closure is Charged Poise—box empty but weighted, path recalibrated under stars. Cost legible in final sentence: “calibrating his steps to the heavens.” Orientation anchored by ridge/town lights within 120 words; no ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Moonlit ridge constrains every move: wind “arrives honest,” stone warms paper, ash field memory. Porcelain box functions as micro-setting—its brittle music against chest dictates cadence. Town lights blink like unopened eyes, mirroring refusal to forget. Final image recalibrates walker to sky—environment recharges stance.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: translate pain into sharable language. Tightening occurs when mother appears—option to retreat or deliver; he stays, box offered. Cost paid: bargain shifts from debt to pathway, fingers still burned. Agency is renunciation of secrecy, not heroic rescue; escalation is emotional density, not event cascade.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from ash and paper: grief’s translatability. No moral stated; final image of empty box reweights “bargained innocence” as ongoing craft. Subtext in silence—she looks at his hands first, not artifact. Resonance: pain becomes legible, never “healed.”</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person lyric, tight psychic distance; perceptual signature—“heat-cracked,” “ash-scented breath”—stays firefighter-specific. Rhythm modulates: long cadence for celestial sweep, staccato for porcelain click. No head-hop; single focalizer throughout. Compression taught early (“steady hush of a man who learned silence”) and paid off in final calibrating step.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or stakes. Metaphors are coherent—porcelain as “small immaculate coffin,” town lights as eyes—no mixed vehicles. Information density high: “paper children breathed their thin, ash-scented breath” carries tactile, olfactory, emotional payload. Read-aloud rhythm varies; final line slows to match star-step calibration.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Familiar trauma-recovery terrain made fresh through firefighter’s professional idiom and porcelain relic. Paper-doll chain rewoven with notepad scrap transforms common sympathy-gift into collaborative ritual. Risk: quiet ending with no grand absolution; coherence held. Specificity of ash field, resin setting, ridge wind prevents template drift.</comment>
