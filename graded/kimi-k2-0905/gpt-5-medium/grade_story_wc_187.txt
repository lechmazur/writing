<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The archivist’s interiority is lyrically specific (“preemptively nostalgic,” “tried on the future’s coat”), and the final micro-choice—offering his own plum memory—turns the archive’s one-way flow into a reciprocal act, earning his inclusion in the collective ledger with visible emotional cost. Earlier beats, however, lean on abstract self-interrogation (“What if I was only a binder?”) rather than embodied contradiction; the turn feels more metaphysical than dramatized under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The piece teaches its accumulative/textural lens early—each donation is a bead on a string—and lands a resonant reconfiguration when the narrator’s personal memory is accepted, reweighting the archive’s rule-set: the cost is the admission that the keeper must also be catalogued. Causality is internal but legible; the only drag is a brief orientation haze around “when fog becomes solid,” yet the metaphor pays off in the final hush.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The stormlit observatory, crystal forecourt, and shifting monolith shadows are not backdrop but instruments: shadow-length literally measures grief’s duration, and the crystal surface returns the narrator’s reflection until he offers an authentic fragment. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true—archivist notices refracted light, not tourist vistas—and the final image of brightened roofs shows environment evolving with internal change, satisfying the 9+ constraint test.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether the archivist can become a contributor, not merely curator—tightens when his own plum memory is demanded; the forecourt’s acceptance bends the shadow toward him, foreclosing eternal spectatorship. Escalation is textural (pattern of offerings) rather than causal reversals, but the final reconfiguration carries felt cost: exposure of a private, pre-loss sweetness to public archive, a visceral price under the chosen lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the inversion of archive and archivist: memory is not hoarded but exchanged, identity sculpted by the courage to donate one’s own fragile particular. Subtext lives in gesture—the chair scraped open by an unseen reader—avoiding overt thesis; the final “I heard my name once” offers a quiet, non-moral resonance that reweights all prior donations as reciprocity rather than collection.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is a sustained lyric signature: compressed syntax (“tidemarked with eras”), meteorological metaphors tied to the narrator’s weather-inked vocation, and rhythmic control that inhales during cataloguing, exhales during self-exposure. No head-hopping; perceptual filter remains consistently that of a curator who tastes atmospheres, and the diction never drifts into academic self-explanation—every abstraction is grounded in sensory archive.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; sentences carry double duty (e.g., “I carried a feather that remembered summers” fuses object, memory, vocation). A few metaphor stacks approach overwriting (“blue blades across the hardened fog”) but pattern is taught early and never obscures causality; no loops or paraphrase clutter the closure beat, and the final line’s monosyllabic click (“I heard my name once”) provides cadence relief.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The conceit of an observatory that archives weathered grief via shadow triangulation is fresh, yet rigorously followed: the world’s logic never breaks, and the emotional turn (archivist must gift his own weather) grows inevitable from the premise. Risk in lyric accumulation is rewarded when the final hush reconfigures meaning without a conventional plot twist; specificity of “sun-warmed plum” keeps the concept from drifting into abstract symbol.</comment>
