<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The survivor-turned-historian stance is vivid; the narrator’s refusal to remain a pawn (“I will travel with the nomadic penumbra”) crystallizes a credible, earned renunciation. Micro-choices—cutting apologies, steadying elbows, surrendering the lantern—embody the benevolent ruthlessness without explanatory labels. Interiority stays concrete: “the real blast braided my lungs with phrases no director could erase” fuses memory and breath. Only the late reveal of the coat-button comet lacks prior seeding, slightly thinning the cost ledger.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the gallery’s “corridor full of legible silence” reweights memory vs. spectacle, cost felt in the vanishing act the narrator embraces. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—echoes, footprints, lantern swings accrue until silence completes the final word. Orientation is taught early: “interregnum,” “whispering gallery,” “chessboard” appear within 60 words, waiving anchor debt. One transition (square rumor → gallery hush) is legible; pattern holds.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The marble rim that “carried voices like a patient river” functions as both acoustic tool and archive; its echo-chamber physics constrain how memory can be written and stolen. The nomadic penumbra—light that walks even when we rest—becomes a migratory environment dictating when sentences can be spelled and when hush must intervene. Lantern, board, and cracked lacquer button evolve in hand, charging the final image. Spatial choreography of walking-letters is tracked cleanly around the single arena.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Central stake: can un-spectacular kindness be archived before the next regime seizes narrative? Pressure tightens as each footstep narrows the available genre of record; the switch from writing “water” to “stay” marks the decisive deepening, foreclosing pure testimony in favor of communal endurance. Cost is paid in bodies: soot-cuffed boy, taped shoes, widow’s button—each pawn-position costs someone their anonymity. No off-stage rescue; the rumoured regency looms but never intervenes, keeping agency inside the gallery.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges as the quiet insurgency of micro-mercies against spectacular history; no character articulates this thesis aloud. Subtext lives in gesture: carrying the lantern handle to warm the next grip reframes gratitude as circuitry, not sentiment. The final silence that completes “hush” is a non-verbal answer to the narrator’s opening desire to “become the historian of small gestures.” Ambiguity persists—readers must decide whether legible silence is victory or erasure—yielding lingering resonance without moral tag.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>First-person voice sustains a lyric, pressurized diction—“luminous absence that refused to be empty”—without violating survivor credibility. Perceptual signature is tactile-acoustic: breath warms lantern metal, marble drinks footfalls, cracks travel like comets; sight is deliberately secondary. Rhythm modulates: long anaphoric “It meant…” clauses mirror queued thirst, then collapse into three-breath hush. No head-hopping; “we” remains a chorus without individuated interiority, consistent with collective record.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies: spondaic stresses (“crack in the lacquer became a comet”) counterpoint the whispered sibilants of hush. Information density high; single sentences fold metaphor, tool, and memory (“taped shoes skidding in rhythm” implies injury, scarcity, synchronization). One mixed metaphor—“border of notice swelling and thinning”—slightly blurs, but recovers under accumulative lens. No loops or scaffold; final image is crisp.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses post-crisis testimony with acoustic graffiti, a fresh angle on memory vs. spectacle. Walking-letters trope is not mere cleverness—it redefines archive as kinetic, vulnerable to regime erasure. Risk is taken in near-total absence of conventional plot, yet coherence holds under textural drive. Button-comet crack refreshes the chessboard without feeling grafted, though its late arrival keeps score just shy of the 9+ gate.</comment>
