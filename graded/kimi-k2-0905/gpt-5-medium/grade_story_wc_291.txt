<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The narrator’s prosopagnosia is more than label: it dictates the entire investigative method—tracing posture, objects, weather instead of faces—so every choice is character-rooted. The final act of sending the painting is a credible renunciation that costs him the physical evidence and exposes his limits to the families, fulfilling earned stasis. Interior contradiction is present—wanting to name yet unable—kept alive through sensory anchoring (ribbon kink, perfume ghost). Micro-choices (pocket nothing, paint absence) reveal hierarchy of values without exposition; no competence fantasy, no tidy emotional algebra.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the blue ribbon reweights the case narrative—Mara may have traded masks to defuse cruelty—creating undeniable social cost (someone else wore her kindness). Lens is Accumulative/Textural: density of objects (ribbon, phone case, perfume) escalates stakes by re-patterning the myth of the fox mask. Orientation locked by line 3 (“the shadowed quarry…”) and held. Cost visible in final image: the bridge-tried-too-late painting forecloses the deputy’s evidentiary chain and the families’ need for a culprit.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The quarry-as-bowl, the rust ladder, the soft ground at the cliff-toe are not backdrop but tactical terrain—each determines where the spear can enter and what surfaces. Weather (mist, cold, sulfurous grief) narrows perception to immediate salvage. The ribbon fragment acts as micro-setting: its kink literally guides thumb and thought back to the bow-knot epistemology. Final canvas charges these objects without faces, so environment and tool conspire in the closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake: can empathy survive evidentiary void? Each object found tightens the question by negating the fox-mask legend. Agency is attention itself—choosing to paint absence—foreclosing the path of facial identification forever. Cost is legible: the families receive forgiveness instead of a perpetrator, a felt price under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the repeated failure to map faces onto guilt; empathy is awakened not by naming villains but by relinquishing the need for one. Subtext in gesture: ribbon twist = invitation to re-knot narrative; refusal to pocket = rejection of evidentiary authority. Final image of bridge-too-late reweights kindness as lethal delay, avoiding moral sermon. Particulars (shelter dogs, stage makeup smear) keep universals anchored.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>First-person lyric interiority never leaks omniscience; perceptual signature—riverbed memory, country-less faces—remains consistent. Syntax lengthens under reflective beats, fragments under tactile discovery (“Lance down—clack”). No dialogue, so voice carries all subtext; diction stays within plausible self-taught artist lexicon. Rhythm mirrors excavation: long silt-sentences, sudden noun-clacks. Experimental compression (“grief also rises when pierced”) is pattern-taught early and paid off in final sulfur exhale.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High information density: one sentence can body, object, and metaphysics (“I threaded it…wanted to twist back into a bow”). No synonym loops; each metaphor is single-use and physically loyal (ribbon ≠ bridge until final canvas). Two mixed-metaphor risks—“spear of rebar,” “ghost of perfume”—read as character’s synesthetic coping, not overwriting. Final third clean of artifacts; closure image crystalline.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: cold-case procedural meets face-blind portraiture, yielding an epistemology of objects. Risk of lyric ellipsis accepted and paid off when closure reweights the ribbon color swap as moral pivot. No prior template matches this convergence; empathy as investigative tool rather than moral garnish. Specificity—shelter cedar scent, deputy’s “lance the silt” directive—anchors universals.</comment>
