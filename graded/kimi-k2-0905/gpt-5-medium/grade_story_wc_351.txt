<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The helix-minded engineer’s contradictory impulses—precision vs. chaos—are dramatized in every micro-choice (mirror tilts, circuit edits). Interiority stays concrete: “chest tightened with the calm panic of recognition.” The final renunciation—tucking the shards and walking on—pays the cost of accepting impermanence, earned by the prior pulses that literally fractured the tool and the self.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each mirror pulse layers density until the final seam opens. Closure is a Charged Poise—“wider field of view” after the mirror splits—cost is the irreversible break of both artifact and observer. Orientation is taught early via the swinging “wounded compass,” waiving any anchor penalty. Causality is internal but legible: because he keeps refracting, the canyon answers.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The canyon’s mica and limestone shelf constrain every calibration; the mirror’s fracture lines literally route the light beams that summon memory. Body-as-setting is equally precise: “quaking reverie” underfoot, “calm panic” in the ribcage. Final image—“every step a careful improvisation”—reconfigures the gorge as a live score, not backdrop.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—can he extract abandoned dreams without erasing himself—tightens with each pulse: first a stranger greets him, then the colleague appears wearing his own future. The third pulse forces the trade-off: keep excavating and the mirror (and self) splits. Cost is visible on-page when he pockets the shards and accepts a “wider field of view” at the price of total fragmentation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme—memory as stratified sediment that can be reread but never fully possessed—emerges through iterated refraction rather than statement. The broken mirror reweights from tool to choir to wound, ending as map. No moralizing; the final “tending the seams” is an embodied answer to the implicit question of how to live after industry and identity collapse.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>First-person spiral voice is inimitable: “I think in spirals, revisiting every assumption from a slightly shifted altitude.” Syntax coils and elongates, mirroring the helix motif without ever losing clarity. No head-hop; perceptual signature stays consistent even under synaptic-light bursts. Compression like “visible silence” teaches the reader the lyric pattern early and pays it off in the final “seam where cold air threaded like memory.”</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or pressure. Figurative layering is high but purposeful—mirror as “wounded compass,” canyon as “lung relearning breath”—and never muddies causality. Rhythm accelerates with the quake, then exhales into the final line. No filter-verb stacks; verbs stay muscular (“tilted,” “etched,” “braided,” “tucked”).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>The conceit—archaeology via fractured periscope that diffracts collective forgetting—is sui generis. Risky second-person hallucination of the colleague lands because the mirror entanglement has been physically seeded. Final grace-note—accepting the split instead of repairing it—flips the typical redemption arc. Specificity of copper traces fossilized in silvered glass makes the metaphor materially irreplicable.</comment>
