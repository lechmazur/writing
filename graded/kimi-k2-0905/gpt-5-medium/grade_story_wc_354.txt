<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The tutor’s exile-guilt and pedagogic drive are credibly knotted; the choice to surrender the basalt king carries a felt cost. Interiority is concrete (“chess is the art of what goes unsaid”), but the emotional crescendo leans on lyrical paraphrase rather than a final contradictory impulse in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the covenant is re-negotiated through the endgame, not by silencing but by teaching restraint. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—field hum and pauses tighten until the quiet chord—but the price is more atmospheric than bodily, keeping it shy of 8.8.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The magnetic valley is rendered with spare, sense-tuned strokes that steer action: the hum guides moves, the hollow accepts the stone, the diagonals soften. Micro-setting fulfills 9+ gate: the nexus as board-border constrains the tutor’s final gift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore beauty without erasure—tightens once when the tutor offers the impossible endgame instead of silence; agency is legible, cost is conceptual (exile risk). Escalation is a single deepening, sufficient for length, but lacks a tangible forfeiture on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as “quiet is a move held back until it ripens,” grown through tactile particulars rather than statement. The re-weighted covenant and the girl’s silent smile invite counter-readings without moralizing, delivering a resonant aftertaste.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>First-person voice is lyric, compressed, rhythm-controlled; perceptual signature is strong (“counting rain by its absences”). No head-hop; elision pattern taught early and paid off in the final quiet chord.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Lines are dense, rhythmic, mostly propulsive; occasional metaphor stacking (“orange hush,” “magnetic nexus heartbeat”) flirts with overwrite but stays within pattern. No loops, clean grammar; final image lands clear.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fusing exile-chess tutor with geomagnetic covenant feels inevitable yet un-familiar; the endgame-as-silence-reform is a fresh synthesis. Risk in lyric compression heightens coherence without obscuring closure.</comment>
