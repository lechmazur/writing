<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The druid’s guarded calm is vividly embodied in micro-choices—crouching, spine rising like a mast, treaty whispered to the seed—showing internal contradiction between warlike serenity and unmilitant unbending. Motivation stays anchored in recovering truth for self, not town, supplying credible moral ambiguity. Interiority is specific, never therapeutic; cost is visible when he pockets the coin as receipt, foreclosing trophy-taking. Flaws (professional detachment) complicate the final moment of listening, earning the shift without tidy redemption.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the mayor breathes the spoken truth, the seed spent, circles calm—an on-page restraint that forecloses spectacle and carries felt cost (the druid’s heart “unbends one unmilitant notch”). Causal lens holds throughout: each expanding circle narrows options until the seed’s bite removes the lie and leaves bare truth. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) surface within first 120 words via “we arrive,” raft, pier, night. No teleporting props; the coin receipt is introduced and paid off in final image, satisfying set-up.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The swirling orchard-vortex is not backdrop but tactical obstacle: raft angles against its current, branches drop fog only after truth is hauled. Sensory hierarchy obeys druid bias—sound of creaks, cold thread tug, taste of static—rather than tourist catalog. Spatial choreography is immaculate: raft, gunwale, pouch, lantern, mayor onshore track without drift. Micro-setting objects (bone whistles, kelp lines, seed) constrain method and final image; coin in pocket recharges earlier “receipt” motif, gating 9+.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—retrieve frozen confession—tightens when eighth circle snags the cold thread, forcing the druid to angle raft into lake belly; denial is physically chewed away, narrowing options. Escalation is causal under lens: each circle because/therefore approaches truth; seed’s bloom is irreversible act that removes lie, leaving only payable cost. Price is visible on-page: mayor’s tremble, druid’s pocketed coin, spent seed. No off-stage rescue; spectacle dissolves by protagonist’s refusal to grandstand, earning quiet but legible cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme—truth as organic, consumable, and costly—emerges from image chain: confession crystallized into hooks, seed that eats only lies, orchard releasing fog once fed. No explicit moralizing; final image of quiet pier with mirrors turned face-down reweights earlier spectacle motif into renunciation. Subtext in mayor’s glassed eyes and druid’s coin receipt invites reflection on price of witnessing versus performing. Ambiguity lingers: crowd steps forward “to listen,” not cheer—truth neither triumphant nor safe.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Voice is perceptual signature: druid’s noticing filtered through tactical calm—light swallowed, orchard creaks like armored shoulders, confession thawing “like a wound bandaged by cold.” Rhythm modulates with pressure: long clauses spiral during descent, then short beats at haul and breathe. No head-hopping; POV distance stays tight to guarded stance. Non-standard metaphor engine (“apples orbit like moons”) is consistent, taught early, paid off when they settle into “ordinary halos.” Dialogue absent by design; free indirect thought remains clean.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: single sentences twin job—map current and reveal character (“circles widen from my raft and touch each spinning tree”). Metaphor layer is high but patterned, coherent (lake as pupil, hooks as crystallized speech), never muddled; no mixed vehicles. Zero loops, scaffold, or filter-verb stacks; noun/verb muscle strong. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves via image that recharges “circles widen and stay calm after battle.” Minor compression in “radio hush of words” approaches edge but remains legible under lyric lens.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: noir detective beats transposed onto eco-fantasy—druid as gumshoe, seed as lie-detector, lake as interrogation room. Orbiting apples and confession-hooks are particular to this world; trope inversion feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk in lyric compression succeeds: reader taught orchard-vortex rules by 25% mark, closure legible. No derivative premise drag; magical noir not reduced to gimmick because emotional cost (mayor trembles, druid pockets coin) grounds innovation. Conceptual integrity intact; spectacle refused, serenity chosen, lake calmed.</comment>
