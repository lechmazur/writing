<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The clairvoyant’s interiority is vivid—“I did not see it coming” is a lived contradiction—but her final hand-stray is more image than crucible; no clear hierarchy of values is forced to a cost on the page. The pilgrim’s shift from baker to bearer is embodied through scent and laughter, yet his kneeling choice is not tested by a forfeiture we feel. The relationship alters, but the guide’s stake is told more than enacted under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the pearl offered up reconfigures meaning with undeniable pressure—“walls begin to inhabit themselves with echoes of bread lines”—and the cost is the guide’s obsolescence, felt in her falling behind. Causality holds under an Accumulative lens: music densifies, pattern breaks, stakes reweight. One scaffold loop—“overlapping shadows” thrice in four sentences—barely keeps it from 9.0.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The cave is not backdrop but instrument: crystal ribs ring when we breathe, salt scale tastes on the tongue, and the final tonal birth is inseparable from the pearl’s lift. Environment actively constrains—sound paths, breathable dark—and charges the final image. Spatial choreography is immaculate; bodies drift ahead of themselves, distances tracked by echo. No other setting could host this exact shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—who may carry the wonder outward—tightens once: the guide’s prophecy veto versus the baker’s open palm. The pearl’s roll is the visible turn that forecloses her path; cost is legible in her emptied certainty. Pressure accrues sonically rather than through new reversals; one meaningful deepening suffices, but a second tightening would lift it higher.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges without sermon: everyday miracles (proofing loaves, dish clatter) displace heroic conquest. Final image—music as woven dusk—offers a non-literal answer to “what is bright darkness?” Earlier sonic motifs reweighted in the closing chord. Resists tidy moral; ambiguity lingers in the guide’s eclipse.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is lyric-ornate yet controlled; syntax lengthens and compresses with breath mimicry. Perceptual signature—“bright darkness, the color of listening”—is character-specific and unprecious. No head-hop; pilgrim’s voice enters only via reported murmur, keeping focalization pure. Minor filter-verb cluster in one sentence keeps it shy of 9.0.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm is musical; sentence length varies from crystalline fragments to winding clauses that echo drip-time. Metaphors stay internally coherent—“choir of rock inhales”—and serve dual duty (sound + body). One paraphrase loop costs −0.2. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image that recharges earlier motifs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Premise—“baker sent to retrieve magic pearl ends up hosting it in communal offering”—is non-obvious synthesis of kitchen and myth. Fresh inflection: yeast-scent as catalyst for artifact activation feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk in lyric accumulative structure heightens resonance without obscuring closure. Slight over-reliance on “music = breath” trope keeps it from 9.0.</comment>
