<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The narrator’s quiet obsession with “what clocks really measure” drives every micro-choice; the wound-and-key beat embodies contradictory impulses (tenderness vs. heresy) and prints a literal cost on the object. Interiority stays concrete—“I pressed the wound to the key”—never abstract, and the final renunciation of correction is earned by the prior valve-tweaking and backward counting. Voice remains singular, not stock; no diagnostic self-talk. The grandmother memory is anchored in present stimuli and alters stance, satisfying BRR.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each drip-lag tightens options until the protagonist chooses to label the lag a “boundary event” rather than error, a decisive change with felt cost (blood on key, foregone overtime). Orientation is anchored by line 3; no teleporting props. Closure lands on the page—“wrote a note…should remain uncorrected”—with persistent constraint: the station now floats on un-corrected time. No outline-and-then sequencing; every beat is because/therefore.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fjord-flat water and razor-edged gauge needles are not backdrop; they physically guide the protagonist’s crab-like caution and nick his skin, charging the final image. The mantle key and bleeding knuckle act as micro-setting that constrains the closing choice. Sensory hierarchy obeys night-watch priorities: sound of drip, salt-frost on rail, cold brass. Spatial choreography is immaculate—Basin Three, catwalk, recorder window—no floating rooms.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“what clocks really measure” under solitude—tightens when the drip lags and the needle refuses obedience. Protagonist’s agency: quarter-turn of key, backward count, final refusal to correct; each action narrows options and raises cost (blood, risk of being found out). No coincidence; pressure is coherent, internal-external. Price is visible and alters tactics: the cut finger becomes the timing device itself.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the concrete: time as the bleed-point where surfaces split, not as duration. Subtext lives in gesture—key pressed to wound—without sloganizing. Final image of “edge of what came next” reweights prior material without moral. No echo of prompt language; insight is earned through tactile ordeal. Ambiguity lingers: is un-corrected time truer?—invites counter-readings.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>First-person perceptual signature is relentless: “fjord quiet, like breath held by mountains,” “gull-bone needles,” “tidepool crab” motion—diction stays within a night-engineer’s poetic reach. Rhythm tightens under stress: short clauses mirror drip-counting. No filter-verb stacks; syntax reflects mounting caution. Voice coherence survives lyric compression; elision (“a quarter breath”) is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; sentences do multiple jobs—“I reset the basins and wrote a note” advances plot, signals cost, and prepares closure. Metaphors stay physically coherent; no mixed vehicles. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and image. Micro-typo-free, strong verbs, no thesaurus-itis. Final third is artifact-free, allowing 9+ eligibility.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Hydraulic water-clock station on a fjord is a fresh, non-obvious frame; the profession of “clock shepherd” feels invented yet lived-in. Transformation test: story would collapse without drip-pressure logic and key-blood fusion. Takes the risk of lyric stillness rather than external plot, and coherence holds. Slight proximity to maritime-gothic tropes keeps it from 9.0+ uniqueness, but angle is sufficiently reconfigured.</comment>
