<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The father’s ache is visceral—clutching the unopened tin, knotting the ribbon into the graft—every beat tying competence to cowardice. Mira’s “dropped-marble” laugh and shove externalize the emotional pivot so the orchard’s release feels like family re-knotted. Quartz eye, pruning hook, and psalter all serve as embodied proxies for parental tools the narrator fears failing with. Cost lands when he leaves the tin shut: renunciation earns the bridge he fashions.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative lens: each micro-beat (ribbon touch, bell-ring, vow-shed) layers density until the final “readable rustle” re-weights the broken contract. Causality holds: breach → thickened vows → ritual pruning → breathable orchard; no off-stage fixes. Orientation is complete before 120 w; space stays coherent from choir loft to ribbed canopy. Closure is a Charged Poise: bell still swaying, tin unopened, cost—father must keep waiting—is explicit in the image.</comment>

<comment>Cathedral timbers, suspended roots, and fruit weight work as environmental antagonists, dictating where the narrator can safely climb and splice. Peach scent and creaking wood tether memory to present danger, so every pruning cut risks structural collapse. Spatial choreography is flawless: we track boots on loft, ladder to ribs, ribbon up to bell-rope, graft at the union. Setting finally exhales with the orchard, mirroring the man’s unclenched grief.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: restart the vow-shedding or lose both orchard and chance at generational repair. Mid-text tightening arrives when the ribbon knot must either snap (failure) or take graft (possible reunion), narrowing outcomes. Protagonist’s every cut raises stakes—bad pruning could drop fruit on Mira or snap rafters. Price is legible: he forfeits immediate reconciliation (tin stays sealed) to earn breathable future space.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of letting go versus holding on emerges through arboreal metaphor without sermon. Accreted images—ribbon as graft, bell as throat, rustle as text—reconfigure “contract” from legal to living covenant. Final “economy of gifts the books cannot tally” conceptually re-prices value, refusing moral tagline. Ambiguity remains: orchard breathes, daughter absent; complexity earned.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>First-person voice fuses technical precision (“stress lines through the rafters”) with tender synesthesia (“quartz eye refracted…rainbows”). Prose rhythm mimics carpentry: measured clauses, then release in short, breathy fragments during bell-ring. Perceptual signature—tools seen via flaws (nicked hook, cracked vial)—grounds competence in regret. No head-hop; Mira’s interior stays opaque yet her dialogue cadence contrasts credibly.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Figurative density is high but pattern-taught early (“branches arched like ribs”) and paid off at climax, so no penalty. Strong verbs dominate: “sap slurred,” “fruit lifted,” “bell took the ribbon’s color.” Occasional stacked epithets (“lush orchard spanning the rafters”) verge on purple yet serve atmospheric pressure. Zero paraphrase loops, clean grammar, precise spatial tracking.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Reverse arable cathedral is fresh, but deeper novelty lies in treating vows as literal biomass that must be pruned or it smothers. Combining parental grief with arboreal surgery externalizes emotional stakes inside a living truss—specific, irreplicable. Risk of sentimental father–child trope is averted by refusal to open tin; closure chooses charged stillness over reunion melodrama. Image of graft union tied with daughter’s ribbon feels inevitable yet unforeseen.</comment>
