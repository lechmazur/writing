<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The violinist’s motive—”to unbind the silence” and “find beauty in the unfinished”—is concrete, embodied, and drives every micro-choice from lantern placement to the final gift of the shell. Interiority stays sensory (“barnacles hold their breath”) rather than diagnostic, and the renunciation of finished songs carries visible cost as the bow nods “like a patient bird.” Relationships (Lark, elders) function as crucible: the marble/shell swap alters their mutual state. Only the mother-map backstory is briefly summarized; it still tilts the present choice, so the slight tell is forgiven.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each added object in the bowl thickens the texture until the final “map drawing itself” reweights meaning. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land by line 5; the greenhouse’s sunken logic is taught early and pays off when tide breath rattles the ribs of glass. Closure is a Charged Poise: the footprints left on the greenhouse steps crystallize the communal stance—unfinished song as ongoing path—with felt cost (the hush “loosens one more braid”). No causality breaks; even the off-screen rainforest burn is accepted as inherited constraint.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The greenhouse-shipwreck chimera is not backdrop but tactical resource: rusted hulls police the wind, brackish light dictates which roots drink, the tide literally opens the door to the final breath. The mendicant bowl serves as micro-setting whose shifting contents (marble, shell, seed) constrain each micro-choice of what to keep or gift. Sensory hierarchy obeys the violinist’s ear—quiet is heard before it is seen. Spatial choreography is immaculate: bodies orbit the bowl, tide laps exact steps, no impossible positions.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“will the hush yield to shared unfinished song?”—tightens as each object dropped into the bowl increases communal obligation. The single reversal is the tide pulling doors ajar: passive event reframed as invitation that forces the stance crystallization. Cost is visible: the violinist relinquishes the marble (keeps shell) and accepts “gentle obligations” that will require return visits. Pressure stays coherent under Accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves the conflict—only the collective decision to follow the footprints.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete particular: unfinished song = survival strategy after ecological grief. No character articulates thesis; the final footprints are the non-literal answer. Subtext lives in object exchange—shell for marble = auditory for tactile, both incomplete yet sufficient. Magnificent simplicity is the stance: embrace partialness without romanticizing it, scored through restrained diction that resists sermon.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>First-person lyric voice owns a perceptual signature attuned to acoustic micro-difference: “smoke learned to sink,” “apples bloom white scars.” Rhythm modulates with pressure—long threnodic sentences for hush, staccato Q&A with Lark for lift. No head-hop; diction stays within the itinerant musician’s lexicon. Dialogue is minimal yet distinct: Lark’s questions ring child-direct, violinist’s replies carry metronomic patience.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm: varied sentence ingress, no template cadence, paragraphs visually breathe. Information density high—each image carries twin duty (e.g., “rusted flanks like hedges” fuses shipwreck with garden). Zero paraphrase loops; no mixed metaphors. Figurative language retreats in the climax, letting the tide-click of shell-coin-seed carry the beat—disciplined restraint that magnifies final image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Premise—post-climate-collapse underwater orchard concert—feels inevitable once read, yet nowhere clichéd. Transformation of familiar eco-ruin tropes occurs through acoustic metaphors and gift-economy objects. Risk of lyric obscurity is taken but paid off when tide breath becomes legible closure. Synthesis of musicology, maritime decay, and oral memory is fresh, not grafted.</comment>
