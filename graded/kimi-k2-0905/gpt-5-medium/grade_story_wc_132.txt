<question>1</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Mara’s interior contradiction—command reflex vs. listening surrender—runs through every beat and is paid for in the final renunciation. Embodied emotion is precise: “the linden leaf crisped to a memory of wind.” Micro-choices (knotting vines, stepping aside) externalize the arc with visible cost. No therapy-speak; flaws persist and bless the ending.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: “I will learn to take apart my certainty…” reconfigures prior stakes under Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality is lyric-elliptical yet coherent; each storm gust deepens the pattern until the final image crystallizes options with undeniable cost. Pattern taught early (dripping trellis) and paid off at close. No orientation debt; anchors clear by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The mossy trellis functions as micro-setting that literally supports the final vow; rain-drenched linden leaf constrains her palm and recharges the ending. Sensory selection is POV-filtered and urgent: “droplets clung like second thoughts.” Spatial choreography (ivy braiding hop) tracks cleanly. Weather affects every tactical choice; no static catalogue.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—control vs. listening—tightens through each gust and loosened knot. Agency is renunciation rather than conquest; the final trellis vow forecloses the old gardener identity with felt cost. Escalation is accretive, not causal-turn, but density increase reweights options legitimately under Accumulative lens. No coincidence; weather complicates, Mara adapts.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.7</question><comment>Theme emerges from specific particulars: every plant refusal rewrites the human rule-set. Subtext operates in gesture—signing the treaty by stepping aside—never exposition. Final image reweights premise without moral: certainty disassembled, kindness the only reconstruction. No thematic echo; silence after the vow carries conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is botanist-poetic: roots thinking, rain telling truth slowly. Syntax mimics slow patience—circuitous cadence that mirrors sincerity trait. Compression taught early (“circuitously sincere”) and sustained. No head-hopping; distance stays intimate yet lyrical. Dialogue sparse but subtextual; boy’s linden question crystallizes stakes.</question>

<question>7</question><grade>9.4</question><comment>High density: one sentence often does three jobs (image, emotion, causality). Rhythm breathes with storm cadence; paragraph cuts land on micro-turns. Zero loops or scaffold; no synonym churn. Metaphors stay vegetal and coherent. Register remains within Mara’s lexicon; no filter-verb stacks. Final line is propulsive yet quiet—perfect cadence hinge.</question>

<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: botany as epistemology of surrender. Reluctant metamorphosis rendered through vegetal treaty-making rather than human melodrama. Linden leaf reprises with reweighted meaning—memory of wind becoming method. Risk in lyric ellipsis pays off: closure legible without forced confrontation. Conceptual integrity holds; no retreat to gardener heroism.</question>
