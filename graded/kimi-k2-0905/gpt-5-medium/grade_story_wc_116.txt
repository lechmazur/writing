<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The keeper’s interiority is lyrically rendered but stays largely static; no contradictory impulse is dramatized on-page, so the final “I witness” is a restatement, not a costly renunciation. Micro-choices (folding the swan, pressing the wall) serve navigation, not moral pressure, so agency feels ornamental. The oath is declared repeatedly yet never tested by a moment that would force its violation or costly reaffirmance. Result: credible atmosphere, but no visible hierarchy of values under strain.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The piece lands a Conceptual Repricing at the end: “regenerative silence renews me as it repairs the fragile world” reweights the premise with ecological cost. Causality, however, is loose-associative (Accumulative/Textural lens); the flood’s retreat and the wall’s sigh hinge on off-page magic rather than keeper choice, softening the felt price. Disorientation is deliberate and waived, yet closure still depends on imagery of self-renewal rather than a visible forfeiture. Satisfies closure gate with cost, but causal chain remains atmospheric, not tactical.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Library-catacombs, obsidian cellar, origami swan, and river-amphitheater are tactile, odor-rich, and sonically alive; each object is handled, not catalogued. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly: the swan’s creases steer literal footfalls, the obsidian shelves hum under touch, and the bricked niche yields to shoulder pressure, all grounding the lyric shifts. Sensory hierarchy mirrors keeper’s archivist bias—ink, mulch, mildew—never drifting into tourist catalogue. Final image of “flakes of mortar seasoning my tea” fuses setting with bodily intake, charging the closing beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“witness without judgment”—is declared early and holds, but pressure never tightens; flood, alphabet rearrangement, and wall-collapse occur off-page or are absorbed without trade-off. No moment forces the keeper to risk complicity or partiality, so the oath remains untested. Escalation is textural (density of decay images) rather than option-narrowing; agency is observational. Cost is ecological and conceptual, not personal, keeping tension atmospheric, not tactical.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of passive stewardship emerges organically through compost metaphors and bibliophagic decay; no explicit moral is stated. The final image recalibrates the premise: silence as regenerative glue re-weights earlier “crumbling peace” from entropy to vital cycle. Ambiguity lingers—renewal may erase memory—creating honest complexity. Wisely avoids sermon; insight arises from concrete fungal alphabets and tea-seasoned mortar.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Archivist-register diction (“indices,” “silted histories,” “regenerative silence”) stays within a believable lexicon for a solitary keeper. Syntax lengthens and contracts with tidal rhythm, taught early and paid off in flood retreat. Perceptual signature is insistently haptic—ink ferments, spines knit, gravel clicks—no filter-verb stacks. No dialogue, so voice coherence is total; occasional elevated coinages (“bibliophagic”) read as keeper’s private taxonomy, not leakage.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lyric density is high but patterned; metaphor strings (“roots write footnotes,” “pollen on forgotten names”) teach their own grammar and avoid clutter at climax. No paraphrase loops or template cadence; each sentence layer-adds (sound, smell, tactility). Occasional abstraction (“time forgets its edges”) is earned by surrounding concreteness. Minor register drift into “regenerative silence” as technical coinage is justified by conceptual payoff at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Combines archive-catacombs, origami-map, and self-healing silence into a fresh stewardship myth; none of the tropes arrive in expected form. Regenerative silence as literal repair mechanism (books knitting, mildew surrendering hunger) feels newly functional rather than metaphoric ornament. Risk-taking—absent antagonist, observational arc—pays off by making passivity the contested stance. Synthesis achieves inevitability: decay-as-nutrient logic is seeded in first paragraph and blooms in final tea sip.</comment>
