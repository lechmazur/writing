<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interiority is rich and embodied (“the distance that teaches our shores to speak”); the cartographer remains slightly abstract, but the dancer’s contradictions—exile as home, silence as music—are lived in scene. Final “shoulder-sky” oath crystallizes an earned renunciation whose cost is felt. A hairline slip: the partner’s interior is ventriloquised once (“trembling like a string”) without dramatized access.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens taught early via tide-and-gap motif; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—exile tilts into vocation under obsidian grace, cost legible in “I would walk the coast again” foregone safety. Orientation anchors within 120 words: littoral city, nostalgia ban, twilight garden. One micro-turn: moonstone shift from contraband to nib. No因果 reversal is required; pattern break at “basin’s moon trembled” deepens stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Body-as-setting (“shoulder became a sky”) and moonstone-as-micro-setting constrain every stroke of the verse; garden’s scent-shadow registry-free status enables the crime. Spatial choreography clean: basin, shoulder, cloth, forehead press track without drift. Sensory economy vivid (“petals hear vows without reporting them”) yet never stalls momentum. Environment reconfigures at end into “harbor of a shoulder,” charging closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—illicit memory vs. erasure—tightens when each dot forecloses retreat; visible price is patrol risk tomorrow. No antagonist needed; pressure is legislative ocean. One deepening: silence between dots becomes legible line—knowledge changes, options narrow. Cost paid on-page: dancer commits to permanent exile/clandestine life; cartographer bears visible mark patrols may read.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete particulars: erased coastlines, unreadable shoulders, moons that refuse to rise. Final image reweights “garden listening when stars grow tired of being named” into Conceptual Repricing—naming itself is colonial violence. No moral stated; resonance lives in hush that replaces archive. Subtext of cartography-as-intimacy threaded through “maps storms more tenderly than borders.”</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>First-person tide-dancer voice sustains lyric compression without collapsing into monotony; syntax mirrors tidal surge (“pivot on wet stone makes meaning”). Diction stays within dancer’s poetic lexicon; no academic register drift. Patterned repetition taught early (“between lantern gnats, between leaf and star”) paid off in final “between crest and crash.”</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High information density: single sentence carries image, motion, theme (“I am spontaneously anchored… between crest and crash”). No loops or scaffold; metaphors internally consistent (tide/music/ink). Rhythm accelerates at verse-penning then slackens into earned hush. One near-purple line muted by context: “lunar habits honed by centuries of polishing cold light” reads as character-true excess.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Freshens familiar dystopia-of-memory by fusing tide choreography with tattoo astronomy; moonstone dust as ink is non-obvious and inevitable in hindsight. Risk of lyric overload held in check by concrete coastal physics. “Obsidian grace” as tone-state is newly coined yet instantly legible. Transformation test: swap any element—garden, tide, dot—and story collapses.</comment>
