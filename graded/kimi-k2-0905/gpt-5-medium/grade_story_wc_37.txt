<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The “memory keeper” is vividly interiorized—her warped self-image (“my own seams never fully held”), her tactile rituals (swaddling grafts with spider-silk), and her growing integration (“my scattered selves gather like swallows”) track a credible arc. Flaws complicate action: she doubts, over-reaches, and finally shares scars. No contradictory impulses are staged in a single beat, so the 9+ gate is missed, but the endurance-poise at the end carries visible cost and is earned.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a luminous Resonant Reconfiguration: the loom-window slides its woven dawn into the orchard, night negotiates new boundaries, and the protagonist accepts perpetual co-existence with her scarred twin. Causality is lyric-accumulative (threads = voices), yet every escalation is linked to her micro-choices (asking pomegranates, harvesting sighs). Cost is palpable: she forfeits sole ownership of memory and dawn. One sentence could be clearer on ledger omission, but the image of shared scars lands undeniable weight.</comment>

<comment>The greenhouse-night constrains every tactic: trees distil regrets, shadows braid sap, and the mica window literally becomes the loom—environment shapes the climax. Sensory economy is exact: “wet with patient stars,” “waxy laughter still sticky.” Spatial choreography holds as communities lean in, names soften on the hem. The mirror-world’s thinning light is the felt clock that forces the weaving. 9+ gate met.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“rekindle a dying realm” via communal song-threads—tightens when mornings are declared absent and the window-loom must be invented. Each harvest of voices (beekeepers, midwives) escalates risk of failure; the final pull is a decisive stance crystallization with communal cost: shared ownership of dawn. Agency remains protagonist-driven; no coincidence resolves. A hairline dip because the ledger omission beat is abstract, not viscerally tested.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: community trauma can be transmuted into collective light only if individuals surrender sole authorship of memory. Subtext lives in gesture—scarred twin’s nod, names softened on fabric—never in sermon. Final image of “we drink, mirror answers” reweights premise without moralizing. The refusal to purge night honors moral ambiguity. No motif is token; each thread re-codes prior grievance into warning color.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Voice is crystalline, compressed, mythic yet sensorily grounded: “taste of iron on memory,” “hush like skirts.” Syntax mirrors tidal breathing—long anaphoric accumulations (“I splice… I harvest…”) that break into single-line release. Perceptual signature is consistent: the keeper notices ferment, stickiness, braid-patterns. No head-hop; twin’s interior is only inferred. Register stays within lyric-folkloric lexicon without purple drift. Rhythm accelerates with loom-pull, then exhales—taught pattern paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentence muscle is exceptional: high density, triple-duty lines (“seeds winked approval, ferrying me toward the nursery”). Metaphors are internally coherent (alchemy ≡ memory distillation) and never mixed. One scaffold flicker: “bound release” is repeated concept-label; still, it accrues new tonal layers each time. No loops or synonym churn; no figurative muddle in climax. Minor participle opener cluster mid-story keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>Fusion of alchemical orchard + communal loom-dawn is sui generis; trope of saving realm is re-encrypted through textile-photosynthetic logic. Specificity is non-portable: pomegranate lullabies, mica shuttles, ledger of breath. Risk in second-person mirror twin pays off: shared-scar covenant deepens rather than complicates. Conceptual integrity absolute—world rules (regrets → fruit, window → loom) are followed to final sentence. Fresh inflection: dawn as negotiated textile, not conquest.</comment>
