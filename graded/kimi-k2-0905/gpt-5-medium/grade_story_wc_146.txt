<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The tuner’s quiet, embodied patience and the mother’s wary-to-willing shift are cleanly dramatized through gait and breath; the children laugh on cue yet feel real. Interior contradiction is light—he never doubts—so the arc is collective, not personal, but motives stay legible and the final “practice” choice costs everyone tomorrow’s time.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: sandal-scuffs, cistern sighs, and window latches braid into a cadence shift that reweights silence into shared rhythm; closure is the Earned Stasis of ongoing “practice” whose cost is the winter they must keep walking. Causality is lyric, not sequential, yet the before/after is unmistakable once the bell offers its “hand.”</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Cobblestone micro-topography, bronze hairline crack, and fork-against-stone vibration give tactile constraints; the archway’s throat-clearing and the cistern’s breath integrate setting into action. Weather stays off-stage, but spatial choreography is clear and the fork-as-micro-setting charges the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restoring shared balance—tightens through rhythmic entrainment: each paced measure forecloses abandonment and makes remaining cost time/seasons. No antagonist, but the dissonance inside stone and marriage is pressured until the bell’s soft chord reweights options; price is legible in the mother’s trembling story and the winter they must now keep time.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from gait and resonance: community is a practiced cadence, not a decree. Subtext lives in unlatched shutters and thyme-scented air returning—no moral spoken. The final image of “feet” answers the opening “wild hush” without abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays close to the tuner’s perceptual bias—soundless fork, dusk-drinking ebony, metronome bones—syntax lengthens and contracts with footfall rhythm. No head-hop; diction remains archaic-tinged yet precise, and the final paragraph’s cadence mirrors the restored bell-wave.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sentences do double duty (sound, motion, memory) and vary in length; only one soft loop (“each measure…each turn”) but it serves incantatory beat. Metaphors stay coherent—fork as blackbird, town as echo—without purple drift; high density sustains momentum to the quiet final line.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The “revival by walking the measure” reframes ghost-town tropes through acoustic restoration rather than economic or romantic saviors; the ebony fork and foot-rhythm method feel singular, not symbolic check-boxes. Risk is quiet—no villain, no apocalypse—yet specificity makes the synthesis fresh and inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
