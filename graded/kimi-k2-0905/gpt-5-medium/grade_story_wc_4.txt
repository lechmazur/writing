<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The archivist’s calm is shown through steady micro-choices—threading ribbon, steadying the mayor—but the interior contradiction between public poise and private tremble is only asserted, never lived in a single beat; still, the final mirror moment lets us feel the cost of that performance, so the arc lands.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the mirrored case reconfigures grief into shared ownership, the cost is the unspoken future labor they now owe the corridor; the Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each added ribbon tightens pattern, not plot—though the “word-each” beat arrives late and slightly dilutes the final density.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lavender rows and cooling diesel ghosts constrain where photos can be placed, so setting actively shapes the memory corridor; factory ribs and bees supply tactile, evolving stakes, but the spatial track of who stands where inside the circle blurs twice, keeping it from top band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—collective healing—tightens when each story-thread narrows the possible shape of the corridor; the mayor’s joke marks a micro-turn that proves pressure has peaked, and the final word-offering forecloses passive grief, but no single visible price is paid by the narrator, so cost is collective, not personal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the shifting use of humble objects: ribbon from archive tool to binding spell, photographs from static past to walkable future; the final corridor-as-river image reweights “masterpiece” as shared maintenance, not artifact—no moral is stated, yet the conceptual cost is unmistakable.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>First-person voice carries a consistent perceptual signature—smells as paradox, time as spool—tight psychic distance maintained; compressed lyric syntax is taught in line one and paid off in the final mirrored sunset, no head-hop or register drift under emotional peak.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Rhythm modulates from long breath-piece sentences to clipped imperative beats (“We test the route…”) without mechanical pattern; figurative layering is dense but purposeful, each metaphor (bees as punctuation, vines as climbing ideas) services the accumulative design—no mixed vehicles, no loops, no scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Collective cartography of grief via textile and photograph feels genre-fresh; the mirror-bottom case twist is foreshadowed by “swallowed a small future,” making the reconfiguration inevitable yet surprising, not gimmick. Risk in lyric compression heightens coherence rather than obscuring it.</comment>
