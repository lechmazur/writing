<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The penny-poet’s motives—syllable-measured meals, windproof shadow-sleep—stay vivid and consistent; his micro-choice to cork the first bead-note is embodied and alters tactics. Interiority is concrete (“the loft throbbed with gull bargains”), but the arc leans on lyrical summary rather than scene-level contradiction, so the final renunciation feels slightly soft-grained rather than scalpel-earned. Still, flaws complicate his trade and the village response supplies visible social cost. Voice remains individual, never diagnostic.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the emptied jars and open windows reweight the poet’s vocation from hoarder to conduit, with the widow’s embrace as visible cost. Causal chain holds—box silent → wind releases note → jars capture → beach release—each because/therefore tightening options. Orientation Teach is met: loft geography, dawn clock, and jar mechanic are anchored by word 80. One transition (loft → beach) is legible. No lens ambiguity; accumulative pattern taught early and paid in final lantern-image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Saltwood, torn canvas, barnacled gears—tactile specifics filtered through poet-perception; the loft itself behaves as antagonist, creaking under tidal memory. Micro-setting (music-box ballerina) constrains the pivotal choice to jar the first note. Sensory hierarchy favors sound and rust, mirroring theme of translation between silences. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from rafters to driftwood table; weather (dawn wind) directly triggers the melodic release.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—becoming translator—surfaces early and tightens when the first note is trapped, foreclosing lifelong hoarding. Escalation occurs through successive jarred notes that force public sharing; each glass captured is an option foreclosed to private keep. Cost is visible: widow’s reclaimed song, poet’s emptied sill. Agency remains poet’s throughout; wind coincidence complicates but does not resolve. One meaningful deepening suffices; no reversal inflation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the circuitry of sound, silence, and inheritance rather than thesis: “the long breath that lets a note cross a threshold.” Subtext lives in gestures—ballerina bowing to sand, widow pressing box to chest—never sermon. Final open-window image offers Charged Poise that reweights prior jar-museum without moral tag. Ambiguity lingers: village may yet forget how to cup palms. No late thematic echo; particulars carry resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>First-person POV stays stable; perceptual signature is salt-tinged sonic synesthesia (“voices of passing weather,” “note so clear it described the absence”). Diction stays inside poet’s lexicon—no academic register creep. Rhythm modulates: long breathless sentences for loft fullness, short clauses for bead-release. No dialogue contamination; when villagers appear, their speech is filtered through poet’s reportage, preserving distance. Patterned elision (jar mechanics) is taught by line 6 and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Read-aloud cadence varies; paragraph lengths breathe with scene tide. Information density high—single sentences do triple duty (e.g., “I corked it by reflex and held the glass to the light, and the light trembled as if reading a diary”). No mixed metaphors; salt/tea/iron cohere within coastal logic. Minor scaffold: “I remembered” opens reflective block yet anchors in present stimulus (broken drawer). No synonym churn; “jar” and “note” accrue rather than repeat. Closure image unobscured.</question>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Premise—sound-catcher trading bottled echoes for meals—feels fresh, not derivative. Transformation test fails if poet swapped to generic bard; jar-museum and widow-box duet are particular. Risk taken in lyric accumulative structure pays off: final open-window silence reverses hoarding pattern. Synthesis of grief, circuitry, and communal listening is non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. No close echo of famous scene; specificity anchors universals.</comment>
