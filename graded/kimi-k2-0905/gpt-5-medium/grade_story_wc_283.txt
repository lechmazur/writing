<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The hourglass-turner’s contradictory impulses—obedience to elders vs. theft of the jar—are dramatized in embodied micro-choices (tilting the jar, pinning buttons). Interiority stays concrete: “sand lingers at the narrows like a held breath.” The final oath-shift from counting to offering is earned by the prior cataloging labor and carries visible communal cost—people physically reclaim their dead’s voices. No diagnostic label-speak; the character’s perceptual signature is consistent and individuated.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the prophecy softens into communal clay—undeniable social cost and reconfiguration of power. Causal chain holds: theft → catalog method → ledger bridge → open warehouse → shared authority. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“amber warehouse beneath cliffs”). Lens is Accumulative/Textural; the density of button-echo pairings tightens the stake until the final image reweights it.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The warehouse’s glass ribs and shifting cliff faces constrain every move—echoes fall like fruit, shelves tremor, sand flow alters when doors open. Buttons function as micro-setting whose materiality (tin, bone, shell) determines which syllables can cross. The final blue silhouettes and shining buttons provide a charged, reweighted image. Environment directly shapes the catalog tactic and final communal stance.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—who controls meaning—is signaled early (“script I was given read like a lock”). One meaningful deepening: the catalog method turns static prophecy into live, communal loom. Cost is legible: the protagonist loses sole guardianship, warehouse authority diffuses, cliff sentences literally enter villagers’ mouths. Pressure escalates under Accumulative lens via button-echo pairings; no coincidence resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the concrete labor of matching discarded closures (buttons) to silenced voices—wisdom as communal fabric, not priestly decree. No explicit thesis; final image of clay in everyone’s fingers reweights prior lock metaphor. Subtext in button materials—bone for old vowels—carries historical guilt without exposition. Resonance lingers in the open warehouse, inviting ongoing co-authorship.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>First-person voice maintains a distinct lyrical texture: compressed syntax, tactile diction (“smell of sand, resin”), consistent metaphoric logic. Perceptual signature is biased toward haptic and auditory detail; no filter-verb clutter. Rhythm modulates with pressure—short pulses during jar opening, longer breaths at dawn. No dialogue, so voice distinction clause is N/A; internal coherence is flawless.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence or synonym loops. Figurative language is selective—one sustained loom metaphor—never obscures causality. High information density: “page becomes a small bridge” does image + plot work. No mixed metaphors or register drift; closure image remains crystal.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The canyon-echo-button loom synthesizes fresh mythic tech; no prior story combines lost buttons with voiced geological memory. Risk—letting villagers literally speak cliff sentences—pays off by turning prophecy into communal clay. Specificity of materials (tin, bone, shell) prevents abstraction. Transformation is inevitable in hindsight yet non-obvious at start.</comment>
