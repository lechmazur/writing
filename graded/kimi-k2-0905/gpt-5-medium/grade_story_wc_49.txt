<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Rowen’s motivation is legible but archetypal; his gentle trickster-teacher aura never cracks under contradiction or cost, so we see no interior friction, only enactment. The collective “we” narrator remains a passive chorus—no individual inside it risks a visible choice—so the human stake feels secondhand. The promised hunger “to restore sacred practices” is announced, not dramatized through competing wants or fears; consequently the ending’s ‘return of appetite’ lands as mood rather than earned arc.</comment>

<comment>Causal chain: Rowen arrives → teaches listening/singing → ritual night → village healed; each step proceeds clearly, but agency lies with Rowen while villagers witness, softening the Decisive Change. Closure image—“we hummed the low note, and the earth answered”—supplies a Resonant Reconfiguration: the village’s new consent is felt, cost is the old apathy now foregone. Orientation is immediate; no lens ambiguity. The penalty is that the villagers’ passivity means the closure’s price is vicarious rather than viscerally shared.</comment>

<comment>The arbor’s dawn light, tool strew, and dew-strung vine filament are tactile and bias-filtered; the grove’s acoustic feedback (needles dropping as metronome) turns setting into participant. Spatial choreography stays clean despite a crowd. The vine-as-instrument constrains the ritual and reappears, glowing, in the closure, meeting the 9+ gate for object-as-setting. Only the wells’ sudden echo feels slightly off-stage; a micro-withhold that barely blunts immediacy.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—recovering reciprocity with the land—is signaled early and tightens through song-practice beats; the tightening is lyrical (density & cadence shift) rather than option-blocking. Visible price is present: cracked bowls mend, wax regrows—material proof—but the villagers themselves sacrifice nothing onstage, blunting cost legibility. Escalation remains gentle and accumulative; no reversal tests personal commitment. Meets lens; falls short of 8.8 because agency and price are externalized to Rowen and objects.</comment>

<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: repair as remembering, alignment as consent. Subtext lives in gesture—pressing ear to root, coiling vine round wrist—never slogan. The final image reweights “silence” from absence to tool, achieving CR without moral statement. A hair’s-breadth from 9+ only because the villagers’ consent is observed, not wrestled with, leaving a wisp of thematic safety.</comment>

<grade>8.9</question>
<comment>Lyric first-plural voice sustains a consistent, ritual cadence; diction stays botanical and artisanal (“driftwood frame,” “green tongues”) without register drift. Rhythm teaches its pattern early and pays off in the choral cadences of the closing song. No head-hop; perceptual signature remains collective yet intimate. Compression and elision (“we practiced until our throats were polished”) are purposeful, legible. A near-invisible seam away from 9.</comment>

<question>8.4</question>
<comment>High information density: one sentence often performs scene, symbol, and sensory hit (“dew trembled into tone, and the arbor bent closer”). Figurative language is selective; no mixed metaphors. Occasional template cadence (“he… and he…”) appears but never in closure beats. Paraphrase loops absent. Minor hedge—“like someone who trusts dew to teach”—softens authority yet fits voice. Overall propulsion carries reader to final line without drag.</comment>

<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Restoring ecological sacrament through song is fresh, yet the wandering-mystic-heals-town spine is recognizable; specificity of vine-instrument and moonlit sonic repair lifts it. Risk is present—quiet lyric stakes, collective POV—but does not gamble hard on contradiction or loss. Transformation test passes: names, tools, and songs are entwined with this grove; swap them and the ritual collapses. Lacks a final unsettling edge that would push higher.</comment>
