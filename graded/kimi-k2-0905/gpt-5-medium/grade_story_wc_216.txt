<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The narrator’s interiority is richly textured—time felt by smell, grain-shadows, a heart “on loan” that learns to listen rather than tick—yet the arc stays inside the single stance of witness-helper; the earned shift is the quiet switch from counting to listening, but no contradictory impulse is dramatized in-scene, so the change feels contemplative rather than costly. Lio functions more as echo than crucible, so relationship pressure is absent. Still, the voice is so particular that the solitude itself becomes character, and the final boot-posting shows micro-choice altering community rhythm.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the capsule’s hinge “remembered its calling,” the urn fragment patches the seam, and the narrator’s rediscovered childhood cricket-time reweights the premise—time is no longer measured but walked. Cost is felt in the irrevocable loss of numeric time and in the communal labor of walking letters; the final boot-posting extends the method, showing the path foreclosed to old clocks. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each garage-sale breadcrumb thickens texture until the final ribbon-unrolling breath. Orientation is taught early via sensory offsets (“clocks coughed colors”), waived penalty.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The emerald glass refracts choice—glow acts as lantern and filter; the silo floor swells underfoot, turning body into clock-face. Micro-setting triumph: the urn fragment’s curved edge literally guides the loop-walk that closes memory. Sensory hierarchy is biased to touch and scent, matching the timekeeper’s occupational synesthesia. Weather is transmuted into taste (“waiting tasted like cedar”), charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can communal non-numeric time endure—tightens when each new capsule donation risks fragmenting the fragile calendar of gestures; the narrator’s agency is to keep patching the seam with walked letters. One meaningful deepening: the childhood cricket-memory converts private nostalgia into shared method, foreclosing return to numbered hours. Cost is visible—each receipt-flavor, each walked footprint consumes stamina and secrecy. No reversal, but accumulation makes abstaining from numeric time irreversible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges as the equation between measurement and meaning dissolves; the story refuses to mourn numbers, instead locating time in shared sensory labor. Subtext persists in silence: no character ever says “time is community,” yet the boot-posting makes it undeniable. Final image reweights earlier motifs—boots once walked footprints now invite others, converting private rediscovery into public method. Complexity is honored: nostalgia is neither pitied nor transcended, simply re-inscribed into gesture.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is relentless: every abstract noun is tasted, sniffed, or palped—“numbers tasted like nettles,” “calendar barked,” “waiting tasted like cedar.” Syntax mirrors synesthesia—long chain of sensory metaphors stays controlled, never slipping into purple because the POV is the synesthete. No dialogue to distort voice; compression in “follow the soft thunder” teaches the reader the code. Rhythm accelerates into breath-ribbons at climax, then settles into boot-thud cadence, paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>High information density: one sentence often layers sensory metaphor, world-rule, and micro-action—“Lio placed the cremation urn fragment on the seam as if patching a nest, and the metal sighed awake.” No scaffold loops; each metaphor extends prior vehicle (ribbon, river, boot) rather than restarting. Occasional elevated diction (“anticipated mysteries”) is licensed by the lyrical register and pays off in final boot post. Read-aloud ear test passes: varied sentence openings, paragraph breathing spaces align with breath-ribbon motif.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The non-numeric time premise is freshly rooted in garage-sale poetics rather than abstract dystopia; the breadcrumb method of embedding clues in shoe-and-spoon descriptions feels specific and gamelike. Transformation test: swap out synesthetic timekeeper and the entire texture collapses. Risk-taking in structure—accumulative shards, walking a letter as reading—pays off in closure image. Cricket-as-New-Year and boot-thunder are non-obvious syntheses that feel inevitable once revealed.</comment>
