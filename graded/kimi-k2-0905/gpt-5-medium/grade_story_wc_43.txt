<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The therapist’s calm authority is embodied in micro-choices—peeling the clementine, thumb on the bedrail—so “decisively kind” is shown, not labeled. Interiority stays concrete; the moment she decides to phone the son crystallizes her stake and costs her professional detachment. The only slack is the phrase “execute a flawless goodbye,” which momentarily sounds like mission-statement prose amid otherwise particular perception.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the final breath is not described, but the shared silence reweights every prior song-of-the-mundane into an irreversible after-state. Causal chain is clean—blood-work alert → therapist call → son arrival → shard passed → breath thins—each beat narrowing options with visible emotional cost. Orientation is swift; who-where-when is anchored by word 60 and never loosens. No lens ambiguity; the accumulative pattern taught early holds through the last line.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The “radiant haven above the clouds” is not a postcard; the glowing corridor, cloud-cross window, and pooled sunlight constrain pacing and choreography, forcing intimacy into a single rectangle of light. The clementine peel, IV beep, and broken record function as micro-setting that alters tactics—peel opens scent memory, shard demands gauze handling, beep sets tempo. Spatial tracking stays clean across the one-room scene; bodies never float. One hairline slip: “weather still clinging to his jacket” is generic compared with the bespoke visual syntax elsewhere.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“execute a flawless goodbye”—tightens once, hard, when the therapist uses her own phone to summon the son, trading professional distance for moral success. Pressure is accumulative: each mundane hymn (latch, drip, radiator) adds density until the shard is passed and the final silence arrives; options narrow to a single shared breath. Cost is legible on-page in the son’s raw handling of the unwrapped shard and the father’s exhausted relinquishment. No reversal, but the single deepening is sufficient for 600-word scope.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete return: the broken record becomes a safe shard once the son agrees to “ask the world to be gentle,” reweighting joy as something handled, not feared. No character states the moral; the clementine scent and final light-pool carry the conceptual repricing. Ambiguity lingers—will the son keep dancing?—but the emotional after-effect is fixed. The only near-tell is “execute a flawless goodbye,” a phrase that flirts with mission statement yet is redeemed by the flawed, human execution that follows.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>First-person voice carries a hushed, percussive rhythm—short clauses mimicking beeps—that modulates into longer lyric lifts during the hymn sections, mirroring the therapist’s shifting psychic distance. Diction stays within a caregiver’s lexicon; no sudden academic register. Filter verbs are scarce; perception is direct (“Sunlight pools on his blanket so it looks like water he could swim”). Dialogue is minimal but distinct: the father’s clipped “It stopped, but you can still dance” cracks open the scene without exposition. No head-hopping; focalization remains locked to the therapist until the final wide shot.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Line-level craft is near-flawless: every sentence advances image, character, or beat; no paraphrase loops or scaffold. Figurative language is spare—three extended metaphors total—and each pays off (clouds as slow animals → final river finding sea). Rhythm accelerates during the phone call, then lengthens into the dying cadence, supporting breath logic. One mixed vehicle: “weather still clinging to his jacket” is cliché-adjacent amid otherwise fresh phrasing, keeping the score sub-9.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The hospice-music frame is fresh, but the broken-record-as-talisman and clementine-scent triggers are recognizable; their rescue lies in the specific hymning method that turns radiator clang into lullaby. Risk is taken in the accumulative lyric structure—no dramatic reversal, only density—but the pattern is taught early and pays off, so it reads as purposeful rather than gimmicky. The final transfer of the unwrapped shard feels inevitable yet non-obvious, satisfying the transformation test. A hairline deduction for the near-proverbial “ask the world to be gentle,” which edges toward greeting-card uplift.</comment>
