<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The protagonist’s drive to “excavate truth” is dramatized through tactile micro-choices—reassembling strips, refusing the diamond, calibrating the resonator—each carrying embodied cost. Interiority avoids label-speak: the hush is “shaped exactly like a prayer,” a concrete, POV-specific image. The final refusal of the diamond crystallizes an earned renunciation whose price is the love note he keeps, giving the arc a credible sting. Flaw: we get no contradictory impulse under peak pressure; he never seriously contemplates keeping the talisman, so the renunciation feels slightly pre-ordained.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal lens holds from first beat to last: shredded memo → rebuilt tech → recalibrated orchard → renunciation. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—“traded a curse for a calibration”—with social cost legible in the caretakers’ split response. Orientation is anchored by word 30, lens taught by word 120, pattern fully paid off. No teleporting props; the stuttering shredder and diamond states remain tracked.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Orchard is handled as a tactile machine: sagging fruit, silvered leaves, cone of calm whose geometry dictates movement. Dust storm and resonator pit constrain every tactical choice; the final stake-driving scene literally re-uses the ground. Sensory hierarchy obeys crisis logic—only the “timbre as precise as glass cooling” pierces the hammer-herd storm. Minor gap: we never feel the temperature on skin, a missed immediacy beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“find the stillpoint before the next storm”—is signaled early and tightens when the calm’s math is revealed to be replicable, not divine. One decisive deepening: the diamond becomes a tunable tool, collapsing mystery into maintenance and forcing the final choice to teach rather than keep it. Cost is visible—time, skin, social capital with the prayer faction. No second reversal, but the single turn is sufficiently weighted for 800 words.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges without slogan: imperfection as the signature of every useful thing. Subtext lives in gesture—refusing to pocket the diamond while palming a love note—showing tenderness survives bureaucracy. Final image of caretakers running “with sacks and songs” reweights prior curses into collective stewardship, avoiding moral lecture. The shredded love note quietly reframes irradiated survival as an act of care, not fate.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>First-person voice owns a forensic cadence—short, chisel-cut sentences that mimic strip-reassembly rhythm. Metaphors are POV-bound: “heart on a rusted chain,” “herd of hammers.” Compression taught early (“should not have lived”) pays off in final “should not have lived, no richer, but steadier.” No head-hopping; caretakers’ songs enter only as audible texture. Filter verbs appear only when justified by investigatorial stance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Line-level craft is dense yet propulsive: “logs were gone, but absence is a kind of presence” compresses mystery and method in one stroke. Figurative layer is controlled—never more than one image per high-pressure sentence—so metaphors sharpen rather than clutter. No paraphrase loops; each sentence adds new information or tactile detail. Micro-slips: “like stubborn lanterns refusing to extinguish” edges toward stacked comparison, but the physicality of sagging fruit keeps it grounded.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fusion of post-apocalyptic orchard with quantum-field horticulture feels non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Risk: lyrical STEM exposition could have collapsed into TED-talk, but emotional stake stays anchored to the love note and bottle-cap wages. Transformation test passes—swap diamond for any generic MacGuffin and the entire moral calculus of imperfection collapses. Fresh inflection: cursed geology repurposed as DIY maintenance manual, turning superstition into civic tech.</comment>
