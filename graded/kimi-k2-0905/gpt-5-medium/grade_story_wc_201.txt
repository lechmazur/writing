<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The survivor’s interior contradiction—needing the mask strap as both leash and lifeline—grounds every beat; the final knot around the branch is a credible renunciation with embodied cost. Proprioceptive gift is more label than lived torque until late, blunting early micro-choices. Still, the hierarchy of values (name vs screw-turn) is legible and paid for in ultraviolet flesh.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each fluorescent leaf adds density until the geometry of mercy crystallizes. Closure is a Charged Poise—the strap on the branch reconfigures future options with conceptual cost visible in “I am sworn not to exceed again.” Orientation waivers apply: delayed anchoring is taught by the mask strap cue and pays off in the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Body-as-setting and pewter strap-as-tool constrain every tilt and step; ultraviolet forest pigments choice with cobalt fire that charges the final geometry. Spatial choreography is immaculate: elbow brace → dirt palms → bark knot track without drift. Sensory economy favors confession-light on scars over tourist catalog.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—find the mathematics of mercy before becoming an instrument again—tightens when each fluorescent letter demands bodily honesty. One meaningful deepening: the ratio of intention to harm is scraped from bark mid-stride, foreclosing the option to keep turning screws. Cost is legible in the strap left warming on the branch.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the ultraviolet calibration itself: mercy is not absolution but an early-limit constant discovered through bodily confession. No moralizing—final image of warm metal on branch reweights all prior fluorescence without statement. Ambiguity lingers: will the geometry hold off-stage? The forest’s applause photosynthesizes regret, not certainty.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is unmistakable: proprioceptive angles map ribs like a drawn bow, UV color that “does not exist until it touches scars.” Rhythm modulates from dropped-compass disorientation to the final cadence of “roots can grow in a displaced heart.” No head-hopping; lyric compression is taught early and paid off in the caretaker’s black-robe silence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Sentence variety and information density are high; figurative language is patterned (UV confession, cobalt fire) and never clutters peak beats. One scaffold loop: “I brace again” repeats within three lines but serves as proprioceptive echo rather than filler. No mixed metaphors; closure image remains crisp.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: enhanced interrogation survivor + UV penance forest + proprioceptive geometry yields a new moral calculus. Risk—lyric sci-fi sacrament—heightens stakes without gimmickry. The premise could not swap names or places without collapse; the ultraviolet alphabet and strap-theorem are irreplaceable.</comment>
