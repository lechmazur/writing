<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The librarian’s contradiction—custodian of knowledge yet pursuer of an elusive dream—surfaces in concrete micro-choices (setting out plates, refusing to turn). Emotion is embodied through salt-stung fingers and dawn-drenched palettes; no diagnostic self-talk. The final renunciation costs him the dream’s physical presence yet earns a re-cataloged dawn; the price is legible. Interiority stays anchored to sensory action, though occasional lyric lift drifts toward emblem rather than beat-specific pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative / lyric lens holds: each photograph-layer thickens the hush-map rather than causes next event. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration—dream escapes while its reflected route is fixed in emulsion; librarian’s refusal to possess creates Charged Poise with felt cost (“some absences must remain luminous”). The map hums, re-weighting the entire archive. Orientation is deliberately mist-soft, but pattern taught early (“I was the odd-hour librarian…”) waives penalty.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Salt-stained atlases, foam-stitched shoals, and watercolor wells create a micro-setting that constrains tactics: the palette must be tilted to bleed dawn into frames. Sensory hierarchy favors brine, gull-cry, wet emulsion—never catalogued as tour. Weather and tide are causal (dream trips on foam stitch). Internal–external mirroring occurs through light-on-water rather than declared symbols.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—capture vs escort—tightens once when the librarian answers the sea’s price question and renounces ownership. Escalation is lyrical accumulation: each plate adds opacity to the chase until the final refusal crystallizes cost. No external antagonist needed; pressure is ontological (dream must stay fugitive). Cost is conceptual yet visible: the map hums with unborrowable light, foreclosing future pursuit.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through recurring “passage not possession” enacted in salt, light, catalog cards. No articulation of thesis—wisdom rests in final image of anchor-cast light. Subtext resides in fishermen’s nods and surf’s untranslated laugh. The luminous absence reweights the cipher of longing without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>First-person lyric voice owns a perceptual signature: libraried dawns, salt-inked margins, dialect only surf translates. Syntax breathes with tide-length cadences; no head-hop. Compression (“I answered that a dream should not be owned”) is voice-true, not shorthand. Register stays within a poet-librarian’s plausible lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Rhythm varies from long wave-sentences to shutter-click fragments; no template cadence. Metaphors (atlases with salt margins, dawn as childhood letter) extend rather than contradict physics. Information density high—“palette bled a dawn of diluted oranges” does triple scene work. No scaffolding loops or synonym churn; even “whispering archipelago” recurs with accrued charge.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Premise fuses librarian + oceanic photo-capture of fugitive dream—fresh synthesis. Tropes of chase and archive are inverted: possession is refused, atlas becomes mirror. Risk in lyric accumulation pays off with audible map-hum. Specificity of salt-footprint emulsion makes metaphor irreplicable.</comment>
