<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The narrator’s “reckless idealist” motive is embodied in the tactile gesture of giving away her own name and planting the listening seeds; the micro-choice carries visible cost and alters both her stance and the boy’s fate, earning the change. Interiority stays concrete—ash map, bone-hand, card-warmth—without therapeutic self-labeling. One slight dip: the boy’s shift from cindery eyes to “rain on coal” is more observed than lived, so the symmetrical exchange feels fractionally neat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the act of scattering grandmother’s stories-seeds reweights the market’s rule-set and visibly forecloses the narrator’s old grief-loop. Causal lattice holds—card → map → pit → trade → planting—each step a because/therefore linkage under the Causal lens. Cost is legible in the final line: she will “return with more names to trade,” i.e. perpetual exposure to the market’s suction, a price she accepts on-page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard is not backdrop but instrumental: the bone-hand cupping earth becomes the planting site that enables the closing contract, satisfying the 9+ gate. Sensory triage matches urgency— candle soot, brass light, root-knuckles—while spatial choreography stays clean across the lantern swings and seed scattering. Slight over-milk of “bones chimed whenever a breeze lost its way” is the only decorative excess preventing 9.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (“patch holes in the soul”) is signaled in paragraph two and tightens when the Weaver demands a destiny that “refuses you,” forcing the narrator to relinquish her own name and future autonomy. The single deepening—offering the soldier fate back to the market—pays an on-page price (she becomes perpetual barterer) and crystallizes the new equilibrium. Under Causal lens, the escalation is lean but sufficient for 650-word window.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the tactile economy of stories-as-seeds, not abstraction; the final image of perpetual return reconfigures grief from private wound to communal listening circuit. Subtext operates in gesture—name given, fern-stamped contract, ash pressed into roots—avoiding thesis statements. The refusal to moralize keeps ambiguity alive while still delivering resonant reweighting.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice carries a sustained lyric cadence that teaches its pattern early (“breathed like a sleeping beast”) and pays it off in the final “card still warm with a tongue.” Perceptual signature is concrete and character-specific: tarot edges “curled like a quiet snarl,” hush “settled over his cindery eyes like rain on coal.” No head-hopping, no register drift; even the Weaver’s dialogue stays spare and silt-inked. One micro-slip: “fiercely gentle” is iterated twice and edges toward slogan, but the repetition is contained within the narrator’s self-description and reads as deliberate incantation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm breathes with scene pressure—long sinuous clauses in discovery, staccato fragments at the trade beat. Figurative language is dense but coherent, rooted in market/orchard imagery; no contradictory metaphors. Information density high: one sentence often layers sensory cue, world-rule, and emotional tilt. Minor template echo: three consecutive “I…then I” constructions mid-story, but they coincide with causal sequence and do not obscure clarity or closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The destiny-barter premise is familiar, yet the ash-map that literally rewrites the orchard floor and the inversion of tarot-from-fire-ruin feel specific and inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in lyric accretion heightens coherence without gimmickry; the listening-seeds notion fuses grief-work and world-logic in one image. Could edge higher if the market mechanics were slightly less allegorical, but the synthesis still registers as fresh.</comment>
