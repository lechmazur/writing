<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The scavenger’s interior contradiction—hoarding regret while bargaining it away—peaks in the ghost’s demand for verbs; the embodied admission “I forgive the rain” carries palpable cost and earns the renunciation to stay. Micro-choices (washing the sack, counting bolts) convert abstract motive into tactile ritual, showing hierarchy of values. However, the childhood/scars temporal shuffle is asserted, not dramatized in-scene, muting the flaw-in-action that would push this to 9-band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Accumulative/lyric lens taught by iterative image knots: camera wheel, lagoon, carousel bones. Closure lands as Charged Poise—camera clicks sync with turbine sighs, reconfiguring time into “craft of breath.” Persistent constraint: scavenger must remain on raft, learning minutes by sighs; cost legible in final image without forward/back wind. Minor drift: “chronologically confused” premise floats free for ~180 words before pattern coheres, but payoff waives orientation penalty.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Micro-setting dominates: camera wheel as portable clock, turbine-raft as kettle/tea station; both constrain tactics (cannot leave raft, must measure time by sighs). Cloud-lagoon physics stay consistent—updraft ladders, submerged rails—anchored in scavenger’s tool-use. Sensory selection skews auditory (clicks, sighs, clinks) reinforcing fractured stillness. Slight over-glitter in “thinking water” phrase keeps it sub-9.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: exhume and pay for eroded ambitions via ghost negotiation. Escalation delivered through accretion of story-fragments that thicken bridge until ghost steps on; cost felt when regret is spoken aloud and sinks. No causal reversal, but deepening pattern tightens option: stay and measure time or keep fleeing. Luck absent; tension plateaus rather than spikes, keeping score sub-8.5.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from refuse-to-ritual arc: eroded ambitions = compost for future garden, shown via sack-washing and bolt-counting. Final image of “breath becomes a craft” offers conceptual repricing without moralizing. Subtext lives in silence where ghost nods—reader must infer forgiveness accepted. Avoids tidy aphorism, though “coin bath for pride” edges toward overt thesis, holding it shy of 9.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>First-person perceptual signature is relentless: pockets “jangling with hinges and promises,” verbs like “telephone a friend I betrayed.” Rhythm modulates from long breathy clauses to staccato admissions under ghost pressure. No dialogue, so voice carries all subtext. Patterned elision (skipping how ladders are climbed) taught early and paid off in closure; no head-hoop or register drift. Diction stays within scavenger’s salvage lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>High-density lines multitask: “turbine becomes a kettle; hinge becomes a book's quiet vertebra” propels both image and theme. Figurative layering is deliberate, patterned, never purple; mixed metaphor vigil passed. No scaffold loops or synonym churn; sentence openings vary. Micro-typo: “seamed with green” should probably be “seamed in green,” a hairline slip that does not occlude closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Conceptual leap—carousel pause creates aerial lagoon of memory—feels inevitable once read. Fusion of scrap-yard diction with metaphysical negotiation avoids standard surreal template. Fresh inflection: using camera wheel’s backward click as truce mechanism, not nostalgia device. Risk high, clarity intact; transformation test fails if transplanted to other names/places, confirming originality.</comment>
