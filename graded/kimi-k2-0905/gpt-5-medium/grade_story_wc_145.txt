<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interiority is textured—editor’s need to “find where the rivers begin” collides with fear of taming the wild, embodied in chalk-and-glass cartography. Micro-choice turning wheel while falcon watches shows hierarchy: map over safety. Flaw (subtle hubris) pushes act; cost (must chase next departure) lands cleanly. No secondary character on page; relationship lens not needed.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: condensation pattern teaches geography, each fog-and-sketch tightens stake until final handshake under hill. Closure—Earned Stasis: clerk accepts atlas will breathe differently, cost is perpetual migration. Causality intact: phrasebook → condensation → valve turn; no teleport. Orientation anchored by 89 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Outpost iron, lake’s held breath, black water under culvert all constrain movement and supply tools (glass, valve) that charge final image. Frosted girders hum like teeth—setting mirrors inner tension. Patterned cold returns in every beat; no static postcard. Falcon as mobile setting piece re-weights at landing and departure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—record elusive headwaters without domesticating them—tightens via each condensation reading; final valve turn forecloses static mapmaking. Agency visible: protagonist turns wheel while speaking dialect prayer, pays price of endless following. No reversals needed under Accumulative lens; density and cadence shift suffice. Cost legible: perpetual itinerancy now required.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme—naming follows listening—emerges through glass-oracle and reluctant atlas; no moralizing. Image of rivers “voting” reframes exploration as democratic, not conquest. Final line “until the atlas breathed differently” offers resonant non-literal answer. Falcon glare and chalk veins accumulate without motif-checklist feel.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Voice—dry, map-stained wit—carries perceptual signature: “lake surface shone like a single held breath.” Syntax mirrors cadence of thaw: long clauses loosen after valve turn. No dialogue, so no register clash. Patterned elision (condensation grammar) taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lyric density high yet propulsive; each metaphor advances geography or stakes—“mouth that swallowed maps” compresses threat and lure. No synonym loops; sentences vary in length and opening. One mixed metaphor (“veins met veins…applause”) minor amid overall control. Final image crystallizes without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: cartographer uses condensation as survey tool—concept non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Risk of lyric abstraction accepted and paid off via tactile valve turn. Falcon-as-herald trope made specific by itinerary skull. Avoids generic frozen-north postcard; stakes stay personal.</comment>
