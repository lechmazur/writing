<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Marek’s embodied interiority—ribs chiming, palm tasting key teeth—shows contradictory impulses alive in-scene; the renunciation of force and the offer of co-guardianship are earned by prior vibrational study and carry visible cost in the shared breath at the lens. The seeker’s hunger-to-listen shift is credible because the chord physically unsettles her knees and shoulders. Minor slip: “logically emotional” is named once rather than dramatized, but the trait repeatedly governs micro-choices. Overall a taut, singular psyche under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causality holds: because Marek studied the stone’s forgiveness, he can therefore offer sonic absolution; because she hears the chord, she therefore relinquishes ransom. Closure is the Earned Stasis of shared guardianship, cost legible in the stone’s low chord that “remembered drowned orchards.” Orientation secured by 120 words; lighthouse stair count acts as causal timer. No lens ambiguity; pattern of tuning taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Drift-ice marina is not postcard scenery: ice nudges pilings like shy animals, constraining skiff approach and forcing sonic rather than physical defense. The Fresnel lens room becomes micro-setting whose glass ribs amplify the stone’s breath, directly enabling the absolution tactic. Sunset’s dying-light freckles mirror the emotional thinning of old hunger. Spatial choreography clean: boots wet on rungs, lantern wink coded in swagger, bodies tracked to final shared stance.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—protect the Throat—tightens when rumor of skiff-borne seeker narrows options to adapt or fight. Marek’s agency: he decides to tune rather than defend, foreclosing violence and opening shared stewardship. Cost is the audible memory of drowned orchards that both must now carry. One meaningful escalation beat suffices; no coincidence resolves the standoff.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges without sermon: protection through alignment, not erasure. Subtextual turn: ransom desire is re-tuned into collaborative listening. Final image of lifted beam as “rib set back in place” reweights prior maritime loss into joint vigil. No thematic echo; wisdom stays inside concrete particulars of stone’s chord and woman’s coat of sailcloth.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dist lyric compression—“fleshly ethereal hush,” “honey into the cold”—is taught in line 2 and held to final “lifted its beam.” Perceptual signature is engineer-specific: graphs feelings against vectors, counts stairs like scars. No head-hopping; skiff woman’s interior accessed only through external listening of her knees. Rhythm modulates: long exhale sentences under stone’s breath, short knocks of ice at end.Filter-verb free; diction stays within coastal trades lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>High density: “key’s cold teeth taste his palm” does sensory plus metaphor plus plot in one stroke. No loops or paraphrase; each sentence advances. Figurative control maintained even at closure—beam as reset rib—without mixed metaphor. Minor scaffold: “like shy animals” and “like a curious dog” both animalize ice; does not dull image but keeps cap at 8.5.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: lighthouse + tuning fork + drowned orchard chord = new myth without genre furniture. Transformation test fails if names places swapped, because stone’s sonic absolution is inseparable from Fresnel acoustics and maritime loss. Risk of lyric engineer pays off: vector-graphing feelings is not stock trope. Final reconfiguration of enemy into co-keeper feels inevitable yet non-obvious.</comment>
