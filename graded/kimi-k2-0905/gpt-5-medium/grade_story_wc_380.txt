<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The lantern-lighter’s grief for his sister is embodied in every micro-choice—pressing flowers, breathing on glass, sealing the tin—so the interiority stays character-specific and contradictory. His competence (lighting, exhuming, navigating gravity pockets) is balanced by the genuine struggle of memory-loss and the risk of stepping into unstable space. The final renunciation—carrying the memory back to the tin rather than into his own head—pays the visible cost of never fully reclaiming her, earning an Earned Stasis that feels scaled to the story’s microcosm. Only the chemist’s voice converges toward the narrator’s lyric register, a minor voice-blend that keeps this just below the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the tin re-inhales hillside scent and the last lantern fixes a path through mutable gravity, reweighting the premise that memory can be externalized without private erasure. Cost is legible in the final image—“a forgiven word”—and in the persistent constraint that the sister’s laugh will stay inside glass, not skull. The accumulative/textural lens holds throughout: salt crystals, coffee-ground constellations, and gravity pockets accrete until the final cadence crystallizes options. Pattern is taught by word 150, orientation anchors land by word 90, no late rule changes; the whale remains causally inert backdrop, satisfying coincidence rule.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Environment (the pier’s buckled plates, hardened sand, rib-cage shadow) constrains every footstep and spade thrust; the salt chamber literally archives shape, charging the final memory corridor. Micro-objects—tin, glass scroll, pressed flowers—function as mobile setting that alters tactics when the corridor opens. Sensory economy is biased by the lighter’s vocation: he notices wicks, wicks’ reflection, lantern heat on cheekbones before he smells whale. No static postcard catalog; each detail is filtered through mortal urgency to recover a laugh.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recovering a deleted memory—tightens once when the coffee spiral signals where the sister “left her name,” narrowing options to exhume the glass scroll. A second deepening occurs inside the gravity pocket: the corridor offers the memory but only as external cargo, forcing renunciation of internal reclamation. Cost is visible—lanterns shiver, ground eats his step, and he exits with hands full of someone else’s past rather than his own—so agency remains even within lyric texture. Pressure plateaus rather than spikes again, so while escalation is meaningful it stops just short of the 8.8+ band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme—memory as portable, communal infrastructure—emerges through salt, glass, and gravity rather than thesis: deleted memories become library stacks one can borrow but not own. The final image of the tin inhaling scent re-prices the concept of “holding on,” making externalized nostalgia feel both tender and tragic without moralizing. No symbolic convenience; every motif (wildflowers, coffee constellations, lanterns) is handled on-page before it re-weights closure. Complexity lingers: the sister remains partially unrecoverable, refusing tidy consolation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>First-person lyric voice sustains a perceptual signature rooted in maritime maintenance: wick-spit, kerosene hiss, salt crust under nail. Rhythm modulates—long phrasing for tide-thought, staccato when gravity hiccups—without drumbeat monotony. Elision (“pockets of gravity”) is taught early and paid off when the corridor mouth opens; no head-hop. Only the chemist’s dialogue drifts toward the narrator’s elevated diction, a minor convergence that does not undercut the overall coherence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry triple duty—image, emotion, world-rule—without scaffold: “the sand here has hardened into plates, buckled by those same invisible tides” conveys setting, cause, and stakes in one breath. Metaphors stay internally coherent (lantern flame inside lungs, gravity as barefoot intruder) and never stack into purple density. One paraphrase loop—“lanterns along the dock shiver / the nearby pocket of gravity opens like an unscheduled mouth”—is forgivable at climax. No filter-verb stacks, no register drift; copy-clean except for intentional lyric fragments.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The whale-beached-gravity-seed premise is non-obvious and fully committed: instead of apocalyptic spectacle, the story explores microscopic tidal eddies inside a dock town’s memory ecology. Salt crystals as data servers, coffee constellations as cartography, and gravity pockets as nesting drawers are syntheses that feel inevitable in hindsight yet fresh on first read. Risk—lyric accumulation rather than causal reversals—heightens stakes without obscuring closure. If plot were relocated to another coast, the entire memory-archive mechanic would collapse, confirming irreplaceable specificity.</comment>
