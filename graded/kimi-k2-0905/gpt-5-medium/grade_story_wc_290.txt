<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (claustrophobia vs compulsion to move) are alive in every beat; the compass-point micro-choices tether identity to action. Interiority stays concrete, never drifts into label-speak. Final endurance of tightness with key in hand is earned cost, visible on the page. Slight undercut: no secondary character on stage, so status/relationship crucible absent, but single-POV default holds.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: because the alleys mutiny, therefore the protagonist negotiates via sound-geometry; each linkage tightens options. Closure is a Charged Poise—the telescope re-aimed downward reweights the city’s “hunger to be heard” with conceptual cost. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land by line 3; no debt. One soft spot: spatial rules of the mutiny never fully codified, so the final cease-fire feels slightly lucky rather than ruled.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fountain-basin, alleys, organ pipes, telescope—all tactile, lived-in, and choreographed without drift. Starlight, silt, chalk, compass point act as micro-settings that directly constrain tactics (pricking triangles, chalk commas). Sensory hierarchy narrows to touch and hearing under pressure, reflecting claustrophobic bias. Final telescope aimed downward turns setting into closure instrument, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—retrieve lost key—tightens when spatial mutiny threatens to erase routes; alleys “turning like sleepers” raises physical cost. One meaningful deepening: the mutiny is reframed from enemy to neglected treaty, shifting tactics from conquest to listening. Price is legible (cold bite, lung tightness, public disobedience of Council ban), but external stakes (city-wide consequences) remain implied rather than dramatized on page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: maps as promises, spaces as sentient partners, rebellion as remembrance rather than conquest. No explicit thesis; final image of telescope listening downward reweights prior imagery without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers—city may mutiny again—keeping complexity alive. One near-echo: “wistful rebellion” is named in prompt but only enacted, never labeled in text, so resonance stays earned.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>First-person voice maintains perceptual signature: breath “measured like a diver’s,” alleys that “pretend to meet,” compass “bright as frost.” Rhythm modulates from long breathless phrases under pressure to clipped chalk-prick beats. No dialogue, so no register clash. Filter verbs minimal; metaphors stay within POV’s plausible lexicon. Final telescope image crystallizes voice into resonant stance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Line-level craft is dense yet propulsive: each sentence advances atmosphere or tactic. No synonym loops or template cadence detected. Metaphors (stone lungs, lace of breath) remain coherent and mutually reinforcing. Minor overworld risk in stacked figurative lines, but pattern is taught early and justified by lyric mode; closure image unaffected.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Spatial mutiny as negotiating partner rather than obstacle offers fresh angle on urban-fantasy mapping. Compass-point-as-key-finder and organ-as-diplomacy are non-obvious syntheses that feel inevitable in hindsight. Risk in lyric compression heightens stakes without clarity loss. Derivative-premise guardrail waived: city-alive trope is transformed through listening-as-architecture and earned stasis closure.</comment>
