<comment>The narrator’s curiosity about the building’s language is embodied in micro-listening choices; the tutor’s contradictory “dead language tutor” line crystallizes his function. Interiority stays concrete—“ivy strangling and embracing at once” fuses guilt/loyalty. The seal-handover in the meteor light is a credible renunciation with visible cost. Only minor slack: the narrator’s emotional saturation never quite cracks under final pressure, keeping the change one-note.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the seal pressed into rooftop stone lets the building speak its weather-kept rain, re-weighting every prior “agreed lie.” The accumulative/textural lens holds—density of architectural metaphors tightens until mortar literally speaks. Causality stays intact: every tea session accrues listening skill needed to decode the wax imprint. One soft spot: orientation is slightly late (~140 words) yet pays off at closure, so waiver applies.</comment>

<comment>Stairwell drafts, iron breaths, and the rosemary planters are tactile constraints guiding attention; the wax-filled mortar seam becomes the charged micro-setting that alters choice at the climax. Sensory economy is exact—sound of steps, smell of tea, heat of wax—all filtered through a linguist’s ear. Spatial choreography holds across tea table, hallway, roof coping. No white-room lapse; even the “nonexistent corridor” echo is spatially grounded.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</question>
<comment>Dominant stake—can the narrator learn to hear the building before questions run out—tightens when each tea/lesson forecloses ordinary neighborly distance; final seal act makes listening irreversible. The tutor’s “agreed lies” escalate via ritual wax stamps that raise cost of breaking silence. No external antagonist needed; internal pressure (fear of empty questions) converges with architectural empathy. Price is visible: acceptance of complicity in preserving illusions.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of “respectful illusion” emerges through lived detail—cornice Latin, fake corridor—never lectured. Final mortar’s sentence (“we are all full of rain”) offers non-literal conceptual reprice that reweights every earlier façade. Subtext in gesture: pouring tea = pouring time into a shared lie. Avoids tidy moral; ambiguity lingers—lies shelters, truth might flood.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>First-person voice carries a linguist’s perceptual signature: syntax prefers clauses that parse sound (“syntax of weight and habit”). Rhythm modulates—short fragments under meteor shower mimic falling sparks. Compression taught early (“a stair that missed a tread because a child once did”) stays legible. No head-hop; diction stays within narrator’s scholarly lexicon. Dialogue indirection strong: “Only as much as the Latin in the cornice.”</comment>

<comment>Prose achieves high density without filler: one sentence fuses meteor, rooftop, cathedral (“rooftop garden a cathedral”). Mixed metaphors rare; “ivy strangling and embracing” is intentionally double-edged. A few template cadences—“we met…we watched…we agreed”—appear mid-story but do not touch closure. No synonym loops; concrete nouns dominate. Read-aloud rhythm rises to match meteor shower then exhales on final line.</question>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses ghost story with urban philology—fresh. Tutor as literal “dead language” queers the trope; building that keeps weather as memory reframes haunt trope into ethics of shelter. Seal’s negative image revealing mortar’s confession is a specific reweighting impossible without prior ivy/ownership lore. Risky lyric compression taught early and pays off; no safety-middle retreat.</comment>
