<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mara’s interior contradiction—fear of her own growing numbness versus her vocation of teaching feeling—drives every action; her embodied micro-choice to thread the filament through the needle crystallizes her arc with visible cost. Oko’s wrist-listening and shell-grin supply distinct secondary pressure that alters her stance. No stock phrasing; even “frost beneath the ribs” is earned via prior winter imagery. Final bow—cavern “bows back with a breath she felt”—seals earned stasis.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the repaired needle hums “like a small animal sleeping,” reweighting the premise—backward listening now propels forward teaching. Causal linkage holds: because she stitches silence, therefore music returns as lucid tide. Orientation anchored by word 80 (“cavern’s keeper, an old drum maker named Oko”). Persistent constraint—the needle newly threaded—shapes the final image and tomorrow’s pedagogy; cost is the fragility of that live filament.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The cavern is not backdrop but instrument: basalt “swallows sound into velvet,” constraining how Oko tunes drums to dream earthquakes. Micro-setting—the broken phonograph needle—literally charges the climax when pierced through skin. Sensory hierarchy obeys Mara’s deaf bias: touch and vibration precede sight. Weather (“dry leaves ticked like distant metronomes”) syncs with seasonal transition, coaching the reader to feel time pass without exposition.</answer>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—defeat emotional numbness—tightens when the backward playback first rubs frost from her bones; second beat deepens when she realizes she had already stopped feeling. Agency: she rigs, threads, and bows; no coincidence. Cost is legible: the filament could snap, the needle could re-break, the city might still refuse to thaw. One meaningful tightening satisfies 600-word scale.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme—listening backward to feel forward—emerges solely through image and action; never named. The phonograph needle’s transformation from failed promise to compass reframes silence not as absence but “presence to travel.” No final-paragraph moral; last line (“frost admitting it was water”) reweights earlier winter metaphors with conceptual cost. Subtext in Oko’s grin and wrist-listening invites multiple readings of what “music” can be.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person lyric distance stays stable; perceptual signature is deaf-tactile: “skin, bones, and the remembering of feet.” Syntax mirrors tidal rhythm—long sentences swell, fragments break (“Not loud, but precise”). No head-hopping; Oko’s interior is implied only through gesture and grin, maintaining POV modesty. Register never drifts above Mara’s plausible lexicon; “lighthouse at fog’s edge” is concrete, not purple.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or stakes. Metaphors are coherent—“velvet hush,” “fossil teeth”—and avoid muddle. High density: “She slipped the repaired needle into her pocket, its new thread humming like a small animal sleeping” performs action, object state, and resonance in one stroke. Opening and closing lines read aloud with natural cadence; no algorithmic patterning.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The deaf music teacher seeking feeling via reversed sound is a fresh synthesis; the phonograph-needle-as-stylus-on-drumhead is an ingenious literalized metaphor that could not be swapped. stakes are intimate, not world-scale, yet feel universal. Final image of frost “admitting it was water” reconfigures season, emotion, and medium in one stroke—risk that pays off. No derivative premise or stock scene echoes.</comment>
