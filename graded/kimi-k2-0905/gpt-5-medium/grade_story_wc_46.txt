<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The watcher’s interior contradiction—clinging to loss while refusing fire—turns every polished shard into renunciation with cost. Micro-choices (tongue-warming, kelp-stringing) literalize the shift from blazing to breathing. Brother’s absence remains an active hollow that reshapes present tactics. Motive never drifts into therapeutic self-label; ache stays salt-raw, unhealed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds: each circled stroke adds density until the garland reweights “light” from blaze to hush. Closure lands in Charged Poise—garland hung, village exhales, brother maybe returns to a world that has already renounced his promised star. Cost is the lifetime of salt and rasp compressed into every oval. No causal gaps; memory shards are cued by tactile present, never dumped.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Grotto-mist functions as micro-setting that dictates method: wet slate, salt leather, tide-clock. Pebbled floor and sea glass supply both tool and material; environment literally smooths the stake. Final ascent up “slippery stairs carved by waves” transposes grotto curvature into village lane—setting follows choice uphill. Glass ovals carry grotto breath skyward, so place constrains outcome.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—how to give light without burning—tightens via each failed friction: fire once took roofs, now only tide-tumble is allowed. Polishing stroke = micro-agency that forecloses pyrotechnics; garland’s soft glow is the only remaining path. Visible price: decades of salt rasp in finger joints, time paid instead of matchstick. One meaningful intensification: when “garland learns its work,” option of future blaze is quietly extinguished.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges as the moral calculus of aftermath: speed once killed, so slowness becomes ethical. “Pearl of stillness” reweights from pretty motif to survival strategy without explicit thesis. Final image—village faces brightened by borrowed dusk—delivers resonant non-verbal answer: gentleness is the harder, costlier star. Ambiguity lingers: will brother accept a muted constellation?</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>First-person lyric sustains tidal cadence; syntax lengthens and contracts like breath. Perceptual signature—glass “round as a heartbeat”—is idiosyncratic, not borrowed. Register never drifts into workshop abstraction; diction stays brine-soaked, tactile. Patterned repetition (“I circle… I circle…”) is taught early and pays off in ritual momentum rather than monotony.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or pressure. Metaphors stay physically coherent—glass “listens,” mist “folds like milk into tea”—without mixed vehicle crashes. High information density: one sentence can layer tactile motion, memory shard, and ethical stake. Rhythm breathes with physical effort; no filter-verb stacks dull the rasp.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Takes familiar grief-recovery trope but pivots resolution from grand reunion to communal lumenectomy—renouncing fire itself. Sea-glass starlight feels inevitable yet non-obvious; transformation grows organically from coastal ecology. Specificity of method (sand-smooth slate → leather → coat cuff) outshines generic “craft” scenes. Risk in quiet ending pays off: withheld blaze becomes the haunting absence that charges closure.</comment>
