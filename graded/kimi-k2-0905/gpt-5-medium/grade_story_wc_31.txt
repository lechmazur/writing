<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The lamplighter’s interiority is concrete—his practiced ease of slipping into water, the brass tag against his throat—but the “hides behind truth” trait is asserted rather than dramatized; no moment shows him dodging honesty at cost. The vow he leaves is binding yet feels more lyrical than earned, a quiet pledge without an on-page trade-off that would foreclose a path. Micro-choices (brushing a book, mouthing the vow) are present but low-stakes; the hum’s color change happens to him rather than through a decision that costs him something visible. Still, his perceptual signature is distinct and consistent, keeping him above the middle band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the silver hum becomes a color the narrator can carry, a Conceptual Repricing that reweights the premise with undeniable conceptual cost—sound is now a weather he must tend. Causality is lyric rather than plot-driven, fitting an Accumulative/Textural lens: each glowing sentence knots him to seafloor quiet until the metronome heartbeat signals the earned stasis. The orientation anchor (who/where/when) arrives by line 3; no penalty. The only drag is the mild soft-reset feel—he surfaces unchanged outwardly—but the internal reconfiguration is legible and charged, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Kelp curtains, silt-furred books, ribs of the ship yawning like wet timbered bells—every descriptor is filtered through the lamplighter’s nocturnal, tidal attention. The hotel skeleton key tag functions as micro-setting: its brass oval against his throat constrains the choice to leave his own vow pressed into the ledger, charging the final image. Spatial choreography is flawless; the drift nudges him, lantern-shadows rest on shoulders like temporary birds, anchoring body and tool. Environment, body, and object all participate in the closure beat, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—discover the color of sound—is signaled in paragraph 5 and deepens when the hum acquires a thawing silver tint, a meaningful intensification under Accumulative lens. Pressure is ambient rather than antagonistic; the library’s breathing and the vows’ threads tighten his heartbeat into a tethered metronome, a visible cost. No external reversal, but the internal stance crystallizes: he must earn the silver by tending brightness others see first, foreclosing the option to remain a passive observer. Cost is felt but modest; the silver is carried yet no tangible loss is dramatized, keeping it shy of the 8.8+ band.</comment>

<comment>Theme emerges organically: attention as a form of stewardship—tending light without tiring—rather than explicit moralizing. The luminous vows motif reweights from sailors’ superstition to a training in patience, a quiet conceptual repricing that resonates without pronouncement. Subtext lives in gesture: pressing the tag against the page is a silent covenant more potent than spoken oath. Final image—lanterns as visible notes—offers a non-literal answer to the color-of-sound quest, achieving thematic unity with charged poise.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is distinctively tidal: syntax swells and subsides, mirroring the harbor’s surge (“the ribs of the sunken ship yawned, muttering like wet timbered bells”). Diction stays within the lamplighter’s plausible lexicon yet lifts into lyric register without strain. Patterned elision—no dialogue, only murmured vows to water—is taught early and paid off when the vow answers with color. Rhythm modulates: longer clauses drift, then compress into staccato breaths under mask, a perceptual signature that heightens pressure without clutter.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Information density is high; single sentences perform triple duty: “I carried a hotel skeleton key tag on a cord around my throat, a brass oval stamped with the number that visited my dreams” anchors object, backstory, and motive in 22 words. Metaphors are precise and internally coherent—“meteor hush,” “moonlight nicked by old knives”—no mixed vehicles. Minor scaffold: “the corridor that had become stacks” could compress, but it occurs early and doesn’t dull closure. Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; paragraph cuts land on image-shifts that recharge momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fusion of lamplighter lore with underwater library is fresh; the color-of-sound quest reframes sensory synesthesia as vocational ritual. Sunken ship-as-library trope is familiar, but the luminous vows logged in salt-furred ledgers particularize it, transforming generic into specific. Risk—lyric accumulation instead of plot—pays off when silver becomes a weather the narrator must tend, a conceptual turn that feels inevitable in hindsight. Voice, setting, and theme cohere into a singular artistic stance without gimmickry, meriting the high band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Late-shift pier lamplighter: setup in line 1, development via practiced leaving, closure linkage—pledges to light without tiring. His attention-tending choice reweights the stake, nearly indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Hotel skeleton key tag: early throat-carry, mid-scene twin discovery that reweights meaning, final press into ledger that transfers vow. Irreplaceable; removal would collapse the covenant logic.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Luminous vows: early rumor, mid-scene glow on brushing pages, final vow left in ledger that trains ear to patience. Drives two beats and charges closure with silver tint.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.2</grade>
<comment>Hides behind truth asserted but never dramatized as a costly dodge; functions as thematic label rather than choice constraint. Swappable with “seeks refuge in facts” without structural change.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Signify: vow’s glow signifies safe passage or honest wreckage, mid-scene brightens pages, final vow signifies commitment to attention. Shapes tactics and ending color.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.5</grade>
<comment>By wandering purposefully: signaled early (“drift nudge” compromise), guides descent into library, enables silver discovery. Mechanics matter but lack visible cost, keeping it sub-7.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Forgotten library inside sunken ship: spatial pressure (hold-corridor-stacks), supplies glowing vows, constrains movement and breath. Setting actively participates in silver acquisition and final vow.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>During a sky lantern release: anchors surface/subsurface parallelism, lantern-shadows rest on shoulders, ash descends as library’s saved sentences. Time tracked via rising lanterns, alters visual stakes.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>To discover the color of sound: desire stated early, conflicted against need to earn rather than borrow, culminates in carried silver tint. Drives every beat; removal breaks quest logic.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Meteor hush: fog thinning to meteor quiet, lanterns budding like mild stars, ash descending like patient snow—tone modulates from hush to silver listening. Coherent across turns, charges final image.</comment>
