<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Protagonist’s contradictory impulses—grief vs. compulsion to play—surface in embodied micro-choices (kneeling, lifting the shard, bow finding bridge). Interiority stays concrete, never drifts into label-speak; the fiddle case on hood, cold glass in pocket, and arm warmth all externalize hierarchy of values. Bridge-song vocation is not decorative but causal: it triggers the ledger’s re-write and physically draws the hitchhiker back into grain. Cost is felt: the new duet at the end forecloses solitary grief, completing a believable endurance-turn.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory return (maps fluttering, scaffold arrows aligning, river-light pixelating) reweights stakes until the glass clarifies and the ledger signs. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—warm arm pressure and shared tune—whose conceptual cost (the mountain’s debt cancellation) is undeniable. No orientation drift; who/where/when anchored by line 3. Persistent constraint: the fiddler must keep bow on bridge for the amnesty to stay legible, shaping every tactical move under the span.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setting acts as micro-instrument: guardrail “tired eyelid,” scaffold fabric city, river-light pixelating through lattice—all constrain movement and sight, forcing the protagonist to kneel, read, then play. Mountain pullout is not postcard but crucible; wind and traffic provide live metronome that the fiddler must play against. Final image—bridge trusses applausing—returns environment as active agent, sealing the ledger receipt.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether vanished hitchhiker can be reclaimed from pixelated ledger—tightens through sensory escalations: each gust that aligns scaffold arrows narrows the protagonist’s options until only the bow stroke remains. Agency is continuous: recounting climbs, kneeling, lifting shard, playing measure. Coincidence (arrows fluttering) complicates rather than rescues; the final warmth is earned by the fiddler’s resolve to play forgiveness into physical being. Cost is visible: glass clarifies, river mist beads on varnish, solitude foreclosed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of forgiveness-as-data and disappearance-as-debt emerges wordlessly from images—collodion peeling like moon languages, ledger hesitating, warmth where arm meets arm—never from thesis statements. Subtext operates in silence: hitchhiker’s “more rumor than man” status and the unreadable mountain ledger force reader to weigh technological absolution against flesh. Final non-literal answer: music read as policy, bridge-song as un-erasable pixel, reconfigures prior material without moral. Complexity lingers: the mountain may reopen its books at next crossing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>First-person lyric voice owns a perceptual signature—sound-as-bridge, wind-as-fray, light-as-pixel—held stable throughout. Compression (“pixelated amnesty,” “door click shaped maybe”) is taught early and paid off at closure when pixels resolve into grain. No head-hopping; hitchhiker’s speech arrives as bow-drawn ripples, maintaining POV modesty. Rhythm modulates: staccato listing of counted turns gives way to legato river-light sentences under the span.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or paraphrase churn; each sentence advances image, sound, or stakes. Metaphors are precise and non-contradictory: “emulsion peeling like a moon shedding languages” sustains photographic/celestial logic. Sentence variety accelerates with pressure—fragments (“You found the ledger”) under bridge—then exhales into longer harmonics. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by action (“now ours”) that recharges bridge-song motif.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fusion of wet-plate collodion, pixelated amnesty, and fiddle-as-bridge feels non-obvious and specific to this narrator; removal would collapse the causal engine. Ledger-as-mountain, forgiveness-as-data offer fresh inflection on ghost-recovery tale. Risk in lyric elision is rewarded: closure legible under accumulative lens without gimmickry. Particularity of mountaintop scaffold-map and bow-drawn ripples prevents template drift.</comment>
