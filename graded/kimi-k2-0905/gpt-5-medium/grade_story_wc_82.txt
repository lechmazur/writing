<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The lantern-maker’s grief is rendered through tactile craft rather than label; each micro-choice (polishing, steaming, folding cranes) externalizes the ache. The absence of a shadow functions as a lived body-state, not a metaphoric decal. Interior contradiction is palpable when he both longs for and fears the shadow’s return, yet the final laugh feels slightly un-earned because the prior beat shows only resignation—no new micro-choice signals the release. Still, the characterization stays within hailing distance of 9 because embodied emotion and tool-mediated agency remain consistent and specific.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the shadow touches but does not reattach, loosening grief’s weight without restoring the lost part—cost is the permanent partial absence. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each lantern crane adds density until the final image reconfigures meaning under sky. Causality is lyrical but coherent; nothing teleports, and the basilica’s rules (dream recording, descending stairs) are established before they matter. The ending’s felt cost is unmistakable in the phrase “the ache no longer drags at the world around his ankles.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Environment is not backdrop but instrument: the glass ribs scatter rainbow seed into lungs, constraining breath and pacing the polishing action. The floating island’s stair-inversion is not spectacle but tactical puzzle—he must climb to descend, a literal constraint that shapes the final release beat. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: a professional lantern-maker notices refractive indices, steam tension, bell-like chime of uncut stone. One hairline slip from 9: the tea shrubs “sleeping lungs” is lovely but momentarily abstract, not quite tethered to bodily risk.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will grief regain shape or stay formless—tightens through each lantern crane; the option of full restoration forecloses when the shadow touches but refuses re-entry. Escalation is Accumulative: every steam-folded crane increases emotional density until the release ripple. Cost is visible in the laugh that emerges “hoarse as a knotted rope,” a sonic record of strain. No external antagonist needed; the conflict is ontological—how to carry an absence—and the tightening is the growing flock of cranes seeking impossible return.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</question><comment>Theme emerges as the inverse of repair: wholeness is not restored; instead, the burden is made portable. The final image reframes the premise—grief is not a missing piece but a lantern flock one learns to release. No moral is stated; the basilica’s sky-altar offers only a question: what does it mean to be lightened by what still hurts? The thematic return of ribbons (originally stolen by the shadow) reweighted through cranes carries quiet resonance without symbolic billboard.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is a sustained lyric compression that teaches its own grammar: “light thickens,” “sky tastes of cellars.” Perceptual signature is lantern-maker-specific: vision measured in refraction, sound in bell-like chime, time in breaths between tea pours. Rhythm modulates—long clauses for ascent, fragment-breaths at the touch of dusk-hand—mirroring oxygen thinning on the inverted stair. No head-hop, no register drift; even the abbess’s speech is filtered through his ear for paradox.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Read-aloud ear rewards variable cadence; no template churn or paraphrase loops detected. Metaphors are dense yet internally coherent—vehicles stay within light/cellar/sip domains. Only micro-slip: “meadow of rainbows” momentarily mixes agricultural vehicle with glass architecture, but the clause is too brief to dilute closure. Opening and final lines anchor and re-charge the motif of ribbons/cranes with precise image economy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes familiar grief-quest with unfamiliar craft logic: lanterns that sip dreams, stairs that descend while ascending. Transformation test passed—generic grief story would collapse without the specific basilica physics. Risk (lyric accumulation rather than plot reversal) heightens coherence and pays off in final reconfiguration. Minor proximity echo to “folding grief into paper” trope is overridden by glass-crane innovation and inversion stair.</comment>
