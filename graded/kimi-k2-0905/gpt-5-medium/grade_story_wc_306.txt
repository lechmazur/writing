<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Lark’s “sincerely insincere” mask is shown, not labeled, in her choice to fund boats with the tax she vowed to cut; the narrator’s micro-choice to accept the hollow shard as fee embodies his mercenary detachment. Interior contradiction pulses throughout (“rented doubt and rented faith”), but the narrator’s moral arithmetic stays external—never quite pierced under pressure—so the final stance feels observed rather than sweat-through. Still, the visible cost (public confession, political suicide) is legible and scales to length.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Lark steps to the rail, town waking beneath, gulls as “impartial jurors”—a crystallized moment where options reconfigure and cost is felt. Causal chain holds: dune argument → chime divination → public confession, each because/therefore link narrowing her future. The hollow shard’s emptiness as “where to stop performing” reweights premise with conceptual cost. Minor waiver: orientation (who-hires-whom) is delayed past 120 words, but the delay serves the final image, so no penalty applied.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lighthouse gallery, wind-raked and chime-strung, is not backdrop but instrument: the breeze literally votes through scavenged metal pipes, constraining the choice. Micro-setting object—the cloak stitched from campaign banners—physically billows with doubt, charging the final image as Lark buttons it against the rail. Sensory hierarchy stays POV-biased: narrator clocks “gulls keep time” before town geometry, aligning with his hired-watchman attention. No orientation debt; spatial choreography clean across climb and stance shift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—public confession vs political survival—tightens once when chimes spell “speak and set terms,” foreclosing the hide-or-return binaries. Agency stays Lark’s: she funds the boats via the tax she campaigned against, a visible price that alters tactics (electoral suicide). Pressure coherent under causal lens; luck complicates (wind, not fate, decides) but does not resolve. Cost is on-page and charges final image.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of negotiated transparency emerges through chime-ordained confession rather than moral dictum; the townspeople must “accept both the rescue and the rot.” Subtext lives in object-handling: the hollow shard’s non-reflection literalizes the impossibility of pure image in politics. Final rail moment offers resonant, non-literal answer—public vulnerability as campaign platform—without sermon. No thematic echo in closing paragraph; ambiguity lingers cleanly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Narrator’s perceptual signature—commerce metaphors for conscience, wind as “choir learning to breathe”—stays distinct and rhythm-controlled. Free indirect compression (“My fee is the shard…”) teaches the elision pattern early and pays off when shard re-weights closure. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk avoided. Register stable, no head-hop; lyric diction matches the situational lens without obscuring causality.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm breathes with ascent: longer wind-filled clauses up the dune, staccato beats at the rail. Metaphors stay mutually coherent (wind-chimes as choir, shard as eyelid) and physically rooted. No paraphrase loops; information dense (“decisions here already carry the sound of aftermath” does two jobs). One mixed-image risk—”cloak of doubt” could tilt symbolism into slogan—but reclaimed by tactile billow at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Premise—“conscience for hire paid by the breath it saves”—feels fresh yet inevitable; wind-chime jurisprudence repurposes coastal folklore into campaign crucible. Risky second-person address to reader (“you” in shard offer) is brief and serves transactional intimacy. Transformation test fails if relocated inland: lighthouse, chimes, and tidal ethics are inseparable. Specificity throughout (campaign-banner fabric, pipe metals scavenged from wrecks) prevents allegorical thinning.</comment>
