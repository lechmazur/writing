<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The pacifist-daughter persona is vivid: her refusal to track, her whispered stories into irrigation tubes, her micro-choice to tie the sandbag scrap to a rose all embody an earned, costly gentleness. Interiority stays concrete (“hands remember restraint,” “thirst makes derision soften”) and her final vow to keep the farm open is the believable culmination of every prior decision. The only hairline slip: the father’s off-stage motives remain slightly opaque, so the emotional cost of his absence is felt more through her than through shared contradiction.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the protagonist’s decision to press the father’s letter to the sandbag scrap and tie both to the oldest rose reconfigures grief into continuity with undeniable conceptual cost. Causality under an Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each visitor’s softened knife, each rooted seedling, tightens the pattern until the final image crystallizes the stake—“turning ruin toward renewal.” The orientation anchor (dome, roses, heat) is clear by line 4; no lens ambiguity. Cost is legible in the final sentence: “This is my work, and it is enough to keep the world threaded.”</comment>

<comment>The glass-domed desert rose farm is not backdrop but active constraint: the dome makes derision “sound like thirst,” the roses physically lean toward memory, and the engravement of quiet governs behavior. Micro-setting objects—the frayed sandbag scrap, the broken-slate labels—are handled in beat-level actions that charge closure. Spatial choreography is pristine: visitors stall at thresholds, knives are laid on tables, the scrap is tied to trellis; no floating props. The final image of starlight gathered like dew on the dome reweights the entire atmosphere from menace to shared vow.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—whether mercy can outlive collapse—is signaled in line 1. Escalation is textural: each new footprint, each sheathed knife thickens the density of “engraved quiet” until the trio’s planted names physically narrow future revenge. Protagonist agency drives every turn: her invitation to plant, her tying of the scrap, her final vow. Cost is visible when a knife is literally softened into soil; the path of vengeance is foreclosed on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without thesis: mercy as a cultivated, thorny discipline that needs grafting onto ruin. Subtext lives in gesture—visitors laying knives on tables, roses drinking honeyed tea—never exposition. The ending’s conceptual repricing (blame must learn to breathe) is earned by the cumulative image of seedlings shading strangers. No moralizing; the final line’s “enough to keep the world threaded” is an image, not a maxim.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>First-person voice carries a distinct perceptual signature: heat scorches edges “smooth,” derision becomes “thirst,” debt pairs with “mercy” in a syntax that sounds like scripture reclaimed by a gardener. Rhythmic control under pressure—short declaratives when knives soften, lengthened cadence when night “lowers its velvet bucket”—mirrors emotional respiration. No head-hopping, no filter-verb clutter. Diction stays within a gardener-poet lexicon; “ballast sandbag scrap” is as rough as the voice allows.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or stake. Figurative language is disciplined—“thorns like tiny sundials set to mercy” is precise, never mixed. Information density high: one line can carry site (“glass-domed enclosure”), ethic (“inculcating plants with values”), and plot cue (“people come with knives”). Only hairline slip: occasional stacked adjectives (“honeyed tea,” “velvet bucket”) flirt with purple, but the cadence justifies the risk and never muddies causality at closure.</comment>

<comment>The pacifist-bounty-hunter’s-daughter tending post-collapse roses via speech-fed irrigation is a fresh synthesis; no trope checklist here. The sandbag scrap repurposed as memory-trellis transforms standard post-apocalypse debris into sacramental tool. Risk—in lyric accretion rather than plot reversals—pays off when the final image reweights collapse into continuity. Specificity throughout (“ballast sandbag scrap,” “broken-slate labels”) makes the concept un-stealable.</comment>
