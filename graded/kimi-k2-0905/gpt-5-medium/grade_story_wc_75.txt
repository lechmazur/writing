<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The museum guide’s contradictory impulse—cataloguing while fearing embalming—drives every micro-choice; the green-lens acceptance crystallizes a hierarchy of values with visible cost. Interiority stays concrete (“salt-tongued, ridiculous, hopeful”) and degrades under spray. No stock labels; traits filter diction and perception. The final vow feels earned because earlier refusals and wax failures foreclose retreat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the narrator swears seasonal return, foreclosing safe museum distance; cost is the lifelong nectar-armor of caretaking. Causal chain holds: bread初试 → wax软 → lens择 → vow, each because/therefore tightening options. Lens-as-selector rule is taught early and paid off in the mist test. No orientation debt; anchors clear by line 3.</comment>

<comment>Grotto, waterfall mist, and bee-smell constrain every move (ovens from cisterns, crumbs into wax). The green lens functions as micro-setting/tool hybrid that literally rewrites walls, charging the final image. Sensory hierarchy obeys crisis: children notice candle flicker, elders track driftwood fires. No static postcard; place evolves with each bread-letter launched into spray.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“rescue dying arts”—tightens when the lens reveals only viewed artifacts survive; the bread-letter launch is the visible price that forecloses passive cataloguing. Pressure escalates because earlier wax refusal hardens the need for a living archive. Stranger’s arrival complicates rather than resolves, forcing public mourning. Cost is chewed and swallowed live; no off-stage fix.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: memory must be edible, ingested, and re-excreted as breath, not embalmed. Bread=initials motif reweights from family quirk to civic survival; final mist-swallow makes the metaphor corporeal. Subtext in silence when hive quiets after crown dissolves. No moral—“keep our names warm” is sung, not lectured—leaving bittersweet ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>First-person perceptual signature is unwavering: limestone taste, hive-slick rope tug, opera balconies inside eyelids. Diction stays within curator-poet lexicon (“testimony,” “docent,” “crepe”) yet flexes under spray-pressure to fragment syntax. No head-hop; Senka’s speech is filtered through narrator’s green-glow overlay. Rhythm swells like waterfall cadence, then fractures at climax.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>High density: “We stacked loaves shaped like A for Arkady… eaten, crumbs sprinkled into wax molds” compresses ritual, name, and material transfer in one breath. Mixed metaphors (“nectar armor,” “historical seams”) stay coherent within bee/honey rule-set. Zero loops; no scaffold. One hairline slip—“history tug like a hive-slick rope” edges purple but earns its visceral snap at peak beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>Fusing museum cataloguing with edible typography and apian necromancy is non-obvious; bread-as-archive feels inevitable only after consumption. Risk of lyrical overload is embraced yet controlled: waterfall stage-curtain that bleeds honey ribbons transforms kitsch into civic oracle. Grotto setting displaces war refugees downward, inverting surface/depth tropes. Synthesis is total—no swap possible without collapse.</comment>
