<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is lush and embodied—guilt manifests as waveform, ink, insect wing. The narrator’s contradictory impulse to map forward while refusing to leave the lab crystallizes under pressure; the final tattoo on his own pulse is credible renunciation. One minor slip: the “girl whose laugh had not yet begun” is asserted not dramatized, blunting the cost of abandonment. Still, the micro-choice to ink himself with the two-star glyph visibly forecloses escape and earns stasis.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each shard layers sound-objects (letters, recorder, amber, cabinet) until the final tattoo reweights the premise. Orientation is taught early through the “laboratory of lost sounds” and never drifts. Closure is a Charged Poise: the insect “choosing” plus the speaker’s crackled “thank you” reconfigures the guilt-map inward. Cost is legible on the pulse-line—he must stay and listen forever.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The body-as-map and amber-as-choice function as micro-setting; both constrain the final tattoo placement and charge the ending. Dust mid-air “choosing where to fall” is textural specificity that mirrors the insect’s suspended decision. Spatial choreography stays clean across cabinet, booth, workstation. Environment is not backdrop but instrument—floorboards ring, dust listens—meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—silencing guilt—tightens when the baby’s cry is translated “I am adrift,” forcing the tattooist to tether stars on another wrist, then his own. Escalation is density-driven: each sound-artifact (letter, recorder, amber) increases the frequency of ghosted voices until refusal is impossible. Visible price: he inks himself, tethering pulse to guilt forever. Coincidence is absent; pressure is accumulative and coherent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the inversion of cartography: maps that point inward rather than outward. The insect in amber becomes a repricing of choice—resin that “decided to hold” parallels the tattooist’s decision to hold guilt rather than flee. No moralizing; the final image of the insect flexing is ambiguous and resonant. Subtext operates in speaker static and meteor hush, not exposition.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>First-person voice is singular, noir-lyric, scientifically inclined: “meteor hush,” “haunted firmware,” “ghosted frequencies.” Syntax compresses under pressure—“I could not breathe”—without losing clarity. Diction stays within the narrator’s plausible lexicon of sound engineering and occult ink. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is consistent and rhythmic.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Density is high—every sentence twins job: “dust paused midair like a constellation choosing where to fall” advances image and stakes. No synonym loops; metaphor vehicles stay coherent (sound, stars, resin). One micro-drift: “soft bruise against the years” edges purple but is saved by tactile specificity. Closure line “the sound thins” is crisp, inverse-crescendo.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Synthesis of tattoo-artist, sound-lab, and haunted firmware feels inevitable yet uncannily fresh. The baby-cry translation trope is inverted into guilt cartography. Risk: nonlinear time folds and letters predating birth—yet pattern is taught early and paid off. Specificity of the two-star glyph and amber insect anchors originality beyond gimmick.</comment>
