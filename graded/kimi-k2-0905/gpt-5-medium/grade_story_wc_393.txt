<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Chaplain’s interiority is concrete—his guilt mirror and jaw-clench recall show embodied emotion. Micro-choice—leaving credit card, practicing words—exposes hierarchy of values. Jonah remains off-page, so relationship crucible and status bullets skipped; interior contradiction and micro-choices under pressure satisfy the 9+ quick test. Final renunciation of borrowed doctrine is earned by prior causality with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: because the thorn snags, therefore the heart can restart; because it ticks, Jonah must choose. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): ticking heart crystallizes options with felt cost in the booth. Cost is legible—“the booth filled with a silence that listened back.” Persistent constraint—Jonah must keep tomorrow’s time—shapes the final image; no slips touch closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Repair-shop micro-setting functions as setting; its bench lamp and oils constrain the repair ritual and charge the final image. Dust-motes, velvet box, and brass filings are selective sensory details filtered through chaplain’s patience. Spatial choreography is clean—box slid, credit-card pushed back. Environment, body, tool trifecta met; 9+ quick test passed.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—Jonah’s need for a rhythm to deserve freedom—is signaled early and tightens when the thorn is removed, narrowing options to “choose again tomorrow.” Escalation is driven by chaplain’s agency under causal lens; cost is visible in the silence that listens back. One meaningful tightening suffices at this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars—clockwork as moral gravity, apology as map—never stated. Final image of apology-become-map reweights prior material without moral. Subtext in silence, box-tick, and withheld payment invites reflection. No final-paragraph moralizing; resonance is earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person close maintains stable distance; perceptual signature—light through storm clouds, “hinges inside them seize”—is character-specific. Compression and elision (“I listen for lives”) are taught early and paid off. No dialogue to judge; prose rhythm modulates with emotional intensity. Head-hopping absent; 9+ quick test met.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and cadence; no template cadence or synonym loops. Metaphors are coherent—“gears set like teeth in an uncertain smile”—and do not collide. Information density high: “velvet lining cradling a clockwork heart that would not wind” does three jobs in eleven words. Zero artifacts in final third; closure image pristine.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Premise—chaplain repairs inmate’s moral clockwork—feels fresh, not template. Synthesis of guilt-as-gravity and apology-as-map is non-obvious and inevitable in hindsight. Risk in lyric density pays off without obscuring causality. Specificity of brass filings, thorn-as-doubt, and deferred verdict create memorable texture.</comment>
