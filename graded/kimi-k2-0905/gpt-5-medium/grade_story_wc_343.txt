<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The apprentice’s curiosity is concrete—sleeping under charts, compass dust—but the decisive chalk-reading choice is lightly motivated; we’re told of docks-hopscotch memory rather than shown how that past forces this night-risk. Interiority is atmospheric, not contradictory; no visible flaw-cost beyond “pretended not to glow,” which is performative rather than embodied price. Earned Stasis qualifies but the cost is poetic, not tangible. Still, voice-specific attention (compass dust, kettle-lid note) keeps the character individuated.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a lyric Conceptual Repricing: the figure-eight trace frees the light and re-casts the apprentice’s insomnia as successful method; cost is conceptual—language snared mid-utterance, ropes unprickled, town’s dawn restored—felt on page (“tongues our own again”). Accumulative/Textural lens holds: starling vectors + chalk grid + hopscotch numerals tighten into one pattern break that releases luminance. Orientation clear by line 4; no causality gaps. Pattern taught early (dog-ear grid) and paid off in final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Airship Petrel functions as micro-setting: rigging hums, deck-rings agree, gondola windows frame choices; tool-objects (sextant, kettle, chalk board) constrain navigation tactics. Starling flock and static halos supply sensory hierarchy filtered through map-apprentice bias. Spatial choreography clean—no impossible drift positions. Final image (“leaving our ropes unprickled”) recharges rigging detail. No environment-forcing choice beyond chalk board, so stays below 8.8 gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—map the stranded light—signaled in paragraph 4; pressure tightens when halos gather on rigging and birds dictate diagonals. One meaningful deepening: decoding hopscotch numerals reweights navigation options under luminous pressure. Agency is attention and chalk-acted instruction that forecloses prior drift-randomness; cost is the momentary seizure of speech/internal light. No visible resource lost, so cost is atmospheric, not tangible—keeps it from 8.8+ band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges as “language becomes motion/light” through concrete recurrence: polyglot scraps, bird-diagonals, chalk numerals, figure-eight trace. No explicit thesis; final image reconfigures meaning without moral. Particulars (dock hopscotch, grease-mottled dog-ear) prevent abstraction. Quiet ending earns resonance by tying apprentice’s insomnia to town’s revived dawn. Avoids tidy moral; ambiguity lingers in whether chart will ever be believed.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>First-person perceptual signature is consistent and texture-rich: “compass dust on my cheek,” “wink that smelled of clove smoke,” “ribs were lantern slats.” Diction stays within apprentice’s plausible lexicon; syntax flexes with awe (“the engine hush was bright”). No dialogue to judge; internal thought clean in tense. Purposeful compression (“I solved the rumor the way a child solves weather”) teaches lyric pattern paid off at closure. No head-hopping; distance stable.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>High information density: each sentence layers sensorium + navigation fact + emotional tint. Metaphors disciplined—no mixed vehicles; “gauze soaked in mint” stays within tactile/light field. Rhythm varies: longer anacrusis for dusk, staccato for chalk numbers. Minor scaffold: two “note” verbs adjacent in log-writing beat (−0.2). No loops or synonym churn; opening and final lines anchor voice and reweight motif. Clean grammar, pronouns, tense.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fusion of starling murmuration geometry with antique airship navigation feels fresh; hopscotch numerals as flight protocol is non-obvious synthesis. Detail particularises trope—light trapped in sky-lanes made honey-frost, not generic aurora. Conceptual integrity held: linguistic scraps → bird vectors → chalk code → freed light. Risk in lyric accumulative structure pays off; no close pop-culture echoes. Slight 0.2 dock for airborne hopscotch convenience.</comment>
