<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The scribe’s interior contradiction—record vs. refuse the harmful oath—drives every beat; the final renunciation costs the future archive, visible in the folded, rain-softened parchment. Micro-choices (shaving the wax, releasing the stylus) embody the conflict; embodied emotion (“pin in my breath”) recurs with credibility. No status or relationship crucible is on-page, so those bullets are waived; single-POV interiority stays specific and flawed. The 9+ gate fails only because the cost is more conceptual than viscerally felt in the final image.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the narrator folds the prophecy away, accepting unarchived mercy, a path foreclosed with legible cost (“the future shifts enough to shelter a child's unpinned breath”). Causality is lyric-accumulative: the cylinder memory → basin experiment → prophecy → refusal, each beat tightening agency. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds; pattern taught early via “method, not magic.” No orientation debt; space/time anchors bloom by line 10. Wax shaving and orchard both charge the final image, satisfying 9+ quick test.</comment>

<comment>The rooftop orchard is no postcard: wind access, root tension, quince weight all shape the choice to withhold the vow. Micro-objects—rainwatered basin, wax ribbon—constrain action (immersion, shaving, folding). Sensory hierarchy stays POV-bound: narrator notices bark scent, phonograph dust, thumbbone echoes, never tourist catalog. Final image of unwritten parchment recharged by earlier “archive is a house of careful hauntings,” fulfilling 9+ gate.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—archive versus mercy—tightens once: prophecy forces the choice “record harm or refuse work.” Agency is active (shave wax, hum note, fold parchment); refusal pays visible cost (loss of future archive, city’s vowels). Escalation is conceptual deepening, not causal reversals, appropriate to Accumulative lens. Cost is legible on-page: “the orchard sighs… the future shifts.”</comment>

<comment>Theme—archiving as act of violence versus mercy—emerges through images (quinces bruised like unspoken vows, wax dust refusing sweeping). No final moralizing; the blessing “in a language so old it only describes weather” offers resonant non-literal answer. Subtext in basin’s glassy eye, orchard’s linen sigh. Ambiguity lingers: did refusal spare the child or merely delay harm? Complexity earned, not asserted.</comment>

<grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>First-person perceptual signature is relentless: verbs rustle like moths, rainwater “remembers roofs,” orchard wraps “velvet disquiet.” Rhythm modulates with pressure—short clauses at prophecy moment, then elongated linen-loosened sigh. No dialogue, so dialogue bullets waived. POV modesty intact: “I feel the orchard lean” reads as inference, not omniscience. Patterned elision (dead languages as lullabies) taught early and paid off at blessing.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentence-level propulsion high; nearly every line doubles duty (image + causality: “I shave the wax thread thinner… let it sink… hum the harbor note”). Metaphors stay coherent within lyric physics (“ribbon of dust… arranging themselves like punctuation”). One paraphrase loop detected (“the orchard drops its fruit” repeated with identical syntax) triggers −0.2; not in closure beat, so 9+ allowed elsewhere. Otherwise zero scaffold, strong verbs, audible rhythm.</comment>

<grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise—skyscraper orchard as archive of oaths—feels inevitable yet unseen; synthesizes mythic pact with urban vertigo. Risk of lyric non-causal structure is embraced and paid off. Specific detail (“wax cylinder phonograph shaving I found in a courthouse renovation”) anchors freshness. Transformation test fails if names changed: orchard-on-roof + oath cylinder is inseparable. No close echoes; voice singular.</comment>
