<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The restorer’s solitary labor is credibly embodied—every motion of needle and palm carries the weight of salt-death. Interior contradiction surfaces in the tug between sealing ghosts away and letting them breathe, shown when the narrator “taught [joy] how to rest” beside grief. The final act of lifting the rewoven mask to the face crystallizes a renunciation: no exorcism, only stewardship, paid for with cut fingers and prismatic scars. One hairline slip: the caretaker’s winter-grip catch is briefly observed from outside the POV, a microscopic leakage that keeps this just shy of 9.0.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the masks ringed round the salt-locket hearth, tide paused as if its pupils “turned toward us.” Causality is Accumulative/Textural—each unraveled knot off-loads breath-history until the sanctuary’s hush changes weight; the final hush is heavier because it is chosen, not hoarded. Orientation is taught in the first 40 words via the cathedral-of-rainbows image; time and place remain anchored through recurrent starlight glints on glass. Cost is unmistakable: “the needle drank the room, and the room did not protest” simultaneously drains the sanctuary and fills the masks with footing.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The prism sanctuary itself functions as a micro-setting tool: every refracted star-beam constrains where the narrator can stand without casting disruptive color. The whalebone needle’s polished shaft, “dipped in the hush of constellations,” becomes a portable environment whose vacuum-pocket dictates the pacing of every stitch. Spatial choreography is pristine: the iron stair, the net hung high, the ring of masks on the floor track cleanly as bodies orbit the locket-hearth. Weather outside (tide softening, gull crying once) is filtered through interior pressure, never decorative.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake: will the hush accumulate into anchoring or suffocation? Escalation is textural—each loosened knot thickens the emotional density until the air becomes “dense enough for the spirits to stand on.” The protagonist’s agency is relentless: every choice to unravel, braid, or thread reconfigures what the sea may reclaim. The price is cumulative rather than a single decisive payment, hence it stops just short of the 8.8 gate that demands a visible, felt price on the final beat; the cost is legible but diffused across the lyric weave.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges as: stewardship over banishment; silence is not absence but artifact. Subtext lives in gesture—kiss of salt-white hair, palm to floor—never exposition. The final image of tide “accepting the shape of the shore” offers a Conceptual Repricing: the sea’s hunger is not defeated but re-negotiated, a boundary redrawn without moralizing. Ambiguity persists: does grounding the spirits free or imprison them? The story refuses to resolve, letting the aftertaste taste like brine and glass.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Voice is a sustained lyric first-person whose perceptual signature is prismatic: every noun is filtered through refraction—light, glass, salt, star. Syntax elongates then snaps (echoing net thread) as in “I almost fell, but the caretaker caught me with a grip that remembered winter,” rhythm matching lung-breath under hush-accumulation. No dialogue; instead murmured names function as indirection that advances the exhuming goal. Register stays inside a plausible restorer’s lexicon, elevating only when the sublime is physically handled (“constellations,” “scripture”)—the diction is earned by the sanctuary’s cathedral aura.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Line-level craft is near flawless: each metaphor is singular, no mixed vehicles; “patient rainbows,” “sleeping lung” extend imagery without contradiction. Density is high—sentence openings vary, no template cadence; information is braided (knot = breath = memory) so lines perform double duty. Micro-loop only: “hush” is repeated but accrues semantic weight, hence permitted pattern. The closing sentence folds the ladders back into night, a crystalline echo of the opening cathedral, satisfying the read-aloud ear test.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: ghost-grounding via net-unraveling reframes maritime folklore through textile metaphysics. Risk—lyric accumulation instead of因果 plot—pays off because pressure coheres inside the hush-density. Specificity anchors universals: salt-bleached hair, whalebone needle, prism starlight could belong to no other tale. The premise commits fully; no retreat into conventional exorcism, producing an inevitable yet non-obvious closure image.</comment>
