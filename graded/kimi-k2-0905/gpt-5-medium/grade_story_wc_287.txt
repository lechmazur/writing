<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The narrator’s contradictory impulses—grief’s paralysis vs. the need to “reflect light”—collide in the embodied tremor of picking the lock; the brass tooth is handled, not talked about. Micro-choices (kneeling on cold stone, sheltering the match like a fledgling) reveal a hierarchy of values where tending life outweighs safety. The final renunciation—staying to keep the beam turning—pays the concrete cost of perpetual exposure to wind and memory, foreclosing escape. Interiority stays concrete, never drifts into label-speak; even “forgiveness” is filtered through the image of broken windows becoming eyes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal chain is pristine: dropped petal → promise → skiff → lock → lantern → beam → child pointed at. Each because/therefore linkage narrows options until the last click locks the protagonist into caretaking. Closure is Earned Stasis: the decision to stay and rotate the light carries the visible cost of perpetual vigil. Orientation lands by line 3 (“fire escape gardener”), spatial anchors hold across the rowing sequence, and the inferred lens (Causal) is never broken.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The brass tooth functions as micro-setting: its cold gauge-notches dictate the pacing of the pick, constraining breath and wrist angle. Harbor geography is economical—neon sighs, sleeping gulls, broken-window fish plant—each detail filtered through the gardener’s eye for what can be coaxed to life. Weather (salt-bitten hinges, moon shoals) actively resists and enables the lockpick. Spatial choreography is flawless: railing glow, skiff patch-mends, ladder rungs, catwalk under lens—every coordinate tracked without drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—keep the harbor lit to honour the mother—tightens when the padlock clicks: the protagonist now shoulders perpetual vigil. Agency is crystallized in the match-strike that lights the wick; coincidence never rescues. Cost is immediate and felt: cold stone through pants, brittle wick risking failure, future nights spent rotating the beam. One meaningful intensification suffices; the beam’s first sweep reweights all prior grief into duty.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: tending life in broken places—gardens on iron, light in a dark lighthouse—parallels grief-work that refuses to abandon. The brass tooth migrates from personal keepsake to public instrument, repricing memory as service. Subtext in the child’s wordless pointing offers a prayer that needs no creed, resisting tidy moral. Final image of “slips of light” rooted in bricks carries conceptual cost: vulnerability becomes architecture.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>First-person voice is irreducibly specific: “fire escape gardener,” “small brass thing,” “quiet thunder in the pilings.” Syntax lengthens and shortens with oar-stroke breaths; cadence teaches its pattern early and pays off in the match-strike fragment. No head-hopping; perceptual signature stays anchored to tactile detail—salt, rust, oil skin. Diction never exceeds the self-taught lexicon of locks and soil.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm is supple; sentence openings vary, paragraphs breathe with scene tempo. Metaphors are sparse, precise: moon “shoals,” lantern “breathes like someone waking.” No paraphrase loops or scaffold; information density is high—one sentence often layers sensory, emotional, and causal work. Minor register lift in “congregation of eyes learning to forgive” stays justified by the heightened final beam sweep.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The gardener-who-picks-locks synthesis feels inevitable yet fresh; premise could not transplant to another vocation without collapse. Brass tooth as living memory-tool repurposes a niche trade into grief ritual. Risk of lyric montage (neon, gulls, moon) pays off because each image is later re-weighted by the turning beam. Harbour-as-sleeping-lung avoids cliché by tangible respiration in the oar-pulse.</comment>
