<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The knight’s interiority is gorgeously embodied—gauntlets clicking out choreography, gorget falling so he can “hear the leaves without the ring of metal.” Contradictory impulses (soldier vs. seed-tender) coil inside every beat; the final murmured allegiance is earned by the mother-memory cue and the tongue-pressed kernel. No stock phrasing; even static is tasted. Micro-choices (climb, unsnap, taste) chart a visible hierarchy of values. Closure cost is the thunder he will no longer give the world—felt in the hush after theater bells.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: every image layer (constellation-rooted glass, fossilized pollen slab, mercury sap) tightens the same stake—possibility vs. singular choice. Closure is Conceptual Repricing: the kernel on tongue rewrites the rule-set—he exits the greenhouse already living an unwritten morning. Causality is lyrical but legible: script cues → ladder → kernel → new vow. Cost is legible in the line “armor abandoned to rust into reeds” projected inside the reel of mornings. No orientation debt; who/where/when arrive by line 3 and evolve with the greenhouse.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Alchemical orchard is not backdrop but constraint: mercury sap sinks, branches braid into proscenium, fossilized pollen slab becomes altar. Body, tool, and setting triad converge when the ladder “written by bees” is the only path to the kernel. Constellation-glass and lantern crucibles charge the final image—nectar hisses where mornings drip, re-pricing the world. Spatial choreography is flawless: boots click, rows rearrange, clearing offers proscenium. Setting literally scripts his steps; remove it and the climb is impossible.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“capture the shape of possibility”—is signaled in paragraph 1 and tightened to one kernel. Escalation is density-driven: each grafted star, humming equation, and nectar droplet narrows infinity to a single taste. Agency persists; he climbs, chooses, presses kernel to tongue, releasing other futures. Cost is the plural mornings he forfeits—shown in the reel he watches but will not enter. No reversal, but a deepening that changes knowledge: possibility is not hoarded but inhabited.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</question><comment>Theme emerges from the contradiction between martial thunder and orchard murmur; no sentence states “war vs. nurture.” Subtext lives in objects: marionette program = maternal script, kernel = unwritten history. Final image offers resonant non-literal answer: theater bells ring inside the greenhouse, equating battlefields with stage curtains. Complexity is honored—he is not pacifist but re-allied to tending rather than taking. No moralizing; the nectar hisses the equation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person intimate maintains consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature is knight-specific—armor clicks, blood hears cue, tongue tests static. Syntax mirrors measured breath: long anastrophic phrases when he moves softly, fragment-like ladder line when ascent demands effort. No head-hopping; mother appears only in his memory-filter. Register never drifts above his war-taught lexicon yet can name “proscenium” because theater program taught him. Compression (“shivering bliss”) is taught early and paid off in final taste.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Rhythm breathes with scene: caesura-rich sentences for orchard hush, staccato clause-chain for climb. Metaphors are internally coherent—stars graft, equations splice, nectar hisses; no mixed vehicles. Information density high: one sentence can splice memory, object, and world-rule. Loops absent; no scaffold phrases. Artifacts zero; even neologisms (“apple stars, quince comets”) obey taught pattern. Closure line “possibility settle into him like a homecoming” lands clean, no overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fusing alchemical laboratory with puppet-theater stagecraft is fresh; crucibles as lantern fruit and script cues as orchard map feel inevitable yet unvisited. Traveling puppet-troupe mother seed reframes chivalric quest into backstage rehearsal—specific, not abstract. Transformation test fails if knight is generic soldier; his “bones echo long after wars” and tongue-pressed kernel make this irreplaceable. Risk-taking (lyric causal chain, non-antagonist plot) heightens meaning without gimmick. Conceptual integrity absolute—world commits to its own botany-of-sky rules.</comment>
