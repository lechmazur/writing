<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The librarian’s hinge-hearted patience and cataloguing obsession are vivid, but the only micro-choice—accepting the woman’s triple cards—feels performed rather than pressured; no interior contradiction is dramatized under the moon-phase stakes, so the “keep” vow at the end, while resonant, is not visibly paid for by prior causal struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly as Earned Stasis: the librarian shoulders the indefinite, tide-driven duty of remembering, a conceptual cost legible in the final “keep” exchange; lens is Accumulative/Textural—density and cadence reweight wonder versus routine; orientation is taught early via sensory anchors, no caps triggered.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The tidal atrium, creel, and bell-metal corner are tactile micro-settings that constrain procedure (filing, smelting, word-catching) and return charged in the final hush; salt, kelp, and bell-resonance mirror the migratory identity stakes, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Migratory identity is the dominant stake, signaled early; pressure tightens when the woman’s three cards collapse to one unpronounceable name via the bell-metal acceptance—an on-page trade-off with felt cost; escalation is textural (cadence, imagery) rather than causal reversals, permissible under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges non-literally: memory as tidal labor versus wonder; the creel-to-bell progression reweights “remembering is wonder doing chores,” avoiding moralizing; ambiguity lingers about what the moon will eventually erase, giving after-resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>First-person perceptual signature is sustained: salt-flecked diction, hinge clicks, minnow-words; rhythmic escalation mirrors tidal inhale/exhale; no head-hopping; invented compounds (“titan-gear,” “wintersun”) stay legible and pattern-taught.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Lyric density is high yet purposeful; each metaphor extends the tidal clockwork conceit without mixed logic; no synonym loops or filter-verb stacks; final “keep, keep, keep” repetition is earned cadence, not artifact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The library-as-tide-pool conceit synthesizes memory, identity, and archival labor in a way that feels inevitable yet fresh; risk in lyric ellipsis pays off because closure remains legible; specific detail (chlorophyll signature, migratory pitch) prevents generic allegory.</comment>
