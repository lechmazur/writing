<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The narrator’s contradictory need for both silence and confession is embodied in every beat; the lattice object externalizes the split. Interiority stays concrete—“wolves into every shadow,” “brine of a promise kept”—never drifting into label-speak. Micro-choices (climbing, placing the lattice over the drain) crystallize values under pressure. Cost is felt: the inherited lie is loosened but not erased, and the open door implies future peril.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each image adds density until the lattice + drain moment reweights meaning. Closure is Charged Poise—the hush becomes “a soft animal in a trap,” foreclosing the old reflex to cry wolf. Orientation is delivered obliquely by line 3 but suffices for lyric mode. Cost is legible: “I could steer the current of what came next” shows the price of silence assumed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The lighthouse-prison is not backdrop: barred sightlines force prisoners to “see what they were not touching,” a constraint that shapes the narrator’s desire to cup silence. Copperlight, salt-green locks, gulls laughing like verdicts—each detail is filtered through the POV’s guilt-ear. The lattice acts as portable micro-setting; its squares physically throttle sound, enabling the final transfer. Spatial choreography is clean: pier → door → ribs → lens → drain.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“trade false alarms for a truer bell”—is signaled early. Pressure escalates by accretion of sensory detail; the arrival of the boat is the first external complication, but agency remains internal (will he speak?). One meaningful tightening: placing lattice over drain surrenders the option to expose the bodies. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral; the final hush forecloses confession.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the inversion of the wolf-fable: silence, not shouting, becomes the moral risk. Subtext lives in objects—lattice as confessional grill, green locks as corroded judgments. Final image (“the hush would be guiding them, not the lie of my inheritance”) reweights prior motifs without moralizing. Ambiguity is purposeful: the withheld bodies keep ethical tension alive.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>First-person voice owns a perceptual signature: maritime diction (“copperlight,” “sleepwalk surf”) and ecclesiastical cadence (“confessional,” “truer bell”) interlace. Rhythm swells and recedes like tide; long sentences climb the spiral, fragments appear at stress points. No head-hopping; compression (“I told her it all at once”) is taught early and paid off. Distinctive syntax—“the hush I was chasing felt like something I could cup”—is irreplicable.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lines carry triple duty: “salt turned the locks green and the guards slower” advances plot, paints world, echoes moral corrosion. No synonym loops or template cadence; metaphor logic stays consistent (“lighthouse sustains impossibilities the way a jar keeps a firefly”). One mixed metaphor—“lighthouse prison off a jagged reef behind me like a rumor pinned to the horizon”—is earned by lyric mode. Closure image is clean, propulsive.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The conceit of a lighthouse whose light is turned inward to imprison sight feels inevitable yet fresh. Inversion of the wolf myth into a parable about voluntary silence is non-obvious. Specificity—“gulls learned to laugh like they were practicing a verdict”—prevents allegorical slide. Risk in lyric structure heightens resonance without obscuring closure.</comment>
