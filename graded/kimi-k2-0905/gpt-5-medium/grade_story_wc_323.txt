<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The narrator-instructor’s contradictory yearning—teaching students to “navigate by starlight they cannot see” while clinging to a rusted anchor link—gives a credible, embodied flaw. Micro-choices (night crawls to map erased edges, the chain thudding against his thigh) keep interiority concrete. The final bow with open palms crystallizes Earned Stasis: he accepts the cost of lifelong exile from the surface sky. No secondary character presses him, so relationship crucible is N/A; head-count stays within default.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory layer (kelp shadows, thermal edges, lamp-glare that “makes the water forget”) thickens until the alien reply reweights the whole texture. Closure is a Charged Poise: the folded-horizon blossom reframes prior mappings, cost felt in the narrator’s hush—“the unknown begins to feel like a coordinate.” Orientation anchors arrive by line 3; no ambiguity. Persistent constraint: every new bulb erases subtler star-imprints, tightening tactics.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The anchor link functions as micro-setting: its salt-pitted mass constrains pocket choice, thigh rhythm, and memory of surface gravity. Benthic dome geometry—ceilings “ripple like slow glass,” lamps erase star edges—directly shapes the narrator’s cartographic obsession. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: sonar scrolls dull, but pressure and echo sharpen. Final image recharges the link as counterweight to unfolded horizons, meeting 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prove to himself that star-navigation is still possible—tightens when each city lamp erases an imprint. The night crawl is the visible price (stamina, isolation). Alien reply folds horizons, reweighting stakes without external rescue. Cost is legible; could edge higher if a concrete tactical loss (broken tool, student defection) had bitten on-page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the tension between measurable edges and unseeable stars; no moralizing statement intrudes. The anchor’s remembered weight versus the aliens’ weightless folded planes reconfigures what “navigation” means. Final resonance—“let the horizon unfold until it tells you where to fall”—offers a non-literal, irreversible answer. Image pattern (edge, fold, pressure) accumulates rather than labels.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet disciplined: nautical precision (“scarp of the continental shelf”) collides with submerged mysticism (“sky turned inward”). Syntax lengthens and compresses with pressure; no template cadence. Perceptual signature—density kisses density, shimmer is born—stays instructor-specific. Filter verbs appear only when sonar distance is the point; no head-hop.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>High information density: one sentence can map, characterize, and foreshadow (“I feel the cold ring of cause and the chain that holds us here”). Metaphors stay coherent within liquid physics. One mixed image—“petals on a cold machine”—but pays off when aliens unfold exactly that geometry. Minor synonym swirl around “edges” but never clogs closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Takes the tired “post-contact underwater city” trope and makes navigation pedagogy the emotional engine. Edge-geometry as starless astronavigation feels inevitable yet fresh. Risk of lyric obscurity is embraced and paid off in the final folded blossom. Specificity of salt-roughened chain versus alien abstraction creates an unforgettable internal/external polarity.</comment>
