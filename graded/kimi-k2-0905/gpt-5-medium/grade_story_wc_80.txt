<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority is rich—"firm shore surveyor" observes through silt-senses and carp-echoes—but the micro-choices remain observational rather than decisive. No visible contradiction is dramatized; the "archaeologist" desire is declared, never tested against resistance. The final note is summary, not a moment of embodied trade-off, muting earned change.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each slip of paper layers absence into pattern; closure lands with Conceptual Repricing—"map its living gaps, and to love them until they answer" reweights prior material with cost of witness. Orientation is late; "drowned promenade" not anchored until ~130 words, but the disorientation serves the payoff and is waived. No causal rupture, one legible shard, pattern taught early.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Submerged pavilion body and inkwell tool act as micro-setting: inkwell handled in three beats—satchel, lid-snap, copying names—charging final image. Silt-smell, green-water light, and rust-crown graffiti are filtered through surveyor’s professional gaze, guiding note-placement. Spatial choreography clean; no impossible moves. Environment constrains entry and dictates cataloguing method, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</question><comment>Dominant stake—mapping absence—signals early and tightens through each slip placed; cost legible in "restraint is a flame." Escalation is accumulative: each foundation seam filled with testimony increases density rather than narrowing external options. One meaningful shift at the cabinet wrest, but no further tightening; pressure plateaus rather than spikes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</question><comment>Theme of "interlaced absence" emerges from concrete slips, rust dates, and silted program, never abstract assertion. Final note reframes earlier cataloguing as loving gaps—resonant reconfiguration without moral. Subtext carried in inkwell hush and fox bark across iron, not exposition. Avoids tidy moral; ambiguity lingers, anchored to surveyor’s patience.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</question><comment>First-person perceptual signature is distinct: "boots remembering former thresholds," "tripod coughs," "lighthouse shutting its eye." Syntax mirrors surveyor’s calibrated mind—parallelisms, hyphenated compounds—without monotony. No dialogue, so voice remains pure; diction stays within lexicon of meticulous technician-poet. Compression is patterned early and paid off in final "hushed blaze" reprise.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</question><comment>High metaphor density but pattern-taught and coherent—water, fire, archival motifs recur with purpose. Mixed metaphors minor: "river loosens its grip" vs. "wind pushes like a reluctant broom" scan fine. No synonym loops; sentences vary in length and opening. One scaffold paraphrase: "I did not come merely to measure" echoing prior intent; deduct −0.2. Closure image crisp.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</question><comment>Flooded ballroom archaeology via ink-graphed absence feels fresh; synthesis of cartographer and mourner not templated. Specifics—water-bitten program, rust crown of graffiti—anchor novelty. Risk in lyric accumulative structure pays off in final bioluminescent image. Could edge higher if one irreversible physical consequence accompanied conceptual cost.</comment>
