<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The narrator’s contradictory impulses—guilt-driven return vs. fear of the digital ghost—are dramatized in every micro-choice (warming the radio, scraping frost, aligning the dish). The porcelain shard as both wound and lens externalizes the flaw that once blinded the array; its final pocketing is a credible renunciation that costs the comfort of forgetting. Interiority is sensorial (“taste of iron,” “staccato I cannot slow”) rather than diagnostic. The heartbeat counting is not a quirk but a pacing device that collides with agency when speech must interrupt it to survive.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>A textbook Accumulative/Textural lens: each lyrical return of “after the radio static clears” tightens the same stake—can the narrator bear to face the error—until the final fade-out reconfigures meaning without expository hand-holding. The closure image (shard-as-lens pocketed under opal snow) is a Charged Poise that reprices earlier blindness as portable vigilance; cost is felt in the relinquishing of absolution. Orientation is taught by sensory immediacy within 50 words; no caps triggered. Causality is intact: the ghost’s coordinates arise from the narrator’s own archived voice, so the mistake is self-authored and self-repaired.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The opal dome, frost-latticed eyepiece, and ink crawling toward heat are not postcard backdrop but instruments the protagonist handles to re-calibrate both telescope and conscience. Micro-setting supremacy: the porcelain shard’s crescent becomes a portable moon that refracts dawn light onto the ink, literally re-weighting how the past is read. Sensory hierarchy obeys crisis—sound of snow settling, taste of iron—while quieter beats admit milky color. No occupational exposition dumps; technical terms (frequency, fill, packets) enter only when they alter tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single dominant stake: fetch wisdom from the self-inflicted data burn. Escalation is textural—each static-clearing recurrence deepens the same wound rather than pivoting plot—but the final alignment of the dish is a visible narrowing of options that forecloses eternal self-haunting. Cost is legible: the mentor’s laugh thaws into the admission “you merely believed yourself big enough to,” forcing the narrator to trade absolution for ongoing vigilance. No coincidences; the ghost is archival echo, not deus-ex-machina.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: error is not cosmic doom but human scale mistaken for godhood. The porcelain shard’s journey from domestic breakage to portable lens enacts the moral repricing—wisdom is carried, not consumed. Subtext lives in silence: the radio’s final fade withholds forgiveness, offering only continued counting. The spilled ink sequence avoids allegory; patterns are misread, then re-read, turning abstract “failure” into visceral re-calibration.</answer>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>First-person texture is unmistakable: syntax elongates under aurora awe (“milky colors smoldering beneath rime”) then fractures into staccato when pulse accelerates. Lexicon stays observatory-specific yet intimate—“defragment,” “fill,” “packets”—never drifting into academic display. Rhythmic control mirrors emotional temperature: clause-stacked sentences during sensor burn collapse into heartbeat integers under panic. No head-hop; even the mentor’s voice is filtered through thawing glass, retaining POV modesty.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Sentence variety is symphonic: participial openers, em-dashed appositives, and fragment pulses keep the ear alert. Figurative density is high but patterned—“snow like fine ash,” “ink crawls,” “fake moon”—each vehicle pays off by re-illuminating the shard. Zero paraphrase loops; each metaphor adds new physical logic. Minor register elevation (“conceptual repricing”) is voice-motivated, spoken by the disembodied mentor and justified.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Familiar sci-fi trope—ghost in the machine—becomes fresh by locating the haunt inside the protagonist’s own archived voice, collapsing external antagonist into self-reckoning. The porcelain shard as telescope lens is an irreplicable object; swap it for glass or metal and the metaphoric re-framing collapses. Risky lyric accumulation could have drowned causality, yet closure remains legible. The aurora-as-false-datum error feels novel in miniature, a human-scale mis-sight that topples an archive.</comment>
