<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The painter’s refusal to live inside the painting is earned: every micro-choice (dipping the shell, drawing the submerged quay, walking away) visibly trades the ecstasy of merger for the discipline of witness. The “intimately aloof” trait is not label-only; it is acted out in the renunciation scene where proximity to the pool’s eternity is rejected. Cost is legible in the cracked mirror kept broken—an externalized scar of the split self. Interiority stays concrete, never drifts into diagnostic speak; the voice’s perceptual signature (salt ghosts, mineral syllables) is consistent and particular.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the drawn harbor-under-the-quay is relinquished, reweighting the rule-set so the sea—not the artist—signs the work. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density increases via tidal imagery until the final breath-curve reconfigures meaning. Persistent constraint—the cracked mirror left broken—carries visible cost. No orientation debt; who/where/when anchored by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Coastal cave system functions as micro-setting: the luminous pool’s limestone walls force the decisive self-splitting reflection and later forbid residence. The painted shell’s tiny harbor literally floats over the fingers, constraining the choice to renounce full immersion. Sensory hierarchy obeys painterly bias: color, sheen, reflected light dominate; brine and quince arrive as fleeting accents. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible positions across forked pathways.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—keep the hidden promise vs. disappear into copies—tightens when the pool offers eternal return and is refused. Escalation is textural: mirrored images accumulate until refusal reweights stakes. Cost is the forfeited stay inside eternity; this forfeit is dramatized on-page. Agency remains painterly: one breath-curve added, then retreat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly: art must breathe without its maker. No final-paragraph moralizing; the gulls awake and the unsigned canvas carry the resonance. Subtext operates through gesture—leaving the corridor, keeping the mirror cracked. The shell’s tiny moon recharged at the end reweights prior material without assertion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>First-person lyric voice maintains distinct perceptual signature: “salt ghosts,” “mineral syllables,” “tidal shards.” Rhythm modulates with pressure—short paratactic clauses during cave descent, longer breath units at pool revelation. No head-hopping; interior access stays consistent. Compression (“tomorrow I go in”) is taught early and paid off at renunciation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dense lines perform triple duty: “the ceiling breathes in mineral syllables” advances atmosphere, stakes, and metaphor simultaneously. No synonym loops or scaffold; each image adds new angle. Mixed metaphor risk avoided—tidal/limestone vocabularies stay coherent. Final third free of overwriting; single breath-curve keeps closure crystalline.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Premise—“painting the inside of the sea”—is familiar artistic conceit, but execution freshens via wrong-turn cave pool that literalizes split self as temporal mirror. Renunciation of eternal return feels non-obvious; typical arc would swallow the sublime. Specificity of shell-cum-boat, cracked mirror kept broken, and unsigned canvas transform trope into singular stance. Risk of lyric overwriting is taken and controlled.</comment>
