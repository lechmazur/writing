<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The myth-buster’s contradictory drives—comic defiance and elegiac duty—co-exist in every micro-choice (tuning peg, shell pivot, crooked bow). Interiority is concrete, never diagnostic: “the string tasted the wind” shows desire, not explains it. Final endurance—packing the bandaged cello while the dome keeps humming—pays the cost of his vocation without sermon. Voice remains singular, textured, and irreproducible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the riddle unclenches into “kindness carried forward until it looks like gravity,” reweighting every prior hum. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each resonance thickens atmospheric density until stance crystallizes. Cost is legible in the shell’s cooling blush and the dome’s continuing song—he leaves with the answer but without certainty. No causal breaks; patterned elision (lyric repetitions, echo as character) is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Observatory-as-instrument constrains tactics: the dome’s throat shapes resonance, the half-finished cello needs the cliff wind to speak. Shell, wood, and star-dust form a micro-setting triad that charges the final image. Sensory hierarchy obeys POV: gulls are “unfinished thoughts,” star-dust is tasted, not seen. Spatial choreography stays clean across continuous scene; no off-stage leakage.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—decode the universal riddle before tide erases it—is signaled in paragraph three and tightens through each harmonic probe. Escalation is textural: pattern of hums increases density until the sky’s stitched smile complicates options. Agency stays active—he turns the shell when it “bites,” he draws the crooked bow that invites the page-figure. Cost is the forfeiture of certainty: kindness, not proof, becomes gravity.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges from accumulated hums: truth is curved, not straight, and survives as kindness, not fact. Subtext lives in gesture (bow crookedness) and object state (shell blushes). Final re-pricing rejects empirical triumph for ethical persistence—exactly the inversion the premise promised. No thematic echo; resonance is felt in the dome’s continuing song.</question>

<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Voice is a controlled unreliable lyric—syntactic compression (“jokes between them like bright scarves”) without clarity loss. Perceptual signature is consistent: every metaphor is filtered through a myth-buster who trusts ribs more than logic. Rhythm modulates—short clauses under bow pressure, longer wave-like sentences during harmonic release. No template cadence; patterned repetition is purposeful and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Information-dense lines carry triple duty: “the sound gathers…turns, and sits down beside him” advances story, character, atmosphere. Figurative logic stays coherent—no mixed metaphors; “tired but merry widow” extends the cello-as-boat image. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence adds new pressure or sensory layer. Final line lands with cadence shift that reprises opening gloomy cheerfulness without recycling phrasing.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade>
<comment>Premise—retelling the sky with a half-built instrument and a lacquered shell—feels inevitable once executed. Combines maritime, musical, and cosmic vocabularies into a diction unique to this cliff. Risk of personified echo and prophetic cloak figure pays off because both are acoustic, not plot, presences. Synthesis of kindness-as-gravity reframes myth-busting genre itself.</comment>
