<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Rafi’s interiority is concrete, embodied, and contradictory—his freeze response is never clinical, always visceral. The photograph and the grafting knife act as extensions of his memory and agency, forcing micro-choices that cost him breath and bearing. His renunciation of heroic narrative in favor of “rooms storms can enter” is earned by every prior somatic marker. The only minor slip is the niece’s late appearance; her function is more thematic conduit than crucible, slightly blunting relationship pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Rafi folds the photograph with hands “steady as a trellis in wind,” reweighting trauma into still-bearing. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout—each salt-stained pane, vent-fan whir, and graft seam adds density until the final image crystallizes options without promising safety. Cost is legible in the scar-decision to keep working by “that feeling,” a pearl whose weight is felt even though unpaid. One micro-transition (niece’s arrival) is well-anchored; orientation is secure by line 20.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The arboretum’s glass roofs and cliff-edge wind physically constrain every choice—panes that need scrubbing, grafts that must take before the next storm. The crumpled photograph functions as micro-setting in Rafi’s pocket, its edges literally crowding his fingers when unfolded. Salt, sap, and diesel logbooks braid into a texture that charges the final stillness. Spatial choreography is immaculate; no one floats or teleports.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether Rafi can stay present inside a life that keeps breathing storm and rotor noise—tightens through accumulative density rather than causal reversals. Each sensory echo (vent fans = rotors) raises the cost of staying open. The gull-release beat is a micro-turn that reweights stillness from symptom to tool, not a false resolution. No option is foreclosed, yet the bearing is irrevocably altered.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges as the quiet inversion of heroic survival: optimism is not denial but “doors, not denial,” a realism that lets storms enter without wrecking. Subtext lives in gesture—Rafi’s pencil notes that “leave the least arrogant mark” speak louder than any manifesto. The lighthouse’s unmanned blink and the niece’s logbooks reprice automation vs. hand-kept time, letting weather become choice become care. No moral is stated; the final image of steady hands folding war-wound into trellis-work is the non-literal answer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited aligns to Rafi’s perceptual signature: salt-fog, graft seams, rotor-shadows. Rhythm compresses under trigger beats—“whir of the vent fans made him freeze”—then elongates with horticultural patience. No head-hopping; niece and Leda remain externally focalized, preserving psychic distance. Diction stays inside Rafi’s lexicon: “trellis,” “somatic markers,” “madrona” read as lived vocabulary, not researcher gloss.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Sentence music is varied and propulsive—“the ocean lifted its shoulders and settled like a giant animal” delivers image and rhythm without overwriting. Only one paraphrase loop: “quietly talented” appears twice in close proximity; the second could compress. No mixed metaphors; vehicles stay consistent to wind, tide, and plant life. Filter verbs are deliberate—“he felt inside his sternum a pearl” keeps the sensation embodied rather than abstract.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The lighthouse-automation vs. hand-grafting parallel is fresh, turning familiar coastal iconography into a meditation on unmanned vs. still-tending. Somatic-marker therapy is rarely dramatized through horticulture; the pairing feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk is taken with accumulative lyric structure rather than plot reversal; the payoff is a Charged Poise ending that would collapse if any shard were removed. One minor echo of “room storms can enter” feels close to current memes, but the surrounding specificity redeems it.</comment>
