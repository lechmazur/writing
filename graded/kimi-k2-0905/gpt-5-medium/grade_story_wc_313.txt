<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The warden’s “precisely humane” creed is dramatized in every micro-choice—pocketing the label, naming stones, radioing volunteers—so the final refusal to expunge feels earned. Interiority stays concrete: the ache he “cannot place,” breath steadying with the mirrored hush. No stock gestures; even his mentor’s maxim arrives via condensation-traced letters, not lecture. Cost is palpable: he will still file reports, but the living story carried in mouths shows the path foregone.</comment>

<comment>Accumulative lens holds: each photograph adds density until the grove assembly reweights the stake from neutral hazard removal to moral guardianship. Closure is a Charged Poise—headlights climbing the ridge, story orally transferred—whose cost is the warden’s future bureaucratic loneliness. Early orientation is swift: midnight ridgeway, drought-exposed bones, silent chime within 50 words. The mentor’s traced condensation cue anchors the reflective block without breaking causality.</comment>

<comment>Reservoir mud prints bones, rusted street signs, sapphire label lacquered by time—each tactile detail filters through the warden’s professional eye. The grove’s stone seats and mirrored hush of water constrain the final choice, literalizing “meeting place.” Micro-setting succeeds: the label’s blue flourish reappears in mentor’s script, charging the final image. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible positions as he kneels, pockets, walks the cracked flats.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—keep the drowned town’s memory alive—tightens when drought exposes evidence and the bureau’s order to expunge arrives. Each photograph narrows options until the grove becomes the only moral stance. The tightening is accumulative: density of relics, not explosive reversal. Price is visible: he accepts bureaucratic reprisal by radioing residents, yet still must file reports, foreclosing neutrality.</question>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without sermon: stories as levees against erasure. The blue label migrates from commodity to covenant, its flourish becoming a call to gather. Final oral transfer braids individual memories into “one careful rope,” refusing tidy moral binaries. No abstract thesis—meaning is felt in thermoses and blankets, the loons’ call substituting for drowned bells.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person close sustains a perceptual signature attuned to hush, breath, and reflected surfaces. Syntax lengthens during contemplation—“the mirrored hush of the water steadies his breath”—then shortens under action—“He radios.” No filter-verb clutter; perception is embodied. Dialogue is absent, appropriate for solitary patrol; when voices rise at the end they are reported, preserving distance. No register drift; diction stays within warden’s plausible lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with scene tension: elongated cadence for drought exposure, staccato for pocketing photos. Figurative language is spare—“patient bones,” “paper ghosts”—and always purposeful. No synonym churn or template cadence; each sentence advances image or stakes. Scaffolding absent; even reflective lines anchor in concrete cues like condensation rings.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Flooded-town-resurfacing is familiar territory, but the trail-of-photographs map and the levee-warden as communal bard feel fresh. Sapphire label’s reuse as script and rallying cry transforms a prop into covenant. Risky accumulative structure pays off: photographs teach pattern early, then reweight stakes at grove. Specificity—“chessboard napkin,” “The Saffron Pike”—prevents generic anywhere ruined town.</comment>
