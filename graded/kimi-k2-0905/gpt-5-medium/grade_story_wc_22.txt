<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The coachman’s quiet, ritualized agency is rendered through embodied micro-choices (thumb finding the pod seam, stacking bayonets into lattice) that externalize a layered interior contradiction: penance through cultivation. His motive—growth as apology—remains stable yet deepens via tactile repetitions, and the final image of crossing “narrow as mercy” crystallizes earned renunciation with visible cost (empty pods stored for tomorrow). No secondary character pressure is on stage, so relationship crucible is waived; interiority alone carries the arc.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the submerged concord is re-instantiated each dusk, the cost the perpetual labor of carrying tomorrow’s empty pods. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of seeding, bird-grammar, and language-translation tightens cadence until the final lattice-flower image reweights the whole harbor. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) are taught by line 3 and payoff at closure; no causality break. Persistent constraint—reef death—shapes every tactic.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Jetty planks, salt-slick boards, rusting cannon wheels, and morning-glory braids are not backdrop but tools: the bayonet lattice literally reconfigures battlefield debris into trellis, constraining seed growth and final image. Bird-call “latitude of calcium” and Phoenician stone-prayer provide sensory hierarchy filtered through coachman’s trained ear, guiding seed arcs. Environment physically alters choices and charges the closing glow; micro-setting (pod seam, ash palm) doubles as setting object that constrains gesture.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will the shore remember life instead of slaughter?—is signaled in paragraph 1. Escalation is accretive: each fertilizing arc narrows the possibility of forgetting; bayonet removal turns weapon into support, foreclosing violence without erasing it. Cost is visible in perpetual return, empty sacks, and the “narrow as mercy” path that must be walked again tomorrow. No coincidence; pressure of salt, wind, and ghosted battlefield tightens choices under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from inverse conquest: cultivation as non-argumentative restitution. Subtext lives in gesture—pulling bayonets “like rotten roots” and training flowers to climb surrender—rather than statement. Final image of glowing jetty unlaces battlefield under green, offering resonant reconfiguration without moral. No thematic echo or final-paragraph sermon; silence after Phoenician prayer lets tide speak the cost.</comment>

<comment>Third-person POV remains tight to coachman’s perceptual signature: he hears “music of coral streets” in pulverized shell, names gulls in forgotten syllables. Syntax lengthens and contracts with labor breath; no head-hopping. Lyric compression (“submerged concord,” “narrow vastness”) is pattern-taught early and paid off at closure. Distinct idiom differentiates interior voice from harbor voices that drift “smooth as weed.”</comment>

<comment>Rhythm modulates from long clause heaps (seed recipe list) to clipped seed-cracking beats, mirroring task tempo. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or action. Metaphors are coherent within marine lexicon (shell-music, salt gossip). Information density high: “He pulls them out like rotten roots, stacks them into a lattice, and trains morning glory to climb” does three jobs in one line. Zero scaffolding or filter-verb stacks; clarity intact at closure.</comment>

<comment>Premise—post-apocalyptic reef gardener who negotiates with birds via dead languages—feels inevitable once underway. Transformation of battlefield into trellised garden via bayonet lattice is non-obvious synthesis of war-and-peace tropes. Risk of lyric density is embraced and repaid by coherent closure image. Specificity of kelp-ash fertilizer and Phoenician prayer prevents generic eco-fable; lived detail anchors freshness.</comment>
