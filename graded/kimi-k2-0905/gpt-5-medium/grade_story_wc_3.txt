<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The translator’s methodical kindness is embodied in every tactile micro-choice—fingers trusting grooves, voice cupping rails—until the final quiet renunciation of “not to own transition, but to keep company.” Interior contradiction hums in the haunted ambition that never settled, yet never collapses into therapeutic self-talk. The seed-split moment reweights his hierarchy of values on the page, paying the cost of letting her stay gone. No stock phrasing, no label-speak; even the grief is filtered through reed-and-water physics.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the arbor’s soft chime re-weights the premise—transition is not a puzzle to solve but a pressure to accompany. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens: each tablet-pressed node, each voiced vowel, layers density until the field hums anew. The cost is palpable—“the vacuum that remains”—and the final image of the seed’s pale helix drinking the tuned field makes the price undeniable. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive by line 3 and never drift; the hollow sky is taught early and pays off as the chime finds the ribs.</comment>

<comment>The magnetic arbor is not backdrop but active crucible: filings swim to rail-lines, trunks settle like sentences, the tuned soil decides whether the seed will bear silence. Micro-setting—the pouch of woven reeds, the cradle of filings—constrains the planting gesture and charges the final helix image. Sensory hierarchy obeys POV: a cuneiform hand notices grooves before color, the translator hears grammar in bark pulses. Weather is not picturesque but argumentative, and the arbor listens, guiding the protagonist’s breath-bridge tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—keep the orchard from sparking—signals in line 4 and tightens when rails drift without her serenade. Each micro-adjustment of a node narrows options until the final breath-bridge act: renounce ownership or watch the trunks grind. Visible price: the vacuum after her name is spoken once, the seed risking silence if planted in untuned soil. Escalation is textural—density of hum threads—yet the protagonist’s agency remains causal at every pressure point.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: transition as accompaniment rather than mastery. The recurring “bridge” motif—breath, reed, rail—shifts from engineering ambition to compassionate witnessing. Subtext lives in gesture: pressing tablet to bark is an apology to the absent physicist. Final image reweights haunted ambition into haunted caretaking without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Perceptual signature is lapidary: language of field strengths, verbs for hands and breath, cadence that mimics cuneiform wedges. No head-hop; single first-person holds. Compression like “weight is rumor” is taught early and paid off when filings swim into script. Rhythm modulates: long clauses for methodical climbs, fragments for seed-split instant.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops; each sentence advances image or stakes. Mixed metaphors are deliberate and coherent—“arbor is a sentence with quiet conjugation of force”—and never violate internal physics. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image that recharges prior motifs. High density: “knowledge fruits are born from resonance, and seeds are the lost chords” does three jobs in nine words.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: cuneiform physics meets arboreal magnetism, making translation a literal tuning of memory sap. Risk of ornate abstraction is embraced yet grounded in tactile filings, voiced reeds, split seed. The haunted ambition is not generic but specific to a translator who trusts grooves more than ink. Conceptual integrity holds: every poetic device is also a physical rule inside the arbor’s grammar.</comment>
