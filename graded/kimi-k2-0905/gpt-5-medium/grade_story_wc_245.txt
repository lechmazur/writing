<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The blind mapmaker’s interiority is vividly embodied—touch-reading lichens, dowsing with a trembling ring—yet the arc is more accumulative than decisively changed. Grief is confessed but not complicated by contradictory impulse; the final “axis” acceptance feels arrived at through lyric accretion rather than a costly renunciation forged under pressure. Still, the sensory specificity and occupational blindness keep the portrait individuated and memorable.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the ring falls silent, re-weighting grief from coastline to marrow-map, cost legible in the finger-ache and the new stillpoint carried outward. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of musical notes, temperature shifts, lichen vowels—tightening until the final cadence reconfigures meaning. Orientation is taught early via sonic/tactile cues; no ambiguity at end; lens holds without contradiction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Ultrasonic forest, platinum ring, lichen lexicons—each detail is tactile and POV-filtered, constraining navigation to non-visual senses. The clearing’s sudden silence and the ring’s temperature pivot are micro-settings that directly enable the dowsing climax. Spatial choreography stays clean; no visual placeholders violate blind perception. Environment is indispensable to stakes, not postcard backdrop.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—chart grief’s coast—stays coherent; pressure intensifies via narrowing sensory trail (notes → intervals → stillpoint) rather than external opposition. One meaningful tightening: ring’s abrupt chill signals the final harmonic north, foreclosing retreat. Cost is conceptual—grief remains but is re-mapped—visible in the finger-ache and the silent ring. Agency is attention/endurance under Accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: maps are not escape but consent to pivot within ache. Subtext lives in touch—lichen vowels, ring temperature—never sermonized. Final image of “night steps with me” reweights prior star-pause into ongoing companionship, resisting tidy moral. Grief stays native; insight is earned through sensory accumulation, not stated.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is compressed, lyrical, taught immediately—“leaves speak above hearing”—and sustained without head-hop. Syntax mirrors blind perception: clauses pile like braille, rhythms hesitate with star-clock teeth. Diction stays within plausible lexicon of touch-anchored cartographer; no filter clutter. Read-aloud cadence varies, accelerating into the clearing silence, then settling into winter-seed stillness.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density: each sentence layers sensory job plus metaphoric charge without scaffold. Occasional stacked figuratives (“vault of glass strings”) risk purple but payoff in sonic payoff at climax. No synonym loops; pronouns clean; temporal sequence precise. Final line gives resonant image, not explanation. Minor hairline: “weaponed with silence” is arresting yet borderline mannered, not fatal.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Blind mapmaker who charts emotion via touch-sonar is fresh synthesis; trope of mystical forest is retooled to ultrasonic, proprioceptive logic. Musical-note trail and temperature-compass avoid generic quest markers by grounding in non-visual interface. Risk-taking—lyric accumulative structure—heightens meaning without gimmickry. Conceptual integrity holds: grief is not cured but re-mapped, a non-obvious angle that lingers.</comment>
