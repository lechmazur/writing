<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The narrator’s shift from complacent puppet-master to follower is dramatized through embodied micro-moments—hands feeling “like tools for theft,” the silent offer of the stick—so the arc is legible and costly. Interiority is character-specific, not diagnostic, and the quiet renunciation at the end is earned. Secondary characters (the woman, the partner) stay off-page long enough to keep the crucible tight; when the woman enters, her single speech rewrites the entire ethic, so status pressure is immediate. Flaws (exploitative satire) are not hedged; the final serenity carries the bruise of that knowledge.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the stick passes to the audience, applause is refused, and the meteor hush reweights every prior gig. Causal linkage is lyric-accumulative rather than bang-bang, but the pattern is taught early (“we had to reverse the gravity of the strings”) and lands with conceptual cost. The dome’s acoustic property externalizes the ethical inversion, so the final silence is felt, not lectured. One soft spot: the partner’s shouted accusation is off-stage summary; because it seeds the whole crisis, the missing beat keeps the score sub-9.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The dome functions as micro-setting: its echo turns every footstep into evidence, forcing the narrator to hear his own exploit. Sensory detail is selective—moon-puddle vellum, moth-dust, rope-coil stage—each object later touched or re-purposed in the performance. Spatial choreography stays clean as the woman walks “beneath the ribs of the scaffolding,” literalizing healing surgery on the structure. Weather is irrelevant, but the meteor hush is an acoustic weather the characters must breathe; it charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—ethical storytelling versus exploitative satire—is signaled in the first 120 words and tightens when the narrator’s own hand feels criminal. The meaningful turn is the stick-hand-off: it narrows future options from “satire as good” to “satire co-owned,” with visible social cost (no applause, only listening). Escalation is situational-accumulative rather than causal-domino, but pressure coheres under the dome’s echo chamber. Price is conceptual but legible: the troupe forfeits hero-narrative and surrenders authorship.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the concrete inversion of punchlines: power must sit in the audience’s lap. No character utters a thesis; the final silence is the argument. The half-lit epiphanies motif returns re-weighted—once vague smoke, now shared light that refuses spectacle. Ambiguity is preserved: the woman says “keep the joke,” but the joke is newly dangerous to its tellers, leaving a lasting ethical instability.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>First-person lyric interiority sustains a calligrapher’s perceptual signature—ink, vellum, pen-strokes—without drifting into workshop diction. Syntax lengthens and contracts with guilt (“I had countered with ethics I had not yet earned”) and snaps short at the hand-off (“I offered the stick without speech”). Dialogue is minimal but voice-differentiated: the woman’s wind-worn sentences contrast the narrator’s polished salon cadence. No head-hopping; collective “we” stays a single stance until the final diffusion into audience.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Line-level craft is dense yet breathable: metaphor clusters (meteor hush, chalk footprints, moon puddle) recur with accrued meaning rather than decorative overload. Rhythm modulates from long reflective sentences to staccato stage directions, mirroring the shift from reflection to action. One paraphrase loop (“we had to reverse the gravity… we would carry this ethic back”) is forgivable because it functions as deliberate incantation. No mixed metaphors; each image is concrete and trackable.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The puppet-show morality play is familiar, but the inversion—audience writes the puppets’ lines—feels fresh and inevitable. The decommissioned radar dome as confession booth is a specific, quirky venue never used as mere backdrop. Risk is taken in the refusal of applause; the story bets everything on silence as payoff and wins. The synthesis of performative ethics with tactile calligraphy tools creates a memorable signature unlikely to recur unchanged under other names.</comment>
