<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The narrator’s broken-but-functional competence is credibly limned; every paddle stroke and pole reading feels like a micro-choice that costs salt and shame. His merrily melancholic mask is shown, not told, in the self-mocking buoy/bell image. The salvaging act with the boy gives a visible pivot that forecloses retreat; the chest-press of the compass at the end is an embodied, priced renunciation. Interior contradiction holds to the last line—he is “open and used,” not healed—so the arc earns its stasis.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a taut Charged Poise: the compass against the sternum reweights every prior failure without declaring victory. Causal lattice is tight—every pole hum propels the next tactical choice; no off-stage rescue. The “utility-pole method” is taught early and paid off in the channel extraction, so lens holds. Cost is unmistakable: the same brass that once reflected a “jittery mouth” now seals an unbroken, still cracked, self—steady, not fixed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fog, salt, rope-taste, and barge-throttled horizon are filtered through a navigator’s trained eye; no tourist catalog. The red kayak deck, galaxy-mud footprints, and eelgrass grounding are tactile anchors that alter tactics—draft, trim, push-off. The astronomical compass as micro-setting constrains the final image: its brass becomes the literal weight that steadies the ribcage. Weather shifts from clinging worry to lifted veil exactly synchronized with interior tilt—environment performs the reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can he still read the world well enough to keep others safe?—tightens when the boy’s father is already aground; failure will replay last year’s death. Each pole hum escalates by narrowing options: false cuts versus real channel, greedy tide versus draft. The protagonist’s own tool (compass) and method (poles) are turned outward to serve strangers, so the cost of competence is immediate—one mistake and three lives pay. Escalation is accumulative/textural: knowledge density increases until the final breath-held release, not a single causal reversal but a mounting chord.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of salvaged usefulness emerges from concrete salvage act; no aphorisms. The compass’s shifting reflection (jittery mouth → seal unbroken) reweights the concept of “alignment” without naming it. The refusal to promise more than he can keep lets the sea keep its own score—complexity honored. Final image of carrying sorrow “open and used” like a chart offers resonant non-literal answer: navigation continues because the map is creased, not because it is pristine.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>First-person voice owns a mariner’s compressed lyric—ellipses, hyphenated coinages (“star-machine,” “judge-softened-gavel”) taught in first paragraph and sustained. Perceptual signature is tilted toward spatial acoustics: pole hum, gull off-key forgiveness, brass flicker—no generic sea catalog. Syntax coils and releases with each paddle beat; no template cadence. Dialogue minimal but voice-distinct: boy’s solemn merciful nod is rendered through narrator’s astonished filter, keeping distance clean.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Varied sentence openings, muscular verbs (“hammering,” “shoving,” “eased free”), no filler stacks. Metaphors stay nautical and mechanical without mixed collisions—gavel, stitches, circuits all belong to a navigator’s toolkit. No paraphrase loops; each image advances either water-state or emotional valence. Final line “open and used” is irreplaceable compression of chart = heart—zero scaffolding.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Fresher angle: a pilot who can only “see” by land scars (utility poles) turns that liability into rescue power—antithetical to open-sea romance. Astronomical compass repurposed as emotional stethoscope, not wayfinder, flips trope. Pattern of “broken but working” becomes literal social currency the boy accepts without sentiment—avoids inspirational redemption arc. Risk in lyric density pays off because closure image is legible under accumulative lens.</comment>
