<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The name “Foresight Hindsight Only” is not a gimmick: every beat—counting seconds, re-reading static directives, translating damp margins—makes the interior contradiction visceral. The final acceptance that the directive has rotted into an invitation is earned by iterative micro-choices (crumble, feed, thread, open). Embodied emotion stays specific—itching scar, ribcage yawn—never diagnostic. Cost is unmistakable: the bunker exhales and ownership flips; the maze becomes direction.</question>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: each sensory layer (vine-damp, static-cough, eel-map) thickens until the pattern breaks at the door. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the wafer’s failure is not a twist but a revealed rule, paying off the early taught fragility. Causality holds because the protagonist’s ritual translations physically exhaust the archive; the loosening knot is legible cost. Orientation is taught by line 3; no debt.</question>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The vine-draped bunker functions as micro-setting: its concrete lung-inhale physically ejects the protagonist into the corridor, a literal constraint that shapes the exit. Sensory triage—dust silk, damp alphabet, iron-skinned bruise—mirrors the archive’s decay withoutcataloguing the forest. Spatial choreography stays clean: drone distance, door location, boot-loam track. The final image recharges “vine-draped” as the bunker exhales ownership—setting becomes agent.</question>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—why paths choose walkers—tightens when the archive coughs back the verb “to shepherd,” forcing a stance. The tightening is textural: static thickens into meaning, eels into lines; the cost is the relinquishing of safe bunker lung. No reversal, but one meaningful deepening qualifies under Accumulative lens. Pressure stays coherent; storm clock + decaying directive compress options until door return.</question>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the material conflict between sealed order and biological decay; the cosmos’s “tired grin” is never moralized. The final image—name as direction—reweights every earlier maze-metaphor without stating a thesis. Subtext lives in silence: no evacuees appear, making “shepherd” ironic. The invitation to be shown is felt, not explained.</question>

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>First-person perceptual signature is consistent: the narrator counts teeth-of-lock, tastes obsolete authority, hears thunder teach alphabets. Syntax mirrors stress—compressed clauses during storm approach, longer riff during reel-threading. No filter-verb bloat; “I thread, whisper, feel” keeps immediacy. Drone’s riddle is voiced lighter, achieving distinction without dialogue overload.</question>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Metaphor density is high but patterned early (“names are maps,” “sigil I can almost remember”) so payoff justifies risk. No mixed vehicles: eel-nest map stays aqueous; “iron-skinned bruise” keeps storm = injury logic. Rhythm modulates naturally; paragraph lengths breathe. One paraphrase loop—“precisely playful” twice in four lines—drops 0.2; otherwise information density is excellent.</question>

<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The evacuation-archive decaying into consent is a fresh inversion of dystopian obedience tales. Turning the wafer seal from authority to invitation grows inevitably from the taught fragility. Risky lyric compression (“alphabetized by roots,” “qualm of roads”) heightens meaning without obscuring closure. The synthesis of bunker lung, dream translation, and weather-as-path feels non-portable—this story could not swap names or places intact.</question>
