<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>Interiority is vivid—keeper of secrets posture is embodied in “walking in prismatic quiet”—but the lovers’ motivations are inferred rather than dramatized; the narrator’s decisive micro-choice (tucking letters beneath the bowl) is clear and carries cost, yet the lovers’ final step feels gently orchestrated rather than earned through visible contradiction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the choral reading of withheld letters reconfigures the lovers’ stance and the crowd’s complicity under the accumulative lens; cost is felt when strangers speak their private lines aloud. Causality holds—threads, leaves, and bowl all planted early—though orientation is soft until “the city always comes here” (~130 w) which waives penalty.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Lotus temple and pond function as micro-setting: the mirrored surface and stepping-thread paths literally constrain how bodies move and converge; the thrush-nest spiral anchors the final image. Sensory selection—rain beads, brass bell, frog-ceremony—stays filtered through the narrator’s perceptual bias rather than tourist catalog.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—can art rejoin two silenced lovers—tightens once when parallel threads physically narrow to one bowl; escalation is accumulative (each new leaf adds social pressure) rather than causal reversal. Price is legible: private letters become public utterance, foreclosing secrecy; however, the lovers themselves exert minimal agency until the final step.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as communal reparation of private rupture; no moral is stated—wisdom is earned when strangers voice the lovers’ lines and the pair physically close. The thrush-nest spiral returns reweighted: what was a blueprint for private desire becomes the scaffold for public reconciliation, satisfying the non-literal reconfiguration test.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Lyrid compression is pattern-taught early (“prismatic quiet” repeats with variant cadence) and pays off in the final hush; perceptual signature is consistent—synesthetic rain, lantern simile—without over-articulation. No head-hopping; psychic distance stays shallow-near, matching the ghostwriter’s keeper stance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>High information density: one sentence threads action, image, and theme (“I laid thin threads…gentle enough for wary feet”). Metaphors are clean and mutually reinforcing (rain beads as “tiny windows,” bell sound as “thin fish”). No loops, scaffold, or register drift; minor over-modification in “dripping and shimmering like a patient lantern” stays within lyric contract.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Premise—ghostwriter who externalizes hidden hearts via public installation—is fresh; the choral un-sending of letters reweights the trope of unsent love notes. Risky accumulative structure pays off: crowds become co-authors, turning whimsical method into civic ritual. Specificity of lotus-pond geography and thrush-nest object prevents generic transplantability.</comment>
