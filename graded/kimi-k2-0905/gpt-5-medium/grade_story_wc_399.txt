<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The narrator’s motive—preserve fragile wisdom at the price of daily erasure—remains urgent and embodied; the walker’s “strangely honest” eyes and masked silence create a credible, character-specific enigma. Interior contradiction is lyrically handled (“I guide him” yet “the valley forgets quickly”). The renunciation at the end—accepting tomorrow’s identical labor—earns its quiet cost. Only the prophet stays off-page, so status dynamics bullet is waived.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the widening clearing and the cup sealed by prophet’s breath reweight the entire ritual with conceptual cost—their labor is infinite, necessary, unread. Causality is lyric but intact: because memory is skittish, therefore they sand breath; because the walker balances, therefore the clearing holds. Orientation is taught early via sensory anchors (pavilion lip, dune skin, ink pages). Lens is Accumulative/Textural; density and cadence tighten once at midday wind-beat, then crystallize at dusk.</comment>

<comment>The murmuring pavilion, kinetic parapet, and glass-rib tent are not backdrop but instruments: parapet rises/falls to protect syllables, pavilion exhales consonants, tent ribs catch sun to signal clearance. These micro-settings directly constrain tactics and charge the final sealed-cup image. Selective sensory focus (sand underbody, mask’s ridge) keeps spatial choreography clean while filtering through POV bias. No orientation debt.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—keep echoes legible—faces escalating wind that wants to “scatter vowels”; the walker’s mid-day stitch-line tightens options and visibly costs fatigue (“strangely honest in his fatigue”). The tightening is single but meaningful, sufficient for lyric 760-word scope. Agency remains collective yet present: their joint consecration forecloses the path of loud permanence. Cost is legible in the final image of tracks filling, echo settling against ribs.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: preservation demands erasure, wisdom survives only if endlessly re-whispered. The sealed cup and refilled tracks reprice the premise—memory is not kept but constantly re-paid. Motif of peripheral vision (never looking straight) reweights at closure: the widened clearing is seen only sideways, making the theme of indirect caretaking felt, not told. No final-paragraph moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>First-person choral “we” remains stable, no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent: breath-as-sand, syllables-as-birds, margins-as-loyalty. Syntax breathes with ritual cadence; diction stays inside plausible caretaker lexicon (“kinetic parapet,” “oculus”). The lone spoken line—“we can widen the clearing if we trust its margin”—is bare, low, and earned, maintaining voice integrity under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is lyrically dense yet propulsive; figurative layering (wind wants to steal syllables) is patterned early and paid off. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn. One minor scaffold: “the sand’s underbody lies the kinetic parapet beneath the dunes” could trim to “beneath the dunes lies the kinetic parapet,” but the inversion is voice-motivated. Closure image is uncluttered, ensuring clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The concept of a caretaker culture that sands breath to keep memory legible is fresh; the kinetic parapet that moves to protect whispers is a non-obvious, internally consistent invention. Peripheral vision as the only reliable path to truth inverts usual heroic gaze. Risk—quiet lyric ending, collective POV—heightens rather than hedges stakes. Specificity anchors universals; removing any named element would collapse the logic.</comment>
