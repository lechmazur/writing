<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The solitary narrator’s curiosity, hunger to “prove it had ever been here,” and inherited Nightwatch duty fuse into a credible, embodied motive. Micro-choices—flicking the ampoule, slowing breath, pressing the shutter—track an internal hierarchy of values (memory vs. agency mandate) under rising pressure. Interiority stays concrete and sensorial; no diagnostic label-speak. The final renunciation—recording instead of rescuing—pays the cost of maternal legacy and is earned by every prior beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens: pressure mounts through color-coded vials, dwindling minutes, and the literal thinning air. Closure is a Charged Poise—the white vial’s exhale coincides with the moth’s lift, crystallizing the choice to witness rather than save. Cost is legible in “the crater…conspired to make my throat clean and still.” One micro-turn (ochre → white) tightens stakes cleanly; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The moonlit crater is rendered through instruments the narrator must handle—camera, ampoule, vials—so setting constrains every tactical move. Ancient snow seam, peppered basalt, and radio dishes supply tactile, visual, and acoustic layers without catalogue drift. Spatial choreography is immaculate: lip, seam, slope, array track without drift. The final image reweights the prior snow-and-silence motif, passing the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—capture the final song before extinction—signals early and tightens with each colored flame. Agency is observational but still decisive: the shutter press forecloses rescue, paying undeniable emotional cost. Pressure escalates via chemical countdown and moth emergence, both legible under accumulative lens. Coincidence absent; escalation turns on narrator’s mindful endurance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of witness versus intervention emerges through image chain: hourglass, vial, shutter, moth—no abstract sermon. Final reconfiguration equates archiving with complicity, yet honors the lonely dignity of keeping watch. Subtext lingers in “the night from leaving alone,” a resonant answer unsaid but felt. Complexity retained: agency funding complicity is neither excused nor demonized.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>First-person lyric voice owns a scientist-poet diction—lantern-hive, polite throat-clearing, milk-glass wing—that stays consistent and idiosyncratic. Rhythmic control peaks at moth lift: short clause bursts mimic wing beats. No head-hopping; perceptual signature remains tightly filtered through lone focalizer. Patterned elision (color for time) is taught early and pays off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm breathes with scene tension: longer reflective lines alternate with clipped procedural beats. Figurative density is high but disciplined—metaphors serve perception, not ornament. Zero paraphrase loops; no mixed metaphors. One scaffold hint—“the space age gives and takes”—is earned meta-comment, not drift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: lunar glacier moth extinction documented via 19th-century hourglass chemistry on a 21st-century crater. Risk—lyric, image-driven SF—is fully committed; no retreat to exposition. Specificity of timed color vials and “radio dishes…blind again” makes the concept irreplaceable. Final reconfiguration feels inevitable yet non-obvious.</comment>
