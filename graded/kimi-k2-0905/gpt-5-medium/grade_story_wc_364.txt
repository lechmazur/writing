<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Iven’s quiet resolve is embodied in action (hammering hope, mapping chalk, offering memories) rather than labels. The wrist bruise from the tightening silk gives visible cost to his endurance, earning his final smile. Interiority stays sparse but consistent with a meek man who speaks to stone; the single POV keeps pressure coherent. His refusal of fame (“only for work, and for sleep”) crystallizes Earned Stasis without speechifying.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the arches settle, ladders root, and the town’s stance shifts from collapse to deliberate upkeep. Causal chain holds—silk tightens on honest oaths, wind halts when price is paid—without forcing linear spectacle. Orientation is clear by line 8 (orchard planet, quake aftermath). Accumulation cap: one minor scaffold (“the stone hummed softly like a song learning words”) does not touch the closing image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Floating rock arches function as both threat and eventual scaffold; their final handspan drop reconfigures what can be built. Magician’s silk acts as micro-setting/tool, constraining honesty and bruising flesh. Sensory hierarchy tilts to touch and sound (grit wind, hammering, stone humming) under crisis. Selective detail skips botany and geology; what matters is what can be bartered.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will the town stand again?—is signaled in line 2. One meaningful tightening: the silk’s bruising wrist under wind-fire makes the cost visceral and narrows options to keep promising. Escalation is accumulative: each night adds density of knots and memory until the third-night wind forces the final offer. Coincidence (wind’s timing) complicates rather than rescues; the resolution is Iven’s offered memories, not luck.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges as mutual stewardship: orchards keep people, people keep orchards, stone keeps both if sung to honestly. No character voices the thesis; the silk’s tightening and the eventual rooting of ladders carry the argument. Final image—“bells that rang true in a key of azure defiance”—reweights the sky’s color from permanent to chosen. Complexity lingers: the town remains between understanding and confusion, refusing moral tidiness.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>First-person plural sustains a communal, choral texture without individuated head-hopping; stance stays stable. Perceptual signature favors collective body (we rushed, we lifted) and auditory cues (stone humming, bells). Purposeful compression—“bartered awakenings” repeated—teaches the pattern and pays off when the term re-weights the ending. No dialogue to judge; free indirect style is absent but not needed.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with scene needs: long cadences for exposition, staccato prepositional chains during wind. Information density high—“hammering more hope than iron” does two jobs in five words. One template cadence run (“the arches… the orchards… the stone…”) is pattern-taught early and serves chant-like cohesion, forgiven. No mixed metaphors; azure defiance stays coherent.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses planetary romance with folk negotiation, a fresh angle. “Bartered awakenings” as economic-spiritual currency is non-obvious and drives every beat. Risk taken with communal POV and lyric repetition pays off in closure resonance. Some phrasing edges familiar uplift tropes (“we lifted walls, and the walls lifted us”), keeping it from full 8-band.</comment>
