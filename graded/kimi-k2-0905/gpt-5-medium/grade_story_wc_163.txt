<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The narrator’s desire “to learn the rhythm of belonging” is dramatized through the synchronized-breathing ritual and the final image of maps that “breathe with me,” showing embodied change. Interiority stays concrete—reading drowned avenues as constellations, feeling tide clocks in the ribs—avoiding label-speak. The burnt-feather micro-choices (handing, setting down) externalize values under pressure. Cost is present but muted: the city “felt almost native,” a hair short of visible forfeiture, keeping the score just below the 9-band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the narrator’s maps become “companions” instead of destinations, a conceptual repricing with felt cost—“almost native” carries the ache of almost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of silt/constellation/tide imagery tightens until the final image reweights the stake. Orientation is taught early—underwater hatch, midnight—and paid off at dawn. One soft spot: the algorithm’s invitation to rest is accepted without foregrounding what is foregone; the cost is implied, not sharp on the page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The drowned city is rendered through tactile, POV-filtered specifics—“glass fronds swayed like thought,” “reefs as constellations.” Environment constrains the breathing ritual and charges the final dome image, satisfying the 9-band gate. Spatial choreography stays clean across hatch, garden, lab, dome. A micro-slip: “seaweed-draped hatch” is the only anchor for depth/pressure, leaving submersive physics partly inferred.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—belonging without nativity—is signaled early and tightens through the breathing synchronization that narrows options to mutual consent or retreat. The burnt-feather insertion is the visible, irreversible act that raises cost. Escalation is lyrical rather than causal: density of light/tide images reweights the stake until the dome offers “charged poise.” Lacks a tangible, on-page forfeit (tool, air, memory) that would push into the 8.8+ band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the tension between mapping and dwelling—cartographic control versus surrendered breathing. The final image of maps that “know when to put the pencil down” offers a non-literal answer that reweights the premise. Subtext in the shared exhale and fish “like drowsy stars” keeps sentimentality at bay. No moralizing summary; the insight stays anchored to the dome’s breath-timed light.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>First-person voice carries a disciplined poetic cadence—“midnight shivered the surface into ink,” “tide clocks cupped in our ribs”—without purple drift. Perceptual signature is consistent: landscapes read as star charts, fins as “softly ingenious.” No head-hopping; Rin’s interiority is inferred only through gesture, maintaining distance. Compression like “shadowseam wonder” is pattern-taught early and repaid in the final hush, earning high-band clearance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><<comment>Syntax varies from long breath-like clauses to fragmentary star-notes, propelling the dive-tempo. Information density is high—each sentence layers image, metaphor, and stakes without paraphrase loops. Metaphors stay coherent within the aqueous/star lexicon; no mixed vehicles. A single template cadon of “like” similes clusters mid-story (−0.2), but the closing lines break pattern, restoring rhythm.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Combines underwater exploration, algorithmic sentience, and landscape astrology into a fresh synthesis that feels inevitable in hindsight. The “shared exhale” ritual repurposes firefly wonder into a plausible subsea key, a risk that pays off emotionally. The drowned city as living astrolabe reconfigures familiar eco-SF tropes through lyric specificity. No derivative echoes; the final cartographic surrender is a quiet inversion of conquest narratives.</comment>
