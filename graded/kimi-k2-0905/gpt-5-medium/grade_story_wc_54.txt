<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The intern’s “functionally creative” trait is repeatedly enacted—angling ducts, flipping breakers—so motive stays visible. Interiority is lean but bodily (sextant warm against leg). The janitor’s entrance introduces status tension that alters the maze; both men cede agency to the building, so the relationship crucible is the architecture itself. Endurance earns stasis: he sleeps on a bench, circuits murmuring—cost is fatigue, not epiphany.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative lens: each micro-tweak (gutter to cistern, escalator reversed) layers density until the terminal’s lung reinflates. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration—terminal exhales, intern breathes back—cost is embodied in the living hum, not speech. Orientation anchored by line 10; no drift. Tightening escalates via visible gauges, wet boots, mother’s thanks; options narrow to staying and maintaining.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setting is tool-as-environment: sextant angles against ducts; brass limb becomes compass. Rainwater ballroom, dust-skipped archives—each spatial glitch is mapped, then re-circuited. Skylights opened literally rename darkness in the final image, charging closure. Micro-setting (sextant fragment) constrains every adjustment; without it the re-routings lose logic.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake: prove hope is a solvable system. Escalation is accumulative—each redirected flow proves the equation on-page (sinks cough awake). Janitor’s desire for flood-shelter tightens stakes; mother’s arrival tests the system under live load. Cost is legible: sleepless bench, wet boots, unpaid labor—options foreclosed to perpetual maintenance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from tactile proofs: hope = measurable airflow, lumens, water level. Subtext in silence—terminal gratitude is “changing,” not speaking. Final image of reciprocal breathing reframes earlier sextant bearing as internalized pulse, avoiding thesis statement. Complexity preserved: carnival’s exploitation un-avenged; no moral ledger balanced.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Lyracised first-person slides into accumulative cadence—sentence length swells with each retrofit, then shortens at sleep. Perceptual signature filters world through engineering numerals: “budgets of mercy,” “gauges again.” Sextant as diction anchor keeps metaphor mechanical, not cosmic. No head-hop; janitor’s voice stays exterior, reported.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Compression high—“rainwater pooled in a ballroom where passengers once queued” does triple sensory + history + problem. No scaffold; each sentence adds system detail or micro-choice. Metaphor disciplined: “threadbare lines like lifelines” keeps textile scope. Terminal breathes / I breathed back—mirrored close that re-uses respiration motif without redundancy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Post-carnival spaceport as community infrastructure reclamation feels fresh; sextant fragment repurposed for terrestrial HVAC rather than celestial navigation. Stakes inverted—no rocketry, just buses and clinic light. Conceptual re-pricing: hope becomes maintenance, not escape. Risk stays grounded; no speculative cheats.</comment>
