<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The narrator’s self-definition as “charcoal portrait ash scatterer” is embodied in every beat: she powders unsent letters, breathes ash onto canvas, accepts the chair’s rhythm as her metronome. Contradictory impulses—need for maternal blessing vs refusal to ask permission—coexist in the same moment, not in alternating abstracts. Cost is felt when she pockets the last jar of ash while her mother’s grip leaves “a bracelet of dust” on her wrist, showing endurance has a tactile price. Only the mother’s late shift from stone guardian to co-witness feels slightly under-causal; the squeeze is earned but the interior leap is compressed into a single beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the chair’s final slow-rock under the skylight crystallizes the shared cost of speaking slant; mother and daughter stand in “breathless quiet,” the path of direct naming forever foreclosed. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: ash, dust, and rocking rhythm accrete until the last gust-through-the-gallery reweights everything. Causality is tight—every gallery prop (mask, chair, powdered letters) is seeded in the first 200 words and returns with altered charge. One minor orientation waiver: “the room that holds our hush” is the only spatial anchor at the open, yet the lyric disorientation pays off when the same hush is finally filled with visitors’ footsteps.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The rocking chair functions as micro-setting: its joints’ tired metronome literally times the family’s secrets and is carried to the gallery where its final rock becomes the closure image. Ash is tactile—paper dust smells of “singed sugar,” sticks to binder, greys the jar rims—constraining how the narrator handles each brushstroke. Spatial choreography is immaculate: we track the chair from hallway shadow to skylight circle without a single pronoun drift. Light through the mask’s kintsugi rivers is the visual signature that charges the final image, making the chair’s motion feel like a cathedral bell tolling inside a bone.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can art testify without naming the abuser—tightens when mother hands over the un-mailed letters: the narrator must now convert private evidence into public pigment under the gaze of the man’s surviving spouse. Escalation is textural: each scattering of ash increases the moral opacity until visitors must decide who wore the mask, forcing the artist to surrender interpretive control. The cost is visible—mother’s “gray of resolve” and the narrator’s powder-blackened cuticles—showing endurance, not solution, is the only path. No reversal, but a decisive deepening: the chair’s ghost-rock converts inherited trauma into shared witness, narrowing future silence to a single audible creak.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the inverse of safety: every object (mask, chair, sealed letters) is beautiful precisely because it is shattered and re-seamed, arguing that survival is the act of displaying cracks under gold. Subtext lives in gesture—mother’s nod toward the chest is also a nod toward complicity—never spelled out. The final image reweights “mirage of safety” into somber marvel: visitors inhale the ash of unspoken names and exhale their own ghosts, proving art can transmute danger without declaring it. No moral is stated; instead the chair’s slowing tick offers a resonant, non-literal answer: witness is the only lullaby that never fully stops.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>First-person voice carries a distinct perceptual signature: the narrator sees moonlight as “porcelain cracks in her eyes,” smells memory as “singed sugar,” and measures time by chair squeaks. Compression is taught early—sentence fragments like “a storm of names dissolving into faces”—and paid off when the final quiet sentence mirrors the opener. No head-hopping; even mother’s interior is inferred only through externals (voice wearing “only the gray of resolve”). Register stays within an artist’s lexicon—kintsugi, binder, pigment—without academic drift, keeping lyric texture grounded.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet breathable: “I grind the envelopes, and memory sighs up as paper dust” does three jobs—action, sensory, metaphor—in twelve words. Rhythm modulates from long breathy lines that mimic rocking motion to staccato scatter-commands (“finger, and brush”) under peak pressure. No loops or scaffold; every paragraph either advances the installation or deepens the emotional ledger. One near-muddle: “the verse broke” is abstract, but it is immediately anchored by the literal creak of the chair, so clarity recovers inside the same sentence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The kintsugi mask and ash-pigment installation feel inevitable yet fresh: domestic trauma transmuted into tactile fine-art ritual rather than therapy monologue. Risk is taken by making the climax a collective inhale of powdered silence—an anti-confrontation that still forces moral calculus on the viewer. Specific detail prevents allegory: “ singed sugar” smell of old envelopes could not swap with generic “dust.” The concept commits fully; even the gallery name “Vanishing Point” literalizes as perspective lines that nearly erase the visitor, turning architectural space into moral aperture.</comment>
