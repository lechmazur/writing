<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist’s perceptual acuity (“sensitively perceptive”) drives every micro-choice—pressing an ear to plaster, warming the negative, hop-scotching dust squares—so the trait is more than label; it alters tactics and forecloses retreat, earning the vow’s cost. Interiority stays concrete, never drifts into diagnostic speak. The only drag is that the “legacy burden” is felt thematically more than as a visible choice-cost at the exact closure beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the cartographer locks the door, accepts the shawl of echoes, and maps future footfalls rather than corridors—an on-page renunciation with felt weight. Causal chain holds: negative → hopscotch → letter → vow reaffirmed. Lens is Accumulative/Textural; density of salt grammar, ash-wet pages, and ivy taps keeps tightening until the final cadence shift reweights meaning. Orientation anchored by line 4; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Environment (ivy-veined passage, half-sleeping coals, tide-stilted house) constrains every move—ivy dictates entry route, floor yields letter only after hopscotch shock, coals warm the negative. Sensory hierarchy mirrors cartographer bias: sound first, touch second, sight last. Spatial choreography is flawless; the sideways-curtsying house stays trackable. Final image—house rising on memory-stilts—recharges every prior detail.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will the walls consent to speak and will the listener bear the weight—is signaled in paragraph 1 and tightens through each artefact encounter. The hopscotch moment is the visible reversal: play ruptures floorboard, reveals letter, narrows options to “return and listen.” Cost is legible: name slides away, future mapped as footfalls not escape. Pressure is coherent under Accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves tension.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme—listening as civic duty to drowned memory—emerges from concrete turns: negative inversion, hopscotch rupture, letter translation. No moralizing summary; final map draws “thresholds that ask questions,” offering resonant non-literal answer. Subtext rests in gesture: locking door equals vow renewal. Ambiguity lingers—will the house dream the cartographer back?—without forced profundity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is irreducibly specific: “salt grammar of vanished tenants,” “lime answered in faint taps,” syntax mimics echolocation. Diction stays within cartographer lexicon—ledger, acoustics, measures—no register drift. Rhythm modulates: long breathy clauses for echo, staccato for hopscotch. First-person distance stable; no head-hop. Compression taught early (“corridor echo cartographer”) and paid off in final cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; almost every sentence layers sensory, metaphoric, and emotional work. Metaphors stay internally coherent—house as shell, negative as eel, silence as pantry—no mixed vehicles. One scaffold loop: “I thought of the mentors again and their diagrams…” is near-paraphrase of earlier beat, costs −0.2. Otherwise zero filter-verb stacks, zero synonym churn. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with discovery beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Premise—cartographer who maps by hearing walls dream—is fresh, yet owes faint genealogy to Calvino’s invisible cities and recent cli-fi ruins. Synthesis feels specific: hopscotch as divination tool, negative as inverted memory lantern. Risk—lyric accumulative structure—heightens rather than obscures stakes. No close-phrase echoes. Transformation test fails if relocated from drowned district; idiom is place-bound.</comment>
