<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The "fool" persona is lived-in: every metaphor the narrator stitches is a micro-choice that costs blood and privacy. Interiority stays needle-sharp—"I recognized my own mask in theirs"—and the renunciation of safety at the end is earned by the whole accretive pattern. No stock phrases; even the bodily prick is a specific, character-bound ritual. The single flaw: the keeper’s interiority is only glimpsed through wrist quivers, so the relationship crucible is slightly under-braided.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each embroidery beat adds density until the cloth literally opens a throat—an undeniable RR/Charged Poise. Causality is lyric but legible: because I listen → because I stitch gaps → because I bleed → therefore the conspiracy exhales. Orientation is taught by line 3 ("cobalt observatory in autumn") and closure reweights the premise—star charts are lies—so the early lyric disorientation pays off. Cost is visible in the final image: the narrator will be blamed, and the candle ash is still warm on the glove.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The observatory is not backdrop; its brass rails, domes, and echoed silence are tactile tools that guide the embroidery ritual. The eternal candle functions as micro-setting—its flame bent "left, then right"—and directly constrains the final synchronicity beat. Weather (maple leaves as bead-choir) evolves with the coup rehearsal, mirroring internal tension. Only micro-slippage: spatial choreography of the "small desk" relative to the dome eyepiece is briefly floaty, but the candle re-anchors.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—truth vs. survival—tightens when the whisper reveals forged star routes. One meaningful deepening: the jester-hat stitch turns the narrator from passive listener to active saboteur, foreclosing anonymity. Cost is legible—blood on cloth, future blame—yet the escalation is slightly abstract (no immediate physical jeopardy on page), keeping it just below the 9-band. Still, the accretive pressure under the Textural lens is coherent and felt.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges solely through image-pattern: stitching as listening, lies as silk routes, laughter as leaking freight. The final ash-drawing of two sliding names reweights the premise without moralizing—conceptual repricing that star charts are political fabric. Subtext in silence: the keeper’s wrist quiver says more than any confession. No spoon-feeding; ambiguity about who will fall is thematically honest to espionage ecology.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Voice is inimitable—compressed, rhythmic, synesthetic: "dust made constellations over the unused charts." Perceptual signature never slips; even abstraction ("adjacent possibilities") is filtered through textile sensory bias. Patterned elision ("the heavens ticked") is taught early and paid off at closure. Zero head-hop; keeper’s thoughts surface only as observable tremors, preserving POV discipline.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Every sentence threads multiple jobs—world, metaphor, pressure: "I pricked my finger, dabbed the thread with red, and the candle flame contracted." No scaffold loops; metaphor chains are coherent (needle → star → route → lie). Rhythm modulates from long breathless accumulations to the staccato "doors clicked like teeth." Micro-slip: "starwash" is a nonce coinage that momentarily jars the otherwise antique diction, but its alienness also fits the speculative frame, so deduction is hairline.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade>
<comment>The embroidery-as-espionage conceit is freshly synthesized: celestial cartography meets textile activism. Risky lyric structure—accumulative shards, no conventional climax—pays off in the final moth-ash image that reconfigures meaning. Specificity is non-portable: only this voice could call laughter "freight moved under the auroras." The premise commits fully; no retreat to safer realism. Bold yet inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
