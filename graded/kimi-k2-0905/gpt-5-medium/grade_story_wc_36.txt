<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The narrator’s guilt and need for atonement are palpable through embodied detail and micro-choices (unrolling trembling maps, re-casing the flute). Internal contradiction is alive: pride in craft vs. recognition of catastrophic shortcut. The decisive shift—playing the third note with loosened weave—pays the cost of public emptiness and private shame. Yet the “driven relic keeper” label is asserted more than dramatized; we see the failure’s aftermath more than the original breach choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the market exhales, driftwood lane points windward, the seam knits clean—an undeniable social cost for the valley. Causal lattice holds: miscount → breach → return → slower weave → restoration. Orientation anchors (Thunder-echo range, canyon hush, chalky dirt) appear before 120 words; deliberate lyric elision is taught early and repaid in the final charged image. One thinning spot: the jump from second to third note could use a micro-beat to show why tempo alone reseals; still, the cost is legible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Thunder-echo range functions as micro-setting that constrains tactics: storms teach stones memory, avalanches begin in whispers, chalky dirt marks the last safe stance. Body-as-setting (bones beneath velvet hush) and the warming flute charge the final image. Spatial choreography is clean: ridgeline → gully → fountain → fountain tiles. Sensory hierarchy skews auditory, justified by the canyon’s hush and the flute’s reed memory.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—repair the breach or live as its vandal—tightens when the first ghosted note refuses to die. Agency is iterative: each note tests strain/give, each driftwood piece slows the weave, the third note loosens tempo, foreclosing shortcut forever. Cost is visible: vacant market stalls, black rain of raven dust, the apology carried off by birds. Escalation is single-crescendo rather than multi-reversal, sufficient for lyric 750-word frame.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</question><comment>Theme emerges as the price of craft arrogance: weaving thresholds demands humility, not virtuosity. Subtext lives in gesture—ravens shaking dust like black rain—rather than exposition. Final image reweights premise: a lane of driftwood left for future travelers crystallizes the lesson without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers: will the valley trust again? the ravens’ cargo of apology is both hope and uncertainty.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>First-person texture is incantatory, syntactically braided like the worlds it describes: “avalanchingly quiet,” “thread seams without tearing.” Perceptual signature is slantwise listening, not visual spectacle. Compression and elision (“they call me…”) are taught early and paid off in final cadence. No head-hop; interiority stays concrete, never drifts into diagnostic label-speak.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies from compressed fragments to rolling anaphora, mirroring loom-shuttle motion. Figurative language is dense yet coherent: no mixed metaphors, vehicles obey stone-and-wind physics. High information density: one sentence often layers sensory, emotional, and causal work. Minor scaffold: “like” similes occasionally cluster; none obscure closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</question><comment>Freshest synthesis: geomantic canyon that literally remembers sound + reed flute as inter-world shuttle + driftwood breadcrumbs as both map and penance. Risk—lyric ellipsis, no overt antagonist—heightens introspective stakes without gimmickry. Premise feels inevitable in hindsight: of course sound would unstitch stone if miscounted. Could edge higher if original breach scene had one vivid flash rather than summary.</comment>
