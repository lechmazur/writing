<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kio’s interiority is lyrically specific—her need for a border against unraveling, her willingness to thin herself fiber by fiber—yet the brother remains off-stage, so the relationship crucible is only implied. The final smile and emptied loom show credible renunciation, but the cost is more poetic than viscerally felt. Still, her contradictory impulses (cling vs. send) are woven into every loom pass, satisfying the 9+ test almost fully.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: each weave pass thickens the emotional density until the fabric’s launch reweights the stake. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Kio’s emptied loom and the brother’s felt wind—with visible cost (“she must thin herself”). Orientation is taught early by sensory anchors; no causality breaks. One hairline slip: the dead-river “wound” is introduced late, but it complicates rather than resolves, so lens holds.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The orchard-bamboo micro-setting is inseparable from action: neglected prunings dictate the hush that Kio spins into warp, the bamboo shafts become heddles, the amber bead clicks the shuttle. Environment literally supplies materials and rhythm; without this grove the weave—and thus the message—cannot exist. Final image of fabric drifting between bamboo scars recharges the setting as both launch corridor and witness. Meets 9+ gate cleanly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—send a message across an impossible distance—is signaled in paragraph 5 and tightens through each weave pass; the loom’s emptying is the felt price. No antagonist is needed; the impossibility itself supplies pressure. One meaningful deepening: the recognition that self-thinning is the toll. Coincidence is absent; escalation is purely accumulative density. Cost is legible but slightly abstract, keeping it just shy of 8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as the cost of connection when bodies cannot bridge distance: silence must be woven into voice, memory into textile. The amber bead’s suspended gnat and the puzzle edges reprice meaning at the end—what traps also carries. No moralizing; the final smile is an earned stasis that forecloses reunion. Ambiguity lingers: is less of Kio left? The reweighting is undeniable yet avoids tidy answers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays tightly glued to Kio’s perceptual filter: “the way sailors taste wind,” “cloth thinking.” Syntax lengthens and contracts with loom rhythm; diction stays within her textile lexicon. No head-hopping; the brother’s sensation is reported only through the fabric’s arrival. Compression like “ancestral fingerprints” on a lantern handle is taught early and pays off in the final sail-breath. Distinctive, controlled, and pressure-responsive.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Rhythm is loom-like: long warp sentences interrupted by weft-beat fragments; no two openings repeat. Figurative language is dense yet purposeful—each metaphor (raveling silence, attic thunder) advances atmosphere or stakes. Zero paraphrase loops; no mixed metaphors. One tiny scaffold: “the way light leaps but words cannot” is almost aphoristic, but it is earned by prior textile physics. Closure line breathes without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Familiar trope—sending a message to a lost sibling—is transformed by the specificity of bamboo-loom alchemy and the puzzle-border navigation system. The amber-bead-fossilized-gnat image is fresh, functional, and reweighted at closure. Risky lyric accumulation could have collapsed into purple haze, yet coherence holds. Synthesis feels inevitable: of course silence must be woven when distance is absolute.</comment>
