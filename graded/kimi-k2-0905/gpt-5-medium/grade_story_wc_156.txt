<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The restorer’s curiosity-driven, methodically playful stance is consistently embodied through micro-choices (tap-counting, solvent timing, coin-rolling). Internal contradiction—fear of erasure versus hunger for discovery—surfaces in the hairline-crack admission and earns the final lighter burden. Grandfather’s voice threads backstory into present action without unearned epiphany. The closure renunciation (leaving the nickel, accepting porous certainty) is causally seeded and carries visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each echo-densified layer increases stake weight until the final Charged Poise reconfigures meaning (“now you are mapping the air”). Orientation anchors within 60 words; garden, curved wall, dawn time, and mural task are immediately legible. Causality is lyric but coherent: because the nickel rings, pigments wake; because pigments wake, the mason’s daughter appears; because she questions, the narrator confesses fear; because fear is voiced, the wall retains its whisper. Closure cost is unmistakable: the narrator walks away lighter yet unfinished, coin left as price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The “listening shells” parabolas, sun-warmed coping, and hairline crack function as micro-setting that directly constrains sonic restoration tactics and final image. Sound wave garden rules (echo returns clothed, temperature-shifting chords) are learned through action, never exposited. Spatial choreography is immaculate: coin rolls along coping, echo fingers trace vines, visitors lean into dishes. Final image—“map unfolding in the air”—recharges the nickel-as-map motif under the same curved geometry.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Dominant stake: fidelity-to-curiosity versus fidelity-to-certainty. Escalation is density-driven: each echo-stirred layer adds aesthetic and ethical cost—risk of erasing living hands. Midpoint tightening: the wall’s breath-question forces public confession; options narrow to perfect restoration or porous memory. Price is visible—nickel abandoned, soot released, mural left bi-vocal—yet curiosity is affirmed under Charged Poise.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges from iterative awakenings: restoration as resurrection of prior voices rather than authoritarian overhaul. Subtext operates in sonic silence—the pause between question and reply—where meaning reconfigures without exposition. Final image reweights premise: “map keeps unfolding” implies perpetual irresolution, a conceptual cost legible on page. No moralizing; complexity retained as wall keeps asking.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>First-person lyric accumulative voice is distinct: needle-sharp verbs (“coax,” “cricketing”), acoustic metaphors (“folded like birds wheeling”), rhythmic coin-ridges. Perceptual signature filters every detail through listening bias, not visual catalog. No head-hopping; interior access stays strictly bounded to restorer. Compression (“temperature of the day”) and purposeful elision (“nested awakenings” pattern taught early) pay off in closure legibility.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Read-aloud ear test passes: cadence modulates from hush of dawn to metallic cricket to dusk hush. Sentence openings vary; no template churn. Figurative language is dense but pattern-taught (echo = bird = map) and coherent under acoustic logic; no mixed metaphors. Zero paraphrase loops; each line adds sonic or tactile newness. High information density: “pigments trembled into awareness” simultaneously advances solvent action and metaphor. Minor filter verbs (“felt”) are voice-motivated, not clustered in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: sound-based fresco conservation is undocumented in fiction; acoustic archaeology as plot engine. Nickel-as-bell, star-as-map micro-transform the familiar hobo nickel into conservation tool. Risky lyric structure (no antagonist, no conventional reversal) pays off via accumulative pressure and Charged Poise. Premise is specific to this voice and curved garden; could not transplant to another backdrop without collapse.</comment>
