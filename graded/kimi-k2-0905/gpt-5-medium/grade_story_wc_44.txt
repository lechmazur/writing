<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The scholar’s “quietly deliberate” trait is embodied through the paced mirror-ritual and the refusal to force noon; interiority is precise (“question refused to stop breathing”). No internal contradiction is staged, so the arc is more ritual than dilemma, but the renunciation of sunlit certainty carries quiet cost. Micro-choices (narrow shutter, nine key-turns) align with motive and foreclose the path of impatient discovery. The character’s competence is balanced by the constraint of looping time, avoiding flawless-observer syndrome.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the gold line slips under skin, reconfiguring meaning of noon and sealing the loop. Causality is lyric-accumulative—mirrors copy, key winds, shadows unfold—each beat deepens pattern rather than pivots. Orientation is taught early (“isle drifted like a patient lung”), waiver earned when the floating logic pays off in the final contract. Cost is visible in the ribbon under skin and the irreversible internalization of noon-without-sun.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The observatory itself becomes a tool: brass lenses, collimators asleep, mirrors arranged like a throat constrain every gesture. Micro-setting (mirrors, shutters, key-slot) physically shapes the ritual; spatial choreography is flawless. Night-as-calendar is never exposition-dumped but acted upon—shutters closed to a seam, key turned nine times. The final gold line across mirrors is an environmental charge that reweights the entire sensorium.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“where shadows go at noon”—is signaled in paragraph two and pursued throughout. Pressure escalates accumulatively: mirrors multiply noons, shadows fold flatter, the hallway of uncast shade narrows choice to inward-only. The protagonist’s agency is ritual micro-precision; each turn of the key deepens the loop rather than breaks it. Cost is the irreversible internalization of noon-without-sun, a conceptual repricing that forecloses normal daylight forever.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the sheer repetition of loop imagery: noon is not a time but an agreement sealed by returning. Subtext lives in silence—the caretaker’s wordless nod, the hush that gathers before mirrors copy themselves. The final image of a gold ribbon under skin reweights the stakes: knowledge is no longer observation but contract. No moral is stated; the aftereffect is the reader’s own unease about the loops they live inside.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Voice is dense, tidal, syntactically braided—“night winds that tasted of iron” sets perceptual signature immediately. Compression (“names behaved like traps with flowers”) teaches the reader to read elision early; payoff is the final ribbon that needs no exposition. Rhythm modulates: longer clauses for lung-like isle, staccato for key-clicks. No head-hop; distance remains tight first-person with inference-only access to caretaker.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Line-level craft is near flawless: information-dense, zero paraphrase loops, metaphors stay physically coherent. Only hairline slip is occasional stacked modifiers (“narrow corridor for a disciplined question”) that momentarily stall airflow, but they occur in low-pressure transition, not peak beats. Sentence music is deliberate, each noun chosen to taste or sound (“fork-born thunder”). Closure line breathes cleanly, no artifact touches the final ribbon image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise fuses rune scholarship, floating nocturnal isle, and spoon-bent reality without sliding into steampunk cosplay; the synthesis feels inevitable. Fresh inflection: noon as contractual loop internalized under skin transforms familiar metaphor of “finding oneself” into ontological signature. Risk in lyric-accumulative structure is rewarded when the pattern crystallizes in the gold line. Specificity of “ring of little eclipsed moons” on the key tooth anchors the entire cosmic scheme inside a tactile object.</comment>
