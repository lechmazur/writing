<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The narrator’s occupation (“sea-foam recollectionist”) supplies a quirky lens rather than a contradiction to act upon; interiority is lyrical but generic (“my favorite neighborhood”) and no micro-choice visibly risks or costs anything. The final “bow” and seed-scattering are gentle, not staked against a live loss, so the change feels ornamental, not earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: lyrical repetitions and image-stacking create density that peaks in the “new path wakes like a cat.” Closure is a Charged Poise reconfiguration—paths revise themselves to protect the mountain’s unborn sentence—yet the cost (renouncing the old trail) is asserted, not dramatized through a visible forfeiture on stage, so the reweighting is felt but lighter than required for 9-band.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The geode-cave is tactile—“light moves like patient fish,” seeds sprout underfoot—and the crater glass object functions as micro-setting that guides the vision beat. Spatial choreography stays clean; no props teleport. The cave never actively constrains exit or supplies resource scarcity, so environment informs but does not force the final tactic, keeping it just outside 9.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—why paths vanish—announced early; pressure deepens through iterative visions showing shepherd turning away. Escalation is textural (accumulating images of self-erasing trails) rather than option-narrowing; no live dilemma confronts the narrator—he observes, conjectures, then respectfully reroutes. Cost is conceptual (loss of old trail) but never threatens the recollectionist’s safety or deadline, muting visceral tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—landscapes edit themselves to avert harm—emerges through the shepherd’s courteous retreat and newborn fault-beast, avoiding explicit moral. The idea is fresh, but articulation drifts toward aphorism (“the world edits its sentences”) that slightly over-explains the resonance. Still, the final image of “considerate caution” re-weights prior material without sermonizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>First-person voice sustains a consistent lyric register—compressed, metaphor-dense, hyphen-rich—whose rhythm breathes with the cave. Diction stays within an arcane folk-science lexicon that fits a “recollectionist.” No dialogue to test, but perceptual signature is distinct; occasional template cadence (“I…”) is minor and pattern-taught, not jarring.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose is highly figured; metaphors are coherent within the fantasy lyric mode, yet density approaches overwriting—four similes within two sentences recur, dulling peak moments. No synonym loops or scaffold sentences, but the clause-stacked lyricism slows propulsion. Final image lands cleanly, so artifact touches atmosphere more than causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fantastical premise—harvesting vanishing paths with sea-foam memory—offers genuine novelty; execution keeps specifics (crater glass, bird-seed syntax) tethered to invented craft. The “path as caretaker” twist feels inevitable in hindsight yet non-obvious, satisfying transformation test. Risk is moderate; originality is high but not paradigm-shattering.</comment>
