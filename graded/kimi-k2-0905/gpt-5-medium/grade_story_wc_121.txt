<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Interiority is lush, embodied, and idiosyncratic (“learn its edges like a blind cartographer”), but the protagonist’s contradictory impulses are more asserted than dramatized in distinct beats; the renunciation lands with poetic cost yet feels slightly abstract because the only concrete choice is the final toe-touch.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Drive lens = Accumulative/Textural; closure is a Charged Poise (“time resumed like a song switching…”) with felt cost—the surrender of flight. Pattern taught early (“generate the path forward through procedural generation”) and paid off when the tablet is sanded smooth, erasing the seed. No orientation debt; spatial choreography on the viaduct is crystal.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Glowing viaduct after rain functions as micro-setting that literally prescribes each footstep via reflection-pathways; the wet stone, neon gutters, and “cooled wires” scent constrain balance and visibility, charging the final image when the protagonist lowers to the stone. Environment is inseparable from tactic.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</question><comment>Dominant stake—conquer labyrinth of self without breaking the suspended instant—tightens when the tablet’s message forbids outrunning the shadow; cost is the surrender of flight itself. Escalation is lyrical rather than causal: each step “tuned the timelines,” a density increase that culminates in the visible price of gravity reclaimed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</question><comment>Theme emerges through recursive imagery of suspension, reflection, and surrender; the final image reweights height as hubris and flat stone as mastery. No moralizing—wisdom is encoded in the tactile loss of lift. Ambiguity lingers: is eternity abandoned or merely accepted?</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</question><comment>Voice is irreducibly specific—caustic starlight, rainlight script, “staggered applause of distant tires”—with rhythmic compression that mirrors breathless suspension. Perceptual signature holds without head-hop; elision (“I did not live forever, but I lived again…”) is pattern-taught and paid off. No register drift or syntactic monotony.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</question><comment>Figurative language is densely layered yet internally coherent (no mixed metaphors); information density is high—“water chased the grooves and made a script of rainlight” does triple sensory, symbolic, and plot work. One template cadence slip (“counting arches, counting breaths, counting…”) is minor and outside the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</question><comment>The fusion of procedural-generation mysticism with lyrical anti-gravity pilgrimage feels fresh; risk-taking in structure (lyric accumulative) heightens meaning without obscuring clarity. The surrender-of-flight closure is inevitable yet non-obvious, reconfiguring the entire timeline motif.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</question><grade>Setup: “gravity defier” frames identity. Development: hover-choice alters timeline options. Closure: surrender of flight reweights self-definition. Cost visible—loss of lift—irreplaceable.</question>
<question>9 B</question><grade>9.2</question><grade>Tablet seeds every beat: grooved script guides steps, runes warm under palm, final sanding erases seed—literal tool of procedural generation. Without it, no path appears and no surrender possible.</question>
<question>9 C</question><grade>8.4</question><grade>Fractured timelines are walked, not merely theme-stated; each step collapses branches, creating live tactical choice. Final toe-touch freezes the mosaic—timelines stop sliding, cost paid.</question>
<question>9 D</question><grade>7.1</question><grade>“Periodically eternal” constrains action—protagonist cannot die, only loop, hence must surrender flight to exit cycle. Trait enables hover yet forbids progress until renounced.</question>
<question>9 E</question><grade>6.9</question><grade>Retracing is the literal gait across reflective puddles, each step a reiteration of prior incarnations. Action shapes final stance, but could be paraphrased as “repeat” without full breakage.</question>
<question>9 F</question><grade>8.7</question><grade>Procedural generation is taught early, governs pathfinding via rain-seeded tablet, and is terminated when tablet is sanded smooth—method surrendered once harvested.</question>
<question>9 G</question><grade>8.0</question><grade>Viaduct after rain supplies the reflective pathway that dictates footfalls; slick arch forces micro-hover choice. Setting literally scripts the climax.</question>
<question>9 H</question><grade>7.5</question><grade>“Between the drop and the ripple” is the live clock—hover must occur inside that sliver; time resumes only when toe kisses stone. Tightens decision window.</question>
<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</question><grade>Labyrinth-of-self motive drives every step; internal conflict dramatized via shadow-refusal and final surrender. Want (flight) conflicts with need (grounding), cost legible.</question>
<question>9 J</question><grade>8.3</question><grade>“Darkening brightness” modulates from neon glare to cool glare-less dawn, mirroring internal shift from seeking light to reading by absence. Tone charges final image.</question>
