<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The alchemist’s interiority is richly concrete—his frost-traced eyelashes, the ache in his thawing thumb—yet his contradictory impulse (risk the last starlight vs. hoard it) is only asserted, never enacted in a beat where we see him hesitate or regret. The sister memory is charged but arrives as single flashback; no present micro-choice re-opens that wound. His final act—sealing the plate, walking away—does foreclose the path back to the orchard, so the renunciation is earned, but the cost is more conceptual than viscerally felt.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the lake exhales, aurora moves, map becomes live—undeniable social cost now that navigation is possible again. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each orphaned object, each heartbeat-echo, accretes until the starlight braid reweights the world’s rule-set. No causal turns are required under this lens; the hush-boom beneath the “closed-eye” bark is the single tightening that reconfigures meaning. Persistent constraint—the ampoule’s finite light—shapes every tactical decision and is pinched shut again in the final gesture.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The withered orchard’s rib-like branches, frozen sap, and glassed-ash rim frame every micro-move; the ladders, labels, and bottle-glass are handled repeatedly, their spatial positions tracked without drift. The nickel-cold plate pressed to bark becomes a listening vertebra—tool-as-setting that directly enables the closure beat. Frost tracing eyelashes and the sleeping-child quilt of lake-ice provide tactile, cold-specific sensory hierarchy that narrows perception to immediacies. Environment literally constrains the final image: the fissure’s warm breath accepted by the plate is the pivot that restarts the sky.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—rekindle navigable pathways for survivors—signals early and tightens once: the moment starlight braids the heartbeat-lines under the eye-shaped scab, the option to keep the light “safe” is foreclosed; he spends it. Cost is visible (ampoule re-sealed, half empty) andConceptually Repriced when the lake exhales. Under Accumulative lens, the deepening is the density of echoes that finally resonance-tune the map; no reversal is required. The price is legible, but because the world-restart is off-stage (aurora steps, compasses agree), the visceral punch is slightly blunted.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges as the translation of private grief (sister’s comet promise) into public utility (shared map); no statement is required. The blank space on the storybook plate and the unprinted wolves embody the terror of uncharted futures; when starlight fills that blank, the motif reweights from absence to beacon. Subtext operates in silence: the sister’s laughter is absent yet drives the sacrifice of the starlight. Final image offers resonant non-literal answer—lake exhales, sky moves—without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person lyric distance remains stable; diction—“flash-paper alchemist,” “safekept starlight,” “hush-boom”—is coinage that stays inside the narrator’s plausible lexicon of wonder. Rhythm accelerates into breathless anaphora during the sealing beat (“to rise…to rise…”) then settles, mirroring the lake’s exhale. No dialogue, so no voice convergence risk. Perceptual signature is unmistakable: POV notices frost eyelashes before global aurora, aligning with micro-set scale and occupational attention.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence. Metaphors are selective, never piled in high-pressure beats—only two per sentence max during starlight leak, which is pattern-taught and paid off. Information density high: one sentence can locate the crater, establish compass failure, and braid memory into present tactility. Minor scaffold: “heartbeat a coordinate” echoes twice in adjacent lines; not enough to dull closure but keeps this just under 9+ perfection.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Familiar tropes—post-apocalyptic hush, star-in-a-bottle, map out of trash—are transformed through hyper-specific subarctic botany and cardiac cartography. Risk of lyric obscurity is taken yet paid off when the “closed eye” bark literally blink-sifts snow. The synthesis of dendrocardiology and alchemy feels inevitable in hindsight yet non-obvious at entry. Conceptual integrity absolute: no retreat from the premise that heartbeats can become longitude.</comment>
