<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The assistant keeper’s contradiction—yearning to whisper yet needing proof—drives every beat; the grandmother’s vial cork steadies breath and choice, its cost felt when pressed to lips while the captain passes. Interiority is embodied (“vial warm with my patience”) and degraded under pressure as salt, gulls, and dew narrow perception. One micro-choice—hum, scent, circle—crystallizes values and forecloses shouting. Mentor’s late silence confirms witness; relationship shifts without head-count clutter.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: because mentor sleeps, therefore narrator tests whisper; because scent and hum are sent, therefore freighter angles in, horn humbled—cost is the mentor’s thumped arrival and the captain’s two-finger salute that acknowledges the whispered map. Closure lands as Charged Poise: options reconfigured, tenderness now a navigable seam. Tiny slip: “rinsed and almost forgiving” is an early abstraction before pressure grounds it; −0.1.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Body-as-setting rules: salt-mopping arms, cork against teeth, dew-drop ears on lantern glass—each constrains breath and tonal pitch. Lighthouse rails smell of “old quarrels of gulls,” a sensory hierarchy that guides the lean-over-gallery choice. Micro-object vial recurs in hand, pocket, sill, final tuck—its warmed state alters breath tempo and thus the freighter’s path. Spatial choreography clean; no impossible gull positions.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“prove whispers beat shouts”—is signaled in line 3 and tightened when the captain’s earlier shout almost carved his hull; now the narrator risks failure if scent fails. One meaningful escalation: the shift from paper letter (last week) to airborne perfume—this narrows options to non-verbal persuasion with visible cost of exposure (mentor catches the act). Agency is attention and endurance, not brute reversal; cost is the exposed tenderness the mentor now “hums” beside. No coincidence; wind answers only after scent is offered.</comment>

<comment>Theme emerges through sensory particulars: scent as soft compass, vial as holy anchor—no abstract statement until final “gentle map of breath,” which reweights the premise. Subtext in captain’s two-finger salute and mentor’s closed eyes: witnessing tenderness reframes masculinity and authority. No moralizing; resonance lingers in village bells retuning to water-key. Slight risk: “screaming tenderness” could read as thesis, but context keeps it visceral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>First-person lyric texture sustains maritime concentration: syntactic tide of comma-spliced clauses mirrors wave pulse; diction salted with “hissing,” “brass,” “gull-quarrels.” Perceptual signature is acoustic-tactile—listening for cable vibrations, tasting dew ears—never tourist-catalog. No head-hop; mentor’s interior accessed only through scrubbed face and mutter. Compression taught early (“whispers travel farther”) and paid off in final “gentle map.”</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with scene: long sentences in calm, fragments under pressure (“I hum. The hum is not loud…”). Information dense—single sentence often does scent, metaphor, and因果. Zero loops; no synonym churn. One mixed metaphor patch: “dull knife” freighter vs. “soft compass” petals—quickly re-anchored in scent mechanics, so −0.1. Line-level artifacts never touch closure; final line lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Whisper-guided navigation via night-garden scent is fresh synthesis of apian lore and maritime lore; trope of lone keeper subverted by tender non-shouting. Image of dew-drop “small ear” is memorable and specific to this voice. Risk-taking in lyric causal chain (scent → wind → hull) pays off; no gimmick. Could swap captain’s mother ear with another detail, so not fully irreplaceable—halts at 8.7.</comment>
