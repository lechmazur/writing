<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The mapper’s interiority—wind combing reeds, unyoking “yapping urgency”—is vivid and embodied; the contradiction between vigilance and forced stillness is sustained in scene. Yet the arrival of the girl triggers no fresh micro-choice from him; he watches her nod rather than risking a tactic shift, so the arc’s cost lands more on the village men than on his own exposed flaw. Closure still feels earned because his ledger of swallowed notes and withheld shout crystallizes into the teaching moment, but the absence of a visible personal renunciation caps the score below 8.8.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each image—ice seam, swallow threads, salt carried—adds density until the final “widening steadiness” reweights the stake. Orientation is anchored by line 4 (“basalt sanctuary”), well within the 120-word grace; transitions are single-scene walk-and-return, so no orientation penalty. Closure is a Charged Poise: the village sets down ropes while the mapper’s final ledger page turns, a conceptual cost felt as “the world admit us like a house unlatching.” Persistent constraint—the need to keep watching—shapes every tactic, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The frozen lake, viaduct rails, and basalt walls are not backdrop but instruments: moon paths dictate where men scatter salt, warm stone dictates where the community sleeps. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true—sound of ringing basalt, magnet pull through boot leather—never tourist catalog. The final image of whitening fog swallowing the viaduct recharges every prior rail-shine, so setting actively constrains the closing choice. Micro-setting qualifies: the ledger itself becomes terrain the mapper must physically open to let the world in.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will impatient fear surrender to patient vigilance—tightens when the girl’s rook-feather question forces the mapper to convert private practice into public teaching. Escalation is textural: each task (salt, threads, dust) widens the “quiet rings of thaw” until the option to tighten ropes is foreclosed. Cost is visible: men set down ropes, swallow shadows fold, mapper’s silence becomes instruction. No coincidence; pressure coils under Accumulative lens until stance crystallizes, satisfying the single meaningful deepening required at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the repeated refusal to shout: patience is not passive but an active sculpting that costs voice and comfort. Subtext lives in gesture—setting down ropes, lifting chin—never thesis. Final image of “the world admit us like a house unlatching” reweights the premise without moralizing, achieving Conceptual Repricing. Ambiguity lingers: revolution remains a school, not a victory, satisfying complexity requirement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>First-person texture is distinct: “yapping urgency,” “thin horizon,” “slow thunder under the ice” are idiosyncratic perceptions, not recycled lyric stems. Rhythm modulates from long breath-sparse sentences during walking to staccato injunctions (“Do these things softly purposeful”) at the teaching beat, mirroring emotional intensity. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk is zero; perceptual signature remains coherent. Compression (“I stored them in a small ledger”) teaches the elision pattern early and pays off when the ledger is finally opened, meeting the 9+ threshold with hairline slack only in a few adjective clusters (“whitening fog”).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty: “Pebbles stuck to its rails as if they remembered the mountain” layers sensory fact with geologic memory. No paraphrase loops; each metaphor extends prior physics (“ironstone spine crossing the valley and humming like a struck harp”). Filter verbs are sparse and voice-motivated. One mixed metaphor—“patience from impatience, chipping at the block”—is minor against the density gain. Closure line “our patient revolution stood” is crisp, uncluttered, and propulsive, sealing the read-aloud cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The premise—mapping horizons by doing nothing louder—flips the explorer trope into inward cartography. Magnetic viaduct, rook feather, and basalt sanctuary are particularized objects, not generic wilderness props. Risk is taken in the quiet ending that refuses spectacle; payoff is the conceptual repricing where stillness becomes insurrection. Synthesis feels inevitable: every magnetized pebble anticipates the final un-latched house. Minor slack comes from familiar ice-moon symbolism, but the angle remains fresh enough for upper band.</comment>
