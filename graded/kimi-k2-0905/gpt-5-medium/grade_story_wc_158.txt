<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The insomniac-poet identity is vivid via curating darkness “like a library,” embodied insomnia, and salt-to-sugar motive. Interior contradiction—vigilance vs. devotion—drives micro-choices (pressing sea-blooms, breathing onto postcard). The final renunciation (learning to nap between heartbeats) pays the cost of abandoning vigilance, earned by prior causal beats. Voice occasionally abstracts into lyric shorthand (“reef-shadow joy”) that blurs embodied specificity, preventing 9-band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: tide-echo, shell-glow, postcard reprise deepen pattern toward closure. Orientation is deliberately disorienting yet taught by ~100 words (“gargantuan shell,” “scallop lip”) and pays off at the Charged Poise ending. Earned Stasis lands: the protagonist forecloses the insomnia-vigilance path, accepting vulnerability inside a self-grown reef; cost is the surrender of perpetual alertness. One minor causality wobble: Gardener arrives by “currents of remembered scents,” a soft coincidence that does not materially resolve stakes, so eschews 9.0.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Shell-as-body micro-setting constrains every choice (sleep, song, treaty signing) and charges the final image. Sensory hierarchy follows poet-bias: ink-salt echo, nacre whorls, pressed sea-blooms. Spatial choreography remains coherent—drip-creak orchestra tracks across chambers. Weather/tide are integrated causally, not decorative. Lacks 9-band only because environment never actively threatens or limits physical mobility; it shelters more than it tests.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: convert vigilance into vulnerable rest without betraying memory. Tightening occurs at postcard-breath beat: insomnia vs. blossom armistice becomes binary, foreclosing middle ground. Cost is surrendered sleepless identity; price is legible in “I still wake often, but rise gentler.” Agency is interior yet decisive; no external antagonist needed. Escalation is textural: color, drip, glow intensify until stance crystallizes. Slight reserve: cost is emotional, not tangible—could use one physical forfeiture to reach 8.8.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: pain transmuted into beauty is enacted, not preached. Recurrent postcard and reef metaphors reweight at closure—constellations redrawn, shells extrude gardens—offering CR. Ambiguity lingers: gentler waking is not cure, resisting tidy moral. Final image of “tides rock the shell home” answers the longing question without thesis. Therapy-speak almost intrudes (“what hurt was asking of me”) but is buffered by briny specificity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>First-person poet POV sustains lyric compression, taught early (“indexing heartbeats”). Syntax mirrors insomnia: long clauses, enjambed fragments, reef-shadow neologisms. Perceptual signature—salt-to-sugar, sea-bloom ink—stays character-bound. No dialogue; thus no voice convergence. Occasional elevated diction (“vegetal,” “conceptual repricing”) nudges register drift, but pattern remains legible and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Rhythmic control matches tidal surge: sentence length swells and ebbs. Information density high—one line often layers sensory, metaphorical, and emotional work. Metaphors stay coherent within brine/reef ecosystem; few mixed-vehicle hazards. Minor scaffold: “via half-sung lullabies…” repeated as refrain; reads as intentional pattern, not loop, because it accumulates choir-like payoff. No artifacts touch closure beat, so 8.3 holds.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses insomnia, conch-shell womb, and interstellar postcard into fresh constellation. Reef-building-as-healing reverses typical recovery arc; salt-to-sugar photosynthesis literalizes metaphor with conceptual integrity. Risky lyric compression taught early and paid off. Familiar “meeting the guide” trope is subverted: Gardener arrives by scent-current, offers breath-signature not magic cure. Only withhold of 9.0: postcard’s galaxy conceit could push physics rules further.</comment>
