<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Arin’s motive—turning silence into music—stays legible, but the “quietly charismatic” label is never tested by any social friction; the advisor’s whispered prompts supply the only external pressure, so Arin’s interiority stays abstract. The embodied contradictions we need (joyful sorrow) are declared, not dramatized through micro-choice. Still, the renunciation of applause and the empty camera create a visible cost, earning a partial Earned Stasis.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The piece runs Accumulative/Textural: cadence and image density tighten until the single bell-swing deepens the stake—silence mapped becomes silence released. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the camera’s empty click and the tide-washed map reweight the premise with undeniable conceptual cost. Orientation is lyric-taught from line 1, so the early shimmer is waived; no lens ambiguity at the end.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Harbor, moon, boards, bell, camera, and salt-bloom work as micro-settings that literally constrain every gesture; the camera’s empty belly and the bell’s single permission-stain charge the final image. Spatial choreography stays clean across the pier-to-bell walk. Sensory selection obeys Arin’s artist-perception filter, never drifting into tourist catalog.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—can silence be translated without violating its absence?—tightens once: the bell-swing risks breaking the very hush Arin worships. That single deepening, under Accumulative lens, is sufficient for 600 words and carries visible cost: the camera stays empty, the map is erased by tide. No reversal is needed; the tension is whether silence will survive its own transcription.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the accretion of absences: every image (empty camera, wiped map, unstruck bell) reweights the premise that music is born only where sound is withheld. The final coordinate-system of silence offers a non-literal, non-moral answer: forgetting is the price of song. No late thesis statement; the tide’s erasure is the argument.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The lyric third-person hovers at psychic distance 2–3, filtering every predicate through Arin’s artist-ear: “tide hummed like glass,” “shutter was a metronome.” Syntax coils and releases in sync with the mapping cadence; no head-hop or register drift. Compression is pattern-taught early (“stories thinned to murmurs”) and paid off in the final erased map.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm is deliberate, with anaphora and fragment beats that mimic sign-language pulses; no template cadence or synonym loops. Metaphors stay coherent within the glass-and-moon schema. One minor scaffold: “joyful sorrow” is abstract shorthand, but it is isolated and does not touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The core premise—composing music by mapping silence with a filmless camera—is a fresh synthesis of familiar tropes (artist-at-harbor, moonlit epiphany). The vintage camera and bell permission invert expected utility: the tool that cannot record becomes the only ethical witness. Risk stays coherent; no gimmickry obscures closure.</comment>
