<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The narrator’s contradictory pull between documentary detachment and visceral re-rooting is embodied in tactile micro-choices—tracing stele routes with a thumb, scavenging pomegranate wood for the gnomon—so the renunciation of departure earns its hinge-moment cost. Interiority stays concrete, never slides into label-speak; “the orchard had always been a mouth” is perceived, not preached. Sami functions less as secondary crucible than chorus, yet the single-POV default is met; status dynamics are thin but not required. Earned stasis lands when the narrator accepts orbit instead of exit, foreclosing the diaspora loop with visible nightly ritual.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the rebuilt sundial’s shadow “kisses the numeral for home,” crystallizing a new stance whose cost is the lifelong orbit that will tether him to graves and quince trees. Accumulative lens holds—each unearthed fragment layers density until the final image re-weights faith as listening, not owning. Orientation is anchored by line 3; no ambiguity. The rib-of-wood beat is the visible price that charges the final image, satisfying 9+ cost test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</question><comment>Catacomb orchard is not backdrop but instrument: roots braiding skulls dictate the gentle cataloguing rhythm and supply the pomegranate rib that becomes gnomon, directly constraining the rebuild beat. Sensory hierarchy is POV-tilted—dew “jewels” the bronze at dawn, reflecting narrator’s reclaimed wonder. Spatial choreography is flawless; shovel knot, cracked stone ring, and stele stay tracked. The final orbit micro-setting charges the last image, meeting 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</question><comment>Dominant stake—restore lost faith—tightens when each spadeful exposes mirrored interruptions in bone and self. One meaningful deepening: the gnomon’s absence stops time literalized as “hours lost their anchor,” forcing the rebuild decision under visible pressure. Agency is sustained; no coincidence resolves. Cost is the lifelong orbit, felt on-page in the closing sentence, satisfying escalation under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</question><comment>Theme emerges as listening-as-faith rather than belief-as-possession; the orchard’s “grammar” is relearned through tactile acts, never sermonized. Subtext in the coin-under-root reburial silently argues that history completes itself only when we relinquish archival ownership. Final image of nightly circumambulation offers a non-literal answer: faith is motion that keeps the dead speaking. No tidy moral, no echo—specificity carries resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Lyracist diction—“time hesitate like a held breath,” “shadow returned like a migrating bird”—is patterned from first paragraph, paid off in the migratory shadow closure, so the compression reads taught, not purple. Perceptual signature is consistent: the narrator notices etymologies of soil, never tourist vistas. Syntax modulates with pressure, shortening as dusk rebuild nears. No head-hopping; POV distance stable.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</question>
<comment>High information density: one sentence often layers sensory, symbolic, and causal work—“We cataloged the bones, but our hands kept arranging them like notes in a hymn we had forgotten” advances plot, reveals interior drift, and foreshadows sonic closure. Rhythm breathes with scene tempo; longer sentences during midday lull, clipped fragments at sundial fitting. Figurative language is selective, never clustered in high-pressure beats. No loops, no scaffold, no mixed metaphors. Copy clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</question>
<comment>Familiar diaspora-return frame is re-inflected through catacomb orchard and rebuild of timepiece from human bone-wood, a specific synthesis that feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk—letting excavation slow to near-stasis under gentleness—pays off by making the final orbit earned rather than sentimental. No close echoes of canonical scenes. Conceptual integrity intact: every image (seed beside heel, coin under root) is reused to reweight meaning at closure.</comment>
