<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The keeper’s “observe gaps” method is embodied in every beat: crouching to the notch, matching stem to wear, sweeping the plank to hide the shrine. His contradictory impulses—grief-archivist vs. living signalman—co-exist in scene, never abstracted. The final choice (lantern swing that may only mirror himself) is renunciation earned by the dock’s prior ledger of pain; cost is visible in the salt packet pressed into the page. Voice remains个体, never lighthouse cliché.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the lantern code answers the stranger’s silence, re-weighting the entire chain of notches and knocks. Causality holds under Accumulative lens—each sensory layer (opal sheen, salt ledger, flower key) tightens the emotional cost until the final light-signal. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“At nautical twilight the dock…”). No teleporting props; the flower’s fit into the notch is prepared by earlier tactile rehearsal.</comment>

<comment>The dock itself is the micro-setting that constrains every move: the worn notch dictates where knees bend, where lantern light must land. Mist, gull refusal, and salt packet embed sensory hierarchy filtered through a keeper who reads wood grain like scripture. Spatial choreography is immaculate—plank seams, iron steps, harbor bar track cleanly. Final image (keeper holding flower + light) recharges the opal sheen, making environment inseparable from the closure cost.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—deliver the stranger’s unspoken answer—tightens when the notch-letters are discovered; options narrow to “swing lantern or let silence win.” Agency is observational yet decisive: aligning stems, sweeping traces, choosing the obsolete code. Cost is legible: the keeper accepts perpetual custodianship of another ghost, paid with salt packet and page-fold. No coincidence rescues; the answering light is left genuinely ambiguous.</answer>

<comment>Theme of reciprocal witness emerges through concrete recurrence: girl’s 15-year-old knocks → stranger’s inverted chest-tap → keeper’s lantern swing. Isolation is not lamented but repurposed into a quiet postal service. No moralizing; final paragraph’s “promise that can be borrowed but not owned” is conceptual repricing earned by the dock’s absorbed grief. Ambiguity lingers: is the harbor reply real or reflection?—yet the emotional ledger is undeniably balanced.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>First-person voice owns a maritime-philosopher diction—“tide keeps its own ledger,” “gray vows”—that stays within a self-taught keeper’s lexicon. Syntax lengthens under contemplation, then shortens to stressed fragments (“So I began…”) during tactile investigation. Perceptual signature is obsessive-gap reading: every description is slit, seam, or scratch. No filter-verb stacks; each metaphor is physically rooted (opal dock = smoothed stone). Rhythm accelerates with the lantern swing, breathing with mist ribbons.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet lyrical: “colors hushed themselves to gray vows” performs double duty—atmosphere + personification of sea. No paraphrase loops; each sentence adds new physical intel (notch brightness, salt packet fold). Figurative vehicles stay coherent—dock as ledger, flower as key, light as reply. Opening and closing lines mirror without repetition, creating circular cadence. Micro-moves (“I swept the dock”) prevent shrine sentimentality, keeping momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Familiar trope—lonely lighthouse keeper—reframed as archivist of maritime silence rather than savior. The Edelweiss-as-key and notch-as-letterbox feel inevitable yet fresh in this coastal context. Risk of “answer your own signal” could dissolve into solipsism, but text holds ambiguity as thematic strength, not weakness. Specificity of tidal ledger and lantern code transforms generic isolation into a singular occupational ritual.</comment>
