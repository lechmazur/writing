<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The collective “we” is credibly individuated through embodied labor, thirst, and grief; micro-choices (climbing, knotting, counting breaths) reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. Interior contradiction is absent—no one dissents once the bell rings—but the shared flaw (cling to old grievances) is acted out in the mid-stream apology trading, so the renunciation of isolation is earned. Relationships function as crucible: the stranded families force the orchard to become one body, altering status from stranger to kin. Cost is visible in raw hands and the long dissolve of the final bell-rain inside ribs.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the nebula appears only after collective exhaustion is accepted, reweighting prior squabbles as petty. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—each bell-ring, chalk line, and gift jars density until the final misted bell-spray crystallizes the new orbit of trust. Causality holds: Lio’s wind-fingers loosen fruit, chalk directs labor, bell governs rhythm; no late rule changes. Orientation is clear by line 3 (orchard planet, floating arches, harvest). Cost is legible in the “rain inside our ribs” image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Setting is not backdrop but tool: floating arches become ladders, rafts, and finally a river of air; the bell garden is a micro-setting that constrains every trade and story. Sensory hierarchy follows crisis—thirst narrows perception to wind-in-teeth, sunset widens to nebula lantern. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly during the rescue: twelve hammocks, severed ladder, slings lowered, breath-count child. The butterfly bell recurs with reweighted meaning: first water signal, then oath, finally misted rain that charges the closing image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake is collective survival of identity after storms erase labels; tightening occurs when the bell’s unknown braid forces immediate orchestration—climbers with splicers, cooks with medics—foreclosing solo heroics. Protagonist agency is the decision to stack baskets into boats and row by breath, paying the price of bruised fruit and chalked apologies mid-air. Cost is visible in raw palms and the long dissolve ring that “felt like rain inside our ribs.” No coincidence resolves; the nebula appears only after the orchard moves as one body.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the shift from private grief to shared exhaustion: “tired together rather than tired alone.” Subtext operates in the bell’s silence between rings and the chalk margins where no name is signed. The final image (mist raining on faces and ladders) offers a non-literal answer: trust is a weather one can breathe. No moral is stated; the nebula’s appearance reconfigures prior brambled hope as the cost of entry.</comment>

<comment>First-person plural remains stable—no individuated interiority leaks in. Perceptual signature is orchard-bound: wind tasted in teeth, fruit assessed for bruise, bell heard as humble comet. Rhythm modulates with labor: short clauses during rescue, elongated sentences while drifting toward nebula. Diction stays within collective lexicon—“gnarl,” “splicers,” “knotters”—without academic drift. Compression is purposeful: “we kept finding small gifts” elides logistics but teaches the pattern of unseen generosity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud ear is musical: alliteration (“bell…braided alarm that braided us”) without purple overload. Information density high—one sentence can deliver setting, emotion, and myth (“orchard planet riddled with floating rock arches”). No paraphrase loops; each chalk instruction adds new tactical detail. Metaphors are internally coherent: bell thread as comet, nebula as lantern in fog. Final line “rain inside our ribs” is precise, not sentimental, and recharges earlier thirst motif.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses ghost-story with agrarian SF and collective lyric—fresh synthesis. Transformation test fails if names/places swapped: only this orchard’s bell-butterfly-mothweed garden could produce the final misted oath. Risk in first-person plural paid off without committee-voice drift. Tropes (ghost, nebula) are re-grounded in orchard labor and chalk logistics. Specificity: “jars of sap, coils of rope, chalk kept dry in waxed pouches” feels discovered, not décor.</comment>
