<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The narrator’s vocation as “wreck-diver ghost whisperer” is vividly embodied through tactile micro-choices—mapping Morse on paper, warming the globe between lamplight and breath—showing a hierarchy of values (truth over spectacle) that costs him the easy triumph of public accusation. Interior contradiction surfaces in the quiet refusal to cheer: he wants justice yet protects the town from its own fracture, a renunciation legible as Earned Stasis. The only minor slip is a touch of diagnostic self-labelling (“I am the kind of guide who weaves truth carefully”) that slightly over-articulates what the action already proves.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the foreman’s lowered eyes and the silent torchlit harbor reconfigure power without a shouted verdict, the cost felt in the communal hush. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each tapped dream, mapped dot, and shrine listening session layers density until the globe’s password reweights the official story. The melted snow globe’s final stillness crystallizes options: justice achieved through shared recognition rather than spectacle, the constraint of gentleness persisting.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Environment is never backdrop: the glacier shrine’s candle halos limit acoustics, forcing the narrator to warm the globe slowly; the ferry’s silt-filled ribs provide the only path to Sofia’s seat. The melted snow globe functions as micro-setting—its blurred city and rusted crank physically constrain how evidence can be extracted and shared. Spatial choreography is immaculate; bodies, offerings, and portholes track cleanly from ice to wreck to town square.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—surfacing submerged truth without shattering the community—tightens when the narrator chooses the shrine’s collective listening over public shaming; the option to accuse is foreclosed in favor of metered hymn. Pressure accumulates through each dream cameo and tap mapping; the welding company’s concession is earned by the townspeople’s recognition, not external force. Visible price: the narrator accepts anonymity and the townspeople accept complicity, both legible in the final shared silence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: truth is a shared rhythm one must dare to hear together rather than weaponize. The snow globe’s transformation from child’s toy to lifeboat of evidence reweights innocence into responsibility without moralizing. Final image—globe shining in borrowed starlight then resting—offers a resonant, non-literal answer: justice is a collective quiet that survives the thaw.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>First-person voice carries a distinct perceptual signature—silt memory, candle halos, plankton prayers—sustaining lyric compression without opacity. Patterned elision (“I could have shouted, but…”) is taught early and pays off in the withheld cheer. Syntax mirrors dive cadence: long breathy clauses on ascent, clipped fragments underwater. No head-hopping; knowledge stays strictly bound to the narrator’s sensory reach.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Prose density is high—each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or causation without scaffold. Figurative language is selective and coherent: “cabins gape like pulled teeth” fits the narrator’s dental awareness of metal and bone. Rhythm modulates from the metronomic taps to the final stuck crank, mirroring the story’s cadence shift. Zero loops, mixed metaphors, or register drift; the closing “then rest” lands with surgical economy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>Premise—ghost-whispering wreck diver who decodes posthumous Morse via dreams—feels inevitable yet wholly fresh. The snow globe as encrypted testimony transforms a kitsch object into forensic instrument, a risk that deepens emotional stakes without gimmickry. Synthesis of maritime disaster, communal guilt, and lyric ritual produces a singular artistic stance unlikely to survive renaming or relocation.</comment>
