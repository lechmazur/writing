<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The watcher's interior contradiction—trust in his own vigilance versus the memory of a past failure—drives every micro-choice; the final nod with the pilot crystallizes a cost that has been embodied, not declared. Competence is balanced by the scar under the friendship, keeping flaw active. No label-speak; emotion is muscle and weather. The earned stasis lands because the earlier rupture was dramatized, not recalled in abstract.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the ship down, the friendship still scarred, the burden carried better—cost felt in the tightened chest and the unspoken apology. Causal linkage holds: revised route → lantern code → pilot’s tilt → safe kiss of cradle. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“platforms stitched to the trunks”). One shard, one POV, one transitionless scene; lens is Causal throughout.</comment>

<comment>The arbor’s creak, the rope’s hunger, the lantern’s green-blue fog—each tactile detail constrains the next tactical move. The parachute buckle recurs as micro-setting that alters timing and swing. Cloud-heat fist and colder ribbon are learned through action, not lecture. Spatial choreography is clean: rail, slot, cradle, wrist—no drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—preserve trust under pressure—is signaled in paragraph 5 and tightened when the pilot explicitly asks for eyes, forcing a public revision that risks reputation. The vortex blister raises physical cost; the rope’s half-arm length is a visible price that shapes the final approach. One meaningful escalation under causal lens; no coincidence resolves. Options narrow to “tilt early or repeat the burst rail.”</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges: vigilance is fallible, trust is a scar that must be re-earned nightly. The nod at the end reweights every prior lantern tap and rope feed without moralizing. Subtext lives in the unspoken apology and the shared scar. No thesis lines; meaning is welded to the tactile ritual.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>First-person voice carries a distinct perceptual signature—sound felt through gloves, stars kept shy by low lanterns. Syntax lengthens and contracts with wind shear; no head-hop. Diction stays within the watcher’s professional lexicon; “hungry slot,” “metallic vow” are idiosyncratic yet clear. Compression (“we are not done paying”) lands harder than exposition.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with the arbor: long vowel sentences under calm, clipped fragments under buckle-test. No scaffold loops; each sentence advances tactic or atmosphere. Figurative density is high but patterned early (“breathing cathedral”) and paid off in the final sigh. Zero filter-verb stacks; props track cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Sky-orchard supply docks feel fresh because the emotional core—re-earning trust after a near-catastrophe—is grounded in rope tension and lantern code, not aerial spectacle. The inversion of ground-as-sky and the “cloud seam” as navigable artery are specific to this world. Risk is taken with lyric compression, but coherence holds. Transformation test fails if transplanted to a prairie; the arbor is necessary.</comment>
