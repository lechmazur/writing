<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Lyr’s “diminutive titan” contradiction is embodied: he writes, waits, arranges mirrors—power through patience. His patched robe and tin reliquary anchor interiority without exposition; the micro-choice to open the pellet box charges the climax. Serane’s arc is equally tactile—the ink climbing her finger externalizes identity collapse. Both characters show contradictory impulses simultaneously (pride/terror, pity/resolve) and pay a visible cost, satisfying the 9+ test.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Causal lens: each pellet-planted book causes Serane’s next revelation; the rune-of-drift column causes past/present to handshake at the exact beat she touches the ink. Closure is Earned Stasis—Serana’s renunciation is irreversible, ink stain on skin the visible cost. Orientation is secured by word 60 (“ancient temple library…stone”). No teleporting props; the pellet’s trail is causally legible from first drop to final glossary sealing.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The library is not backdrop but mechanism: drifting shelves realign to expose the missing-comma decree; skylight fractures as mask cracks. Iron-gall scent and vellum texture constrain Serane’s reading sequence—she obeys the “carpets were thick here” rule. The ink pellet functions as micro-setting: its tin mouth opening re-orients power between them. Environment directly shapes tactics and charges the final image, clearing the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“unmask the pretender”—is signaled in paragraph four and tightens when the ink brands her finger, foreclosing coronation. Agency is Lyr’s arranged mirrors; cost is Serane’s public identity. One meaningful escalation: the rune slides past/present until the decree with restored comma surfaces—no off-stage resolution. Pressure stays causal and coherent; coincidence only complicates (retreat of retinue is social consequence, not luck).</comment>

<question>5</question><question>9.3</question>
<comment>Theme emerges through ink-as-blood genealogy: legitimacy is a chemical reaction, not parchment. The missing comma morphs from typographic joke to existential wound—wisdom earned, not lectured. Final image of the pellet “sleeping like potential thunder” reweights every prior drop as latent justice. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers—library keeps its doors misplaced.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</question>
<comment>Third-person omniscient stays anchored in Lyr’s perceptual signature: “dust motes spiraled as if stars rehearsing” is his librarian metaphor. Syntax alternates between short declarative (catalogue precision) and lyrical spiral clauses that mimic drifting aisles. No head-hop; Serane’s interior is read through gesture and ink stain, not intrusion. Voice modulation under pressure—final paragraph collapses into hushed monosyllables—“swept the fallen pride into a pan”—perfect cadence shift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.4</question>
<comment>Zero loops; each sentence advances image or causality. “Ink recognized kinship before law did” is dense, visceral, irreplaceable. Metaphors stay internally coherent (ink/ivy, carpet/path, thunder/potential) and never violate library physics. Read-aloud rhythm varies from spondaic thumps (“iron gall ink pellet”) to hushed fricatives when pride collapses. No filter-verb stacks or register drift; every word earned.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.5</question>
<comment>The “diminutive titan” paradox and “rune of drift” mechanics feel fresh yet inevitable in hindsight. Using a comma splice as the fulcrum of dynastic theft is a brilliant, specific inversion of epic fantasy MacGuffins. Library-as-time-bellows transforms familiar setting into active antagonist. Risky lyric compression pays off: constellation choreography teaches reader to accept temporal slippage without exposition.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Lyr’s tiny stature is not cosmetic—being overlooked lets him manipulate royal readings unseen. He authors every beat: pellet placement, book order, final glossary sealing. Without his scale/paradox, the plan collapses; closure ink belongs to him. Cost: he remains forever small, sovereign only of dust.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Pellet appears first line, handled in every beat—writing, rolling, staining. Chemistry of iron-gall bonding to skin is the irreversible signature that ends the masquerade. Final tin-cradle image reprises “inheritance” with reweight: potential thunder now spent. Remove pellet and no unmasking mechanism exists.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Rune etched “pale as a healed scar” is taught early; its hum slides aisles to align decree at exact beat Serane needs to read it. Moves context, not bodies—core rule obeyed. Without drift, past handwriting never confronts present claimant. Slightly abstract cost keeps it from 9+.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>“Regally unpretentious” is shown: patched robe yet precise sovereignty over dust, refusal to accuse aloud. Constrains him to indirect combat—mirrors not blades. Enables opponent’s self-sundering. Trait recurs in final sweeping gesture, but cost is more conceptual than visceral.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>Sunder is literal—comma restored severs her from dynasty; metaphorical—name blurs off her skin. Action is the hinge beat: happens on-page, irreversible, stakes pivot. She performs her own sundering under Lyr’s arranged light. Remove it and no coronation withdrawal occurs.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Cryptic pellet-messages are seeded first paragraph and drive every discovery: iron scent, moonlight rearrange, comma decree. Mechanics legible—between vellum leaves, ink map/date/name. Serane follows bookmark trail; order of books is tactic. Final glossary sealing continues the method, closing loop.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Library breathes, drifts, fractures skylight—active agent, not scenery. Provides rune, pellet cache, hidden decree, witness mice. Spatial choreography clear: column near skylight, bench where time grazes floor. Without sentient shelves aligning histories, truth never surfaces.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>“Pause of shifting constellations” frames opening and ending; rune activates during this celestial breath. Creates lived clock—when constellations resume, doorway remembers itself. Time is trackable yet elastic, forcing decision before astral drift ends. More atmospheric than tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Unmasking desire is stated early, embodied in every pellet drop. Conflicted when Lyr witnesses her tears “brilliant as a forfeit”—pity vs duty. Final cost visible: ink stain = permanent exposure. Motivation remains single-threaded; could use more private doubt beat.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Graceful collapse is coherent arc: silver laughter → torn syllable → skylight fracture → quiet sweeping. Tone modulates from star-spiral wonder to hushed acceptance, matching physical decay of lies. Final “potential thunder” sleep maintains elegiac cadence, charging last image with poised aftermath.</comment>
