<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The storm-recorder persona is convincingly etched through perceptual filters and tool-use, but the interior contradiction promised in the “refuse poor maps” motive never visibly collides with an on-page fear or flaw; the final stance is credible yet costs are only atmospheric, not personal. The micro-choice to plant decoy charts while dispatching the true data is sharp, but the beat is solitary—no status crucible or relational shift tests resolve. Still, the voice’s meteorological conscience feels lived-in and specific.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Earned Stasis: the protagonist forgoes heroics for quiet witness, charts surrendered but integrity preserved, cost legible in the bench left empty and the pigeon now beyond recall. The lateral sidestep behind the fig is a decisive physical act that crystallizes the new stance. Causality is lyric-accumulative rather than thriller-causal, but the pressure coil (rogue quarantine vs. personal recorder) tightens neatly; no orientation debt; lens holds.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Courtyard stones, barometer ticks, and pigeon-warmth are tactile and selective; weather readings double as emotional barometry, charging the final image. The micro-setting of the bench-as-stage and the arch-as-exit directly shape the stealth exit tactic, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography survives the single long paragraph; bodies track cleanly. Only the off-stage museum spire is mildly abstract, but it never governs a choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—personal integrity vs. state obfuscation—is signaled early and tightens once: surrender forged charts or risk capture. The sideways exit forecloses negotiation, paying the price of perpetual outsider status; cost is visible in the dusk-soaked bench left behind. No second reversal, but the single deepening is sufficient under Accumulative lens. The quarantine stays abstract, slightly blunting visceral jeopardy.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges as the impossibility of clean measurement in a polity that edits storms; the final ledger entry “as it pleased” reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext lives in gesture—pebbles courting breeze, pigeon drinking—these images return charged with the cost of refusal. No motif checklist; the barometer is tool first, symbol second. The closing image resists tidy epiphany yet resonates.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is meteorological, synesthetic, and consistent: “pressure fell… sideways” maps physics onto psychology. Syntax modulates from long breathless accumulations to the staccato of “I lifted my hands” under peak tension. Compression like “note… like a cough held too long” is taught early and paid off. No head-hopping; distance stable; diction never exceeds the observer’s lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>High density—most sentences couple sensory report with causal cue; no scaffold loops or synonym churn. Rhythm breathes with scene tempo: fountain-metronome clicks mirror stealth pacing. Figurative layering is disciplined; vehicles stay meteorological and cohere. Minor register lift (“conceptual repricing”) appears only in narrator’s professional idiom, not intrusion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The storm-recorder vs. rogue-quarantine pairing feels fresh; the pigeon tube reprise twist is unexpected yet prepared. Specificity of barometer ethics and “geometry of control” prevents template drift. Risk in lyric-accumulative structure heightens coherence rather than gimmickry. Could edge higher if the quarantine’s human stakes were more visceral, but the conceptual angle is boldly committed to.</comment>
