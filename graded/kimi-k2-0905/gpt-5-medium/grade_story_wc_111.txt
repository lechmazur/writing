<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The gardener’s motive—proving the garden remembers—drives every micro-choice; the mended-deception confession is a credible, costly renunciation. Interiority stays concrete (“palm of soil,” “constellations of stubborn care”) and avoids label-speak. The final stance—leaving the gate unlatched—earns its quiet trust because the maze has already tested him. One hairline slip: the line “fortune is a mirror, and gardeners are light” drifts toward aphorism, slightly blunting the embodied cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the dials steady, the gate stays unlatched, and the cost—public honesty about the marble lie—is paid on-page. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout; the maze’s overnight corridor and the vine’s final lean reconfigure meaning without causal sleight. Orientation is anchored by line 3 (“dials I set by the gate”) and never wavers. No teleporting props or retroactive patches; the cracked marble reappears exactly where the gardener once planted it.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The garden’s tactile economy—polished latch, cracked marbles, vine tasting soil—constrains every choice and charges the final image of glowing marbles beside the shadow. Weather, gravel, and hedge-hiss are filtered through the gardener’s pragmatic attention, never tourist catalog. Spatial choreography is immaculate: the new corridor steers visitors to the fountain, the hedges part, the vine leans. One minor shimmer: “silver breath” of still water is almost too lyric, but it is instantly grounded by the cracked marble at its base.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—garden’s recognition—tightens when the maze objects to the false marble miracle; escalation is the hedge-hiss and shivering dials. The protagonist’s agency is the kneeling confession, which forecloses the option to keep the deception. Cost is visceral: public admission, loss of “withered vine dresser” mystique, and the vine’s half-wither verdict. No coincidence rescues; luck only measures, never solves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme—mercy must be remembered as faithfully as luck—emerges from the fountain lie and its mending, never sermonized. The cracked marbles reweight from trophies to witnesses, a silent jury that reframes earlier victories as indebtedness. Final image of unlatched gate answers the thematic question: trust, not proof, ends the score-keeping. No tidy moral; the garden’s silence after applause lets ambiguity breathe.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>First-person diction is vine-dry, rhythmic, and specific: “string and grit,” “timid beetles under glass.” Syntax lengthens and contracts with emotional temperature—short beats under duress, lyrical coils in reflection—without losing clarity. No head-hop; perceptual signature stays rooted in the gardener’s calloused attention. The one aphoristic line noted in Q1 is the single hairline drift from perfect control.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry triple duty—image, motion, metaphor—without overcrowding: “I trimmed the oldest vine tenderly, accepting the leaves that chose ground.” No paraphrase loops, no mixed metaphors; each figure extends the garden’s logic. Rhythm modulates like breathing; no template cadence. Proof-level clean: pronouns, tense, punctuation immaculate.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The measurable-luck premise is fresh, yet the story’s risk is quieter: a fable that refuses moral absolutes. The cracked marbles as “planets” around the fountain transform souvenir into solar system, an image that could only belong to this gardener. Structural gamble—lyric accumulative beats instead of causal reversals—pays off in the final hush. The synthesis of superstition, penance, and horticulture feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
