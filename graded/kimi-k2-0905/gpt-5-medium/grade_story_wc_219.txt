<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The narrator’s “luminous skeptic” identity is dramatized in mini-choices—declining ritual, offering amber, the raised-eyebrow dissent—each tightening the stance. Interiority stays embodied (breath slows, skin oils react) rather than abstract. The final renunciation of nostalgia is earned by the prior lab-bench distrust of ceremony, giving closure visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the window widens intention, declaring “home is a rate constant,” a legible before/after at felt cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds via rainwater, dust, scent, until the final image reweights the premise. No orientation debt; who/where/when anchored by line 3 and mosaic shards taught by 25% mark.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The rain-washed tower functions as micro-setting that constrains every move: wet dust sticks, rotunda pools reflect, ivy canopy exhales chalk. Fly amber recurs as handled object whose shifting light charges the final pane. Vivid sensory triage (smell of orange-rust, metronome pulse) is filtered through POV’s chemistry bias, never tourist catalog.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can return be synthesized without nostalgia?—tightens once: the basin reaction forecloses ritual as answer, forcing stance crystallization. Pressure grows accumulatively: each droplet, breath, iron flake narrows options until the window re-maps origins. Cost is legible in the softened metronome pulse and the erased footprints—paths foreclosed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges sideways: homecoming as chemical equilibrium, not geography. Recurrent images—amber sun, orange peel, bronze quiet—shift meaning without overt statement. Final image reweights “chemistry of homecoming” as rate constant, offering non-literal answer that invites counter-readings. No moralizing; resonance built from particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>First-person lyric voice owns a perceptual signature attuned to chemistry and latency: verbs like “conduct,” “react,” “reform” mirror lab mind. Rhythm modulates—short inhalations under ivy, lengthened cadences in rotunda—without drumbeat monotony. Purposeful compression (“more lab bench than chapel pew”) teaches pattern; no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loop artifacts; high density—one sentence salts rain, rotunda, and ritual critique. Metaphors stay coherent: “bronze quiet” marries metal’s stillness with alloyed resonance; no mixed vehicles. Sentence variety accelerates up spiral, breathes at window. Final line erases footprints, a crisp image that recharges prior dust motif.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>“Artificial pilgrimage” inverted into lab-bench sacrament feels fresh; amber as fossil alphabet is precise, not quirky. Risky second-person address to aliens avoided; instead, voice synthesizes skepticism with lyric awe. Conceptual payoff—home as rate constant—grows inevitable yet non-obvious from chemistry motif seeded early.</comment>
