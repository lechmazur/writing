<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The courtesan’s interior contradiction—chaste yet complicit in subversion—is dramatized through bodily micro-choices (knot-tying, bare-foot descent) that carry palpable cost. Motive remains consistent: “defy the lullaby of conformity,” intensifying as patrol footsteps approach. The final renunciation—leaving the bowl on the prism—earns its charge because every prior thread-craft foreshadows this surrender of personal safety. Only the childhood-tutor backstory is summary, not embodied, keeping it shy of 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the city inhales differently—an undeniable social cost—crystallized when guards’ pikes “sigh into frost.” Causal lattice holds: because she untangles threads → echoes rise → patrol freezes → she escapes → populace awakens. The “between sigh and smile” window is taught early, re-weighted at the end, satisfying Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are clear by line 30; no teleporting props or timeline breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prism sanctuary functions as both environment and tool: its glass throats literally refract starlight into the rainbow threads she manipulates, constraining her path—she must kneel, handle cold surfaces, work within its geometry. Snow courtyard supplies tactile pressure: frost translated “without complaint” becomes the surface she writes runes upon and later lifts to descend. Spatial choreography is flawless: bowl → grate → looms → return, each object’s state tracked. Final image reweights setting: courtyard now “trembled like a plucked string,” making the place itself the resonator of change.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—liberate suppressed voices—tightens when patrol arrival compresses the “window between sigh and smile” to a pupil-shrink. Protagonist’s agency drives every escalation: she chooses to tug threads, quicken knot-work, descend grate, retune looms; coincidence never rescues. Cost is visible on-page: frost-burned knees, audible guards, forfeited anonymity. The reversal—guards lowering pikes—results directly from her sonic harvest, meeting the lens test.</question>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of voice-as-rebellion emerges from concrete mechanics: threads of forgotten vows become literal cords that reweave palace speech into counter-chant. No moralizing line tells us “silence = oppression”; instead the image of snow accepting runes without complaint dramatizes complicity, then reprises as the city “learns slowly how to refuse and still sing.” Final image re-weights the premise: refusal does not destroy harmony but retunes it. Subtext in bodily poetic restraint—touch withheld to unlock voices—avows sensual power channeled into political act.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person lyric distances meshes with courtesan’s disciplined detachment; diction (“toe-writing a measured rune,” “snowlight”) stays within her refined perceptual lexicon. Compression (“She had come between sigh and smile”) teaches the reader to read elided causality early; pattern pays off when identical phrase seals the closure. No head-hopping; single focalizer throughout. Rhythm modulates: long breathy clauses for hush, staccato “She quickened yet kept alarming serenity” under rising threat—syntax enacts pulse.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Figurative density is high but patterned: “lanterns bled tiny suns,” “breath rose like pale birds” taught in paragraph 1 and echoed in prism’s “hushed rainbows,” so it reads as accumulative texture, not purple. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or causation. One mixed-metor risk—“snow sifted like slow fire”—but physical logic holds (cold vs burn of friction). No filter-verb clusters; verbs are strong (“coaxed,” “clicked,” “rang”). Line propulsion carries through final clause “learning slowly how to refuse and still sing,” which acts as both cadence and concept.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fusion of chastity-as-discipline with subversive acoustics feels unprecedented: courtesan × loom × starlight prism yields a fresh metaphor engine. Accumulative pattern—threads, snow, breath, echoes—grows organically from character goal rather than checklist. Risk in lyrical non-linear causality is justified because closure reprises and reweights every motif. Conceptual integrity: commits fully to rule that emptied bodies can amplify others’ voices, never retreats to safer literalism.</comment>
