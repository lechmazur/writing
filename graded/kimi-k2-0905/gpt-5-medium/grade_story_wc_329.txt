<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The violinist’s longing is embodied in tactile micro-choices—bow pressure, locust mute, heart-tapped code—so motive stays concrete. Interior contradiction is palpable: desire to awaken beauty vs terror of stone judgment. The final stance crystallizes when he stops bowing and lets heartbeat finish the sentence; cost is the risk of remaining in the open. Flaw: no secondary character to test status shift; solo POV keeps it just below 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: orchard breathes, statues sway, city machines stutter—beauty reclaimed without escape. Causal chain holds: soft tone → sap response → copper leaves fall → stone joints unclench. One transition (bridge to orchard floor) is legible; orientation anchored in first 50 words. Cost is felt in the hush that follows silence; no explicit price is paid by body, so barely misses 9.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fog-licked iron, copper halos, sap-scent, and thrumming bridge cables are filtered through violinist’s risk-calibrated attention; every detail either threatens or invites sound. Micro-setting of the instrument bridge and locust mute constrains the final tactical choice. Spatial choreography is flawless: statues step, child climbs, leaves fall to exact spots. Environment recharges final image—orchard shading citizens—without overt symbol. Missing half-click for 9: no weather or tool detail that directly imperils closure beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reawaken beauty under surveillance—tightens when each softer note risks statue seizure. Escalation is Accumulative/Textural: density of responses (sap-scent-sway-fall) reweights stakes rather than narrows options. One decisive intensification: copper halos drop, statues unlock. Cost is conceptual—beauty reclaimed in public view—but not physically suffered; hence stays below 8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through pattern: music as covert pulse, beauty as rebellion that teaches stone to dream. Subtext lives in gesture—statue palm opening, moss bubbling—never moralized. Final image reweights premise: tarnished wonder stands in daylight, no permission asked. Half-dock for near-echo of “beauty does not beg” line that flirts with thesis-statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lyric first-person maintains consistent perceptual signature: sound as animal, scent as coin, fog as tongue. Syntax flexes with pressure—compressed fragments under statue gaze, longer breath after leaves fall. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk zero. Filter verbs (“I feel”) are minimal and voice-motivated. Could hit 9 with one sharper idiosyncratic phrase in final heartbeat cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm mirrors musical phrasing—crescendo of stacked images, then release into short declaratives. No paraphrase loops; each metaphor extends prior vehicle (copper leaves → halos → coins → birds) without contradiction. Information density high: one sentence often carries sensory, emotional, and causal load. Minor over-colonization in two lines (“like...like...”) keeps it from 9.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses mythic orchard, living statuary, and cardiac cryptography into a fresh synthesis. Risky lyric accumulation paid off: copper halos fall as quiet birds—image impossible without prior pattern. Transformation test passed: story fails if violinist trades instrument. Deduction for faint echo of Gaimanesque living statues, but local detail (moss bubbling like skin remembering morning) overrides familiarity.</comment>
