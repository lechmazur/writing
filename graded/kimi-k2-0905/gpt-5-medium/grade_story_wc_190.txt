<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The gondola operator’s vocation—teaching silence to comfort—gives every observation a micro-choice (“I dim the cabin light,” “let the gondola slow”) that visibly costs time and altitude. His interior contradiction—measuring hush he can never fully own—ripples through storm-glass watching and cable-drift decisions. The mathematician’s presence supplies external pressure, but the operative’s final renunciation of speed is driven by that night with the singer memory, making the stance earned. Flaw: the climactic “equation is not about proof or grief anymore” is told, not dramatized in his body, blunting the cost brightness a hair.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the car slows to cradle-drift, breathing syncs with city rustle, silence is re-weighted from cliff to blanket. The operating lens is Accumulative/Textural—each hush-thread (train echo, felt-wrapped scales, velvet pylons) layers density until the final breath-cadence reconfigures meaning. Anchor (who/where/when) is clear within 40 words; no orientation debt. The singer-memory cue at mid-story is the concrete trigger that authorizes the reflective block, satisfying BRR.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The drifting prism terrace functions as both macro-setting and micro-tool: its cables, altitude, and facet-lights literally constrain speed choices and throw the final geometry across the mathematician’s face. Selective sensory hierarchy—visual facets, iron-night smell, hush as almost-tactile blanket—mirrors operative’s professional filter. Recurring storm-glass, felt-wrapped strings, and velvet-lined pylons evolve state-to-state, charging the final “clear as winter morning” image. Spatial choreography across towers and windowed spire is immaculate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake: can silence be shaped into comfort? Pressure tightens texturally—each engineered hush (baffles, velvet, route-timing) raises the implicit cost of failure. No causal reversal, but the mathematician’s revealed grief-equation deepens emotional stakes, forcing operative to test his craft on a living subject. Final cost is conceptual: he forfeits schedule speed, accepting eternal transit as cradle—price legible in slowed drift and cleared vial.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges as the alchemy of engineered absence: silence not as void but as inhabitable room. Subtext crackles in unspoken sync of breathing and city rustle “threaded to her breathing,” a non-verbal answer to “how to be held by grief.” No moralizing; final image reframes entire premise—quiet becomes kinetic cradle. The singer suicide memory provides moral shadow without overt thesis, letting resonance linger.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>First-person voice owns a hush-engineer’s perceptual signature: noticing noisefall ribbons, barometer taps, facet-geometry as data. Syntax lengthens during drift, compresses at train-echo beats, mirroring sonic tide. Diction stays within operative’s technical-poetic lexicon—“sounding void,” “vaulting hush”—no register drift. Dialogue is minimal but distinct: mathematician’s fluid logic vs. operative’s catalytic brevity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm alternates between long, gliding cadences (matching gondola drift) and short, crystalline fragments at echo-points—read-aloud ear test passes. Information density high: single sentences layer meteorology, emotion, and metaphor (“storm glass vials freckles with slow, pearly crystals”). No paraphrase loops or scaffold; metaphors are internally coherent. Opening and final lines act as sonic brackets, recharging “quiet that follows a train whistle’s echo.”</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>Premise—noise-level engineer of aerial gondolas—is fresh and inherently stakes-creating. Conceptual risk: turning acoustic engineering into spiritual midwifery, yet every sensory detail is specific to this world. The final reconfiguration (silence as cradle) feels inevitable yet non-obvious. No familiar template echoes; transformation test fails if ported elsewhere because silence-craft is welded to altitude, cables, and storm-glass tech.</comment>
