<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lark’s interiority is vivid—her father’s maps, the fob’s tick, her tactile thwart of the thief—but the “sound of trust breaking” remains an abstract want; we never feel her need collide with a concrete personal stake (she neither gains nor loses a relationship). The cutpurse hook, the toppled limes, and her final quiet are all embodied micro-choices, yet the emotional cost is displaced onto the market rather than internalized as irrevocable loss or self-redefinition. Still, her perceptual signature (river winds, tide tables, recorder gain) keeps her singular and the early/late fob reprise supplies a charged poise that almost earns stasis.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The truce-of-hush rule is taught by line 3, anchors causality under a situational lens, and pays off when the broken trust is silently recorded rather than spoken. Orientation is locked within the first 100 words; the mosaic of near-transactions builds pressure by narrowing options until Kettle’s reach and the smuggler’s recoil crystallize the fracture. Closure lands as a Charged Poise: the recorder holds the inaudible inhale, the hush still binds feet until sunrise, and Lark’s departure reweights the fob and the pier’s breath. Cost is visible—the smuggler’s sleeve-snatch and the split lime—but the protagonist’s personal consequence remains oblique, keeping the score just shy of 9+.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The rotting pier breathes and creaks, lantern nerves braid the dark, and salt-rot lullabies under bare feet—every sense is filtered through Lark’s smuggler-trained priorities. The fob, limes, and recorder function as micro-setting: the tick meters her moves, the spilled lime moon splits the trust, the spinning crate re-choreographs bodies. Spatial logic is flawless; no impossible positions or drifting rooms. The environment constrains tactics—silence is currency, proximity is danger—and the final gray seam above the river recharges the market’s breathing planks. One hairline slip: “comforting unease” is repeated twice, a minor register echo that does not dull the closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—capture the sound of trust breaking—is signaled early and tightened through Lark’s series of false-start bargains that progressively corner Kettle and the smuggler. Each near-purchase narrows their silent allegiance until the lime spill forces the micro-reach that snaps it; the brittle inhale is the audible price. Agency is entirely Lark’s: her choices, not luck, lever the break. The cost is legible on the page (the smuggler’s stung recoil, Kettle’s retreat), but the price is paid by others; Lark’s own tactical options are not foreclosed, only her collection goal fulfilled, keeping the escalation just below the 8.5 gate for visible protagonist cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the paradox of recording silence: trust breaks loudest when no word is spoken. The hush truce, the fob’s tick, and the recorder’s whirl form a triptych of sound/silence that reweights the final image—Lark carries the brittle inhale home like bottled quiet. No moral is stated; the question lingers whether evidence of betrayal is itself a betrayal. Subtext lives in gesture: Kettle’s fingers rehearse theft, the smuggler’s sleeve is reached for, the cutpurse’s hook is thwarted by a chain of time. The thematic aftereffect is concrete—readers listen for their own inaudible splits—yet the abstraction “human weather” drifts close to thematic echo, nudging the score down a hair.</comment>

<comment>The voice is sinewy, tidal, and compressed: “lantern light braided with nerves,” “limes bright as moons,” “listening shawl.” Syntax coils and releases in step with the hush—long sentences inhale, fragments exhale. Lark’s perceptual signature is unmistakable: tide charts, stains, river-wind straightened spine. No head-hopping; the few spoken lines carry subtext by nod and hiss. Patterned elision (“voices threaded thin, coins spoke, knives whispered”) is taught early and paid off when the recorder finally speaks the silence. Under peak pressure the diction tightens without register drift: “the tick tripping his pulse.” A hairline slip repeats “comforting unease,” but the rhythmic control and distinct texture clear the 9+ bar.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Sentences layer scent, sound, and motion in one stroke: “salt and rot and lullaby” under bare feet. Metaphors are precise—lantern nerves, listening shawl, moons of limes—and never mixed. Information density is high; every clause advances stakes or texture. No scaffold loops, no synonym churn, no filter-verb stacks. The final third keeps propulsion: “gray seam opened above the river” recharges earlier planks. A single near-repeat of “comforting unease” is the only micro-loop, too minor to touch closure. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with the pier, accelerating through thwart and spill, then resting into the hush’s quiet return.</comment>

<comment>The conceit—recording the sound of trust breaking in a silent pirate market—feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. The hush truce reverses the usual noisy underworld; the fob’s tick becomes a metronome of conscience. Lark’s goal is inverse: she wants the fracture, not the loot. Details are particular to this river pier, not generic noir. The lime spill as acoustic trigger is a lovely micro-invention. Risk is taken and paid off by making silence the protagonist’s trophy. While pirate markets and moonshine heirs are familiar tropes, the sonic inversion and the daughter’s archival obsession transform them into something memorable, just shy of the 9+ gate due to the slight thematic echo noted above.</comment>
