<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The protagonist’s “candidly cryptic” voice is vivid and consistent; the gourd seed and greenhouse work as embodied memory and tool. Interiority is specific—“truth looks better in chitin and pollen”—and choices (mapping gardens, releasing lacewings) align with motive. The final laugh-over-beans moment shows earned micro-choice that cancels the levy, paying visible social cost. Minor drift: “charming rogue scholar” is asserted more than demonstrated in action.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the auditors’ involuntary performance of ENTER nullifies the tax. Lens is Hybrid—accumulative garden pattern + situational standoff—held cleanly to final image. Causality intact: garden spell → drone mis-read → legal loophole triggered. Cost is legible in the laugh they cannot invoice.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The greenhouse functions as micro-setting: glass walls, hornworm surge, and lacewing punctuation directly shape tactic and climax. Sensory hierarchy obeys POV—smell of pollen, slap of moths—guiding the “sideways breath” evasion. Spatial choreography tracks clean from trellis to threshold ribbon. No environmental constraint charges the final auditor foot-step more than the beans themselves, capping the 9-band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—freedom of thought—signals early; pressure tightens when towers sprout “new teeth.” One meaningful turn: the discovered clause that artistic rehearsal in public voids tax. Protagonist agency drives the garden-concert plan; cost is the laugh they extract from gray collectors, a social forfeiture of authority. Escalation stays coherent; coincidence (hornworm outbreak) complicates rather than resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges without sermon: language = pollen, resistance = cultivation, audit = digestion. Subtext in garden syntax—calendula for consonants—renders thought tangible yet unpriceable. Final image of officers stepping over bean-enter while laughing reweights power without dictating moral. Avoids tidy thesis; ambiguity lingers in drone-misfiled “weather.”</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>First-person voice owns a perceptual signature: “breathe sideways,” “moths teetered like monks.” Rhythmic control—comma splice breathlessness under raid—mirrors threat. Diction stays within eccentric scholar range; no head-hop. Dialogue minimal but distinct: Kline’s moth-soft aphorism vs narrator’s elliptic invites. Compression like “noise can grow” is taught early and paid off in seed-rattle rain.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sentence variety propels; high-density lines (“temperature rose until sweat became a second language”) do triple work. No loops or scaffold; metaphor chain (bees/antennae, moths/microphones) stays coherent. One mixed metaphor blip: “thinking storm” is passable. Final line “garden keeps the spark” lands crisp with cadence shift. No artifact touches closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Premise—taxable thoughts resisted via horticulture encryption—is fresh, pursued to logical whimsy. Transformation test fails if gardens swapped out; plant-syntax is inseparable from plot. Specific detail (ladder-cracked seed, lacewing punctuation) prevents abstraction. Risk in lyric eco-revolt heightens coherence; no gimmickry, full conceptual commitment.</comment>
