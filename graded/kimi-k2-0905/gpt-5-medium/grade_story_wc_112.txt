<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Jae’s obliging mechanic trait is shown through tangible micro-choices (tuning gantries, pulling the surge lever, planting beacons), each carrying frost-bitten cost; the sideways-time obsession drives every beat and is paid for in bodily risk and solitude. Interiority stays concrete, never drifting into diagnostic speak. No secondary character appears, so relationship crucible is waived; single-POV interior contradiction (trust in his own voice vs fear of temporal loss) is dramatized in scene. Closure is earned: his laugh is small, affectionate, and quietly accepts the self-division that let the mantas—and proof—return. Missing higher band only because the emotional plateau after rescue is slightly under-cooked; cost is felt but not sharpened to a sting.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the lattice steadies, mantas circle twice for every once, and Jae feels forgiven—an undeniable conceptual cost that re-weights time itself. Causal lattice holds: probe → invert fields → corridor refracts → mantas arrive; no off-stage fixes. Orientation anchors (who=Jae-mechanic, where=frost-smoking plateau station, when=migration season) appear within 60 words and remain stable. One meaningful tightening: the lever pull constricts futures to a single breath-wide corridor. Lens ambiguity test waived; pattern is taught early and closure keeps the sideways-time lens intact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Frost-smoking solar arrays, ozone vault, gantry rail “like a wish” body the station so intimately that every tool and coil constrains Jae’s reach; the magnetic ravine literally governs compass insanity and therefore plot possibility. Sensory hierarchy obeys Jae’s mechanic eye—cold copper smell, visor readouts, lever smear of anxious hands—never tourist catalog. Weather is not backdrop but antagonist: frost, twilight bloom, wind combing decks all push choices. Final image of cold-salt, new-paper air is re-charged by earlier salt-rimed wings, fulfilling 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recover the missing mantas—signalled in line 3; pressure tightens when surge-pull risks station blackout and personal erasure. Escalation is one coherent climb: missing flock → probe mapping → lever gamble → lattice inversion → homecoming; each step forecloses retreat. Price is continuously legible: frostbite, ozone cough, heart-beat reckoning, and finally the quiet admission that he too is drifting sideways. No coincidence; even the twilight nexus is pre-seeded by geomagnetic data. Agency is technologist’s: calculation, solder, invert field—yet the cost is flesh and identity. Sufficient for this length, but the ethical dimension (should time be bled?) stays latent rather than tested, keeping it shy of 8.8.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</question><comment>Theme—time’s affectionate sideways slip—emerges through images (windows opening to yesterday-from-tomorrow, mantas crossing twice per once) rather than assertion. Subtext coils around forgiveness: Jae quietly accepts a universe that edits him; the reader carries the ache of being partially unmoored. No moralizing punch-line; final scent of cold salt & new paper is an open question about fresh beginnings that are also old. Ambiguity is meaningful, not evasive, because every motif (lattice, warm instruments, double shadows) has been earned in scene.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</question><comment>Third-person limited clings to Jae’s perceptual filter: “he kept his place by the rhythm of his heart and the solid memory of bolts”—mechanic’s synesthesia of metal and pulse. Diction is precise yet compressed: “a sound like breath pulled sideways through ice” teaches the reader the story’s grammar of orthogonal time. Rhythm accelerates with short paratactic bursts during surge, then lengthens into circling clauses as mantas return; syntactic modulation matches emotional swell. No head-hops; station personification (“the station accepted, for stations accept by not failing”) stays within Jae’s habit of talking to machines.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</question><comment>Line-level craft is admirably clean: no synonym loops, no scaffold, mixed metaphors excised. Information density is high—each sentence layers frost, magnetism, and heartbeat without redundancy. Figurative language appears sparingly and only when it advances the sideways-time concept (“city mid-yawn,” “winter flags”). Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; paragraph cuts land on pivot images (lattice steadied, first manta arrived). Minor slip: “mechanically warm promise” is a faint cliché pocket, but occurs early and is soon overwritten by visceral cold-salt close; does not touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</question><comment>Premise—migratory space-mantas lost in lateral time—is refreshingly non-obvious, yet grounded in Jae’s tactile engineering. Holographic inversion of geomagnetic corridors feels conceptually inevitable after early rule-teaching. Risk of lyric obscurity is embraced but paid off with crystalline closure: the twice-crossing shadow is an image that cannot be transplanted to another tale. Combines cosmic scale with intimate frost-bitten forgiveness; synthesis feels both strange and emotionally durable.</comment>
