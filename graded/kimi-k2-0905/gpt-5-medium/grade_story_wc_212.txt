<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>A lone, embodied consciousness whose quiet, tactile devotion to seeds and spirals feels genetically consistent; the “furiously tranquil” hands are shown in steady action rather than told. Interiority stays concrete (“cupping the newborn vortex like a candle flame”) and the final stance—renunciation of ownership—carries visible cost in the planting of the cap. Missing only a sharper contradiction under pressure to reach 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the oak cap planted in loam reweights the entire inheritance rule-set—keepership is now stewardship that must be passed on. Causality is lyric-accumulative rather than plot-turn causal, but the pattern is taught early (“the principle of vortex inheritance”) and paid off in the final image with undeniable conceptual cost. No orientation or lens ambiguity; the single shard holds.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The icebound atrium is not backdrop but pressure source: frost veining the panes, starlight feeding leaves, the cold that must be sung against. Micro-setting (acorn cap, marble bench, breath-fogged glass) repeatedly constrains gesture and steadies the vortex. Meets 9+ gate: the cap literally charges the final image as wheel-hub and hearth.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“keep the spiral without owning it”—tightens once when Return asks for a name and again when the cap is planted, foreclosing hoarding. Escalation is lyrical/density-driven rather than causal reversals, but the single deepening (cup → wheel-hub → planted seed) visibly narrows options under the Accumulative lens. Cost is legible: the city tips toward spring only if the keeper releases the whirl.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges as stewardship-through-release; no moral is stated—the final image of the cap in soil re-prices “borrowed time” without sermon. The returning motifs (spiral, frost, breath, cap) accrue rather than decorate, culminating in the oak wheel-hub that fuses memory and future. Complexity is embraced: the keeper gains power by surrendering it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>First-person lyric voice sustains a precise perceptual signature: breath mapped as frost-laced bells, starlight as gears, pollen as invisible draft. Syntax waxes and breathes with the vortex—long anaphoric clauses when the spiral unfurls, clipped fragments at planting. No head-hop; elision (“time is a lidded well”) is pattern-taught and paid off. Risk distinction warranted: the lyric compression heightens rather than obscures clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High-density figurative language is disciplined—each metaphor serves either pressure or transition (e.g., “starlight feeds the leaves” mirrors the vortex feeding the keeper). Rhythm modulates naturally; no template cadence or synonym loops. Minor cohesion stretch in “breath hangs like frost-laced bells” but image is legible and propulsive. Closure line is clean, no artifact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The seed-vortex as living inheritance is a fresh synthesis of climate-fiction and mythic memory; the oak cap becomes a literal wheel-hub for time, a turn unseen elsewhere. Risk is high—lyric spiral poem in prose—but coherence never frays. Specificity (amaranth skulls, citrus shivers) anchors the concept, preventing abstraction. The final re-pricing feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
