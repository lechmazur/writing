<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The archivist’s interiority is vivid and idiosyncratic—“I catalog history to keep it from drowning again”—and every micro-choice (kneeling to the lagoon, feeding the diary) is driven by a legible, escalating need to surface erased truth. The grandmother’s circular hand-off of the letters and diary crystallizes inherited obligation as a lived cost, not an abstract duty. Flaws (obsession, willingness to be scalded) actively complicate the final stance, and the renunciation of relief for tension is earned and painful. Voice remains singular, never sliding into civic rhetoric; even the clerk’s apology is filtered through the narrator’s perceptual bias.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the surf “reads aloud” the names, converting private archival labor into public, irreversible speech—cost is the narrator’s half-trapped state and the city’s un-mute future. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each beach-arranged shard thickens the pattern until the lagoon mirrors it, reweighting the stake from private grief to communal accountability. Causality is circular yet legible—grandmother hands over what the narrator already found—time as “circular affidavit” pays off rather than explains. No orientation debt; who/where/when anchor within 30 words and the zeppelin library is immediately tethered to action.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The obsidian lagoon is not backdrop but active antagonist—it drinks starlight, mirrors mosaics, and finally clears to “plain black glass,” a conceptual re-pricing of erased history. Beach debris becomes a stenograph of dissent; bottle caps and eelgrass constrain where each name-shell can be placed, turning trash into evidence. Spatial choreography is flawless: driftwood lines map march routes while the narrator’s knees press into wet sand, body joining the topography. Zeppelin library is sketched in two strokes yet feels tactically present—its humming hive supplies the only place the diary can bloom.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—public truth versus historical erasure—tightens when the diary refuses ink until the shoreline testimony is built, forcing the narrator to literalize archives in garbage. Escalation is Accumulative: each new debris-pattern increases density until the lagoon’s mirror traps the narrator in retrocognitive fire; cost is the blistering reverie that leaves them “half-trapped.” The clerk’s surrender of stenograph punches is a visible price—her bones “like shutters” signal lifelong complicity now broken. Final option reconfiguration: the city must speak the names aloud; silence is foreclosed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the iterative act of naming: what was meant for no one becomes for everyone. Subtext resides in the silence of the lagoon and the punched-out syllables—absence made legible. No moralizing; the final image of the zeppelin tilting inland is an open question about who will listen, not a sermon. The kelp ribbon pinned to courage is the only symbolic object, earned because it was drafted in-scene with the grandmother and later kept, charging the ending with unfinished duty.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is dense, oceanic, yet precision-controlled: “salt-stiff crate,” “keeper of unsurrendered echoes,” “circular affidavit”—diction stays within an archivist’s poetic reach. Rhythm surges and retreats like surf; long sentences pile clauses during reverie, then fracture into monosyllables at the waterline. No head-hopping; even the clerk’s apology is rendered through the narrator’s ear for shaken metal. Experimental compression (“time is a circular affidavit”) is taught early and paid off at closure when the same hand-off recurs.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentence-level propulsion is high: “I arrange a new pattern with shells, repeating their absences” does triple work—action, emotion, concept—in twelve words. Occasional stacked metaphors (“eye sunk in cooled lava,” “gavel lifted above sea”) risk purple but are saved by their functional role in escalating the lagoon’s agency. Zero paraphrase loops; each image of black glass recurs with altered stakes. Final line “each breath a restored margin” is a concise, rhythmic closure that reweights earlier margins erased from council minutes.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade>
<comment>Fusing civil-rights archive, zeppelin library, and retrocognitive noir is non-obvious yet inevitable: all orbit the ethics of record. The conceit that erased minutes can be re-punched with beach trash literalizes recovery without allegory. Circular time seeded in line one pays off when the grandmother hands over future evidence, making structure feel discovered, not imposed. Risk—trapping narrator and reader in a “searing reverie”—heightens stakes without gimmickry; the city learning to read itself is a final reconfiguration that could not exist without every prior weird particular.</comment>
