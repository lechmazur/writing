<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The blank-faced performer’s refusal to smile while still monetizing neutrality is a lived contradiction; every beat of “narrating the sink” dramatizes this. Interiority is precise: “blank face is my costume and my insurance” reveals hierarchy of values under surveillance. Micro-choice of letting child hold brittle stem crystallizes endurance with visible cost. No stock therapy-speak; even “moral ambiguity” is immediately ironized by manager’s token count.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the final refusal to emit mandated joy, held in the remade hush, forecloses compliance forever. Causal chain intact: each narrated chore increases surveillance tension → whittling crafts unsanctioned silence → child’s gesture externalizes the stance → camera blank face = irreversible cost. Lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of performed zest vs. private hush deepens until final image reweights stakes. Cost is legible: “I felt the familiar vacancy where victory should sit” + turbines restart while inside “something finally did not.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Farmhouse/turbine dyad constrains every choice: shadows dictate when to film, whine sets acoustic limit for hush. Dried bouquet micro-setting recharges closure when child thumbed petal teaches brittleness as tactic. Spatial choreography clean: inspectors enter from barley, children watch from ridge, shavings fall to floorboards. Selective detail—peach-wood pith “bright as a wound”—anchors tool without catalog.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—maintain unsanctioned grief inside mandatory happiness—tightens when inspector demands live laundry saga; narrator must perform or lose tokens. One meaningful deepening: turning off mics during dish lesson narrows options to gesture-only, visible price is potential demerit. Escalation driven by narrator’s own micro-choices (whittle, teach pause, blank face) under accumulative lens. Cost legible: bouquet petals fall like “clipped syllables,” signaling irreversible fragmentation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from performance vs. hush polarity; never sermonizes. Final image—“something finally did not”—reweights prior motif of circular turbine arms as release, not control. Subtext in child’s question about dizzy dead: innocence exposes regime’s absurdity without authorial nudge. Ambiguity preserved: tokens still counted, victory seat still vacant, yet refusal is real.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is crystalline dystopian lyric: “cheer has measurable wattage and fines.” Syntax mirrors surveillance rhythm—short imperative bursts for camera, longer elliptical curls for whittling. Perceptual signature: narrator notices light angles that read as joy, smells “paper breath” of petals. No head-hopping; child’s voice stays exterior, filtered through narrator’s pedagogic caution.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops; each sentence advances image or stakes. Mixed metaphors deliberate and paid off: turbines as clock hands/bones/medic arms create coherent mechanical anatomy. High density: “wet crescent of responsibility, slipping toward redemption” packs dish, guilt, and salvation into one image. Rhythm accelerates during inspector scene, breathes during hush beats. Peach-wood pith “bright as a wound” is precise, not purple.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresco of mandated cheer is freshly inverted through narrator’s monetized neutrality. Conceptual twist: grief cultivated as lightness—not happiness—becomes subversive praxis. Risk of didactic dystopia evaded by grounded whittling micro-plot. Final refusal feels inevitable yet un-template: no rebellion arc, just stasis that costs.</comment>
