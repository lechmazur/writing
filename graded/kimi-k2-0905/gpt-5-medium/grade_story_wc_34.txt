<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The balladeer’s interior contradiction—thirst to sing vs. acceptance of quiet—is embodied in micro-choices (tightening bolts, tracing chalk). Flaw: the renunciation at closure is more asserted than paid for; we feel uplift but no forfeiture. Still, the steady “driftingly alert” stance under pressure keeps motive legible and specific.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/lyric lens holds: bolts → chalk → valve blinks form a taught pattern that tightens into a Resonant Reconfiguration (city breathes). Orientation is taught by line 6 (“misty courtyard above clouds”), so no penalty. Cost is conceptual—singer becomes hinge, song becomes utility—but the final image crystallizes that reconfiguration with legible pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Setting is filter-sharp: altitude chill, steam-valve politics, bakery stove as failing heart. Micro-setting (bolt plate on antenna) constrains the final tuning act. Weather is not backdrop but pulse—each sense returns to charge the “body = city” map. No credibility slips; geography stays consistent across ladders, vents, parapets.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: make the ghost’s need audible so the courtyard can breathe. Escalation is density-driven: each graffiti reply → brighter valve blink → tighter tuning until the city’s organs open. Agency stays with singer/ghost dyad; no coincidence. Cost is visible—singer cedes louder song for utilitarian encoding—but arrival feels cooperative rather than a single sharp trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from image chain: communication can be infrastructure, cities are bodies, songs are valves. Subtext sits in silence between lightning/thunder—need heard only when noise pauses. No moral spoken; final “hinge” image reweights earlier songs as tools, not art. Slight abstraction keeps it from full 9.0 but complexity lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Lyrical first-person owns a percussive, tinker-poet idiolect: “notes walking softer than my feet,” “hymn’s refrain.” Syntax mirrors tuning—short bolts, long breaths. No head-hop; POV modesty intact (doesn’t claim to know ghost, only decodes). Register stays within balladeer’s plausible lexicon even at peak compression. Distinctive and consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>High information density: each sentence carries sensory + metaphor + causal nudge (“I bolted the flower press bolt plate onto an old antenna post, a simple act of listening”). Rhythm modulates naturally; no template cadence. Figurative layering is taught early and paid off, so even density at closure reads as culmination, not clutter. One near-mixed metaphor (“bowl of breath”) but clarity intact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses mountain-flower preservation with open-source urban hacking—fresh synthesis. Ghost-in-code trope is re-embodied through chalk/valve syntax rather than clichéd data stream. Risk in lyric accumulative structure heightens meaning without obscuring closure. Slight familial backstory plate feels inherited rather than engineered. Overall, particularity outweighs familiarity.</comment>
