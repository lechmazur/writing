<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ilias’s interiority—“realistically imaginative enough to doubt, bright enough to keep going”—is dramatized in every beat: his refusal of the quick flood, the micro-choice to angle the box, the embodied cost of waiting while “stars practiced sidereal patience.” Contradictory impulses (doubt vs. faith in breadcrumbs) coexist in-scene, driving the final Earned Stasis when he vows to keep the box until rain, foreclosing rest. The water-woman and mason serve as pressure-points, not décor, forcing him to articulate stance with visible cost. No label-speak; every thought is filtered through luminous skepticism and mapped hand.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the city’s “defiant hush” becomes promise, reweighting the entire breadcrumb pattern with conceptual cost—he will stay, box in hand, rain or not. The mosaic shards-as-keys rule is taught early, paid off when the bronze eyelid opens and memories “thread through air as evaporating silver.” Lens is Accumulative/Textural: each breadcrumb intensifies texture until the final cadence shift. No orientation drift; who/where/when anchored by line 3, pattern legible throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The stained glass box functions as micro-setting: its angled light literally creates the stepping-stone ovals, constraining every downstream move. “City of forgotten fountains” is never museum-tour; tiles of fish and eyes, lime-streaked statues, vapor on tile all feed POV-selective attention and thematic drought. Spatial choreography is flawless—tracks from plaza to arcade to eye-tiled fountain without drift. Environment, tool, and recurring object jointly charge the final image, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“liberate trapped memories before the last story cracks”—tightens when the broker offers tankers; Ilias’s refusal forecloses easy relief and pays the first visible cost. Escalation is textural: each unstuck voice adds a trickle, deepening the pattern rather than flipping plot. The woman’s counsel (“wait from the pause…”) functions as deepening, not reversal, forcing sidereal patience into lived time. Cost is legible on-page: broker’s grandmother’s smile, mason’s lime-scarred palm, Ilias’s open-ended vigil.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the breadcrumb conceit: memory is not hoarded but re-enacted in communal dryness; “patience was not waiting but remembering together.” No moralizing—final line lands as image, not thesis. Subtext resides in silence: the geese’s pause, the hush that “sounded like promise.” Conceptual Repricing reweights drought from loss to shared substrate, resisting tidy rain-redemption.</question>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is lyric-accumulative, taught by line 1 (“defiant hush”) and held without slippage. Syntax flexes with pressure: longer clause-runs for star-wait, abrupt fragments when eyelid opens. Diction stays within Ilias’s plausible lexicon yet achieves poetic density—“sidereal patience,” “evaporating silver.” No head-hopping; water-woman’s speech remains external, reported through his filter.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence advances image or pressure. Metaphors are coherent—“colors trod the ground like barefoot children”—and physically tracked. No filter-verb stacks; agency stays in strong verbs (“angled the box,” “spoke the woman’s name”). Rhythm modulates from breathless list to final declarative cadence, mirroring the breadcrumbed light-steps.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses drought, memory, and stained-glass cartography into a non-obvious synthesis that feels inevitable in hindsight. Breadcrumb-as-memory-key is fresh; sidereal patience literalized into civic stone waiting is risk that heightens stakes without gimmickry. Transformation test fails if names/places swapped—city, geese, lime, and glass are inextricable. Bold lyric structure paid off by Charged Poise closure earns the +0.4 risk bonus.</comment>
