<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The narrator’s obsessive noticing is embodied in tactile micro-moves (setting the shard, reading spoon-click) and carries a consistent worldview; the final breath-moment shows earned alteration of stance. Interiority stays concrete, avoiding diagnostic labels. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in scene, so the 9+ gate isn’t cleared, but the arc is credible and cost is felt.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each cottage adds density and pattern break until the final conceptual reweighting—“houses live on our pauses.” Orientation is secure by line 6; transitions are legible. Closure lands with unmistakable conceptual cost: the narrator’s own ritual of attention now perpetuates the life he sought to decode. No causal break; one meaningful tightening is sufficient.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The bay, body-as-setting, and orris shard all constrain tactics: tide-light pulls thread-needle, shard warms or stays cold determining next cottage. Selective sensory filtering (“damp rope and dill,” “broom lodged under a chair”) mirrors POV bias. Micro-setting (stair grain fitting beetle tin) directly charges the final image. No environment-driven choice failure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake— decode aliveness—tightens through three cottages: warm shard/click, cold shard/silence, bright shard/return of tin. Each tests commitment and forecloses interpretive options; cost is the narrator’s own pauses now conscripted into the houses’ breath. Agency is observational yet decisive; one deepening suffices under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from pattern of displacements and returns: aliveness is co-authored by attentive pauses. Final image reweights earlier material without moralizing—“mean to return” becomes the haunting engine. Ambiguity is meaningful: reader must decide whether the narrator is blessed or trapped. No thematic echo in final paragraph.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>First-person lyric voice is unmistakable: syntactic compression (“salt lane, its steps crooked like knees”), diction of scent and seam, perceptual signature of noticing angles of spoons. Rhythm modulates with pressure—short fragments at climax, longer breath after. No head-hopping; filter verbs serve voice (“I saw the past arrange itself”). Pattern-taught elision paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>High density lines (“bay pulled light from the sky as if drawing a thread through a needle’s amber eye”) do double duty. No paraphrase loops or template cadence; metaphors stay internally consistent. One mixed metaphor (“quiet lightning” for crack) is hairline. Closure image is crisp. No line artifacts obscure causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Premise—houses breathe through our displaced objects—is non-obvious and fully committed. Risk of twee avoided by grounding in sensory detail and conceptual cost. Fresh inflection: orris shard as both divining rod and covenant. Transformation test fails if relocated; specificity is high. No derivative template; lyric structure heightens rather than obscures meaning.</comment>
