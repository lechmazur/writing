<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The lone librarian’s interiority is rich—contradictory impulses (cataloguing vs. sheltering) collide in embodied beats (“I angle its atomically reflective face”). The micro-choice to sing the herd-song re-tunes the stone circle, earning the shelves’ leveling and the baskets’ relief; the cost is the hoarseness of that memory and the continued drift of the library itself. No second on-page character, so relationship/status bullets waived. Motivation stays steady: translate isolation into a door “held kindly,” a credo tested rather than declared. Closure is a credible endurance: the word “shelter” is written, the table set, the stance crystallized with visible fatigue. Missing the 9-band only because the beat-to-beat agency is more accumulative than causally irreversible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of tidal exposure/re-shelving intensifies until the atlas sings coordinates. Closure is an Earned Stasis—the protagonist re-anchors the floating nave by voicing the herd-song at cost of vocal strain and acknowledged perpetual drift (“I do not wait for visitors”). Orientation is taught in first line (“tidal library above clouds”) and paid off when the same tilt is steadied; no penalty. Causality holds: sundial → light-blade → atlas → song → hum re-rounds; no off-stage shortcuts. Cost is legible in the final image: “a table made from waiting” that forecloses any promise of arrival. A hairline slip: the stone-circle mechanics remain lightly abstract, barely keeping it from 9.0.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The library itself—swaying vapor aisles, cloudlight sliding “like water through letters”—functions as both environment and tool, constraining every step (the narrator walks slowly so “floorboards remember my weight and do not turn liquid”). Micro-setting objects—brass sundial, atlas of drowned stars—are handled tactilely and charge the closure image when tucked together. Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency: under hum-falter, visual narrowing to lightning and ribbon of bookplates; calmer coda widens to audible “long exhale.” Spatial choreography is clean: shelves tilt, baskets sway, chairs placed by sundial radiance—no impossible geometry. World rules (resonance lifts shelves, fossils crack into syllables) stay consistent and learned through action, not exposition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake: keep the library—and self—from dissolving into formless fog; pressure mounts as stone-circle hum “coughs” and shelves threaten to spill. One meaningful deepening: the atlas drip sings coordinates, forcing the narrator to voice the herd-song, trading vocal strain for restored resonance. Cost is felt—hoarse breath, dripping constellations across wrists—and alters tactics (must sing, not merely read). Agency is accumulative: pattern of cataloguing turns to active anchoring. No external antagonist; coincidence (thunder) complicates but does not resolve. Sufficient escalation for 600-word lyric mode, though the tightening is more cadence-shift than irreversible option-loss, keeping it shy of 8.8.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Theme emerges from concrete pattern: shelving = survival, listening = shelter; the final “table made from waiting” re-weights earlier catalog entries as furniture of care. Subtext resides in baskets “breathing” and floorboards remembering—objects negotiate coexistence before the narrator speaks. No final-paragraph moralizing; the word “shelter” is scratched into metal, not pronounced. Ambiguity lingers: independence is “a door held kindly,” neither closed nor open. Emotional after-effect is quiet awe rather than sentimental uplift. Could use one more reprise of “brittle awakenings” to hit 9.0 resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>First-person lyric voice owns a consistent perceptual signature: time measured by shorebirds, space gauged by vapor tides. Syntax lengthens and contracts with tidal rhythm; diction stays within a reader-librarian lexicon (“catalog,” “bookplates,” “atlas”) without academic drift. No dialogue, so dialogue bullets waived. Internal reliability is stable—knowledge of extinct species is presented as lived memory, not omniscient claim. Compression (“I annotate the air”) is taught early and paid off when fingertip script calms the baskets. Register never breaks: no corporate filler, no thesaurus flourish. Under peak stress, phrasing tightens to “I mutter, kneeling”—prose as character, not puppet-master narration.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm: long tidal sentences alternate with short stabilizing beats (“I wait”; “I wipe”). Figurative density is high but patterned—mixed metaphors are avoided; vapor, tide, and sound waves share fluid physics. No paraphrase loops; each sentence adds new tactile data (polished metal, dripping constellations). Information density: a single line (“Their drops sing coordinates; my tongue answers”) simultaneously advances plot, reveals tool use, and embodies cost. Opening line anchors voice and concept; final line resolves by image that recharges “table made from waiting.” One near-scaffold: repeated “the stone circle” three times in 50 words—minor, outside closure, −0.2 accounted for in grade.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise—floating library tuned by neolithic stones—feels inevitable yet fresh; combines archival, maritime, and acoustic fields into one micro-world. Transformation test: remove clouds, tides, or herd-song and the entire emotional arc collapses. Tropes (lone guardian, memory palace) are re-embodied through specific handling of brass sundial and fossil-voices. Risk-taking: lyric accumulation instead of causal showdown; success shows bold alignment of form and theme. No recognizable near-echoes; specificity (atomically reflective face, drowned star atlas) prevents generic transplant. Conceptual integrity full: commits to rules of resonance and never explains away the magic.</comment>
