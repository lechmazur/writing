<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The tower-winder’s vocation, grief, and ethical conversion are lived through tactile micro-choices—slowing the pendulum, oiling the arbor, offering the rake-handle—each carving visible cost; contradictory impulses (precision vs. repair) act in-scene, culminating in a renunciation of mere exactitude that is earned, not declared.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: because the narrator once wounded neighbors with over-precision, therefore he now halts the pendulum at the crest of stillness to rewrite time itself; the pause is a Decisive Change with felt cost—the tower’s wider arc and the fisherman’s shared carving prove the before/after shift on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Tidal obsidian ridge, brass-scarred pendulum, and rake-handle-as-micro-setting constrain every tactical move; the ridge’s hiss and mirror-shards physically underfoot charge the final shared launch, while the tower’s salt-scarred gears body the moral stakes—no description is ornamental, all is handled.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restoring communal balance after precision-driven harm—tightens when the narrator hazards stopping the town’s master clock; the single reversal inside the pendulum’s pause narrows options to irreversible ethical action, price visible in the wider arc he gifts the town and the net he no longer critiques.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of “incremental absolution” emerges through the rake-handle’s notched history and the shared carving of a child’s name; no moral is stated—resonance arrives in the tower’s answering knell beneath the water, reweighting the premise that measurement must include listening, not dictation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>First-person voice owns a salt-weathered, gear-oil lexicon (“brass scarred by salt,” “solder’s brief spark”); syntax lengthens then compresses with the pendulum’s arc, teaching a rhythmic pattern paid off in the final tidal knell—no head-hop, no register drift, only perceptual signature under stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphor; figurative density is disciplined—each image carries causal weight (“plank of silence laid across the century”); information-dense lines advance both atmosphere and stakes, climax line “the bells ring not triumph but invitation” propels closure without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: clockwork precision as moral failing, absolution literally carved into flotsam; the tower’s pause becomes a writable moment in civic time, the ridge a subaqueous choir—none of this is stock; risk-taking (stopping time itself) heightens coherence and is paid off in the shared launch tuned to bell and tide.</comment>
