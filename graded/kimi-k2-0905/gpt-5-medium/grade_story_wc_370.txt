<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist’s reclusive empathy drives every beat; the “staying while leaving” paradox is lived in body and choice, culminating in the handshake that refuses old shapes. Contradictory impulses—flight vs. need to mend—co-exist in-scene, not in summary. Interiority stays concrete (“I mistook proximity for medicine”) and the final renunciation costs him the shelter of anonymity. Micro-choices (notebook sold, knees that stay) track visible hierarchy of values.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the city’s anonymity is re-priced—no longer refuge but mercy earned through shared reading of Mistake/Wisdom. Causal chain holds: invitation → notebook past → library confrontation → handshake that forecloses old self. One transition (shelf corridor) is legible; orientation anchored by line 11. Cost is palpable in the final sentence: “the city can hold you without knowing you.”</question>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stationery shop dust, toppled shelf corridor, municipal fluorescents that warm into discerning lamps—each detail constrains visibility and social temperature. The paired-book stacks (“grief against gratitude”) act as micro-setting that forces the dyadic reading. Notebook full of unsent letters recurs as handled object whose prior sale cues present shame. Spatial choreography remains coherent through six turns and the handshake at the exit desk.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.0</question><grade>Dominant stake—how to bear the weight of a mistake—tightens when the ex-friend appears opposite the table; option to flee is foreclosed by “knees knew the room.” Reading Mistake/Wisdom aloud is the single decisive escalation that changes knowledge: mistake becomes a room, not verdict. Cost is visible in the refusal to reconcile into old shapes, paid immediately in the uneased spine of the book.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Wisdom through mistake emerges from dramatized paired reading, never asserted. “Nestled paradoxes” is enacted by shelving opposites together; theme accrues via image and action. Final re-pricing of anonymity as mercy avoids moralizing. Ambiguity lingers: no apology first, no full absolution—just the gentlest truth available.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>First-person voice owns a distinct perceptual signature: print that “wrinkled to whisper,” syllables as “birds that might bruise.” Syntax mirrors recluse tension—long breathy clauses that suddenly contract (“I nearly stood to flee”). Patterned elision (“absence is my coat”) taught early and paid off in final street anonymity. No head-hopping; even clerk’s dialogue filtered through POV bias.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Rhythm modulates with pressure: accumulative sibilance in corridor description yields to clipped “We did not apologize first.” No mixed metaphors; vehicles stay physical (map lied, spine uncreased). Information density high—single sentence often carries setting, metaphor, and emotional turn. Zero loops or scaffold; opening “crumpled invitation” re-circulates as passport and mirror of uncreased spine.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Secret-society library that shelves opposites together freshes the familiar “atonement meeting” frame. Mistake-as-room reconfigures self-help trope into spatial epistemology. Specificity of unsent-notebook-sold-at-stationery shop prevents swap to generic object. Risk in lyric renunciation succeeds: refusal to re-spine the book feels inevitable yet non-clichéd.</comment>
