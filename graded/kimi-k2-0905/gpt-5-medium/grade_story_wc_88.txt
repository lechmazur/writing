<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The narrator’s contradictory need to atone yet remain stained powers every beat; the ledger-ball warming under guilt is a lived micro-choice that externalizes internal stakes. Interiority stays concrete (“guilt returned as steam”) rather than diagnostic. Final renunciation to ferry others costs the fantasy of self-wiping, earned by the earlier failed purchase of forgetting.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the baseball cools, the lake offers “rings of useful ache,” reweighting the premise that amnesia could absolve. Causal chain holds: newspaper decoding → rumor → descent → confession → decision to stay. One minor orientation debt—city geography is never anchored—but the haze serves the noir-fable tone and is paid off by closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The bioluminescent lake is not backdrop but active creditor: its algae-comet tails illuminate the narrator’s confession, the pillar-jars enforce the moral ledger. Bench-seat dock and melted street-sign hull tether the underworld to the city above. Exact, sensory idiom (“water whispered with algae”) constrains the skiff’s path and charges the final image of stained rings.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can guilt be outsourced?—tightens when the baseball literally warms, forcing vocal confession that forecloses clean-escape fantasy. Escalation is situational: environmental pressure (glow, heat) rather than antagonist, but the lake’s response visibly narrows options to stay or flee. Cost is legible: voice burns, eyes water, ledger accepted.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of collective numbness emerges from concrete city symptoms (shortened births, spiked condolence ads) rather than assertion. Final invitation to row others across reframes empathy as labor, not sentiment, avoiding moralizing. Subtext lives in object handling: the time-travel ball carries the paradox that harm and repair share one signature.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>First-person lyric voice sustains a perceptual signature—“neon fog,” “homing moon”—without purple overload. Controlled psychic distance: narrator never exceeds what he can see/feel underground. Syntax flexes under pressure (“It warmed, then burned…”) mirroring physiological rise. No dialogue contamination; caretaker’s terse idiom contrasts narrator’s humid interiority.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density: each sentence advances image or stakes; no filter-verb clusters. Rhythm modulates—long cadence for descent, staccato for heat spike. Metaphors stay internally consistent (lake as bruise, ball as moon). One near-loop “delicately robust” repeated, but the echo is thematic, not scaffolding. Closing line crystallizes without exposition.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The memory-for-sale city, bioluminescent moral lake, and time-travel baseball fuse into a fresh moral tech noir. Conceptual integrity: every fantastical element (jars of listening faces, baseball curving home) is causally tied to the guilt economy. Risky lyric structure pays off in a closure image unattainable in realism. Specificity prevents abstract allegory.</comment>
