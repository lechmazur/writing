<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mara’s interior contradiction—needing control while learning release—drives every micro-choice; her spatial gift is more than label, it choreographs the cat’s path and her own emotional lattice. Grief for Kian is embodied in the shovel-strut fix, not named, and her competence is balanced by the visible cost of loosening her grip. The final stance crystallizes with earned cost: she powers down the rig, accepting permeable vigilance. No stock interiority; even “physics of letting go” is tested through fungal sensor data and feral-cat diplomacy.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Mara lays the pointer in her palm “light as a falling permission,” reweighting security from barrier to lattice. Under Accumulative/Textural lens, each pulse of bioluminescence tightens the pattern until the final image reconfigures stakes without burning the night. Cost is legible—“she unhooked a tight dress stitched around the heart”—and persistent constraint (the rig now off) shapes future vigilance. Causality holds: tension accumulates through spore-waves, cat-passage, steam hiss, then releases into breathable alertness.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The farm’s humid domes, slate-glow shelves, and ruptured steam seal act as micro-setting that constrains choices: Mara braces the strut with a shovel, not a generic tool, because the fungal racks demand gentle torque. Sensory hierarchy obeys her intrusion-detector bias—chemical noses, mesh gaps, laser thread—so description never becomes tour-guide. Final image of the pointer “light as a falling permission” re-uses the cracked-button prop to charge atmosphere. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from dome to dome; no floating distances.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—permeable security vs. absolute defense—surfaces in the first paragraph and tightens when the unlocked gate invites the cat. One meaningful deepening: the hiss from ruptured seal forces her to trace pressure backward, trading haste for listening. Escalation is accumulative: each bioluminescent pulse, spore-wave, and mesh gap re-weights risk toward hospitality. Visible price: she powers down the rig, surrendering omniscience for co-existence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges solely through concrete particulars: the cat’s low-threat waveform, the shovel-braced strut, the pointer’s final stillness. “Familiar strangers” is never labeled; it is enacted by cat, steam, and spores. Final image of “quiet wildfire” offers resonant non-literal answer—change without combustion. No moralizing; the wisdom is earned by tactile negotiation with mesh and mist.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays strictly inside Mara’s perceptual grammar—she sees perimeters as melodies, gaps as rests. Syntax mirrors spatial gift: long, lattice-like sentences when mapping paths, clipped fragments under sensor ping. No filter-verb stacks; “spores waved, sensors pricked” keeps immediacy. Voice modulates from cool technician to grief-tinged caretaker without register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>High information density: one sentence can advance atmosphere, tool use, and interior shift (“She clicked it once and the nearest shelf awakened; spores waved, sensors pricked…”). Metaphors are controlled—no mixed vehicles—and rhythm breathes with scene pace. No synonym churn or template cadence. Minor paraphrase loop near “greet movement without mistaking it for invasion” costs −0.3, keeping it from 9+ band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: bioluminescent farm as intrusion-detection lab, grief-work as mesh calibration, laser pointer as ethic probe. Conceptual risk—security through permeability—pays off without gimmickry. Specificity of fungal data-waveforms and cat-diplomacy makes premise uncopyable. Final “quiet wildfire” reweights every prior pulse of light, proving transformation test.</comment>
