<question>1</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Mara’s cautious-exuberant broker verging on civic penance is vivid; her ledger initiative and fee-forgiveness for the choir show micro-choices under pressure. Jun’s “whimsically attentive” librarian is sketched mostly through job detail (bookmarking winds, aligning maps to creaking mast) rather than contradiction under stress; he remains an accessory to Mara’s arc. Interiority stays concrete in Mara; Jun’s lens is surface-level so the relationship crucible never tests or changes him. The ending distributes custodianship but the cost of “sharing the weight” is asserted, not dramatized, muting the final change.</comment>

<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Drives under Accumulative/Textural lens: repeated images of tides, music, and quiet ledgers accrue until the final public signing reweights community memory; causality remains soft but coherent. Orientation is immediate (who/where/when anchored by word 30); the single transition (library→roof) is legible. One meaningful tightening occurs when stevedores actually sign, making abstract gratitude concrete; closure lands as Charged Poise—ledger key passed under starlight crystallizes shared duty, felt cost legible. No causal breaks; “mistaken envelope” functions as coincidence that complicates, not resolves, satisfying situational allowance.</comment>

<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The colonnaded, starlit, gull-gossiping library is tactile and atmospheric; lamps sway, paper lamps nod, spatial choreography holds as bodies move from desk→roof→pier. Salt air and violin resin fuse occupational and emotional textures, constraining choices (wind dictates rooftop rehearsal, resin repairs splinters). Micro-objects—locket, ledger, rope bookmark—are handled on-page and return charged at closure. Sensory economy favors sound and smell over visual catalog, supporting musical tide metaphor without overwriting.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“uplift silent contributors”—is signaled early; pressure mounts modestly as townsfolk hesitate to inscribe names. The signing moment itself is the single decisive tightening that makes civic gratitude irreversible; cost is symbolic (public exposure of humility) rather than material, but legible. No antagonist needed; internal risk of “recognition can be risky” provides low-grade tension that plateaus rather than escalates further. Escalation is present but gentle, adequate for lyric/accumulative mode yet short of visceral punch demanded for 8.8+.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme of quiet reciprocity emerges through concrete ledger entries, not exposition; final image of alphabetized dark reweights earlier “secrecy has taxed the town’s spirit.” Subtext lives in gesture—folded notes, unsure hats in hands—avoiding overt moral. The locket photo and tide-return motif recur with shifting meaning, charging closure. A slight sermonic lilt in Mara’s speech keeps it from 9.0, but complexity and ambiguity remain intact.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person omniscient floats cleanly above two principals without head-hopping within paragraphs; perceptual signature favors maritime acoustics (gulls gossip, brass whispers). Syntax flexes with cadence—“paper fibers snapping open like sails”—showing rhythmic control. Dialogue is minimal but textured: “where the letter tried traveling” is librarian-exact yet whimsical. Diction stays within coastal colloquial register, no register drift; poetic compression is pattern-taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>High information density: single sentences deliver broker trait, setting, atmosphere (“salt breezes and the hush of pages”). Mixed metaphors avoided; vehicles stay nautical/musical. No scaffold or synonym loops; occasional adjectival pairs (“cautious exuberance,” “whimsically attentive”) are prompt-mandated and brief. Ear-test shows varied sentence openings and paragraph rhythm; final rope-bookmark image is lean and propulsive. Minor abundance of participial phrases in celebratory rooftop beat, not at closure, so 9+ still within reach.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Takes the familiar “unsung labor” trope but reframes through cargo-broker–led bibliographic archive of dock hands’ violins—fresh synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk of gentle stakes pays off by avoiding sentimentality; accumulation replaces confrontation. Specificity of resin-fixing splinters and demurrage-for-choir swaps general gratitude for port-economy detail. Not radically groundbreaking, yet the maritime-archive angle and communal ledger as closure carry memorable inflection.</comment>
