<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Interiority is sensorially rich (“kiln walls warming a little, without flame”), but the potter’s contradictory impulses stay mostly lyrical rather than sharp under pressure; the final “steady tenderness” reads as poetic resolve more than a renunciation with visible cost, so the arc feels gently earned rather than crucible-forged.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Closure lands cleanly: the braided timelines tighten into a Charged Poise (“the place resisted change by practicing it gently”) with conceptual cost—the potter renounces possession of the oasis and bears the shawl of its times. Accumulative lens holds: each micro-gift (water, cleaned frames, sung note) layers density until the thrum reconfigures meaning, no causal breaks, pattern taught early.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Heat-shimmered hive, flattened smoke, and lantern glass as micro-setting constrain every beat; the cracked trough clay literally shapes the final cups that “keep speaking,” so environment charges closure. Sensory selection stays urgent—sound of invisible wings, taste of breath-condensed water—without tourist catalog.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—can tenderness re-animate a dead place?—tightens through each micro-offer; the thrum’s answer braids timelines and forecloses the option of taking anything away, visible in the leaving of cups. Cost is present but soft (water, breath, time); lacks a visceral price that would lift to 8.8+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: kindness as photosynthetic force that lets places resist change by practicing it gently. The lantern-glass refrains reweight at exit, refusing moral summary; ambiguity lingers about whether the thrum will survive, giving the reader after-effect without tidy wisdom.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays interiorly close, with potter-specific diction (“slow kick wheel,” “firing them with brush and patience”). Rhythm modulates—long breath-like sentences for kneeling, staccato “She gave small lights” for beats—no head-hopping, perceptual signature consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>High density: one sentence does scene-work and metaphor (“the smoke lay down again, taught by the day to flatten”). One scaffold tic: repeated “she… she…” anaphora in exit paragraph; not at closure, so −0.2. No mixed metaphors, strong verbs anchor each paragraph.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Fuses eco-fantasy with craft poetics; “phototropic to kindness” reframes hive-collapse as responsive biology. Risk—quiet lyric ending with conceptual rather than plot payoff—pays off; synthesis feels inevitable and specific to this voice, not grafted trope.</comment>
