<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interiority is lush and idiosyncratic—“labyrinth sighed like a sleeping boiler,” “measured grief will float”—but the protagonist’s emotional engine stays reactive; no forked choice ever jeopardizes his safety or belief. The micro-choice to press the cracked sextant against the root is the solitary visible wager; it suffices for this length but keeps the score sub-9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the sealed sextant + archived “minutes” reweight grief from abyss to archive, cost felt in the final image of “minutes yet unread.” Causal chain is lyric-elliptical yet coherent under Accumulative lens; moonlight healing is seeded early, paid off at climax. One shard only (continuous night), so scope default is met; orientation anchor arrives by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Stormlit tower, boiler-maze, milk-blue breath—details are filtered through maintenance-worker bias (“every hinge, latch… my jurisdiction”) and constrain every movement. Root-as-micro-setting literally buckles the wall and steers the excavation; spoon and sextant act as portable locales. Final image of rain-gleamed trees outside re-anchors spatial exit, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</answer>
<comment>Dominant stake: transform immeasurable grief into something archivable. Pressure escalates via density—dust hills, numbered tags, dream ledgers—rather than external jeopardy; the pin-clink moment tightens the cadence and forces the corridor dig. Cost is conceptual: once sorrow is weighed & filed, its power is re-priced; felt price lands in “minutes yet unread” jar.</comment>

<question>5</question><answer>8.8</answer>
<comment>Theme emerges from refrains of measurement vs. living witness; no character ever names “grief” as thesis. Trees’ quiet register reweights the human archive, achieving resonance without moral. Final image of spoon-labeled jar crystallizes the paradox—quantification preserves yet distances sorrow—earning the high band.</answer>

<question>6</question><answer>9.0</answer>
<comment>First-person maintenance voice is distinct in syntax (“I swept their grit into little hills”) and perceptual filter (mechanical joints, leaks, tags). Lyric compression is taught early (“the night was a welder of edges”) and holds without fragment overload. No dialogue, so voice coherence remains unchallenged; moonlight/register diction stays within caretaker lexicon.</answer>

<question>7</question><answer>8.5</answer>
<comment>Rhythm modulates from long breathy sentences to staccato “I logged each tag…” mirroring sift-and-file action. Metaphors are audacious but internally coherent (“stormlit tower… milk blue breath”). Zero paraphrase loops; occasional adjective richness (“snake-thick root”) is purposeful. Closure line “register of their quiet” lands clean, no artifact.</answer>

<question>8</question><answer>8.6</answer>
<comment>Fusion of custodial realism with lyric cosmology feels fresh; grief-archive via stamped root-tags is an off-angle invention. Risky metaphor density serves pressure rather than ornament. The synthesis feels inevitable after the first paragraph, satisfying transformation test. No derivative premise drag; only minor deduction for familiar “tower as memory” trope.</answer>
