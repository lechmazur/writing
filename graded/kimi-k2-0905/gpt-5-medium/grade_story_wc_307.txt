<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The narrator’s interiority is rich and specific—“patience tasted of lake smoke and copper”—but the researcher remains a cipher whose reverse-aging never complicates choices on the page; the final vanishing is accepted too smoothly, so the cost feels conceptual rather than personally earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: each ripple-image thickens the pattern until the last line reweights “vanishing” as gift. The grotto’s hum, the candles, the rising stone all return with altered charge, delivering a Charged Poise that lets the final “space needed” land as undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Floating platform, magnetic grotto, and pond-as-mirror constrain every beat; the setting is the clock that keeps them aloft and the mirror that teaches vanishing. Sensory detail is selective—“sycamore hush,” “lake smoke and copper”—and the final image of dawn moving hush to sparrow recharges the opening atmosphere.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Single stake—“learn how to be seen by disappearing”—tightens when the narrator agrees to release the village dam. The price is implied in the widened river, but because the narrator’s emotional resistance is never sharply tested, the escalation feels gentle rather than urgent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Theme of generative absence emerges through concrete images: the stone that falls, the rings that braid, the boats that return. No moral is stated; the final line reweights the whole tale into quiet social cost. The whisper “our vanishing is not an end” is the closest to overt statement but is anchored in the embodied trance, so it earns its insight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Lyric first-person voice is consistent, with syntactic compression that mirrors trance: “rings braided themselves into paths, and the paths into breathing.” No head-hopping; perceptual signature stays anchored to narrator’s body and attention. Register stays within plausible meditation-student diction even at peak lyricism.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with scene needs—long sentences for drift, staccato fragments for the stone drop. Figurative language is dense but patterned (“pond…still word of water”) and never muddies causality. One scaffold pair: “we do not starve knowledge…withhold its feast” could compress, yet it occurs early and does not touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Reverse-aging mentor + magnetic grotto + vanishing-as-gift fuses into a fresh meditation koan. The rising stone that settles back onto the rim rewrites gravity as compassion; this reprise feels inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric density is justified by trance frame and pays off in final image.</comment>
