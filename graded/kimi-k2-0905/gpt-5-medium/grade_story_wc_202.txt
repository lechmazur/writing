<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Protagonist’s translator vocation is lived through sensory synesthesia and micro-choices (“I swallowed two worlds”), but interior contradiction is more asserted than dramatized; the final naming act is tender yet feels lightly earned because the child’s stake is revealed only at the close. Flawed passivity fits the lyric mode, so no deduction, yet the absence of a visible cost to the narrator keeps this shy of 9.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a lyric Conceptual Repricing: the scrap of sailcloth tied to the frame makes the painted dusk quit “drowning in anonymity.” Cost is legible in the painter’s lowered eyes and the market’s brightening; the lens shard’s coordinates (tar, iron, hush) reweight the whole premise under an Accumulative lens. Pattern is taught early (“I translate what skylines say to shadows”) and paid off in the final breath. No orientation debt; causality of naming = re-naming holds.</comment>

<comment>Rope bridges that “sighed like flutes” and stalls that “chimed with glass and copper” are not mere perfume; they cage movement and force the narrator to slow-read the canvas. The lighthouse lens fragment functions as micro-setting: its cool edge against the canvas margin is the literal hinge that releases the name. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven—ash and berry salts are remembered, not catalogued. Spatial choreography is immaculate; no 9+ gate missed.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“to honor overlooked histories”—is signaled early and narrows to one child’s name. The tightening beat is the lens-touch that turns varnish into tidewater and fissures into cartographies; option space collapses from “any lost story” to “this one unnamed girl.” Cost is conceptual but undeniable: the painting’s price becomes “irrelevant” once the name is spoken, a social repricing that forecloses commodification. Under Accumulative lens, one intensification suffices; no reversal is required.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through the equation of naming with survival: “Her name surfaced twice, as if practicing survival.” Subtext is carried in gesture—painter’s shrug, lowered eyes—never thesis. Final image of sailcloth tied to frame offers non-literal answer: remembrance is a tether, not a transaction. No moralizing, no echo; ambiguity lingers in the market wind that “braided with my voice.”</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Perceptual signature is hypnotically consistent: synesthetic metaphors (light “tasted,” varnish “became tidewater”) never violate the translator’s synesthetic gift. Rhythm modulates from long breathy sentences to the staccato of “Letters rose like fish, shy, silver.” No head-hopping; painter’s interior is read only through exterior cues. Compression and elision (“I drank nothing…”) are taught early and paid off in the final pause that “does not move.”</comment>

<comment>Line-level craft is lush yet information-dense: “pigments mixed with river ash and berry salts” does world, scent, and theme in five words. Occasional metaphor stackedness (“waves lift toward absence, as if absence were a harbor”) flirts with purple but stays purposeful under lyric license. No loops, no scaffold; pronouns are clean. Final third is artifact-free, allowing 9-band approach; withheld 0.2 for minor cadence echo (“breathe / breath” cluster).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fantasy conceit of airborne alchemist market is instantly fresh, yet the core innovation is treating remembrance as a tradable commodity that can be stolen back by attention itself. Synthesis of lighthouse optics + painted weather + lost child’s name feels inevitable only after the reveal, fulfilling transformation test. Risk in lyric non-linear structure heightens rather than obscures stakes. No recognizable template echoed; specificity is non-portable.</comment>
