<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The thief’s vow to “take only what harm has taken first” is repeatedly stress-tested by the tactile act of swapping chess pieces that hold living weather-vows; each micro-choice (knight, rook, bishop, queen) embodies a visible hierarchy of values where returning summer, hunger, or mercy costs him trembling certainty. Interiority stays concrete—“my gloves shook” under sacred play—and the final earned stance (“my hands still belong to mending”) forecloses the easier path of theft, paying with a promised itinerant silence. Flaws (compulsion to play, fear of dissonance) directly complicate tactics; no therapeutic self-labeling intrudes. The closing image crystallizes a believable renunciation that is causally seeded by every hollowed piece he handled.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the chessboard inhales and expels the sky’s wrongness as starlings, mountains return “late but apologizing,” and the protagonist accepts a silence inside the lid as payment—an unmistakable conceptual cost that reweights earlier swaps. Causal lattice holds: each piece-exchange narrows weather-options until the queen-letter (pre-natal wind writing) forces the final swap; no teleporting props or retro-fixes. Orientation is taught by 60 words (“icebound spire above the clouds when the sky is wrong”) and ambiguity about literal oceans-in-sky later pays off by showing the dissonance being repaired. Lens is Accumulative/Textural: pressure mounts through sensory density (blue-patient lamps, thawwater moan) until cadence shift at the bell releases accumulated guilt into tuned wind.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Spire functions as micro-setting: the heart-notch constrains entry, the ice-chessboard literally channels seasons, meteoric stone pieces must match or weather stalls—environment directly shapes tactics. Sensory economy favors urgency—cold that “forgot how to bite,” lamps “leaning”—rather than cataloguing. Spatial choreography stays clean through spiral corridor, rafter bell, descending clouds. The recurring pocket-sundial lid recharges closure when its cracked constellations throw light to wake the bell, embedding object-as-setting that crystallizes the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore the sky’s timing by risking his vow—tightens with each piece swap that forecloses a weather shortcut. Agency drives escalation: every substitution (pawn-hair roll, moonlight rook, window-frame bishop) costs certainty and progressively narrows safe options until the queen-letter demands total surrender. Visible prices accumulate: trembling hands, promised itinerancy, and the silence he accepts in lieu of payment. No coincidence resolves; the final bell coughs only after his last swap, crystallizing choice under Accumulative pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme—“mending theft with play”—emerges through concrete image-chain: coins→confessions, seals→lullabies, now storms→mercy, rather than thesis statement. Final silence inside the lid offers a non-literal answer: restitution is not return of goods but acceptance of unknowable cost, reweighting earlier catalog of thefts. Ambiguity lingers: teacher calls it stealing nothing yet giving back everything, resisting tidy moral. Subtextual echo of “apprentice of wonder” stays implicit in astonishment at starlings and late-apologizing mountains.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>First-person lyric voice owns a consistent perceptual signature: sky “wrong,” frost “caught in breath,” time “ticking audibly”—idiosyncratic, never committee. Syntax breathes with pressure: longer anaphoric swaps build tension; clause fragments (“A seam sighed”) mark micro-turns. Pocket-sundial, snow-apple knight, moonlight rook—all metaphors stay physically coherent within fantastic rule-set. No head-hopping; unreliability is hinted but never retroactively explained, sustaining immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>High information density: “lamps burned with blue patience, each flame leaning toward a board carved into the floor” performs scene-setting, foreshadows lamps’ final bow, and maintains rhythmic propulsion. Varied sentence openings avoid template cadence; metaphor strings serve pattern (weather-chess) rather than overwriting. Zero paraphrase loops; no simultaneity errors. Closing line “carrying play like prayer” offers crisp, earned cadence that recharges prior “sacredly playful” motif without cliché.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: meteoric chessmen storing live weather-vows fuses theft, penance, and climate repair—concept grows organically from character’s chivalrous-thief flaw rather than gimmick. No close echoes of well-known scenes; specificity (woven silver hair for punctual dawn, window-frame bishop for shared hunger) makes tropes unrecognizable. Risk in lyric-compression could have obscured causality, but closure reweights premise successfully, so boldness elevates rather than caps score.</comment>
