<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mara’s “affectionate skeptic” contradiction stays alive in every beat—she doubts the pill yet keeps signaling, letting the wand falter and restart. The narrator’s geode-cradling and breath-counting give tactile micro-choices that reveal a hierarchy of values: memory > certainty. Both characters move from static burn to “forehead pressed” renunciation, paying the cost of reopened grief. Interiority stays concrete; no diagnostic labels intrude.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the un-lit muscovite on the sill reweights the whole evening, making the “lantern” they built an after-image the reader now carries. Causality is lyric-accumulative; each wand pass and exhale tightens the same stake—can memory be gentled?—until the final stillness forecloses further attempts. The 120-word anchor is met: “light painting studio,” two characters, rainy night. Cost is legible in the dulled shard and their joined stillness.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The studio’s electrical rig, rain-veined windows, and muscovite flash constrain every move—without the grounded floor they could not chase static into image. Body-as-setting is explicit: fingertips tap, calves sting, foreheads meet. “Fractally precise” is not ornament; it dictates the wand’s spacing and camera timing. Final image of the now-dull geode on the sill is charged by prior luminescence, fulfilling 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>One dominant stake—make memory survivable—tightens through each somatic marker and color pass; no extraneous reversals. Escalation is accumulative: static shock → misread rhythm → deeper breath → cobalt fix; each layer raises the chance of emotional overload. Protagonists pay with reopened grief and the geode’s spent glow. Agency remains joint but visible; coincidence is absent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: telepathy as kindness, not message-service; art as river that forgives a field. No character states the thesis; instead the final dulled shard reprices the premise—memory work ends only when the tool is set aside. Subtext lives in silences between taps and the shared forehead press. Ambiguity lingers: is the “trick” real or art? The story refuses to resolve, letting the question burn.</question>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>First-person plural sustains a single collective interiority without head-hop. Diction—“willowglass,” “muscovite,” “fractally precise”—stays inside an artist-scientist lexicon. Rhythm tightens under pressure: short clauses during static jump, longer breath-interrupted sentences during color passes. No filter-verb stacks; metaphor vehicles stay consistent (light = memory = river).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Line-level density is high: one sentence often layers sensorium, tool-action, and emotional valence. No synonym churn or template cadence; each metaphor extends the prior (minnows → glass → river). Read-aloud rhythm modulates with heartbeat and breath. Artifacts are absent; the final “brittle brightness” line is clean, uncluttered, and propulsive.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</comment><comment>Telepathy-as-kindness-via-somatic-markers is a fresh synthesis; no genre template duplicates this exact grammar. The muscovite shard repurposes a mineralogical curiosity into a memory lantern, an image not previously seen. Risky lyric-accumulative structure pays off in the charged stillness. If names and places swapped, the core mechanism would collapse—proof of specificity.</comment>
