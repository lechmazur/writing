<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The narrator’s interior contradiction—seeking closure yet compelled to reopen wounds—stays active in every beat; the plant-telepathy gift is not merely labeled but used to tunnel, read fossil rings, and decide to plant ivy in the crater. Emotion stays embodied: numb fingers, cold glass pressed to wrists, “tasting loam and apology.” The final micro-choice—shatter hourglass, plant ivy—pays off the prior causality and costs her the relic, earning the shift toward “garden I will learn.” Voice occasionally drifts into lyric abstraction (“meteor hush,” “leaf rhythms”) that dilutes specificity, keeping it from the 8-band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the hourglass is sacrificed and the ivy planted, reweighting the miracle’s displacement into forward-looking stewardship; cost is the empty glass in hand. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—coffee-ring readings, plant whispers, and artifact repetitions accrue until the final cadence shifts. Orientation is anchored by line 3 (quiet tower, dawn, post-anesthesia). No causality break; every beat stems from the prior (rings → tunnel → chamber → planting). Meets 9+ quick test for closure under lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The tower room, tunnel scar, and fossil-cup micro-setting are filtered through the narrator’s plant-sensory bias; frost, clay ring, and moss guide footfall and decision. Spatial choreography is clean—ivy on sill → stairs → fenced scar → chamber—with no impossible moves. The frosted hourglass recurs as tactile cold that steadies tremor, then is emptied and cracked, charging the final image. Environment materially constrains the choice to plant; without the tunnel chamber the ritual fails.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—how to live with a miracle that saved the wrong person—tightens when the narrator learns the miracle mistook her for Mira; this deepens guilt and narrows options to renunciation or stewardship. Agency is exercised in the final beat: shatter hourglass, plant ivy, accept ongoing apprenticeship to green voices. Cost is immediate—the relic destroyed, no longer a shrine—and conceptual—she must “learn to read living scars.” No external antagonist needed; pressure is internal and moral. One meaningful escalation suffices for lyric-accumulative design.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the recurring image of rings—coffee, fossil, scar—arguing that closure is not a gate but continuous cultivation. No overt moralizing; insight is earned through the ritual of planting. Subtext in the plants’ whispered “roots braid time” reconfigures grief into living archive. Final image reweights earlier wounds as soil to tend, not seal.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>First-person voice maintains a consistent lyric-elliptical texture: compression like “meteor hush,” “saplings learn our names” teaches the pattern early and pays off in final “garden I will learn.” Perceptual signature is plant-tinged—air “stitched by long needles of light,” heartbeat learns “leaf rhythms”—without head-hopping. Filter verbs (“I feel,” “I sense”) are minimal and justified by telepathy frame. No dialogue to test, but internal monologue avoids therapy-speak.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>High information density: single sentences layer metaphor, action, and back-cue (“I crack the frosted hourglass against a stone, pour its cold sand into the ring, and plant the ivy cutting in the center”). Rhythm modulates—long breathy clauses for hush, then staccato verbs for ritual. Minor loop: “tremor” appears twice within three lines; not at closure. Metaphors stay coherent (glass as throat, sand as rain) and do not obscure causality. No scaffold or template cadence detected.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: plant-telepathy + coffee-ring forensics + hourglass relic + tunnel collapse grief creates a nonce genre. Risky lyric compression taught early and held to final garden image without clarity loss. Displaced miracle trope is inverted—miracle is burden, not gift. Specific detail (“ivy answers my unasked ache,” “sand hush deepens”) keeps concept from sliding into abstract allegory.</comment>
