<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Protagonist’s voice-driven ledger-keeping and Harbor’s nose-driven guidance both manifest in embodied, scene-level choices; the decision to light the leaf over the cylinder is an earned micro-choice that forecloses the safe dusk and risks the relay. Interiority stays concrete—“I tried to translate distance into closeness” grounds the abstract want in tactile action. The only minor drag: “intuitively descriptive ledger keeper” is label-speak not yet dramatized when introduced, but the wax-leaf cataloguing that follows quickly redeems it.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a crystalline Charged Poise: the copper crow’s lattice of syllables plus the sister’s laugh rewire the meaning of distance under the autumn light, cost felt in the snapped-shut dark that follows. Causality is lyric-accumulative: each object (leaf, cylinder, relay) layers sensory density until the final projection of color through wax triggers the tower; no gaps, no teleport. Orientation anchor (“Sluice… cracked wasteland”) is clear inside 120 words; single transition from settlement to scarecrow site is legible. Persistent constraint—the leaf’s limited dusk window—shapes the entire timeline.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is not backdrop but toolkit: the scarecrow relay fabricated from rebar and a copper crowhead is a micro-site that literally enables the climax; its beak’s orientation steers the beam north. Sensory hierarchy is POV-loyal—grief-fermenting nose of Harbor, rust-tasting wind, solder-smelling envelope—each detail later weaponized (scent cues cylinder ID, rust teaches listening). Spatial choreography holds across the night walk back. No caps triggered; even “wasteland” is stripped of cliché by being cracked, rib-showing, breathing.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—translate distance into audible contact—tightens exactly once but decisively: the leaf must be lifted at the final sliver of dusk or the relay stays mute, and that window is named early and ticked down. Agency is present-tense: protagonist chooses to trade copper, chooses to ignite wax, chooses to stand until “the sun snapped shut.” Cost is the spent leaf and the swallowed darkness that follows; no reset, no second chance. No antagonist needed; pressure is temporal-environmental and suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges as the reparable elasticity of distance: “distance is not a wall but a lens” is spoken by the sister, yet the story has already enacted it through color, wax, and wire rather than preaching. Subtext lives in Harbor’s tail-thump approving the relay—animal silence endorsing human reach. No moralizing tagline ends the piece; final image of Harbor nodding “as if she too could read” lets the idea linger without closure-fatigue. Emotional after-effect is concrete: reader feels the click of alignment then the hush after, a palpable exhale.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>First-person voice owns a scavenger-poet diction—“ribs of buses,” “skins of refrigerators,” “dusty at the edge of sense”—syntactically varied, never drifting into unearned elegance. Perceptual signature is consistent: narrator catalogs by smell and color, filters weather as “a door learning to breathe,” maintains that bias through stress. No head-hop; Harbor’s interior is responsibly hinted via gesture, not ventriloquized. Dialogue is minimal and subtextual (“What wheel speaks…”) keeping voice monopoly intact.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Rhythm breathes with scene: long luminous sentences for wax projections, staccato “we stood inside that glow” for climax beat. Metaphors stay physically coherent—wax river, copper crow—no mixed vehicles. High density: one sentence often couples action + image + emotional valence (“Harbor lay down and let the sand cool her chest, and her ears shaped the air…”). Tiny nudge: rare “the hush here was wild, quick as grassfires” stacks two similes in one clause, but the cadence survives. No scaffold loops, no synonym churn, no filter-verb stacks.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise welding of post-war scrap into sensory telecom via phonograph scars feels non-obvious yet inevitable; no direct genre antecent. Device logic—colored light through wax activating a seasonal relay—is specific, absurd-yet-credible, and emotionally charged. Risk of lyric circuitry paid off by clear causal closure. Transformation complete: swap leaf, dog, or scrap town and the entire emotional calculus collapses. Fresh synthesis emerges from reclaimed tech + grief + color optics—an angle not seen in submission piles.</comment>
