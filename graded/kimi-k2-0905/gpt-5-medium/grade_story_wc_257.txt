<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Grief-struck jeweler’s interiority is vivid—metal that “clouded over” embodies loss; micro-choices (projecting stencil, soldering wire around hesitation) show hierarchy of values. Endurance of running nightly “observatory church” is earned renunciation with felt cost (patience, sleep, livelihood). No second on-page character, so relationship crucible exempt; occupational detail (mourning jewelry, solder, vellum) is germane and specific. Slight safety-hedge: tactile pain or bodily risk never pushed to extreme, keeping flaw human-scaled rather than perilous.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Drive lens = Accumulative/Textural: pattern of “curtains of intention” thickens across shards until final Charged Poise. Closure—lily still glowing from fingerprints—offers Resonant Reconfiguration with conceptual cost: narrator commits to perpetual witness. Orientation clear by line 4 (“timeless observatory”), no penalty. One minor scaffold: “I did not cry; I clicked…” could compress, but causality intact.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Observatory as micro-setting constrains every move—keys hidden in telescope cradle, console that still takes password, projector as only daylight. Environment supplies tools (brass mechanism, vellum window) that enable ritual and charge final image. Sensory hierarchy tight: dust motes in projector beam, wire warmed by hesitated fingers. Setting never drifts into postcard; each detail either enables action or mirrors interior state.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake = teaching “withering to bloom” for self and strangers; pressure accumulates as origami invitations go unanswered some nights. One meaningful deepening: woman’s box of temp tattoos projects child’s aurora—cost of parental grief felt on page. No external antagonist; tension is attendance vs. absence, answered by narrator’s continued vigil. Coincidence absent; escalation is density of shared grief inside dome.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: grief as hinge—never slammed because fingers remain inside. Subtext in objects: coal beads from shipwreck, cradle ribbon pins imply grief predates individual loss. No moralizing; final line “night learns to lean toward smallest heat” is image, not thesis. Lily constellation reweighted from private tattoo to public planetarium bloom—conceptual reprice completes arc.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>First-person voice stable; perceptual signature jeweler-technical (“metal remembers being rock”). Rhythm modulates—long cadence for reflection, clipped fragments under projector switch. No dialogue to judge; interior monologue avoids filter verbs. Occasional lyric compression (“margin of my heart”) is pattern-taught early and reprises at closure, so allowed.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>High information density: one sentence often sets grief craft, location, and emotional state. Metaphors stay coherent—lily petals mapped to unreachable places, no mixed vehicles. Minor loop: “curtains of intention” repeated four times; pattern justified by accumulative design but still draws attention. No typos, tense slips, or scaffold; read-aloud rhythm breathes with projector’s mechanical whirr.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: grief-jeweler turned planetarium-priest repurposes scientific instrument as ritual space. Tattoo stencil projected on cosmos transforms private memorial into public constellation—specific, non-obvious. Risk taken with lyric, near-magical tone paid off by coherent closure. Could edge higher if coal beads or fox origami had sharper real-world detail; still, concept feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
