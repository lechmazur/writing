<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The skeptic’s interiority is vivid—taste-as-compass literalizes doubt under auroral pressure—yet the renunciation (“I will carry your story”) feels slightly foregone; no visible flaw compounds earlier choice. Still, contradictory impulses (doubt vs. longing) coil inside each micro-taste, and the final cost is felt as the ring’s flavor turns to “alone.”</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of taste-anchors teaches the compass logic early; closure reweights “north” to “us” with undeniable conceptual cost. Orientation locked by line 4; single deepening at the fork tightens companionship as stakes. One transition (bluff → meadow) is legible; final image crystallizes options under auroral hush. Cost is on-page: “taste of alone returns” = forfeiture of solitary certainty.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lavender blades, violet breath, and metallic wind function as micro-setting that actively guides footfall and tongue; the aurora’s “green teeth” combs spatial depth and mirrors the soft ballot-glow of spores. Tool-as-setting (ring) constrains every directional choice; its changing taste map charges the final image. No static postcard—every sensory spike alters tactic or cadence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will the skeptic trust emergent taste over doubt?—tightens once when honey at the fork forecloses solo path. Agency remains observant rather than decisive; Mirelle pacifies the storm, not the narrator. Cost is legible (loss of solitary compass-certainty) but pacifist convergence lessens felt jeopardy; still, the stance crystallizes under choral hush.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of delegated weather-care emerges through ballot-spores and tasted storms; no moralizing, only the reframed pronoun “us” carries the reweighted logic. Final image—aurora thinning like “old tape”—offers quiet conceptual repricing: sky belongs to ground. Ambiguity lingers without confusion; resonance arises from taste-metallic particulars, not assertion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>First-person perceptual signature is unwavering: every abstraction arrives taste-bound (penny, pear, violet, tin). Syntax glides from skeptical clause to lyric cascade without register drift; aurora as “vinyl” and “green teeth” keeps futuristic nostalgia coherent. No head-hop; elisions (“static pop along the aurora”) are pattern-taught and paid off. Dialogue sparse but distinct—Mirelle’s lines carry storm-breath subtext.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Rhythm breathes with scene pulse—short bursts under static pops, longer lyric coils during ballot-count. Metaphors stay physically coherent; no mixed vehicles. One paraphrase loop (“taste of…”) is motif-driven, not artifact. Final third is clean; no scaffold dulls the closing cadence. High density: single lines couple meteorology, politics, and emotion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Taste-as-compass + forest suffrage fuses weather and democracy into a fresh sensory engine; not a checklist hybrid. Risk in lyric density pays off—closure would collapse without gust-counting hush. Synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight; no prior template carries this exact metallic-violet ballot flavor. Slight −0.1 for near-lyric familiarity of aurora trope, but redeemed by gust-bow choreography.</comment>
