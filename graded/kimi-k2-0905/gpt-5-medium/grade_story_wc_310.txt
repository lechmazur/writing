<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The narrator’s interiority is rich, contradictory, and embodied (“I laughed once, startled that certainty should be asked of a randomizer”). The final surrender of the ‘cast lots’ identity is earned by a chain of micro-choices with visible cost (“the old shame of my title fall away”). Minor slip: Sori’s emotional interior is ventriloquised once (“quietly enthusiastic” becomes label-speak in the receiver-tending beat), keeping it just below 9.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Closure is a pristine Conceptual Repricing: the last line reweights the entire premise—static bursts become prayer—with undeniable conceptual cost. Causal lens holds: each coin flip is a because/therefore trigger that reverses the gyros and distills silence. The backwards prophecy pattern is taught by line 6 and paid off in the final instruction; no orientation debt. Propulsive, legible, and tight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The ambered dome functions as micro-setting: its gyro rotation physically constrains the final listening angle, charging the closure image. Coins as planet-objects are tactile, weight-bearing, and re-used (“their faces stitched a pattern”). Sensory hierarchy narrows to touch and sound under crisis. No extraneous astronomical exposition; world-rules emerge through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Single dominant stake—can they tune the universe’s last whisper—tightens with each coin flip that forecloses alternative orientations. Escalation is causal: flip → gyro reversal → noise distillation → silence corridor; each step exacts a visible price (hand steadied, copper still, breathing sync). Cost is felt in the final “shoreless feeling” that the path is now irreversible.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the concrete paradox of surrender as control: randomness becomes the only viable causality in a reversed-time cosmos. The final re-pricing—“understanding static bursts as prayer”—is earned, non-declarative, and charged with ambiguity. No moralizing; the insight is inseparable from the narrator’s relinquished identity. Resonant, non-literal, and haunting.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>First-person singular with stable psychic distance; perceptual signature is coin-weight, metallic chimes, amber viscosity. Syntax flexes from liquid long sentences to staccato flip-reporting under pressure. No head-hopping; Sori’s interior is filtered through the narrator’s observation. Rhythm mirrors the backwards prophecy cadence, taught early and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm is deliberate and varied; no template cadence or synonym loops. Metaphors are consistent (amber, fossilized sap, rainbows from dead worlds) and physically coherent. High information density: one sentence often performs setting, metaphor, and causality. Minor purple flourish (“black dew of stellar doubt”) but it lands within voice limits and never muddles closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: divination via alien coins in a contracting-universe observatory. Backwards-time recipe as plot engine is non-obvious and fully committed to. Risky lyric compression never sacrifices clarity. Specificity of extinct alphabets, square-hole coin, feather-light alloy makes the concept irreplaceable. Transforms trope of coin-flip fatalism into intimate cosmological agency.</comment>
