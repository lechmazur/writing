<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The survivor’s refusal to drown is etched in every micro-gesture: teaching his hands to “speak,” weighting forks with leaves to calibrate emotion, walking the riverbank to true his algorithm. Contradictory impulses—grief for the silent world vs. compulsion to keep making music—coexist inside single beats. The final tableau of walking home “like a lantern” crystallizes Earned Stasis: he forecloses the old audible life yet carries its container, cost felt in the click he cannot hear.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each silent session layers density until the closing “reciprocal quiet” reweights the stake from loss to shared witness. The mirrored heat-grid tightens pattern by turning breath into legible staves; the tuning-fork lattice marks the decisive reconfiguration where wonder is re-priced without sound. Cost is unmistakable: the father’s drowned choir stays absent, the protagonist’s ears stay broken, yet the conservatory’s frost-lines now “wait for meanings,” proving the world can balance even capsized.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Winterglass ribs, ice-limned ferns, and breath-clouds are selective, POV-filtered, and constantly guide micro-action: leaf-weighted forks slow heat-flow, panes herd emotion into ripples. The conservatory’s cold clarity functions as both obstacle and instrument, constraining every gesture. Final lantern image recharges the setting’s rule that light, not sound, will answer.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—translate silence into shareable meaning—tightens when early “wrong readings” blister lilies, forcing him to true the algorithm. The middle beat of walking the riverbank to map frost-to-pulse visibly pays a cost in time & exposure, altering later tactics (leaf weights). Final performance forecloses the old audible world forever; silence remains, but meaning now travels temperature, not air—undeniable price under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>“Unshaken marvels” emerges wordlessly through recurrent frost that refuses to shatter and a moth glowing ember-red inside snowglass. Theme deepens as the crowd’s gratitude warms palms without sound, proving awe survives the hush. The closing “reciprocal quiet” reconfigures the concept: marvel is not restored sound but communal stance toward muteness. No moralizing—just the charged image of a city that “glows in reciprocal quiet.”</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>First-person lyric voice owns a perceptual signature attuned to silence: metaphors of “pocket of stars,” “antlers caught before the strike,” prose rhythms that inhale and exhale like frost. Syntax mirrors pressure—short fragments under cold clarity, longer braided clauses when heat ripples. Compressed diction under stress (“ignites without sound”) stays legible because the pattern is taught early and paid off in the final lantern-walk.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Rare loop-free density: every sentence layers body, tool, or atmosphere while advancing the score-of-heat. Metaphors are precise and non-contradictory—“breath makes small clouds, sensors draw those clouds into a choir of light.” Opening and closing lines anchor voice and re-charge motif without scaffolding. Read-aloud rhythm modulates naturally, mirroring the silent crescendo of light.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade>
<comment>Premise—“after noise becomes impossible, make music with temperature”—is non-obvious yet pursued to conceptual limit: frost-lines become staves, leaves calibrate emotion, silence stays absolute. Risk in lyric accumulative structure pays off because closure reweights silence from privation to shared wonder. Particulars (juniper=regret, birch=patience) make the metaphor-system irreplaceable. Fresh synthesis feels inevitable yet could not survive name-or-place swap.</comment>
