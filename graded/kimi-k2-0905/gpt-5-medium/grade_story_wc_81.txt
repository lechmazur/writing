<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Ossa’s quiet, methodical indexer-voice is consistent and embodied; the stamp-test micro-choices (“I pressed… felt the soft bruise”) externalize motive. Interior contradiction is implied but never dramatized in a second beat, so the final stance feels more asserted than compounded. Still, the occupation-specific lens and the renunciation of “rehearsals” land with visible cost on the breath.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a crisp Resonant Reconfiguration: the generators’ return tries to re-coat the world with hum, yet the reclaimed stillness clings—cost felt in “my breath.” Accumulative lens holds: blackout → stillness → stamp-test → ledgers confess → stance crystallizes. No causal gaps; orientation anchors by line 3; pattern taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Salt-weeping books, barnacled arches, and the bone-dry drawer create a micro-setting that actively resists or yields to Ossa’s fingers; the library’s stone lung governs how sound travels and thus what can be proven. Sensory hierarchy is indexer-specific: smell of ink, texture of sailcloth redactions. Final image of stillness “lacquered onto every spine” reuses setting to charge closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“see which impressions bled true”—is signaled early and tightens when the stamp exposes pre-flood council imports. One meaningful deepening suffices: the registrar’s marginal note reframes the flood as deliberate lowering, foreclosing the “hapless disaster” reading. Cost is legible in the violet crowns on Ossa’s fingers and the library’s irreversible tilt in her mind.</question>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through indexer labor: archival evidence versus performed narrative. Subtext lives in redacted sailcloth and violet ghosts—power conceals, then stains. Final image reweights “stillness” from refuge to weaponized attention. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers about whether truth can surface above tideline.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>First-person perceptual signature is distinct: “logical page indexer” filters every image through cataloguing logic—“pages dry like leaves in a careful wind.” Syntax breathes with caesurae that mimic underwater hush; no register drift. Compression (“a stone lung schooling itself to breathe less”) is taught early and remains legible.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; sentences carry double duty—image + concept—without scaffold. One mixed metaphor cluster (“towers rolled on hidden bearings”) momentarily jars but does not taint closure. No loops, no filter-verb stacks; paragraph cuts are clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sunken-city librarian seeking a truth-stamp is fresh, but the real novelty is the indexer’s epistemic method—gentle suspicion via marginalia and pressure-sensitive paper. Risk lies in lyric stillness over plot, yet it heightens stakes by making silence the only credible witness. Transformation is complete: flood myth becomes civic murder through ledger ink.</comment>
