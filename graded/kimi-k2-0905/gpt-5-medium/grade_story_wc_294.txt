<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The highway-robber’s son remains a consistent sensibility—maps, exits, inherited evasion—but the interiority is more atmospheric than embodied; no micro-choice under pressure exposes a contradictory impulse. The polished calm is repeatedly asserted yet never tested in a beat where it could fail or cost him, so the arc stays flat. Closure image (“the hunted and the hunter trade names”) is evocative, but the absence of a visible behavioral cost keeps the change conceptual, not earned on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: the startup rise-and-fall pattern intensifies density until the final image reweights the premise. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—the circling tire-rut re-casts every map as a trap—felt cost is legible in the abandoned ribbons and the protagonist’s lone lingering. Orientation anchor (who/where) is present by line 3; no penalty. One soft spot: the investor retreat is summarized rather than dramatized, a minor ellipsis that does not break but lightly thins the causality chain.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Environment is vivid, selective, and POV-filtered: salt-flat wind, peeling lion decals, kettle steam in half-lit car. The train itself constrains movement—no hallway escapes, only linear cars—so spatial limits quietly shape tactical choices. Weather and sound (distant trucks, breathing rails) mirror internal dilapidation without overt symbolism. The foreign bills taped above bunks function as micro-setting objects that evolve state and charge the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</question><comment>Dominant stake: can a map ever be an exit rather than a loop? Pressure tightens when metrics-hungry investors arrive, forcing the protagonist to renounce scale and tie territorial ribbons—an on-page renunciation that costs growth capital. The tightening is single but meaningful; options narrow from “next funding round” to “stay with memory’s teeth.” Cost is visible (coders leave, ribbons prove useless), though the beat is compressed into two sentences, muting the visceral punch required for 8.8+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: maps as destiny loops, inheritance as cage. The circling tire-rut image offers a non-literal, resonant answer—escape and pursuit share the same groove—avoiding moralizing. Subtext lives in gesture: ribbon knots as failed spells, paper bills as unclaimed mercy. Final reweighting feels earned because early map-startup imagery is recalled and re-priced at closure, leaving plausible ambiguity about whether any road can ever be new.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>First-person voice sustains a lyric, larcenous cadence—“maps nobody admits were roads,” “passwords that smelled like rain”—distinctive without-purple saturation. Perceptual signature stays consistent: narrator notices exit-signs, currency watermarks, latch-frays—details a robber’s son would weigh. No head-hopping; psychic distance contracts credibly under collapse. Minor rhythm repetitions (“then learned, then tied”) flirt with template cadence but stay within voice-driven pattern, not artifact.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High information density: one sentence often layers map, commerce, and memory. Figurative control is mostly tight; only “ledger of exits, census of places” edges toward stacked metaphors yet remains legible. No filter-verb stacks or paraphrase loops; sentence openings vary, read-aloud rhythm breathes. Proofing is clean; however, two near-synonyms (“polished calm…perceptively calm”) create micro-redundancy that blunts peak beat, preventing 9.0.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Circus-startup hybrid feels fresh yet inevitable: the dilapidated train as accelerator for existential cartography. Ribbons-as-boundary-markers invert typical turf claims into memory spells, a risk that pays off thematically. Emotional specificity—“smelled like rain and passwords”—grounds the concept in lived texture. The circling tire-rut reconfiguration grows from established imagery, satisfying the transformation test, warranting the high-band bonus.</comment>
