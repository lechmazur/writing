<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The beautician-mortician’s contradictory drives—scientific care vs. mystic hope—are alive in every micro-gesture (calming cold skin while planting a “whisper-engine”). Her mentor’s remembered voice and the emerald transfer create a visible cost: she forfeits pure guild orthodoxy, ending “unshaken and remade.” Interiority stays concrete, never drifts to label-speak. Competence balanced with credulity feels lived-in, not schematic.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the balm absorbs the mentor’s last sentence, the chip dims, the narrator is left holding a “seed” that forecloses resurrection yet keeps a shimmer between emptinesses. Causality is interior but causal: because she re-tunes the chip, she harvests the echo that then re-tunes her. Aurora-grotto rules are taught early and obeyed; no teleport of props. Cost is legible in the final image—the sealed, exhausted chip and her remade stance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Skyborne conch-grotto, aurora veins, chip glass, and porcelain tap all constrain tactics: the aurora supplies the “static” the device drinks, the grotto’s isolation prevents outside rescue, the chip’s green kiss is the only possible interface. Sensory hierarchy stays mortician-specific—notice the cooling rails, the mathematical fold of cloths. No extra geographic fat; each detail either enables or limits the ritual. Setting charges the final image: aurora pales but leaves the “shawl of air.”</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“capture one last spark before oblivion”—is signaled by word 30 and tightened once: the radio coughs, the rhythm of mentor’s brush emerges, narrowing option space from pure grief to actual echo harvest. Protagonist’s agency drives every beat: cleaning, placing, tuning, listening, anointing. Cost is paid on-page: her acceptance of non-resurrection plus guild heresy risk. No coincidence; escalation is accumulative intensification of aurora light + static clarity until the final dimming.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of “kindness as bridge across absolute silence” emerges through tactile particulars, never sermon. Final line reweights the whole: spark captured ≠ life restored, but path between emptinesses is lit. Ambiguity is purposeful—reader must decide whether the echo is data or soul—yet emotional after-effect is concrete. No thematic echo sentence; mentor’s maxim arrives as radio fragment, not thesis statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>First-person voice is a mortician-poet: precise anatomical verbs (“lifted lids,” “traced her lips”) married to aurora lyricism (“living veils,” “green fire”). Perceptual signature is consistent—she narrates cold, pulse, porcelain timbre, never aurora physics. Rhythm swells with aurora brightness then subsides as light pales, mirroring emotional arc. No filter-verb stacks; every metaphor is purposeful and paid off (“glass cocoon” returns as “seed”).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet limpid: one sentence often does three jobs (anchors body, advances ritual, textures world). No loops or synonym churn; “aurora” never repeated carelessly. Mixed metaphors avoided—aurora as cloth, circuit as bruise, silence as tuning—each kept coherent. Minor overwrought line “world shiver near that threshold” but it lands at climax and is earned by prior “threshold” seeding; does not muddle.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fusion of mortician craft with aurora necromancy feels freshly specific; no genre template matches. Emerald chip as consent-based after-death recorder is a genuine invention, not rebranded soul-crystal. Risk of lyrical static-listening pays off: reader taught pattern early, hears brush-tap payoff at peak. If swapped to different names/places the ritual collapses—grotto, aurora, and guild orthodoxy are irreplaceable. Concept commits fully, never retreats to metaphor.</comment>
