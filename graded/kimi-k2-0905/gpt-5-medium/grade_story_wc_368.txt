<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>The dye-master’s interior contradiction—curiosity vs. the donor heart’s foreign memory—drives every micro-choice (tilting the wing, shifting tables). Emotions stay embodied: the heart “leans,” the room “holds its breath.” The final renunciation—listening without stealing—grows directly from the wing’s earlier lesson, paying a felt cost: he will keep standing “where colors are almost colors,” forever partial. No stock labels; the voice’s perceptual signature (“broken sapphires,” “quietly explosive beacon”) is inseparable from the character.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the protagonist’s stance crystallizes into “a lighthouse of cups and cloth” that seeds stories outward, forfeiting ownership. Causal chain holds: because the wing teaches iridescent caution, therefore he adjusts posture, re-weighting whose tales stick. Accumulated light-patterning (sun-river, indigo steam) tightens once, foreclosing hoarding. Cost is visible on the page: he accepts perpetual semi-invisibility—“nearly seen”—as the price of guardianship.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>The floating tea-house rocks under every footfall, forcing stools, kettles, and bodies to re-negotiate space; this micro-motion constrains how cups can be placed and tales can settle. Sun-beam “rivers” and cliff-cast angles are tracked with ruler-precision, determining when the wing will flare and whose narrative adheres. The blue morpho wing operates as both tool and setting-fragment: its scales decide social physics inside the single room. Spatial choreography stays clean across the rope-bridge arrivals and the final drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—how to hold stories without bruising them—tightens once: the widow’s borrowed tales nearly scorch, forcing the indigo-steam release that loosens them. Protagonist agency drives the escalation: each tilt of the wing actively re-assigns magnetism. Cost is visible—the courier’s lightning-scars, the widow’s half-shadow burn-risk—altering tactics for later customers. Pressure stays coherent under the Accumulative/Textural lens: density of light-patterning, not external villain, escalates risk.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges irreducibly from the central metaphor: magnetism as disciplined listening posture, not greed. Subtext lives in gesture—tilting the wing half-a-degree, brewing indigo steam—never in thesis statements. The final image reweights the premise: stories are not property but weather, best released “like rain arriving from another century.” No moralizing; the emotional after-effect is a hush that invites the reader to stand likewise “where colors are almost colors.”</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>First-person voice carries a distinct perceptual signature: synesthetic color-sound (“scales whisper gradients”), nautical verbs (“bobbed,” “moorings”), and textile lexis (“silk drank the light”). Rhythm modulates with pressure—long cadences for sun-tracking, staccato arrivals for customers—without template churn. No head-hopping; unreliability surfaces only in the donor heart’s foreign memories, paid off when its gratitude “illuminates a path.” Compression like “valley-mist wonder” is taught early and remains legible at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Information density is high: one sentence often layers dye chemistry, heart memory, and social physics. Metaphors stay mutually reinforcing—light as river, cloth as century-old rain—no mixed vehicles. Minor scaffold: “quietly explosive beacon” risks oxymoron, but the internal contradiction mirrors the protagonist’s restraint/force duality and is earned. No loops or synonym churn; each recurrence (wing, sun-river, indigo steam) accrues new functional weight rather than repeating decoration.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Fusion of donor-heart magical realism with textile science is non-obvious and pursued to logical extreme: a dye house that bleeds stories into civic fabric. The floating tea-house reorients familiar “safe space” into a kinetic lung, transforming trope into stakes. Risk—letting stories migrate rather than hoarding—pays off in the final image of balconies flickering “like water.” Specificity anchors freshness: beetle jar child, twine-wrapped knees, inked knuckles could not transplant to another tale without collapse.</comment>
