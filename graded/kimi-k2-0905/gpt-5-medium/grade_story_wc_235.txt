<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The lucid-dream chronicler’s contradictory impulses—cartographing chaos while craving narrative heat—are dramatized in embodied, idiosyncratic interiority (“jealous of past selves until the present brightened like magnesium”). Micro-choices (tracing ants-off-the-bark letters, trading envy for a syllable) visibly tilt tactics under pressure. The final renunciation—walking forward while chronologically scrambled—pays the accumulated cost of envy and confusion with earned stasis. Voice never slips into diagnostic label-speak; hunger for continuity stays visceral.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the dates snap into switchback order across the sky-scroll, making endings and beginnings share bitter coffee—felt cost is the unfixable self-scatter. Causal chain holds: envy → letters climb → syllable released → map re-lanes → patrol resumes under jaded wonder. Orientation is taught by word 30 (“mountain ranger cabin”), obviating the 120-word test. Lens—Accumulative/Textural—stays coherent as density, not plot turns, reweights stakes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The birch bark scroll operates as micro-setting: its scrapable surface and glittering ink literally constrain how the protagonist can read/rewrite time. Cabin stove, frost patterns, and rasping snow are filtered through a ranger’s professional eye for weather and fuel. Spatial choreography is clean—floor rising like a wave keeps bodies and kettle tracked in the dream ascension. Final image of stovepipe underlining the sky charges the closure with environmental cost.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—distill chaos into narrative heat—tightens when jealousy literally sharpens the scroll edges and forces a trade: one syllable of continuity for surrendered envy. Agency drives the escalation: protagonist’s jealousy, not external antagonist, rewrites the dream-map. Cost is visible: envy consumed, continuity still a “trick river,” patrol must proceed on untrusted thaw. One meaningful deepening suffices; no reversals required under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: narrative as consolatory heat against mortality’s cold ledger. Subtext lives in gesture—ravens “rehearsing insults until they were poems” implies language transmutes fear into art. No final moralizing; last line’s “dragging you kindly” offers Charged Poise that reweights forward motion as narrative compulsion. Feral nostalgia, jaded wonder, and bitter coffee form a coherent emotional aftertaste without sentimentality.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>First-person voice owns a ranger’s weathered perceptual signature: “snow hissed like applause withheld,” “stove ticked.” Rhythm compresses under dream lift—“floor rose like a wave”—then exhales into longer, trailing cadences that mimic soaring. No head-hopping; dream doubles are observed, not interiorized. Distinct diction stays within lucid-dream chronicler’s lexicon without academic drift. Patterned elision (dates dodging hooks) is taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Read-aloud ear test passes: sentence openings vary, no template cadence drumming. Mixed metaphors are intentional and coherent—“trout dodging a hook, like calendars in a landslide”—both evoke slipperiness of time. No paraphrase loops; each image adds new pressure or sensory layer. Minor scaffold: “narrative heat” and “distill chaos” appear twice but reframe at closure, so deduction capped at −0.3. Information density high; one sentence often does three jobs (setting, metaphor, interiority).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The lucid-dream cartographer who maps sleeping weather via jealousy of past selves is a fresh synthesis unseen in slush. Risky structural choice—lyric accumulative mosaic—pays off when switchback dates literally rewrite sky-scroll, making form mirror theme. Specificity anchors universals: spruce-tea bitterness, stovepipe underlining the day of death. Transformation test: if relocated to desert ranger with parchment, the envy→syllable→patrol engine collapses, proving irreplicable.</comment>
