<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s barefoot awkward confidence, opera-glass ritual, and circuit-closing gesture embody a believable interior contradiction; the hum she courts is both filial and political, so her choice to broadcast the map lands as earned cost. The absence of any second on-page character keeps relational/status dynamics off the table, but her micro-choices—kneeling, speaking to stones, skin-bridging the circuit—trace a visible hierarchy of values. Reflection stays anchored to present stimuli and tilts choices; no stock epiphanies. Only the father’s disappearance is summarized, not dramatized, keeping the backstory fraction just under the 20 % ceiling, so the flaw is a hairline, not a break.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the star-map projection reweights the colony’s “lull” from despair to navigable possibility, and the cost—Mara’s exposure of the Lark’s survival—lands on the page. Causal linkage holds throughout: because she listens, therefore she finds the ring; because she bridges it, therefore the bay answers; because the map burns gold, therefore the rebellion can reorient. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 3 and tighten at the shuttle carcass; no disorientation survives to closure. One shard, one POV, one transitionless scene—scope defaults met; the hum-as-drive pattern is taught early and repaid in the final banner of light.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The repair bay breathes, rusts, and then projects starlight—the setting actively constrains and finally enables the climax. Sensory economy is biased through Mara’s stargazer eye: orbital chalk, deck vibrations, the cold regularity of black stones—all filtered, never catalogued. Spatial choreography is immaculate; barefoot contact tracks every tremor. The “margin of daylight” timeframe is both literal and symbolic, tightening the decision window without ever announcing itself.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—“where did the Lark go?”—is signaled by beat 4 and tightened when Mara stakes her skin against the stones. The escalation is accumulative: each hum thickens the density of possibility until the map’s projection narrows the colony’s options from rage to orientation. Cost is visible: she risks alerting the silencers yet forfeits secrecy to share the coordinates. No external antagonist appears, but the blockade’s shadow supplies coherent situational pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Meaning emerges as the courage to ask a silent machine the right question and accept its answer; the theme is never sloganized. The opera glasses evolve from quaint relic to proof of alignment, reweighting “meaning” from private ritual to public navigation. Subtext lives in gesture: barefoot contact, stone breath, map fire—no narrator gloss needed. The ending image refuses moral comfort; the rebellion may still fail, but orientation is now irreversible.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Mara’s perceptual signature—rust as constellations, grief as mineral hum. Syntax flexes with pressure: elongated vowel cadences during discovery, then clipped declaratives when the map burns. No dialogue, so voice contamination is impossible. The elevated diction (“leviathan,” “chronology”) is justified by her stargazer lexicon and remains consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm alternates between tidal long sentences and deliberate fragments; no template cadence survives past line 2. Metaphors (ring as sky, hum as grief) are singular and internally coherent; no mixed vehicles. Information density peaks when one sentence fuses tool, body, and circuit: “She set the glasses… closed the circuit with skin.” Micro-scaffold appears only once—“barefoot and sure” echoes the opening—but occurs after climax, so closure remains untouched.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The stone-circle-as-calibration-altar repurposes prehistoric trope into spaceport tech, fused through barefoot astronomer rather than shaman. The opera glasses—antique, not AR lenses—provide a fresh sensory bridge between scrapyard and starfield. Risk is taken: lyric accumulation instead of gunfire climax, yet coherence holds. Without Mara’s specific barefoot hum, the rebellion reorientation would collapse; the synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
