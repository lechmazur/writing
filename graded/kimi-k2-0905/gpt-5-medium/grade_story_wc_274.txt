<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The archivist’s contradictory drives—preservation vs. liberation—are embodied in the micro-choice to warm the seal with his own breath and later to thread the letter through the ducts. Interiority stays concrete (“I could taste heat”) and the final renunciation of certainty (“I did not know if I had preserved it or set it free”) carries visible cost. The only bar to 9+ is that the external stakes never quite pierce the lyric veil; the city remains a silhouette rather than a second character pressing back.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Charged Poise: the city wakes “strangely rested,” the bench “forgot to be a bench,” and the library holds its breath with the narrator—an undeniable reconfiguration of meaning with conceptual cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each image (frost, duct, camera glitch) layers until the quiet itself is re-priced. Causality is lyric but traceable: because he releases the letter, therefore the glances bend and the plaza footage refuses to be clipped. The persistent constraint—his erased future as archivist—shapes every tactical hesitation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The library’s cryogenic hush is not backdrop but tool: frost “furs the brass,” ducts “cough awake,” and the return slot literally routes the decisive act. Micro-setting (the glass case, the reset grid at midnight) constrains the only possible method of transmission. Weather presses against the panes until the aisles “ring,” charging the final image of shared breath. Environment, body, and tool converge to make the closure possible—meets the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—whether the archive will keep or free the dangerous knowledge—is signaled in the first paragraph and tightens through each sensory layer. The single meaningful turn occurs at the midnight grid reset when the narrator feeds the letter into the dormant conduit; this irreversible act forecloses his professional identity. Cost is legible: frost blooms across the case “like a curtain call,” a visual forfeiture of certainty. Pressure accumulates rather than spikes, fitting the lyric mode yet still narrowing options to one seam in time.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Theme—archiving as an act of love versus control—emerges from the braid of maintenance logs and endearments, never abstractly stated. The final image of the bench remembering itself as a rendezvous reweights every prior mention of “appearances” and “blank snow,” delivering conceptual repricing without moralizing. Subtext lives in the grammar of infrastructure: voltage, backups, blind switches. The story trusts the reader to feel the political thaw inside the technical silence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Voice is crystalline, frost-bitten, and consistent: short, percussive nouns (“knife-sharp,” “clock pulses”) mimic the archivist’s clipped caution. Compression like “snow cooks silence differently” teaches the reader the lyric pattern early and pays it off in the final hush. No head-hopping; perceptual signature remains strictly bounded by what a lone custodian can see, hear, or breathe. The rhythm accelerates during the duct insertion, then exhales into the longer sentence of morning—precise control under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Every sentence performs at least two jobs: “Pipes hissed beneath the aisles where frost furred the brass like patient moss” advances atmosphere, stakes, and tactile logic simultaneously. Figurative language is sparse enough to avoid purple drift, yet each metaphor is non-interchangeable (footage “refused to be clipped” personifies the system’s newfound agency). Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; no filter-verb stacks. The final line—“The echoing library under snow held its breath with me”—earns its quiet cadence by releasing all prior sonic imagery.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>The fusion of cryogenic archive, clandestine infrastructure map, and epistolary romance feels inevitable yet unseen before. Risk—releasing a story whose climax is a city’s altered gait rather than an explosion—pays off because the text teaches the reader how to read that subtle revolution. Specificity of the blind switch in the civic plaza and the microfiche return duct prevents the premise from drifting into allegory. The synthesis is so integrated that swapping any core node would collapse the entire lattice.</comment>
