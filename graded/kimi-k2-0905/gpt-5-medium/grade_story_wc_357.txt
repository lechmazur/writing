<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Interiority is lush and embodied; the pilot’s perceptions of sap-glow and echo-grammar feel idiosyncratic. Contradictory impulses—awe versus duty, fear of inversion versus hunger to know—co-exist in-scene. The arrow-tip micro-choices (drawing, touching, binding) trace a credible value hierarchy. Only the grandmother’s backstory edges toward label-speak (“she swore it sang”), but the metal’s later hum re-anchors it in present sensation.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the fused heart/arrow planted beneath the repaired drum reweights the premise—resilience is propagative, not defensive. Cost is legible in the pilot’s vow to “listen each inversion,” a life-long servitude. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: cadence of water, echo, sap tightens until the spindle releases a “breath of water inside light.” No causal breaks; every inversion rule is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Environment is not backdrop but navigational instrument: the floating arches chafe roots, redirect water, force trajectory recalculation. Micro-setting—the hollow grove’s sap-gleam—constrains the final choice (only here can spindle be harvested). Sensory economy favors taste and sound over visual catalog. Spatial choreography tracks the pilot’s vine-harness glide without drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“find the source of resilience”—tightens when the stream stalls for the arrow-tip test, foreclosing retreat. Escalation is Accumulative: each echo, drip, and leaf-ring adds density until the spindle image crystallizes. Cost is conceptual but undeniable: perpetual tending of echoes becomes the price of growth. One meaningful intensification suffices; no reversals needed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from inverted physics: resilience is not resistance but fluent re-orientation. The final image—arrow bound to heart, soil drinking remembered rain—reweights “strength” as porous listening. No explicit moral; the grammar of drips replaces sermon. Ambiguity lingers: will orchard or pilot break first? Complexity honored.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</question>
<comment>Perceptual signature is synesthetic and liquid: “whirling silence folds sound into velvet,” “sap gleams like starlight in honey.” Syntax elongates then fragments to mimic water braiding, never drifting into committee voice. Register stays inside a pilot-poet’s lexicon; no academic intrusion. Patterned repetition (“drip to drop, drop to pool”) is taught early and pays off in closure cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Line-level craft is near-flawless: high information density, zero paraphrase loops, metaphors cohere (waterways, resin spindle, resin threads). One micro-slip: “rain promised but not yet paid” edges toward personification convenience, but the mercantile frame fits the planet’s barter logic. Rhythm accelerates into the spindle release, then exhales with the landing—no artifact touches closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Inversion-hour orchard planet feels inevitable yet unexampled: gravity-defiant agriculture rendered through water-flow navigation and echo-grammar. The broken arrow tip as resilience seed is fresh synthesis, not gimmick. Risk—lyric accretion risking opacity—heightens meaning without obscuring closure. Transformation test: story collapses if setting or object swapped.</comment>
