<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The alchemist’s interior contradiction—“hands do not tremble / heart hears everything”—is sustained in embodied action (palm pressed to grate, hair packed inside crozier). Micro-choices (salt pinch, slower bellows, final snap) trace a credible arc from obedience to self-immolation. Cost is felt: skin to heat, ash in lungs, bishop’s authority reduced to embered question mark. Missing second character keeps relationship crucible dormant, capping at 8.6.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Causal lens holds: each approximation (salt, air, bellows) tightens options until the crozier’s snap becomes the decisive hinge. Closure is a Decisive Change with visible cost—palm blistering, crozier reduced to ash, gate opening. Orientation clean: who/where/when anchored by line 3; “ember nexus at twilight” instantly grounds. No off-stage resolution; every escalation sourced to protagonist agency.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Furnace breathing, warm-penny air, ash grate—details are filtered through alchemical POV and constrain every tactical nudge. Micro-setting (crozier’s spiral, coals’ conspiracy) doubles as tool and terrain, charging the final image. Spatial choreography tight: crozier rolled, slid, snapped, fed—no impossible moves. Slight over-reliance on visual; other senses underplayed, keeping below 8.8 gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Single dominant stake—interrupt stifling destiny—signaled early and tightened through each approximation. Escalation causal: every nudge loses safety margin until the crozier’s destruction forecloses return to guild obedience. Price paid on-page: burnt palm, forfeited relic, exile into blue air. Could use one earlier external obstacle to push score into 9+ band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Creative destruction emerges through concrete acts (charcoal, salt, snapped staff) rather than thesis. Final “hinge not miracle” line offers Conceptual Repricing—reweights obedience as merely mechanical, self-immolation as door. Frozen-bloom motif returns in the cold flower that does not wilt, recharging windowpane memory. No moralizing; ambiguity (is the bloom real or principle?) lingers with cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>First-person voice maintains a precise alchemical register: “warm pennies,” “embered question mark,” “glass that cannot hold a seed.” Syntax mirrors process—initial long sentences coil like the crozier, then fracture in sync with the snap. No dialogue, so no convergence risk. Minor over-alliteration in “breath held on a winter tongue” but rhythm stays purposeful.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Density high: “ashes sighed… exhaling a vow” carries three jobs—sound, motion, intention. No synonym loops; each metaphor extends the alchemical lexicon. One mixed image—“fireflies with broken maps”—momentarily muddles physics but pays off in emotional disorientation. Final third clean; no artifacts touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Alchemy-as-destiny-interruption feels fresh; the crozier transformed from staff of authority into tuning fork for personal gate is non-obvious. Risky lyric compression (“penny drops” as both idiom and literal weight) lands without clarity loss. Specificity throughout—salt, bellows, hair—prevents generic “rebelling apprentice” template. Hindsight inevitability: every image feeds the hinge.</comment>
