<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The chronicler’s vocation is embodied in every perception; the inland decision is earned through a credible, cost-bearing arc. Interior contradiction—comfort vs. growth—plays out in micro-gestures with the cicada. Relationship pressure is subtle but present; the partner’s silent waiting sharpens the choice. No diagnostic label-speak; the voice stays idiosyncratic and sea-salt specific.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: the pause itself becomes the tightening unit; star-fed hinges reweight stakes without causal plot turns. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Charged Poise—as the “Yes” extends the coastline into shared inland territory; cost is the foreseeable bruise of adaptation. Orientation is immediate: grotto, lantern, ankles in tide within 50 words. No lens ambiguity; pattern taught early and held.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Grotto, lantern-light, cicada, and ankle-licking tide function as micro-setting that constrains the final choice: the grotto’s hush literally prevents hasty speech, forcing tangential cognition. Every sensory pick is filtered through chronicler bias—barnacles read like archives. The jade cicada’s weight and seam are re-emphasized at the hinge moment, charging the closure image. Spatial choreography is immaculate; bodies never ghost.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—stay coastal or migrate inland while staying us—is signaled in line 3 and deepens through three envisioned futures that narrow to a single irrevocable “Yes.” Pressure escalates by accretion: each imagined year adds texture of loss until silence becomes unbearable. No external antagonist needed; internal conflict and relationship stakes suffice. Cost is legible: the coastline will bruise, arguments will compact, yet they choose anyway.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of transition-as-continuity emerges through cicada molting and tide-turn imagery rather than statement. Final image—“arch…finally passable”—reweights the pause from paralysis to portal without moralizing. Subtext in shared silence and star-fed hinges invites reflection on how time is textured by attention. No thematic echo in final paragraph; resonance stays imagistic.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>First-person voice is tidal—long swells of syntax, then short foam-crests—mirroring the chronicler’s perceptual rhythm. Diction stays within a marine naturalist’s lexicon; no register drift. Cicada handling and lantern-light tilts serve as embodied beats that advance knowledge. No dialogue needed; silence is voiced through cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm is organic; sentence openings vary, paragraphs breathe. Figurative density is high but patterned early—coastline topography, star-fed hinges—so it earns its lyric stretch. No mixed metaphors or simultaneity errors. One paraphrase loop: “tide ebbing, tide turning” adjacent to “tidepool…reflective” costs −0.2, but closure image remains lucid.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: using marine fieldwork methodology as relationship negotiation model feels inevitable yet unseen before. Risk in real-time decision inside a static pause pays off via accumulative lyricism. No derivative premise; mentor’s cicada and star-fed hinges are particular to this narrator. Transformation test fails if names change—voice and vocation are inseparable.</comment>
