<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>A reticent scholar whose interiority is rendered in lyric, embodied detail—scars, breath, tilt of memory—earns his climactic “testimony” as a renunciation of speech itself; the refusal is legible and costly. No contradictory impulses appear in-scene, so the 9+ quick test fails, but the single-character crucible sustains. The arc is credible stasis rather than change, fitting the inferred Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of sonic returns from the crystal thickens meaning rather than causal reversals. Orientation is anchored by word 30; closure is a Charged Poise—the tilted crystal’s final hum reweights all prior cards. Cost is felt in the image of “forgiving ache of healed mistakes,” foreclosing the printers’ demand for a new volume. No lens ambiguity; one minor scaffold (“he lifts the crystal, from chandelier” paraphrase) keeps it sub-9.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Library-as-body: rafters, dust constellations, angle between shelves constrain posture and acoustic choice; crystal as micro-setting literally refracts the stakes. Dawn light across glass is not backdrop but the tool that makes the suspended hush visible. The final image could not exist without this exact spatial geometry; 9+ gate met.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prove growth still speaks after dictionaries end—tightens once: crystal’s crack refuses to echo, forcing the scholar to write ratios instead of words. Escalation is density-driven, not causal; the “river reversing under ice” moment deepens rather than narrows options. Cost is conceptual (world loses new words) yet felt; visible price would require higher band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of language’s migration emerges through sonic metaphor: crystal = archive of lost utterances. Subtext in silence—hinges apologize, pages fought back—carries more weight than any spoken line. Final image reweights premise: grammar of tending, not volumes, is the only immortal lexicon. No moralizing; resonance is purely imagistic and earned.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person lyric achieves perceptual signature: selective attention to “map of small scars,” “dust becomes constellations,” syntax mirrors scholar’s reticence—compressed, elliptical. Rhythm swells with emotional intensity, then recedes into hush; no head-hop. Filter verbs (“he thinks”) are voice-motivated, not scaffolding. Distinct diction stays within scholar’s plausible lexicon while remaining musically memorable.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density—every sentence layers sensory, conceptual, and emotional work; no paraphrase loops. Figurative risk is high but justified: “language climbed into the rafters” pays off at closure. One mixed metaphor (“river reversing under ice”) is momentarily strained yet forgivable under lyric license. Rhythm breathes with scene tempo; no template cadence. Proof clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</question><comment>Premise—“after the last dictionary” growth must be heard, not defined—is fresh, non-obvious. Crystal-as-sonic-archive transforms familiar object into listening device; risk heightens stakes without gimmickry. Final reconfiguration (“volumes are not the point”) feels inevitable yet un-predicted. Emotional specificity avoids pseudo-profundity; vision coheres as single stance.</comment>
