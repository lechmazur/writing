<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The designer’s embodied, salt-and-petal alchemy feels idiosyncratic; Lark’s soot-smudged quiet drums against adult competence. Interior contradiction shows when the designer filters memory yet hoards risk. The knot-hand-off crystallizes a status shift and visible cost: Lark’s nascent agency, the designer’s relinquished control. Micro-choices (sniffing rag, singing counts) keep motives visceral; no epiphany speech blunts arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: final braid of ash-soot and chant reweights the “gravity of hopelessness” without sermon. Causal chain: mosaic-note → tool-finding → salt recipe → fused cord → sky Reply holds because each step disables retreat (rag knot tied again = cost). Cost is visible in keeper’s straightened spine and flowering walls—an undeniable conceptual repricing. Lens (Causal) holds start-to-finish; orientation anchored by dusk arrival inside 120 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Micro-setting supremacy: the rag knot, mortar pockets, jasmine waterfall, and soot-seeds are handled, sniffed, braided—objects that constrain choreography and color choices. “Blue wave” shard at base of wall literally guides mortar placement; environment writes the score. Sensory hierarchy obeys fireworks pro: smell before color, wind funnels before bloom. Tool-as-setting meets 9+ gate: final image of retelling blooms depends on ash that mortar placement enabled.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><line>Dominant stake—“defy the gravity of hopelessness”—is signaled in para 2 and escalates through each fuse step. One meaningful tightening: lighting the knotted cord irreversibly commits both characters to public proof. Cost legible: fortress residents exposed to hopeful display they haven’t requested, Lark risking uncle’s memory, designer risking reputation on one flammable breath. Escalation causal, single reversal sufficient; no coincidence required.</line>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges from ash-fertilized blooms: serious play as resistance. Subtext in gesture (stooped keeper straightens) not lecture. Final image of vines “retell this note” reweights mosaic instruction as living score—conceptual repricing rather than moral. Avoids pat uplift; acknowledges gravity persuaded, not vanquished.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyrical first-person sustains rhythmic chant cadence that modulates with fuse pace, mirroring internal metronome. Diction—“measuring the air with my feet”, “polite as a messenger with wild news” —stays inside designer’s kinetic sensorium. No head-hop; Lark’s voice filtered through designer ears. Filter verbs justified by professional sensory triage, not clutter. Stress-compressed syntax in lighting beat (“flame walked the cord”) heightens tempo without losing clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm mimics fuse burn: longer vegetative clauses then crackling fragments. Metaphors disciplined—moonflowers as “listening mouths” stays vegetal, not mixed. No scaffold/loop; each sentence advances color, route, or character stake. Minor density overload in “salt and powdered petals, ground with mortar and joy” but resolved within two beats and pattern-taught. Proofing clean, tense stable, pronoun track perfect.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: fireworks craft as liturgy against starless despair. Ordinary rag knot transfigured into time-fuse without fantasy cheats. Specificity—kerosene sniff, petal salt blues—grounds novelty. Risk of lyric overwriting accepted and paid off in reader-visible bloom-ash cycle. Premise feels inevitable post-read, not gimmicky.</comment>
