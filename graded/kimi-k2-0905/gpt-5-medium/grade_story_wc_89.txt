<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The narrator’s interiority is richly concrete—‘a tide keeps pulling at the ribs where Mira once pressed her night-warm thumbs’—and the metamorphosis is credibly reluctant, but the bond-with-the-dead motive is stated more than it is pressured by on-page contradictions; still, the final surrender of voice carries visible cost, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the narrator becomes a ‘passage’ and loses plain speech, paying the promised price; the Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout—each spice, breath, and beast-circle thickens the ritual until the final braided-air image crystallizes the new state with undeniable cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The orchard is never catalogued; instead, ‘apples shining like moons within the moon’ and ‘beasts with velvet feet’ supply micro-setting that actively guides the ritual—every sensory detail is filtered through the narrator’s spell-bound priorities and charges the final image where scent-keeper breath becomes the new orchard language.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—restore Mira or lose self—tightens when the orchard demands ‘change and a drip that means loss’; the protagonist’s agency drives the escalation (choosing to open the rib-seam) and the visible price is the forfeiture of human speech, meeting the 8.8+ band test.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: the cost of keeping love present is becoming its medium; the final fortune-revision to ‘Stay if you become what you both need’ reweights the premise without moralizing, offering a Conceptual Repricing that makes the loss of voice the unavoidable toll of eternal reunion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric-accumulative, taught by the first clause (‘After the phoenix rises…’) and held to the last; diction stays within the conjurer’s lexicon, syntax lengthens and contracts with ritual breath, and no head-hop breaks the single focalization—perceptual signature is unmistakably ‘grammar of breathing with things that do not breathe.’</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm is incantatory yet varied; sentences shift from short beats (‘I choose the first’) to spiralling anaphora (‘Cumin for laughter…’) without template drift; every line advances spell or atmosphere; no mixed metaphors or paraphrase loops—closure image is pristine.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The phoenix-orchard-death-union fusion feels inevitable yet un-precedented; scent as post-mortem syntax is a fresh inflection that reframes grief as inhalation, and the narrator’s self-liquefaction into orchard breath is bold risk that heightens stakes without gimmickry—transformation test passes: no swap of names or places could yield the same effect.</comment>
