<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction pulses—“refusing the tidy raft the market offered” vs. the shell’s whispered patience—yet the renunciation to “start arranging permission” is earned by the river pact and costs the safe ladder of triumphs. Embodied emotion stays sharp: chill “articulate around my knees,” shell “throbbing like a pocketed star.” Micro-choices (wading, pocketing emblems, stepping out) trace a hierarchy of values—art over commerce—without diagnostic label-speak. One hairline slip: the grandmother/midwife/courier parade drifts toward cameo labels rather than full crucible pressure, capping at 8.7.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the protagonist chooses the river’s “footsteps and pauses,” foreclosing the market path with the felt cost of “closing pages turning above me.” Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout—density of emblem-offerings reweights the stake until the contrary thread becomes legible. Orientation is taught by line 4 (“who, where, when” anchored in twilight mist at the nexus). No causality breaks; every emblem (letter, note, star-map) is causally offered and carried forward.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The spiral shell micro-setting constrains the final choice—its “forever hallway” image charges the closing permission architecture. Selective sensory triage—“rust reeds scratched the air,” “soft iron hymns”—mirrors the hush without tourist catalog. Weather (mist, chill) actively shapes the wading decision and visibility pocket. Spatial choreography holds: path braids river, reeds, rails; no impossible positions.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—artistic integrity vs. marketable raft—signals early and tightens when the contrary river-thread offers only “footsteps and pauses.” The midpoint acceptance of emblems (letter, note, star-map) narrows options: once taken, the market ladder is foreclosed. Cost is visible—physical chill, emblem weight, and the sky’s “binding wider than rules.” One minor slack: external antagonistic pressure remains abstract (mist, market) rather than personified, keeping escalation just under 9.0.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: art must collect “quiet forms that can stand when the waves of fashion withdrew.” Subtext lives in gesture—courier’s upstream letter, empty violin that fills with wind—never sermon. Final image of “closing pages turning above me” reweights the premise without moralizing. No thematic echo or platitude; ambiguity lingers about whether the forms will survive, satisfying complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>First-person lyric voice sustains a perceptual signature—“breath itself were undecided,” “river within the river”—taught early and paid off in the spiral hallway. Rhythm modulates: longer cadences for mist, clipped fragments for emblem exchanges. No head-hopping; knowledge stays strictly bound to the novelist’s sensorium. Compression (“I did not write them; I let them speak”) is purposeful, keeping immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Sentences carry double duty—description plus stakes: “the chill articulate around my knees” advances both body and decision. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn; each metaphor extends the water/ink nexus. One near-purple phrase—“bee bright” note—survives because the pattern teaches synesthetic color earlier. Closure line “I wrote them as they wanted to live” is lean, propulsive, artifact-free.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise fuses artistic crisis with liminal geography; the “feral nexus” feels fresh, not recycled. Risk of abstract allegory is countered by tactile shell, reeds, freight hymns—specifics that prevent template drift. The inversion of upstream motion against market current offers a non-obvious angle on the familiar “writer vs. commerce” trope. Transformation test fails if names/places swapped, confirming originality.</comment>
