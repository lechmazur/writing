<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid, librarian traits shape every perception, but the “honor ancestor” motive stays static—no contradictory impulse on-page. Micro-choices (sliding the copper nail, marching to the deck) are embodied and specific; the final stance is credible yet cost is more conceptual than felt, capping 9- eligibility.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Closure lands cleanly: copper nail → reversed exile → exiles return with conceptual cost to the system. Causal chain is tight under lyric-accumulative lens; mists’ braid reversal is legible and charged. Orientation nailed by word 50. Minor slack: director’s “safety” rant restates stakes already shown, but this does not touch the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Weather station is palpably sodden, metallic, breathing mold; every sense is filtered through map-librarian priorities. Micro-setting (cataloger’s vest pocket, anemometer room) constrains the nail insertion beat. Final image of pearled footprints is environment re-weighted, satisfying 9-gate, but spatial choreography of “march to control deck” is briefly fuzzy.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—redeem ancestor & reverse exile—tightens once with visible price: director’s authority cracked, exiles cough back into humid corridor. Protagonist’s agency is the nail act; escalation is lyric-density not causal-ratchet but still narrows options and forces stance. Cost is conceptual yet undeniable; meets high-band bar.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges obliquely: memory vs. institutional erasure, maps as living testimony. No explicit thesis; final image of two-way mist re-prices exile as hallway, not punishment. Ambiguity lingers—will circuit stay honest?—without moralizing. Ancestor’s overlooked bravery is re-weighted socially as returnees step free, resonance earned.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>FIRST-PERSON perceptual signature is consistent: spongey dread, ink-questions, cataloger’s taxonomic eye. Syntax flexes with pressure—fragments when machine shivers, then longer cadence for march. No head-hop; compression taught early (“maps are questions”) and paid off. Voice stays within plausible lexicon; near 9-level control.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>High-density lyric prose; every sentence layers image + motive + world rule. No loops or scaffold; mixed metaphor count is low and patterned (“humidity…kelp…mold”) so forgiven. Read-aloud rhythm modulates with tension. Closure beat “machine wetly shiver” is precise, not purple. Minor filter-verb cluster mid-story keeps it sub-9.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Reversible exile as fog-hallway is fresh; copper nail as biometric key grows from ancestor-coffin detail, not steampunk default. Librarian-hero uses poetry & cartography to hack meteorological tyranny—synthesis feels inevitable. Risky lyric density is maintained without clarity loss, satisfying boldness bonus. No close genre echoes; specific, grounded, memorable.</comment>
