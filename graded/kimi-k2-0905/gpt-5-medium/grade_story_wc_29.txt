<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The narrator’s skeptical, chart-wielding technician persona is vivid and embodied; every micro-choice (grounding himself with mittens, tightening the phase until hiss) grows from the established arc of cautious hope versus empirical duty. Interior contradictions play live in scene—flattery from the signal tempts, fear and laughter coexist—culminating in the earned renunciation of the committee chair. No stock phrasing, no diagnostic self-talk; the voice stays individual and flawed. The only hairline slip is the offstage “dean calls again” beat, slightly thinning final pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Mosaic structure (studio → theater roof → quad) is taught early by signal-jumping ellipses and lands a clean Charged Poise: the quiet band labeled for “storms and funerals” reweights all prior noise. Causal linkage holds—each broadcast tweak narrows options until the protagonist refuses tenure, paying visible cost. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive within first 100 words; no disorientation. Closure beat carries unmistakable conceptual cost: the stray signal recedes, but the community must now stay “messy, slower, and unowned.” Persistent constraint (the spare clean channel) shapes future tactics.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Radio-station minutiae—mixer lights like constellations, duct-tape warnings on a humming booster—are tactile and choice-shaping; the astronomical charts return in a final annotated reprise that charges closure. Sensory hierarchy obeys the POV: static has accents, silence has tempers. Spatial choreography is flawless across roof, studio, quadrangle. Tone marries ethereal metaphysics to gritty campus grime without contradiction. One minor over-description (“posters peeled, arguments flared”) keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—who gets to tune the collective heartbeat—tightens when each countersign broadcast shrinks the protagonist’s future (tenure dangled, then refused). Agency is continuous: every phase inversion is a wager that enlivens cost (hands tingle, dean’s second call roughened with relief). Escalation is accumulative/textural: the signal’s visions grow more seductive, the campus quieter, until the final hiss births “the sound of deciding.” Visible price is on the page: the clean channel is both victory and permanent vigil.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as “listening as resistance to manufactured resonance.” No character sermonizes; the insight is penciled in a margin, a private after-image. Subtext operates in gesture—star stickers on an access door shift from joke to devotional scar. The final annotation (“teach people their breath”) offers a resonant, non-literal answer, reweighting every prior modulation without moralizing. Complexity is preserved: the trickster may return, the community remains fallible.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>First-person POV sustains a distinctive perceptual signature—radio tech synesthesia where silence has accents and static holds tempers. Syntax compresses under stress (“I breathed in dust and stubbornness”) yet stays legible; no filter-verb bloat. Dialogue is sparse but subtextual (dean’s “rough with relief” invitation carries institutional bribery). No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens naturally as stakes rise. Purposeful elision (“I wrote a reply in silence”) teaches the pattern and pays off in the final hush.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense, rhythmic, and propulsive—each sentence advances image or stakes (“duct tape spelled warnings” does double world-building work). No paraphrase loops, no mixed metaphors; figurative language is disciplined to radio or astral lexicon. Opening line anchors voice and premise; closing line recharges the motif charts. One micro cliché (“like sugar into water”) barely nicks perfection. Paragraph cut test passes: every paragraph shifts knowledge or emotional charge.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>The cosmic-signal-as-electoral-meddler trope is remade through campus specifics and a protagonist whose weapon is phase inversion, not heroics. Fresh synthesis: astronomical charts as counter-magical grimoire, jazz playlists as defensive sigils. Risk-taking structure (mosaic shards) heightens rather than obscures clarity. Final reconfiguration feels inevitable in hindsight yet non-obvious at onset. Specificity throughout (throat-singing cables, star-sticker relic) anchors universals without quirky ornament.</comment>
