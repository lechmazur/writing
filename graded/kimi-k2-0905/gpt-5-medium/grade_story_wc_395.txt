<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The narrator’s obsessive archivist persona is vivid—embodied in the flashlight metaphor and the illicit deep-dive—but the interior contradiction (risking job vs. loyalty to Aida) is asserted more than dramatized in-scene; the final choice to “reroute the stream” is credible yet compressed, so the cost is felt but not fully gut-punched.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: lie → vault → Driftwood → Sink → exposure; each node tightens options. The “lyric challenge” gate and the recovered diary-in-code deliver a clear Decisive Change with visible job-risk cost. Closure lands on-page (“I chose voice”) and reconfigures the hush into surf—Resonant Reconfiguration earned.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Micro-setting is the cold-server vault and the Sink’s song-gate—both tactile, smell-of-old-servers, node-ID-lit; the embroidered patch doubles as macro-and-micro setting, charging the final image. Spatial clarity is clean; no orientation debt. The “echo of forgotten songs” acts as both temporal and spatial texture, constraining the lyric key ritual.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recover Aida’s erased voice—signaled early; pressure escalates via policy walls, doxx threats, and the Sink ritual. One meaningful tightening: the lyric challenge moment forecloses retreat. Cost is legible: job security and corporate hush money forfeited; no safety net shown.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme—memory vs. corporate erasure—emerges through the patch, playlists, and Driftwood file rather than exposition. Final image (“surf answering”) non-literally reweights the lie into public resurrection. Avoids moralizing; ambiguity lingers in “still counting.” Minor tick: “largest lie was policy” leans toward articulation, but absorbed in voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>First-person archivist voice is distinct—selective metaphors (beach sweepers, flashlight in drawer), compressed tech idiom (“node IDs,” “policy cliffs”) without jargon dump. Rhythm flexes under pressure: short beats for vault entry, longer cadence for diary revelation. No head-hop; perceptual signature consistent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>High density—each sentence advances plot or metaphor; minimal scaffolding. Occasional poetic overlap (“sensed absence threaded through everything” appears twice in variant) and one mixed metaphor (“silence shaped like a missing person”) slightly bruise clarity, but none touch closure. Strong verb choices, no filter clumps.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Freshens the “dead girl in the cloud” trope by fusing archival noir with space-mission grief cult; the breadcrumb schema using flight telemetry as node IDs feels inevitable only in hindsight. Risky corporate-memory frame commits fully; no retreat into safer realism. Specificity of denim patch lyric key is unforgettable.</comment>
