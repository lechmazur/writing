<comment>Interiority is lyrically dense but stays character-specific; the “warehouse of feelings” metaphor gives her a distinct perceptual lens. The key-ring box and self-addressed letters supply a late, credible micro-choice that costs her self-image. Emotional embodiment is strong—frost-nib wrist, projector’s growl—but the flaw→cost link is more asserted than dramatized before the final aisle. Still, the renunciation of wandering reads as earned within the accumulative design.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: she maps her own shelved love, re-prices her exile, and writes “stay” instead of goodbye—cost is the visible forfeiture of expert detachment. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of images and cadence shift reweight stakes rather than causal chain. Orientation is taught early via “iron ladder…projection booth” and the whispering static pattern; spatial fog later pays off, so no penalty. One meaningful tightening at the self-addressed boxes lands on schedule.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The projection booth is handled as micro-setting: projector gate, bare reels, and film-strip muscle memory constrain every beat and charge the final image. Sensory selection—rain-on-velvet aisle, cooled drum heart—mirrors internal state without overt symbolism. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible object positions. Environment is not backdrop; it supplies the only tools that let her read and rewrite love, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“where unused love is stored”—is signaled in paragraph 2 and tightened when she confronts her own named aisle. Pressure grows by texture, not plot reversals: each shelf-label intensifies the conceptual cost of neglected affection. Agency is renunciation rather than external victory; she forfeits the safety of voyeuristic expertise. The price is felt but modest; no prop or future path is visibly lost except her detachment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the conceit: unused love is not absence but overqualified surplus waiting in costume. The final reconfiguration—letters become doors, goodbye rewritten as stay—offers non-literal resonance without moralizing. Subtext resides in silence of unmailed letters and projector’s modest growl; no character states the thesis. Ambiguity lingers: will she cross her own threshold?—inviting reflection beyond the page.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric sustains a rhythmic, incantatory texture consistent with a crystal-gazer’s voice. Perceptual signature—feelings as rooms, stairs, dead-ends—is relentless and specific; no filler filter verbs. Diction stays within poetic but plausible register; no sudden academese. One micro-shift in psychic distance—from cataloguing shelves to tasting her own name—serves the climax beat cleanly.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm varies; no template cadence detected. Metaphors are dense yet internally coherent (warehouse, costumes, wings) and do not blur causality. A few adjacent abstract nouns (“promises postponed, apologies rehearsed”) flirt with scaffold but compress stakes efficiently. No loops or paraphrase beats obscure the final image; last line lands with musical cadence that recharges thunder motif.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Premise—“psychometric cartography of abandoned love inside a movie palace”—is non-obvious and conceptually committed. Tropes of psychic reader and dusty theater are transformed through spatialized emotion and film-strip muscle memory. Risky lyric density could have collapsed into purple abstraction, yet specificity of “blue dental floss,” “concave paper,” and “brass porthole door” keeps it grounded. Final reprise of thunder as “hands learning to hold” offers fresh emotional reweighting.</comment>
