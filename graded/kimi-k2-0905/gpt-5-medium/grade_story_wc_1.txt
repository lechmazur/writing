<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interiority is rich and glass-specific; the artist’s contradictory impulses (reveal truth vs. protect self) stay live in scene. Micro-choice to fuse the ledger into a dawn-readable window crystallizes values hierarchy with visible cost. No second character on page, so relationship bullets waived. The “steadily adaptive” trait is label-heavy early but ultimately earns its keep by steering the annealing decision.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the annealed window reweights truth from private evidence to communal kiln-of-listening. Causal chain holds: ledger → frost translation → canyon testimony. Orientation anchor (“quiet canyon under stars”) arrives in first sentence; no penalty. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of heat/glass/frost repetition tightens meaning until the final image refracts it.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Canyon, sand, stone, frost, and glass rod function as micro-settings that constrain every tactical move. Frost filigree matching the ledger’s edge is the charged specificity that gates the final plan. Spatial choreography is flawless; no floating props. Weather (frost at dawn) directly enables the decoding act—meets 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—artistic integrity vs. survival—signaled in line 2. One meaningful tightening: realization that returning/destroying the ledger both fail; the annealed midpoint is forced. Cost is conceptual (reputation risk, exposure to guild) rather than visceral, but legible. Agency is interior yet decisive; coincidence absent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the iterated equation of glass, heat, and testimony: truth requires a cooling pause before it can be safely seen. No explicit moral spoken; final image of the canyon as kiln of listening reconfigures meaning. Subtext in the rival’s laugh braided into stone is effective. Resists tidy binaries—justice is left to frost and dawn, not the protagonist.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>First-person voice sustains glass-maker’s perceptual signature—light, fracture, anneal—without drifts into academic register. Rhythm modulates: long breath-held sentences mirror canyon hush; shorter beats under the frost-reading. No dialogue, so dialogue bullets waived. Elision (“someone had tried…”) is taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Metaphor density is high but patterned (heat/kiln/frost) and pays off in closure; no mixed vehicles. One scaffold loop: “pauses were doors, and doors could be shut” could compress, but does not obscure因果. Strong verb choice—“flaking its own moons,” “braided with the hush.” Read-aloud rhythm legible. No artifact touches the final third.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Premise fuses murder-attempt via glass furnace with forensic frost-reading—fresh synthesis. Risk in lyric accumulative structure is justified by coherent closure. Specificity of charcoal-smuggling rival feels lived-in, not bolt-on. Transformation test passes: swap glass for any other craft and the emotional logic collapses.</comment>
