<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is rich and idiosyncratic—“my fingertips taste bitter, the way lies do”—and the proneness to roam the port eavesdropping for story shards gives him a lived, embodied motive. The final micro-choice—laying the poison label on the crate and walking away—crystallizes his hierarchy of values (truth as texture, not revenge) with visible cost: the widow alone must now balance her ledger. No internal contradiction is dramatized in-scene, and the near-total absence of on-page relationship pressure (only a silent stare with the mechanic) keeps the crucible aspect thin; hence capped below 8.8.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the label’s placement reweights the bureaucratic erasure and forces the widow into an unspoken moral reckoning, cost legible in her tremor and the clerk’s retreat. Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout—pattern of gathering fragments, cadence of tides, mirrored oil constellations—culminating in the final image that reconfigures meaning rather than plot. Orientation is clean by line 3, transitions (port → warehouse) are signaled by the mechanic’s dialogue. No causality breaks; however, the early Mosaic-like shuffling of containers/times could feel slightly under-taught for readers needing firmer pattern by 25 % mark, a hairline slip keeping it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Container labyrinth, catwalks, refrigerated vents, and oily water constellations are rendered through the narrator’s sieve-like attention; every sensory note doubles as tactical intel (“the port speaks in clanks and low vowels, telling me where to search next”). The poison-label object constrains the final gesture and is re-handled twice, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography stays clean across night-time approach to the widow’s warehouse stack; only minor moment—no anchor for how he exits the guarded yard unnoticed—keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can the erased man force acknowledgement of his survival without re-entering the bureaucratic net—tightens when he decides to deliver the label instead of confronting officials. The meaningful deepening occurs at the mechanic’s whisper: the shipment route becomes actionable intel, narrowing his options to private confrontation. Cost is felt (widow’s fear, clerk’s withdrawal), but because the protagonist risks no tangible penalty (guards already ignore him), the escalation lacks a visible price that alters his next moves—hence held below 8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of bureaucratic erasure versus lived memory emerges through the accumulating fragments and the final re-weighting of the poison label; no overt thesis statements. Subtext operates in the mechanic’s sideways look and the widow’s tremor, letting silence indict. Final image—“the city stacks its cargo again, layering new stories over the old”—offers resonant, non-literal answer: forgetting is structural, perpetual. Only minus: late-arriving import-route detail risks feeling like a convenient thematic key rather than pattern-earned, keeping it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>First-person voice carries a salt-rusted, stevedore-lyric cadence—“I filter reality differently, as if my eyes are sieves”—maintained without register drift. Perceptual signature is distinct: bitter taste transposed to fingertips, memory as rope texture. Elliptical grammar (“I was poisoned once, I think, or nearly”) is pattern-taught early and paid off in closure. No head-hopping, stable psychic distance, rhythmic propulsion under pressure—meets 9+ bar.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Density is high: every sentence layers image + motive + world rule (“paperwork moves faster than tides”). Metaphors stay coherent—oily water constellations mirror container walls—no mixed vehicles. Varied sentence openings, paragraph lengths breathe. One minor scaffold: “across the rhythm of tides” repeats four times as litany; while purposeful, the final iteration borders loop artifact, preventing 9.0.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: bureaucratic death/error as noir-ghost story set in living port-maze, told by a shadow who collects overheard scraps. Risky second-person address to the sea avoids gimmick by staying in character. Not quite 9.0 because the “widow + poison + insurance” spine treads familiar noir territory; specificity is high but core twist isn’t non-obvious.</comment>
