<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The narrator’s contradictory impulses—guilt, pride, isolation, the need to keep drawing—are embodied in every beat; the compass rose and the slow sky act as tangible extensions of that conflict. Micro-choices (pulling the safeties, dating the blackout, blowing on the ink) carry visible cost and foreclose the path back to social acceptance. The “blessed pariah” status is dramatized, not labeled, through the board’s wary distance and the city’s slow lights. Emotional progression feels lived-in: shame layers into ritual, then into a self-authored navigation that accepts its own exile.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the final sketch-dated blackout and candle-breath crystallize a new personal axis whose cost is the permanent social chill; the compass rose is re-veined from ornament to “vein of intention.” Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each slow shell of perception thickens the stake until the only viable navigation is inward. No orientation debt; who/where/when are anchored by line 3. Persistent constraint—the stretched temporal deck—shapes every tactical decision to keep drawing instead of petitioning for forgiveness.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The time-dilation deck is not backdrop; its glass seams, curved panes, and beetle-slow traffic constrain perception and force the choice to sketch in breath-counts rather than seconds. The cracked sketchbook continents and the applique’s “four arms” (past, present, elsewhere, return) act as micro-setting that charges the final image. Spatial choreography is flawless: body, book, ledge, glass, and sky remain trackable across the slow night. Environment directly enables the climax—only here can constellations be peeled and stacked into a private cartography.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The dominant stake—can the narrator forge a livable compass after becoming civic sin-eater—is signaled early and tightens through each slow-motion shell of sky. Agency is continuous: the decision to keep drawing, to date the blackout, to bless the candle line are all irreversible micro-acts that foreclose apology or re-entry. Cost is legible: social exile, headache, and the “emptiness of being right.” One meaningful deepening occurs when true north is seen to migrate, forcing the shift from magnetic to intentional navigation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: navigation is self-invented after collective rejection; maps are memory-management against future lies. The night-sky custom migrates from grandmother’s storm rumors to a post-catastrophic solitude, reweighting “true north” as devotion, not geography. Subtext lives in gesture—blowing on ink like blessing a candle—rendering the final line a non-literal answer to whether exile can be lived with. Ambiguity is preserved: the city will never forgive, yet the sky can still be drawn.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>First-person interiority carries a distinct perceptual signature: cathedral silence, dust hesitating, constellations peeling like petals. Syntax warps under temporal magnification—“counting breaths instead of seconds, patient as moss”—without losing clarity. No dialogue, so voice contamination is impossible; free indirect thought is clean and consistent. Psychic distance compresses naturally as the night stretches, mirroring the narrator’s narrowing focus onto pencil, applique, and migrating star.</comment>

<comment>High information density: every sentence layers image and thought—“echoed silence nested in the seams of the glass” does triple sensory and metaphoric work. Metaphors are coherent within the temporal logic; no mixed vehicles. Rhythm modulates from long hymnal clauses to the staccato of “I turned the page and dated it.” Zero paraphrase loops or filler; even abstractions like “measured mercy” are anchored to the slowed clock. Closure line is crisp and image-driven.</comment>

<comment>Fresh synthesis: grafts post-disaster civic exile onto an astronomical anniversary ritual, making star-mapping a form of penance and self-pardon. The “blessed pariah” trope is particularized through the blackout date and the board’s stalled verdict. Risk-taking—slow-time deck as literal perceptual filter—pays off by forcing a new cartographic ethic. Conceptual integrity holds: the story never flinches from the cost of being right in the dark.</comment>
