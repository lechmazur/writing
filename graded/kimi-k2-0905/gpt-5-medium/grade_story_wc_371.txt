<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The narrator’s “creeping normality noticer” trait is embodied through tactile micro-choices—pruning, crumbing, pouring tea—each a quiet refusal to forget. Interior contradiction surfaces when self-reproach for “normalizing the wound” collides with the need to keep witnessing. The final shared gesture with the cashier crystallizes a hierarchy of values: remembrance over absolution, practice over piety, with the cost of perpetual vigilance legible in the line “a line thrown from shore that I will have to keep holding.” Only the cashier’s late entrance keeps the relationship crucible from full pressure until the final beats.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the narrator accepts an ongoing, tenuous accountability—absolution is not granted but practiced daily through returned attention and crumbs in the seams. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern of tender, reversible acts accrues until the shared tea and bread reconfigure the meaning of witness. Cost is unmistakable in the final image of perpetual “holding” the line. Orientation is swift; ivy, courtyard, and season anchor by line 4 and the pattern is taught early.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The tea house breathes only after the narrator’s breath and steam warm it; environment responds to body, reversing conquest. Cracked sill, moss-lattice, and sesame scent constrain the ritual placement of crumbs and seeds, charging the final communion. Spatial choreography is clean—balusters, sundial, doorway tracked without drift. Weather’s threat of snow tightens the need to plant now, not later.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether attentive practice can atone for complicit forgetting—tightens when the cashier’s arrival forces the narrator to move from private litany to shared stewardship. One meaningful deepening: the confession “I was late” narrows future options to perpetual return. Cost is visible in the promise of daily “holding.” Pressure is textural, not causal, but coherent under the chosen lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through recurring crumbs: from salvaged loaf to constellation sketched on lacquer to seeds pressed into seams—memory must be scattered to grow. No moral is stated; the final image of birds returning to “no miracle, only careful company” reweights absolution as iterative attendance. Subtext lives in silence between strangers sharing stale bread and tea, the real benediction unspoken.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>First-person voice carries a precise perceptual signature: lists of “tiny surrenders,” verbs like “garden” used transitively, sensory bias toward steam and sesame. Rhythm modulates—long hortatory sentences yield to fragmentary litany under guilt. No head-hopping; cashier’s voice surfaces only in dialogue, distinct in wind-chapped directness. Compression (“I was late”) teaches the pattern early and pays off at climax.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet breathable; metaphor vehicles (bread remembering heat, room unbending) remain internally consistent. No scaffold loops; each sentence advances image or stakes. One mixed metaphor—“line thrown from shore” beside “guerrilla gardening”—is minor enough not to dull closure. Strong verb choice—“uncloak,” “garden,” “sweep”—propels without adverb clutter.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Fusion of guerrilla gardening with sacramental ritual feels fresh; the sacred is located in reversible, almost invisible acts. The vanished bakery’s last loaf as portable relic reconfigures mourning into vegetal future. Risk lies in quietude—no dramatic confrontation—yet coherence of image and voice makes the gamble pay off. Specificity of Grackle Street and sesame scent prevents abstraction.</comment>
