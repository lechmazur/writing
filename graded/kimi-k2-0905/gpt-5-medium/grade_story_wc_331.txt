<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The librarian’s quiet obsession with curvature-shelving gives her a singular, credible quirk, but she never makes a choice that risks anything; the “return with news” is observational, not consequential. Interiority is rich—ozone scarf, negative-curvature aisles—but remains static; no contradictory impulse forces a visible cost. The boy and the woman register only as appreciative mirrors, so status/relationship pressure is absent. The final line admits failure (“have not found”), producing Charged Poise, yet the stance is unchanged from line one, so renunciation feels assumed, not earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: lyrical accretion of library imagery leading to a CR—that stories’ weather, not location, matters. Cause/therefore links are loose but patterned; shelving by curvature is taught early and paid off in the “salt becomes snow” reconfiguration. Closure lands on-page with conceptual cost: the map folds shut, knowledge remains unfinished. Orientation anchor (who/where) is clear within 60 words; no penalty.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Scientific-poetry library is evoked through tactile specifics—filament bulbs, ozone scent, Hawking read as psalms—anchoring mood and theme. Micro-setting of the “saddle of space” between shelves constrains the narrator’s hidden path, directly enabling the climactic CR. Spatial choreography is coherent; the scarf migrates from neck to hook to pocket, tracking the breach-and-return. Weather imagery (salt-snow) reweights the stake at closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—find the breathing country of stories—is signaled early but remains abstract; no concrete obstacle or ticking clock materializes. Escalation is tonal, not causal: density of maritime imagery increases, tightening the lyric pattern rather than narrowing options. Cost is conceptual (accepting endless search) rather than felt; no tool, relationship, or opportunity is forfeited. Meets single-deepening standard for lyric mode but lacks visible price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges obliquely: knowledge is asymptotic, curvature infinite, stories un-locatable. Subtextual reprise of scarf-as-coastline and salt-to-snow subtly reweights the quest from cartography to climate. No explicit thesis; the final image invites contemplation without moralizing. The hunger for origin stays irresolute, producing honest ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>First-person voice is distinct: clipped, equation-laced syntax (“triangle sums less than straight”) mirrors a mathematician-poet. Rhythmic control heightens at peaks—single-sentence paragraphs mimic shelving dips. Compression is purposeful; no head-hop. Lexicon stays within librarian’s range; neologisms (“un-map,” “breath mechanics”) feel coined, not grafted. Dialogue absent, so no voice convergence issues.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud cadence varies; sentence lengths contract during aisle-bend passages, lengthen in reflective lulls. Metaphors (Mandelbrot on napkin, gravity as candle) are precise, not stacked; no mixed-vehicle failures. Information density high—each sentence layers image and concept. Minor scaffold: “I shelve by… I walk to… I write…” template appears thrice; not intrusive enough to dull closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</question>
<comment>Premise—hyperbolic library navigation—feels fresh yet inevitable, grounding abstraction in shelving logistics. Blending of math and lyric memory-tending resists genre bins. Risk of preciousness is skirted by concrete handling of scarf, card, snow. Could tip toward mannered lyricism in lesser hands, but specificity keeps it singular.</comment>
