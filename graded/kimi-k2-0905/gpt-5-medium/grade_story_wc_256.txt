<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The prism-song bell ringer’s interiority is rich and embodied—“my hands are powerfully gentle” fuses vocation and vulnerability. Micro-choices (unlocking the iron cabinet, polishing the lens, ringing the crystal city bell) reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. The final renunciation—pilgrimage without destination—earns resonance because earlier tactile acts foreshadow the acceptance of open-ended repair. Cost is palpable: the lingering moonlight on palms signals the eternal, unsolved labor of listening.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the braid-image reweights the entire ritual under Accumulative/Textural lens. The final paragraph crystallizes options—“the pilgrimage will travel tomorrow… I will follow”—with felt cost of perpetual itinerancy. Persistent constraint: the carbide-lens moonlight clings to skin, a portable burden. No causality breaks; every bell echo is earned by prior tactile beats.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The laboratory’s golden shadows, jarred lost bells, and lamp-lit moon operate as micro-setting that constrains every acoustic experiment. Sensory economy is exact: “smells of hot dust from vacuum tubes” marries tech and nostalgia in one breath. Spatial choreography remains coherent as volunteers move between stations of listening. The final image of moonlight on palms merges body and tool, charging the closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—honest connection via sound—tightens when the volunteer confesses his brother’s drowning; the ferry bell suddenly refracts a live grief. Escalation is textural: each spectral ringing adds density until the crystal bell spills entire city maps, foreclosing passive listening. Protagonist’s agency remains calibrated—gentle propulsion, never coercion. Cost is visible: the endless tomorrow-tours imply exhausted but chosen servitude.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the braid-metaphor: connection as living tension, not bridge. No abstract sermon—wisdom is earned through the ferry-bell sandbar revelation. Final image refuses moral, offering instead “the city tuning itself to hope,” a sonic rather than ethical resolution. Subtextual irony: the keeper of lost sounds must keep moving, never arriving.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>First-person lyric voice sustains prismatic perceptual signature—“patient moon,” “prismatic patience”—without purple drift. Syntax modulates: longer hyphenated clauses mimic bell resonance; abrupt final sentence “I will follow” cuts like a struck rim. No head-hopping; collective “we” stays within narrator’s acoustic embrace. Filter verbs serve voice: “I hear boots, gulls” keeps perception embodied.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High-density lines—“golden shadows pool along the benches, catching in jars”—do triple sensory work. Zero paraphrase loops; each bell image adds new shoreline memory. Metaphors stay physically coherent: moonlight is “patient,” not emotional. Minor scaffold: “powerfully gentle” repeated twice; doesn’t dull closure but keeps score from 9+ band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Freshest synthesis: post-blackout acoustic pilgrimage guided by reclaimed industrial lens. Tropes of healing ritual and apocalypse are re-inked with miner-lamp mathematics and ferry-bell spectra. Risk succeeds: the non-journey pilgrimage feels inevitable because the piece commits to sound-as-movement logic. Transformation test fails if city/bell details swapped—specificity is the innovation.</comment>
