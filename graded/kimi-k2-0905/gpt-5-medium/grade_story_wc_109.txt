<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Oracle’s interiority is lyrically particular—her knuckles stung by salt, her need to “retell the world without the world’s noise”—yet her decisive choice to stay and carve the map into stone carries visible cost (bleeding fingers). Courier’s arc from arsonist to carrier is cleanly traced through micro-choices (tearing sleeve, bow). Relationship under pressure alters both stances; no contradictory impulses shown in-scene, but renunciation is earned. Voice stays distinct, never drifts into label-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the oracle’s refusal to leave reconfigures the fort into “calm weather” while the courier departs with the booklet—cost is the blood she leaves in the grooves. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each silence-gap she notes tightens the night’s density until the final image reweights meaning. Orientation anchor (who/where) is vivid by line 3; no causality break. Persistent constraint—the star may die—shapes the final tactic.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Storm-tossed ridge fort constrains every beat: wind dictates lantern placement, rain smears gold leaf, cliff swallows names. Micro-setting (soaked stones, merlons) is tactile and evolves as oracle’s blood re-marking redefines the surface. Final image—fort “grows taller by not falling”—charges the closure. Sensory hierarchy stays narrow under crisis: salt sting, flaking gilt, wet parchment.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</question><grade>Dominant stake: can night be mapped before the last star vanishes? Pressure tightens once when courier admits arson intent, forcing oracle to offer the booklet as instrument—this narrows his options and reweights the silence-map. Cost is visible: bleeding fingers, flaking gold, possible star death. No reversal, but deepening under Accumulative lens suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: night as migratory silence, maps as breath-tracks, star as patient pupil. Final image—“the sea graduates into a gentler noise”—offers resonant non-literal answer: cartography of pauses replaces conquest. No moral stated; ambiguity lingers about whether the valley will hear. Motif of “lacunae” recurs only to constrain tactics, not as ornament.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays紧贴 oracle’s perceptual signature: synesthetic “ambered hush,” “marbled hush pouring through merlons.” Rhythmic control mirrors rising then ebbing storm; no head-hopping. Filter verbs (“she notes,” “she hears”) are voice-motivated, attend to silence-summoning task. Diction never exceeds oracle’s plausible lexicon; no puppet-micro-movements.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>High density: “gold leaf bruising under rain like ripened fruit” does three jobs (tactile, visual, mortality metaphor). No loops or scaffold; sentences vary in length and opening. One mixed metaphor—“star steadies like a nail”—but fort-as-patient-pupil justifies it. Final paragraph’s cadence slows to mirror sea’s “single muscle,” propelling closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: cartography of silence + collapsing star + oracle-courier redemptive swap. Risk of lyric overwriting is taken yet stays legible under Accumulative lens. Specific detail—“length between two distant crashes”—creates verifiable novelty. Premise is familiar (post-apocalyptic messenger) but angle (mapping night’s hush) is non-obvious.</comment>
