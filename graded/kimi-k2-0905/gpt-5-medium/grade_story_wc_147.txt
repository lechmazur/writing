<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses—crushing panic vs. deliberate stillness—are enacted in the corridor scrape and transmitter placement; flimsy transmitter line and vial tied to chest literalize cost. Interiority stays concrete, tethered to tool and depth rather than abstract fear. The final swim carries earned pride/terror without tidy moral calibration. Only limit: we never learn why this “sender” alone can improvise signal-perfume fusion—competence edges toward convenient expertise.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Charged Poise: vial corked, line singing, rescue possible yet unconfirmed, cost (air/time, temple abandonment) legible in final swim. Accumulative/lyric lens holds: hush, scent, signal braid density across beats until temple recedes “like a star at noon,” re-weighting solitude vs. connectivity. Pattern taught early—perfume as memory antenna—pays off when breath shapes emergency tones through vial. No orientation debt; anchors (lone sender, crippled sub, mythic temple) stable by 120 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Environment-tool symbiosis: crystal vial and limestone nave constrain tactics—vial’s emptiness dictates signal modulation, temple acoustics dictate placement. Micro-setting (belt spool, frieze fish) charges final transmitter nest. Sensory hierarchy obeys crisis: color drains to “bruise of brown,” sound narrows to hush-fold. Spatial choreography flawless—line, column, doorway surge tracked without drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—crew air ticking—surfaces early and re-enters via gauge reminder mid-tightening. Escalation is density/cadence: narrowing corridor, scraping tank, silt swallow, then transmitter thrum—each beat adds acoustic or tactile pressure rather than causal twist. Protagonist agency: unsnarling line, exhaling tones, corking vial—all foreclose retreat. Visible price: vial becomes “small bell of collected silence,” emblem of risk assumed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges from acoustic vs. olfactory memory—ephemeral scents hijack oceanic hush to reroute physics of rescue. No thesis stated; instead, “perfume sing the mathematics of need” fuses synesthesia and jeopardy. Final image reconfigures loneliness from splendor to duty: temple fades, sender swims “proud and afraid.” Ambiguity kept—rescue unconfirmed, meaning rests in attempt, not triumph.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>First-person voice owns perceptual signature—sea as cathedral, anemones blinking “patient eyes,” silt as bruise—without tourist catalog. Syntax mirrors pressure: long clauses when panic paddles ribs, fragment-like phrasing during stillness override. No head-hop; tense stable; diction stays within plausible salvage-operator lexicon. Dialogue absent by design; narrative texture substitutes for speech.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Figurative density is high but patterned: hush as animal, vial as moon, temple as mouth—each returns in closure refrain, avoiding random ornament. No loops or paraphrase; information multi-tasked (“belt spooled transmitter,” “chipped stopper” embeds tool + history). Rhythm breathes with action—caesuras before panic, propulsion in “I pop the vial’s stopper.” Minor register lift “conceptual mathematics” accepted as narrator’s salvage-tech idiom.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fusion of perfume-memory with underwater acoustics is non-obvious and premise-committed: story follows scent as data carrier through pressure physics without flinching. Transformation test fails if relocated to land; hush-fold and brine are integral. Risk—lyric overload—heightens stakes yet clarity preserved. Temple-as-mouth, vial-as-moon feel inevitable in hindsight, not gimmicks.</comment>
