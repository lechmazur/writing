<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and body-anchored; the scholar’s earnest errors surface in micro-choices (hand-steadying, sip counting, crow-quill dip). Each scar rune externalizes a private contradiction; the final bow to her younger self crystallizes earned endurance with visible cost in breath and burn. No therapy-speak; voice stays idiosyncratic and flawed. Could nudge to 9+ if one earlier choice risked immediate platform failure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is an Earned Stasis: the held-breath minute expires as she drinks the self-forged runes, foreclosing the old shame with felt lung-burn cost. Causal chain (ritual rule → breath window → rune inscription → ingestion) holds without ellipsis breaks; the lens is Situational pressure crystallizing stance. Anchors (who/where/when) land by line 5; no orientation debt. Persistent constraint—breath as sandglass—shapes every tactic; final image reweights prior scars as legible alphabet inside her.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Floating basalt platform, ink crystallizing under stress, and storm-rimmed sky are not backdrop but tactical constraints: the cup surface must stay level, breath must fit between thunder rolls. Micro-setting (tea tray, quill, kettle steam) guides exact hand movements and timing; crystalline ink facets literally refract stormlight into the cup, charging closure. Environment and body interleave without static cataloguing. Meets 9+ gate: platform and ink jointly constrain and charge the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—transmute scars into readable runes before breath runs out—tightens via literal lung-burn countdown; each inscribed rune shortens remaining air, an on-page traded cost. No reversals needed; pressure accrues through situational squeeze (storm walls, evaporating breath) that force stance crystallization. Escalation visible when chest begins to burn after third rune; option to quit is foreclosed by ritual rule already internalized. Agency remains hers; luck complicates (lightning metronome) but does not save.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</question><comment>Theme emerges from concrete paradox: superstition (seven-count, knock wood) becomes the rigorous method by which adult self re-authors childhood wounds. No explicit thesis; resonance arises when alphabet-petals float in tea, offering non-literal answer that stories are not escape but ingestion of prior harm. Ambiguity lingers—runes may be only ink yet still warm her—resisting moral tidy-up. Final image reweights earlier youthful superstitions as legitimate grammar of survival.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>First-person perceptual signature is consistent: crow-quill trimmed tip, crystallizing ink facets, “saturated hush” recur with character-specific diction. Syntax breathes with ritual tempo—long sentences during steam rise, fragments at breath limit—mirroring physical pressure. No head-hop; POV distance stays intimate. Minor register lift in “conceptual repricing” line but reads earned within scholar’s lexicon. Lyric elision (“I drink, and the read letters settle”) is taught by prior pattern and pays off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</question><comment>Line-level craft is dense: one sentence often braids sensory, symbolic, and causal work (“Each facet is a shard of old fear, and each shard is a window”). Rhythm modulates from meditative anaphora to staccato breath-beat. No mixed metaphors; vehicles stay physical (steam = page, cup = eyelid). Sparse scaffold—only two near-paraphrase lines midway. Minor loop “I let… I let…” could trim but does not dull closure. Read-aloud ear test passes.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: meteorological tea ceremony + scar-to-rune alchemy + breath-as-clock converts familiar healing arc into situational ritual. Superstitions revisited not as nostalgia but as metallurgy of memory. Risk taken—quiet lyric ending with no external save—heightens stakes and coherence. Specificity (kiln crack “leaping to my skin like quick handwriting”) prevents template drift. Conceptual integrity holds: world rules (ink crystallizes under emotional stress) activated early and obeyed at climax.</comment>
