<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The artisan’s blindness is not a label; it drives every micro-choice (threading braid by touch, reading ripples). Her “magnetic calm” under threat feels earned because earlier beats show her substituting fingertip vibration for sight. The apprentice is secondary but supplies live status pressure: when Mirel’s mirror slips, the artisan’s inhale reveals cost. No interior contradiction is dramatized—she never doubts her method—so the arc is competence porn rather than wrenching change, capping her below 9.</comment>

<comment>Causal chain is tight: damaged trace → must patch → patch requires water-refraction data → fog degrades data → drone hesitation → artisan adds rain-basin mid-beat. Closure is a Decisive Change: the cars couple, the depot “unclenches,” and the hummingbird lands warmed—visible cost shifted from risk to accomplished fact. The lens stays causal throughout; no coincidence resolves the slant. Orientation is clear by word 60; no penalty.</comment>

<comment>Fog, wet rails, and harbor bells are not backdrop; they actively scramble the drone’s sonar and force the rain-basin innovation. The shop’s “circuits, brushes, and bowls” micro-setting constrains every beat; when wind ripples the bowls, the artisan’s entire geometry collapses. Spatial choreography is impeccable—porter shouts move left-to-right, chain clatter supplies auditory north. Only missing 9+ gate: no single environmental element recharges the final image; the drone lands warm, not the mist or rails.</comment>

<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Single stake: couple freight before fog thickens further. Escalation is the fog folding thicker after first car settles, nullifying the water-mirror method. Artisan’s agency is relentless—she rescripts the drone’s buffer mid-air and physically points the final alignment. Cost is visible: the drone’s battery warmth against her wrist, the apprentice’s soaked sleeve, the depot’s audible exhalation—options narrow to “right two fingers” or catastrophe.</comment>

<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as “perception is repairable technology”: metal braid = copper nerve, ripples = retina, drone = proxy eye. No character spells this out; the final image of the smiling artisan “toward the harbor” lets the reader reprice sight itself as collaborative engineering. Subtext in silences: when the drone hesitates, no one speaks—they just add bowls, showing trust as the real protocol. Avoids 9+ only because the emotional aftereffect is admiration rather than unsettling irony.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays inside the artisan’s perceptual signature: sentences lengthen when she listens (“anchor’s metal vowels”) and fracture when she codes (“shortening a buffer, widening a window”). No head-hopping; Mirel’s interior is implied only through gesture. Compressed diction under pressure—“pips like pebbles”—is taught early and repaid at closure. Register never drifts into tech manual; solder becomes “vow,” traces become “scraps of sky.”</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Rhythm mimics rail coupling: long freight-train sentences alternate with single-note fragments (“Metal kisses metal without scream”). Metaphors are coherent—mist as “gauze,” anchor chain as “beads slid along a string”—and never mixed. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence adds new sensory angle or causal data. Only hairline slip: “timbers groaning like a great throat clearing” is mildly stock, but it occurs early and does not touch the closure beat.</comment>

<grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Blind rail-tech prodigy is fresh, but the真正 risk is turning freight-coupling—a trope of industrial brawn—into a delicate haptic sonata. The water-bowls-as-OS concept is non-obvious and inevitable once executed; remove it and the entire logic collapses. Stakes stay human-scaled: one mis-couple, not world-ending apocalypse, making the invention feel proportionate. Final smile reframes disability as collaborative hyper-ability—an earned inversion of expected heroic vision.</comment>
