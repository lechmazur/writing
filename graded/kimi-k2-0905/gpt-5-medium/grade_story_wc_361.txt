<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>The courier’s tremulous interiority is embodied in every breath and palm-tremble; the pendant’s tremor literalizes his sympathetic vibration, making motivation legible. The widow’s single gesture—breathing into his hands—crystallizes a status shift and shared stakes. Cost is felt when the corridor thins and the mentor’s absence is re-felt. The only bar to 9-band is that the “jittery” trait never complicates the success of the ritual—he is competent under pressure without visible flaw-cost.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the yew sprig planted, corridor sealed, widow’s coin and courier’s song exchanged—felt cost on every beat. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of breath-tuning and green note intensifies until the ridge itself reweights meaning. Orientation anchors (aurora ridge, switchback, lantern) land before 120 words. Mentor absence is taught early and paid off in the “old green hush” final image. Causality stays intact; no prop or knowledge teleport.</comment>

<comment>The aurora-lit ridge is not backdrop but instrument: its green note literally tunes the pendant and the joint breath. Micro-setting becomes the cupped palms that function as portable chamber for seed-germination—an irreplaceable constraint. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from climb to switchback to rock placement. Weather (aurora, snow) affects visibility and the literal pitch of the ritual. Only missing 9-band gate: no tactile environmental cost (cold, wind, altitude) is allowed to hamper the courier or threaten failure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—widow’s need to speak with the lost man—is signaled in paragraph 3 and tightened when the tube answers with snow-footfall memory. Escalation is the deepening of shared breath that literally germinates a corridor; options narrow to “hold the pitch or let the moment collapse.” Cost is the thinning of the corridor and the courier’s renewed pang of mentor absence. Agency is courier’s decision to ask for her breath and plant the seed—he could have walked away.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme of continuance versus closure emerges from the yew seed, the planted coin, and the scrap of song—no moralizing. Subtext carries in silence: widow’s half-lit face, the absent mentor’s “old green hush.” Final image reweights the routine job into mythic gardening without stating it. Only slack: “wonder” is named early but never contradicted or tested; the courier never doubts the miracle.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>First-person voice is jittery, synesthetic, courier-specific: “maps bleach into sky,” “snow forgets and remembers footfalls.” Syntax compresses under pressure—“green pouring into the snow like sap”—without losing clarity. Pendant’s tremor acts as rhythmic motif that modulates with emotional intensity. No dialogue, hence no voice convergence; internal diction stays consistently heightened and lyric, justified by occupation and ridge aurora.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense, musical, and propulsive: every image advances atmosphere or stakes. No loops, no synonym churn, no mixed metaphors. Sentence variety toggles between long breath units and staccato observations that mimic tuning-fork vibration. Occasional elevated diction (“corridor,” “timbre”) is earned by the courier’s mentor-trained perception; register remains internally coherent.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The sympathetic-vibration parcel trick is a fresh twist on psychopomp lore; yew seed as memory-conduit feels inevitable, not gimmick. Risk of lyric overload is embraced and paid off by the ridge itself becoming instrument. Absent mentor trope is inverted—he is not ghost but tuning-fork absence that enables the courier’s autonomy. Final reprise of “old green hush” recharges every prior green image without feeling recycled.</comment>
