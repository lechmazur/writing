<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mara’s “gently persistent” tide-metaphor is dramatized: she keeps keys, pairs teens with elders, stands mute under the arbor during the raid—each micro-choice costs her social safety and is rooted in the trait. Interiority stays concrete (“hands visible, chin high”) rather than label-heavy. The final bell-polish moment crystallizes her endurance with visible cost, meeting the 9+ quick test for earned renunciation; only the lack of a single contradictory impulse in-scene keeps it sub-9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment> Accumulative/Textural lens: nightly gift-runs thicken pattern until the patrol search beat tightens the braid; closure is a Charged Poise—Mara re-hangs the bell, now freighted with communal gratitude and visible risk. Orientation is anchored by line 4 (ridge, frost, sanctions). Cost is unmistakable: “fewer lists, fewer boots, more names without fear” and the bell’s warped faces wobble back at us. One soft spot: the patrol retreat relies on off-stage luck rather than an on-page tactic that forecloses options, preventing a 9.0.</comment>

<comment>The terra-cotta arbor is no postcard—it dictates choke-point geography, forces the bell into a beam, supplies frost-prints that hide carrot tops, and hosts the stare-down. Sensory selection is urgency-filtered: “pad-soft steps,” “breath-white arbor,” “kerosene pooled carefully in jars.” The silver bell becomes micro-setting-as-constraint: its dented voice limits signaling to one ring, shaping every night run. Final image recharges it: bell breathing our warped reflections—setting charges closure.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—community survival under sanctions—tightens through escalating night-runs, patrol proximity, and the arbor standoff; each bell-ring deepens knowledge that anonymity is life. Agency is distributed but coherent: Mara’s pairings, teen swagger, elder stories all feed the braid. Visible cost is legible: goat-chaff in snow, “fewer boots,” and the grandmother-knitting-rapper symmetry shows scarcity braided into care. One minor softness: no single protagonist’s option is irrevocably foreclosed on-page, holding it below 8.8.</comment>

<comment>Theme—how anonymity can braid dignity—emerges from pattern, not sermon: every bell-ring reweights secrecy as communal glue. Final bell, now mirror, answers the question without moralizing: dignity kept warm costs us our names but returns our faces. Subtext lives in gesture (broom left behind, sweater sleeve) and silence during the patrol search. Avoids final-paragraph thesis statement; only a hairline risk of sentimental uplift keeps it sub-9.</comment>

<grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Collective “we” holds stable interior access—no head-hop into individual teens. Perceptual signature is compressed, winter-bitten: “air brittle with frost and held breath,” “sanctions period that blistered everything.” Rhythmic control tightens under pressure: clause-shortening during raid (“boots creaking, eyes scanning”) then widens into spring’s “slow inhalation of courage.” Dialogue is minimal but textured: Mara’s soft register vs. sergeant’s clipped demand. No filter-verb clusters or register drift; the lyric elision is pattern-taught and closure-legible.</comment>

<comment>Read-aloud ear: varied sentence openings, paragraph breaths match night-run stealth vs. patrol glare. High density—single sentences carry image, backstory, and emotional tilt: “Mara paired teens with grandparents so the walkers would carry not only bread, but stories, instructions, and jokes.” Metaphors stay coherent (bell as bridge rung into air) and physically plausible. One mixed metaphor blip—“sanctions period that blistered everything”—but it does not touch closure. Zero loops, no scaffold, no template cadence; final line lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Familiar trope—clandestine village mutual aid—is transfigured by terra-cotta arbor as rust-rib cage, bell as mirror, and the grandmother-rapper knowledge swap. Specificity anchors risk: carrot-top decoys, chaff for goats, kerosene in jars. First-paragraph “amplified quiet” frames lyric pattern that pays off in the wind-rung thanks. Not a gimmick inversion; the resonance feels inevitable yet fresh. Slight deduction for echo of “kept their dignity warm” phrase nearing thematic echo, but it is embedded in scene pressure, so −0.2 only.</comment>
