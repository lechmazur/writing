<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The lone protagonist’s interior contradiction—skeptical of belief yet clinging to relics—drives every micro-choice; the wheel-turning beat embodies embodied cost as palms sting with cold iron. Motivation stays legible and intensifies: the need to weigh a “swallowed truth” escalates from mapping radio panic to literal valve torque. The father’s death is not summarized but re-experienced through the pipe’s sigh, so the renunciation—leaving the wheel open—carries inherited weight. Voice never slips into diagnostic labels; thought stays welded to sensory action.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as an Earned Stasis: the narrator turns the valve back open, foreclosing vengeance while accepting the irreducible weight of “normal means.” Causal linkage holds—radio panic → tunnel hum → wheel torque—each step shrinking options until the final quarter-turn. Orientation is anchored by word 30 (“abandoned train tunnel”) and the lens stays Accumulative/Textural: density of beads, drops, metronome ticks accrues until meaning reframes. Cost is legible in the final image: “I carried the memory of the weight, not as proof, but as a tool.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The tunnel’s cold arch, beaded valve, and copper drip form a micro-setting that literally constrains the final choice—hands freeze, threads bite, sound metronomes the turn. Selective sensory economy favors touch and hearing over visual catalog; every droplet and grease-bead is repurposed as rosary, verdict, lung. Spatial choreography is immaculate: wheel, pipe, ladder memory track without drift. The setting evolves—pipe sighs after torque—so environment participates in causality rather than decorating it.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—measure the weight of a swallowed truth—tightens when each quarter-turn raises literal pressure in the pipe, making abstract guilt tactile. One meaningful deepening suffices: the moment water rattles farther on, the narrator grasps that “normal means are heavy.” Agency is continuous; no outside coincidence intervenes. Cost is felt in shivering muscle and the decision to leave the valve open, forfeiting easy condemnation.</question>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the motif of measurable weight—radio timestamps, iron grams, pressure gauges—until the closing refusal to measure guilt in sermons. Subtextual indictment of industrial cruelty stays implicit; the partner’s drunk whisper is never moralized. The final image reweights “tools” over “proof,” letting the wheel become a secular sacrament. No tidy forgiveness is offered; the town’s ghost shift keeps rattling, proving habit outlives conscience.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>First-person voice owns a machinist’s lexicon—valve wheel, threads, meter—whose rhythm mimics pipe pressure: short metallic clauses that clank, then longer exhalations. Perceptual signature is skeptical-materialist: miracles are sold “like soap,” breath tastes of iron. No head-hopping; interiority stays welded to tactile detail. Under peak stress diction compresses—“I turned the wheel slow and counted the threads like rosary sorrow”—yet remains legible and voice-true.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Almost every sentence carries double duty: “Beads of condensation ringed it like a rosary, and grease made the beads shine” fuses image, metaphor, and plot cue in one breath. Metaphors stay coherent—tunnel as cup, valve as lung—without conflicting vehicles. Zero template cadence or synonym loops; openings vary from participial to noun-fronted. Momentum breathes: dense metaphoric blocks alternate with stripped hearing-beats that let pressure settle.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</question>
<comment>Fusing industrial gothic with talk-radio epistemology feels fresh; the “ghost shift” is retooled from haunting into data pattern. The valve wheel as secular rosary transforms familiar salvage-explorer trope into moral instrument. Specificity—grease bead geometry, cold iron taste—anchors universals of labor guilt. Risk in lyric compression pays off: the ending renounces explanatory exposition, trusting image to reweight meaning.</comment>
