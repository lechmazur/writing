<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The narrator’s skeptical-gentle healer persona stays consistent; every micro-choice (pocketing the tooth, resetting Ari’s shoulder) grows from that core. Contradictory impulses—doubt vs mercy—cohere in the final decision to “tell it plain,” with visible cost in the shoulder’s snap and the town wrath they’ll face tomorrow. Linnet’s grass-kneed innocence nudges the plot yet remains credibly childlike. Interiority is embodied, not diagnostic.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>A single shard inside the maze: orientation (who/where/when) lands by line 4. Causal chain holds—finding tooth → meeting Ari → resetting bone → choosing truth—each step narrows options under the Accumulative/Textural lens. Closure is a Charged Poise: the tooth left under the fountain reweights all prior “mistakes into constellations” talk and forecloses silence at undeniable social cost. No lens ambiguity; cost is legible in the final image.</question>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Hedge-maze garden is micro-setting done tight: mint/iron air, muttering fountain, tooth in soil—every detail filters through bone-setter’s tactile gaze and constrains the shoulder-mending beat. Spatial choreography is clean; bodies track from lattice to bench to fountain stone. Weather (wind rearranging hedges) mirrors the shift in moral stance. Object-as-setting qualifies 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—protecting Ari vs facing town justice—tightens once: the shoulder-reset scene forces the narrator’s merciful skepticism into public exposure, cost legible in Ari’s hiss and tomorrow’s backlash. No reversals needed; one deepening suffices. Agency (deciding to speak plain) drives the closure under Accumulative lens. Coincidence merely complicates (hedge wind), never resolves.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: bone-setting as mercy, constellations as redeemed error, tooth as buried guilt—no abstract sermon. Final image of “bright bones of the sky” reweights earlier map sketch and refuses tidy moral balance. Ambiguity lingers: town may still riot, yet garden holds. No final-paragraph thesis statement; resonance is imagistic, earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>First-person voice owns a distinct rhythmic signature: compressed clauses, bone-setter’s anatomical diction, faint archaic tilt (“grass-kneed,” “fae economies”) that stays consistent. No head-hopping; perception narrows to tactile immediacy during the shoulder reduction. Syntax mirrors stress—short bursts for snap, longer lyrical cadence for release. Dialogue sparse but idiomatic when used.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet breatheable; each sentence layers image + emotion + forward motion (“I set more wrists than clocks”). Figurative language is selective, no mixed metaphors in peak beat. Only minor loop: “mistakes into constellations” phrase repeated twice without fresh inflection second time. Otherwise zero scaffold, clean grammar, sharp paragraph cuts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: folk-trope (changeling tooth) repurposed as evidence of community cruelty; bone-setting as metaphor for narrative repair. Hedge-maze secret garden feels new because it functions as clandestine clinic, not escapist idyll. Map-as-constellation sketch reframes error as guidance—an off-beat redemption logic that grows organically from Ari’s character. Risk taken, clarity preserved.</comment>
