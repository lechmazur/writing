<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The machinist’s interior contradiction—trader-aligned skill vs ash-keeper loyalty—stays alive in every micro-choice (chain pacing, burner scraping, vow of song-logging). Emotions are embodied (trembling fingers, sugar-bitter taste) rather than labeled. The final stance—public silence, private song—earns its cost: lifelong vigilance accepted on-page. Only a sliver off because the broker/lover backstory is inferred, not dramatized, softening the highest-stakes motive.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the chain’s catenary becomes the city’s new “readable code,” making fairness mechanical; cost is the machinist’s eternal guardianship, confessed aloud. Causal lattice holds: because lovers salted grief into glue, therefore the residue analysis exposes the sluice scam, therefore the council accepts a song-logged gate. One meaningful tightening—chain sag tracing the mountain’s compromise—reweights stakes under Hybrid lens (causal turn + accumulative image). Orientation is anchored by word 75.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The breathing volcano-amphitheater is not backdrop; its exhalations time every beat and the hidden sluice behind the stage supplies the physical compromise venue. The antique chain functions as micro-setting: its brass sag literally draws the equilibrium line that gates must follow. Sensory hierarchy obeys POV—pressure is heard, tasted, smelled rather than seen. Minor slip: “dormant volcano” never clarified as geologically plausible yet still active; waver keeps it under 9.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—water vs ash—tightens once: discovery of the lovers’ tampered sluice narrows options to either exposed favoritism or a harmonic catenary gate. Protagonist’s agency drives the turn: only his residue test and chain measurement force council consent. Cost is visible—lifelong maintenance vow plus public naming of no names (social risk). Pressure stays coherent under Hybrid lens; no artificial coincidence resolves the conflict.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges as “fairness is engineering when compassion is encrypted into the mechanics.” No moralizing; the final image of gratitude traveling through pipes reweights the premise: governance can be a lullaby, not a decree. Subtext lives in gesture—blank envelope, child’s sleeve-brush—never explained. The lovers’ forbidden union stays off-page, creating lingering irony that the system must serve what it forbids.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lyric first-person voice owns a perceptual signature: sound of brass links as “polite applause,” taste of adhesive as “tea, smoke, miner’s ointment.” Rhythm modulates with breathing volcano cadence; compression during high-stress gate tuning mirrors shortened inhalations. No head-hopping; POV distance stays consistent. Micro-diction slips once—“dappled resolve” is reused verbatim, a faint echo rather than fresh coinage—preventing 9+.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentence-level propulsion is high; every line either advances plot or deepens image. Figurative language is patterned and paid off (pollen-dust verdicts, sugar signatures). No loops, no scaffold, no filter-verb stacks. A single mixed metaphor—“lullaby of patient power”—is mild enough not to dull closure. Read-aloud cadence breathes with the mountain; paragraph cuts are purposeful.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Floodgate machinist who reads moods via valves, compassion encrypted in envelope glue, and compromise measured by chain catenary—synthesis feels non-obvious yet inevitable. Risk in lyric structure pays off: a city’s politics solved by a song-logged gate is fresh. Specific detail (antique chain, sugar-bitter residue) prevents abstract allegory. Conceptual integrity holds; no retreat to generic reconciliation.</comment>
