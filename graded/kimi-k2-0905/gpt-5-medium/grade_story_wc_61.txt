<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The caretaker’s motive is legible and consistent; the brass gear as heirloom and the refusal to repeat ancestral burning give concrete micro-choices. Interiority stays lyrical but embodied (“I rub the gear before I sing the clicks”). The final renunciation—letting petals fall and calling them back—earns a quiet cost, though the child-captain dyad feels more emblematic than individually pressured.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: each shard adds density to the “share light without fire” pattern until the cool-petal transit reweights the stake. Orientation is taught early by sonic echoes and petal geography; no anchor drift. Closure is a Charged Poise: the garden keeps “troubling serenity,” foreclosing flame with felt constraint. Cost is visible in the perpetual re-counting the caretaker accepts.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Nebula garden, brass gear, and sonar pings are specific sensory anchors; the cool lantern-petals constrain tactics by replacing ship-flame. Spatial choreography holds across the single orchard walk. The micro-setting of the gear in palm recharges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“break the inheritance of flame”—is signaled in line 5 and tightens when travelers must power down burners to transit. One meaningful deepening: the captain’s admission of torching a field raises the cost of choosing resonance. Agency stays with caretaker who triggers the petal-rain; travelers’ surrender is reactive, not driving, keeping the score just below top band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through iterated image: light without consumption. Subtext lives in gesture—handing over the gear, lowering the head—never sermon. Final image of “counting again” reweights the premise: mercy is iterative labor, not triumph. No thematic echo or moralizing caps the score just under 9.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>First-person voice sustains a consistent lyric cadence; perceptual signature filters cosmos through horticultural tenderness. Compression (“slow comets,” “moonmilk”) is pattern-taught and paid off. No head-hopping; diction stays within caretaker’s plausible lexicon. Dialogue is minimal but subtextual when the child’s “quiet shaped like yes” replaces speech.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Rhythm modulates from long breathy sentences to clipped “Count the sounds.” Figurative density is high but serves the accumulative design; no mixed metaphors obstruct causality. Occasional near-repetition (“troubling serenity” twice) is intentional motif reinforcement. Zero scaffold or filter-verb stacks; closure image remains clear.</question>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Cosmic horticulture is familiar sf territory, yet the inversion—cool light as anti-flame—feels freshly synthesized through tactile garden labor. Risk-taking in lyric ellipsis pays off because pattern is taught early and closure legible. Specificity of brass gear and sonar botany prevents generic overlay. Not quite a 9 because premise remains recognizable beneath the ornament.</comment>
