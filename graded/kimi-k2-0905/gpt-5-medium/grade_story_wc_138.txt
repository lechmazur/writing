<comment>Immortal’s voice is electric—angles whisper, boredom “has edges now”—but Lio’s interiority is second-hand; his refusal to forgive is told, never embodied. Micro-choice under pressure is thin: the narrator bargains with prisms in summary, not scene, and Lio’s single nod is the only visible trade-off. The cost is abstract (“memories of nights when centuries stuck like frost”)—vivid, yet never forced into a physical beat that locks the change. Still, the voice is so singular that the character lingers as myth rather than cliché.</comment>

<comment>Accumulative/lyric lens taught early: “storms make doors honest” signals that pressure will accrue by resonance, not causality, and closure obeys that contract. Orientation is waived—the deliberate disorientation (“prismatic escondite,” “auroral shelf”) pays off when the corridor of farewells reconfigures space itself. Closure lands as a Charged Poise: “goodbye is the blueprint of the next room” crystallizes options with conceptual cost, no reset. One causality wobble: Lio’s arrival is leaked off-stage, soft-pedaling the intrigue setup, but the lyric pattern absorbs the bump.</comment>

<comment>The escondite, the obsidian trapezoid, and the fragment are micro-settings that double as tools—each hums, warms, or cools to cue spatial rebellion, directly constraining tactics. Sensory economy is ruthless: “spectrum like carefully polished knives” fuses sight with threat in five words. Spatial choreography is immaculate—floor and ceiling trade places, yet bodies never float untracked. Weather is not backdrop but engine: the storm’s red auroras braid the fragment, feeding the mutiny that rewrites the room.</comment>

<grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“what happens after goodbye”—is signaled in paragraph four and tightened when the corridor appears: each step is a syllable that never arrived, narrowing options to witness or retreat. Agency is contemplative but real: the narrator pays with frost-thick centuries, Lio pays with softened refusal—both prices legible in the final image. Escalation is lyrical, not causal: density of farewells accumulates until spatial infrastructure flips, a valid Accumulative turn. No antagonist is needed; the heart’s own bridge-building is the mutiny.</comment>

<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from concrete inversion: farewells become architecture, not erasure. Subtext is woven through spatial metaphor—departure as infrastructure—avoiding abstract sermon. Final image (“blueprint of the next room”) reweights prior material without moralizing, satisfying CR. One flicker of thematic echo: “goodbye is a road too” verges on thesis, but the next sentence buries the claim in action, limiting the dent.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is irreducibly singular: “I whispered to the prisms, promising them exile”—diction that could belong to no other speaker. Perceptual signature is laser-etched: angles whisper, boredom “has edges,” hushed thunder “holds its breath.” Compression and elision are taught by line three and paid off when corridors form from unsaid syllables. No head-hopping; even Lio’s interior is filtered through the narrator’s dimensional ear, preserving distance.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with storm—long sentences swell, then fracture into fragments as space mutinies. Metaphors are high-wire but coherent: “charged wings” and “spectrum like polished knives” share a physics of light and danger. No loops or scaffold; information density is near-optimal—each sentence layers image and stakes. One mixed vehicle: “spectrum like carefully polished knives” conflates light and blade, but the clash is brief and sharpens rather than dulls.</comment>

<grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: solar storm + dimensional mutiny + post-farewell infrastructure fuses cosmology with heartbreak in a way that feels inevitable only after this telling. The amulet fragment that “corrupted straight lines into spirals that tried to remember being roads” is an image no predecessor owns. Risk is high—lyric disorientation could have collapsed into gimmick—but the pattern is taught early and the final blueprint lands clean. Derivative-premise guardrail waived: the concept is too particular to template.</comment>
