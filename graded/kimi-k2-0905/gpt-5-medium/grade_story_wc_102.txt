<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The narrator’s interiority is textured and consistent—light hoarder, breath-tender, mirror-maker who buried love in shelves of unspent hours. Embodied contradiction is dramatized when the camera’s inhale/exhale literally remodels the bridge, forcing an on-page micro-choice that externalizes the internal stalemate. Cost is felt when the glass room becomes a door and the rib-cage pantry unlatches; renunciation of hoarding is earned. Minor: the stranger beats only a faint echo of his own ache; relationship crucible therefore thin, but single-POV default met.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the final river-breath rhythm reweights the premise, leaving a palpable cost—ex-loves decanted, bridge lighter, ribs open. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: every breath deposits a translucent letter until the image thickens to tipping point. Orientation anchor—“twilight viaduct, camera on parapet”—arrives by line 4; no debt. One micro-turn: glass room → door is on-page and pivotal. No causality breaks; metaphor physics stays consistent inside lyric contract.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Viaduct, vine-flowers, and river ribs physically constrain the breathing camera choreography; remove the flowering curve and the inhale/exhale alignment collapses. Micro-tool “Kwan Yin’s tear” doubles as body-adjacent setting when it’s tasted and conducts heat-search for hidden memory. Sensory hierarchy favors haptic over visual—pollen dust on tongue, “attic lungs”—mirrors protagonist’s lens-maker bias. Setting evolves with beats: arches thicken/loosen in real time under breath pressure; no static postcarding.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“where does unused love go?”—is signaled early. Escalation is breath-driven intensification rather than external opposition: each exhale narrows storage options until the body must open. Cost is visible: relinquishing the hoarded sweetness leaves the narrator hollow but river-fed; stranger receives transferable rhythm. No coincidence; pressure coherent under Accumulative lens. Could use slightly sharper external jeopardy to enter 8.5+ band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Theme emerges from concrete pattern: hoarded light → exhaled letters → river reads them. Final image re-prices love as kinetic circulation, not artifact. Subtext resides in gesture: stranger’s mirrored sky-eyes imply collective attic of unspent tenderness. No moralizing sentence tells the thesis; instead pollen acts as golden reasons. Ambiguity lingers—will tomorrow’s breath re-stock the shelves?—inviting reflection without confusion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical first-person achieves a signature perceptual signature—light measured in shelf-hours, river growing ribs, bell-toned rain—maintained without register drift. Syntax swells and contracts with literal breath beats, mirroring camera diaphragm. No dialogue thus no voice convergence; internal diction stays inside plausible spiritual-technologist lexicon. Experimental compression (“a pilgrim of sparks walking inside the lens”) is taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose density high: single sentences carry metaphor, motion, and causality—“I exhale and the arches thicken.” Rhythm modulates responsively; no algorithmic patterns. Mixed metaphors avoided; cloud-lantern, bloom-comet, river-mouth cohere under soft-physics lyric rule. Minor loop: “breath” repeated ten+ times functions as intentional drum rather than churn, but edges toward monotony; prevents full 9.0.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: camera obscura + breath pranayama + bodhisattva tear to solve emotional hoarding. Non-obvious angle on familiar “let go” theme. Risk in extended lyric breath motif pays off by making river a reader of translucent letters. Stranger cameo could feel contrived but is grounded in shared respiratory tuning fork, avoiding gimmick. Transformation test passed; swap specifics and core collapses.</comment>
