<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The coachman’s quiet, needle-threaded patience is embodied in every beat; his decision to trust river-murmur over command drives the crossing. Wren’s entrance adds status pressure, but the relationship shift stays low-stakes. Interior contradiction—hill-borne sorrow vs. water-road acceptance—surfaces in the oar rhythm, earning the final quiet renunciation with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single continuous scene, Accumulative/Textural lens: fog density, stitch-pierce sounds, and gutter-ticking rain layer until the sail-map fusion reweights the promise. Closure is Charged Poise: the yarn-sail flutters with undrowned possibility, cost felt in the coachman’s softened shoulders and the fog’s parting alleys. No orientation drift; who/where/when anchored by lantern, ferry rope, and river slap within 120 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fog, wet bark, and gutter ticks become tactile metronomes that constrain oar cadence; the stitched sail-map is micro-setting that charges closure. Every detail is filtered through the coachman’s hush-listening bias; no postcard listing. Spatial choreography is flawless—hoof-muffled willow to creaking hull to far bank—environment actively steadies or threatens the ferry.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake: deliver the palimpsest promise without erasing fear. Escalation is textural: fog thickens, currents tug, letters bleed through, each stitch tightening the cost of drowning vs. braiding. The protagonist’s agency is rhythmic patience—oar matched to gutter-tick—rather than overt reversal. Cost is legible in the map’s blank spaces and the ferryman’s relieved shrug.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges in braid-versus-erase: storms stitched into lullabies, ancestral tide-marks allowed to show. Subtext lives in the needle’s weightless direction and the final sail’s tremble—no moral spelled out. The image of breathing hills reframes burdens into respiration, recharging earlier sorrow without tidy wisdom.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Lyric third-person intimate, rhythmic compression taught early: “mist braided,” “spindrift serenity.” Syntax mirrors coachman’s ambient listening—long quiet clauses broken by single pierce-stitch beats. No head-hop; Wren’s interior reached only through gesture and his perception. Dialogue sparse, indirection intact: “You look like rain.”</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>High density: each sentence advances atmosphere or choice; no scaffold. Figurative layering is patterned and paid off—fog as muslin, map as horse—never muddled. Rhythm accelerates with oar-ticks, breathes at seam-tie. Zero loops; noun/verb choices precise (“spindrift,”“palimpsest”) without purple inflation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Fog-river crossing with needle-map stitching feels fresh; familiar journey trope inverted into quiet textile cartography. Risk resides in lyric accumulation rather than plot twist; the final sail-map flutter is unforeseeable yet inevitable. Specificity of gutter-metronome and tide-bleed letters anchors universals without abstraction.</comment>
