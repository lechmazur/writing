<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The ripple-mark mapkeeper’s interiority is concrete—she “counts slow taps” and tastes “less brine, more sleep.” A micro-choice under pressure (“I set the echo chamber stone against a rib of calcite”) earns the earned-stasis closure. No secondary character on-page, so relationship crucible N/A; the single-POV interior contradiction (confidence vs. trembling ribs) is dramatized, not labeled. Flaw—overfull beings—compounds mistake and is accepted with visible cost, satisfying 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the bloom of hush petal closes, leaving a persistent constraint—“use this when the world speaks too hard.” Cost is legible in the milk-to-water glow thinning. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern of echo-curling seeds taught early, cadence shift at end. Orientation anchored by word 60 (“In the harmonic caves…”), so no penalty; no lens ambiguity at closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Harmonic caves function as micro-setting: calcite rib and ice drip constrain where the stone must be placed. Echo chamber stone recurs, handled in ≥4 beats, its surface “scored like ancient shorelines” charging final image. Sensory hierarchy adheres—sound (metal-cooled rain) prioritized over sight, matching mapkeeper’s sonic profession. 9+ gate met: tool constraints final tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“find the quiet before maps break”—signaled in first 100 words. One meaningful tightening: the stone’s milk-thick glow narrows options to planting the bloom now. Cost is visible—ice cracks soften, caves’ song “steadied like a held beam.” Agency is attention/renunciation that forecloses future echo-storms; no coincidence resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from sonic metaphor chain: silence as cultivated weather, not moral. Final image reweights prior echoes—“they learn where to be quiet”—without sermon. Motif recurrence (echo, milk, glow) constrains tactics, not ornament. No thematic echo penalty; no final-paragraph thesis statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>First-person lyric voice sustains distinct perceptual signature—“my ribs clatter like thin cups.” Rhythm modulates: long clauses for cave breath, fragment (“blue to the tongue”) at bloom climax. No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens under beings’ glow. Non-standard grammar (“hammered repose”) is pattern-taught early, paid off in final “hammering our repose.”</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence adds density—“bloom of hush lifted without rising.” Metaphors stay coherent within sonic physics. No filter-verb stacks; strong verbs (“grazed,” “fizzing”) drive propulsion. One hairline slip: “weather finally named” edges toward abstraction, but immediacy restored next line.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Premise—mapkeeper cultivates silence from alien choir—is non-obvious synthesis of geology + acoustics. Fresh inflection: “bloom of hush” as canceling wave petal. Risk-taking (lyric accumulation) heightens coherence without gimmickry. Would fail if names swapped; specificity is irreplaceable.</comment>
