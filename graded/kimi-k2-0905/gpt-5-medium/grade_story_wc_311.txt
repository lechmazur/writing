<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The reaper’s grief is embodied in tactile ritual (taping vellum to the lens, lifting the scythe as “cold line for focus”), and the interior contradiction—needing to name fears yet knowing names are only “agreements”—is kept alive to the last line. micro-choices (naming Shoreless, drawing tomorrow’s harbor) visibly cost him: each new name extends his exile-catalogue of sorrow. The absence of Miren on stage keeps relationship-as-crucible from activating, and the one-note occupation (eternal reaper) limits status dynamics, capping the score just below excellence.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: by naming “Shoreless” the reaper rewrites the rule that sacrifices must stay nameless, and the felt cost—his continuing loneliness—glints in the “thin, kind star” on the scythe. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of wax-cylinder fragments, glass creatures, and atlas monsters accretes until the final image reweights the stake. Orientation is clean by line 9; no teleporting props or causal amnesia. One minor loop—“the dome breathed like a sleeping lung left to watch the weather” then “the dome would go on holding distant intimacy”—is a deliberate echo, not oversight, so no deduction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The observatory’s cracked lens, wax cylinders, and salt-eaten acoustics actively constrain tactics: only through “scattered light” can the reaper read the broken syllables. Body-as-setting appears in the trembling hand that steadies the atlas page against the glass, a micro-choice that decides whether Miren’s figure will settle or fly apart. Weather and environment (dusk light, brine metronome) are filtered through grief-narrowed perception, never touristic. Final image—the scythe answering with “a thin, kind star”—charges the tool with emotional cost, satisfying the 9+ gate for object-as-setting; only slight over-painting in the ivy-softening line holds it short of 9.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—turning nameless loss into bearable language—tightens once: the unnamed gull-figure refuses to settle until the reaper risks uttering the winter lamppost phrases, narrowing his options to permanent custodianship of fear-names. Cost is legible: each successful crystallization (“They chimed when they moved”) increases the glass menagerie he must carry tomorrow. Agency remains internal yet decisive; no outside coincidence rescues him. Pressure plateaus rather than spikes again, keeping the score just above the 8.0 threshold.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the inverse equation of naming: to name is to bridge, but bridges demand perpetual toll—his lifelong task of tending the glass choir. Sacrifice is repriced not as noble but as endless clerical labor, a wry commentary on grief-work. Subtext lives in gesture (the atlas page softening like ivy) rather than sermon. The final harbor-drawn smudge offers quiet hope yet admits it may only echo to “someone who needed a name,” preserving ambiguity without moral tag.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays tightly focalized through the reaper’s perceptualFilter: “the dome breathed like a sleeping lung” is exactly the metaphor a death-functionary would invent. Diction—“rasp,” “mire,” “shoreless”—is mined from his professional taxonomy of ends. Rhythmic control peaks under stress: the run of monosyllables in “He named it Shoreless, and the glass wound closed” mimics the click of a lens shutter. No head-hop, no register drift; the only compression (“he would map the dark like old astronomers”) is earned by earlier star-chart analogy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sentences carry double duty: “Words spilled against the glass and began to crystallize into fine cuts on the darkness” advances action while texturing light. Figurative density is high but patterned—each monster, tide, and star reconfigures the same grief—so no artifact penalty. One scaffold moment—“He remembered how she had walked without turning back, and how silence eroded his marrow”—restates prior knowledge yet supplies the micro-cause for the next naming, hence allowed. Read-aloud rhythm varies from long tidal clauses to the clipped “He named it Shoreless,” propelling the close.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The conceit of a reaper cartographer who maps fears by starlight is fresh, yet anchored in concrete process (taping vellum to lens, turning crank). Risk-taking—lyric accumulative structure, glass creatures as emotional prosthetics—pays off when the final star on the blade reconfigures the entire atlas. Specificity of “brine metronome” and “knuckle-read currents” prevents the premise from drifting into allegory. Transformation is total: remove the observatory, cylinders, or atlas and the emotional engine collapses.</comment>
