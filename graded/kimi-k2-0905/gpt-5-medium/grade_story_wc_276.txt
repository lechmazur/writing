<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The fisher’s calm-as-net persona stays consistent; every action (gripping the spike, planting it, letting the map spill back) flows from that trait and costs him his hoarded silence. Interiority is sensuous rather than diagnostic—brine on sleeves, patience in mouth. The only flaw: the “listener with salt for a tongue” retort feels slightly writerly, not yet earned by prior diction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/lyric lens declared on page 1 (“braided music…hills of whisper”) and held; closure is a Conceptual Repricing—by surrendering the coastline-map he has absorbed, the fisher pays an inner cost that reweights the garden’s silence. Orientation (“I stood at its jetty”) arrives by word 18, well under the 120-word waiver. Causality remains associative rather than because/therefore, appropriate to the lyric mode.</comment>

<comment>The sound-wave garden is rendered through tangible acoustic metaphors—tidepools shaped like ears, bass-ripples underfoot—that directly shape how the protagonist moves and listens. Micro-setting (rail spike) becomes tuning-fork and throat, constraining the final gesture of release. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from jetty → hedges → dune → harbor rim. One minor over-richness: “waves rose into antlers and broke into petals” momentarily overloads the visual without new pressure.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—recover the goddess’s name to save the dissolving coast—is signalled early and tightened when the goddess demands the name be wrested from the constellations. Escalation is textural: each transliteration through the spike deepens the cost of listening until surrender is the only path. Agency remains the fisher’s throughout; the final letting-go forecloses personal hoarding in exchange for communal coastline. Cost is felt but could be sharper—no physical toll or irreversible loss is dramatized on-page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme—that listening is an active, sacrificial art—emerges through the spike’s transliterations and the final surrender of the map. No explicit moralizing; the last line’s image of the map spilling back into tide reprises the opening “braided music” with reweighted meaning. Subtext in the constellations’ sleepwalk suggests listeners are also dreamers who must eventually relinquish control. The concept stays coherent while inviting counter-readings (environmental, mythic, psychological).</comment>

<comment>First-person voice sustains a salt-crusted, percussive diction (“I unspooled my line of silence”) that fuses body and seascape. Syntax lengthens and compresses with emotional swell, climaxing in the shortest imperative: “Give it back.” Lyric pattern is taught early (“feral lullaby”) and repaid in the final hush. No head-hopping; even the goddess’s speech is filtered through the fisher’s perception.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>High figurative density is justified because metaphor is the world’s physics; occasional stacked metaphors (“antlers…petals…brow of the harbor”) verge on excess but never break causality or clarity. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or action. Punctuation and tense remain clean; pronoun reference clear despite abstract subject matter. One register wobble: “conceptual repricing” feels academic, but the piece never internalizes that diction.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The fusion of rail-spike-as-tuning-fork with sleepwalking constellations is a startling synthesis that feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk—basing an entire plot on listening rather than overt action—pays off because silence becomes the decisive act. Mythic coast-building goddess folded into acoustic ecology is fresh, not derivative. Specificity of “tidepools shaped like ears” anchors the fantastic in sensory fact.</comment>
