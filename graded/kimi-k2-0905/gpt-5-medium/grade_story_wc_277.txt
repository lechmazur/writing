<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction is vivid—ink-scented nib vs. father’s deadlines—embodied in trembling lens. Micro-choice to seal shutters crystallizes values; cost lands when markets hiccup. Caretaker’s “orbits of regret” speech risks diagnostic-speak but is saved by dust-threaded beard and sleeved thumbs. Flaw: caretaker’s late exposition slightly over-articulates; still, heir’s refusal to retreat charges Earned Stasis.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: because journalist cracks → therefore ascent; because lens shuts → therefore markets stall. Proof-by-contraction wager is the decisive change with conceptual cost—she rewrites the orbit of news itself. Closure image—nib as compass, daylight pouring—reweights premise without moralizing. One micro-turn (caretaker’s astonishment) tightens stakes cleanly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dome, spiral stairs, and lens act as physical logic: shutter movement alters world below. Rosewood nib becomes micro-setting reflected in console glass, constraining final stance. Dust-threaded beard anchors caretaker in tactile history; no white-room syndrome. Weather (snow-smell wind) impinges on breath and timing. Spatial choreography across console and eyepiece stays clean.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—truth vs. control of headlines—signaled in journalist’s cracked call. Tightening occurs when shutter-closure wager forecloses retreat; cost legible in printer halt and exchange hiccup. Agency resides in her intervention, not coincidence. Persistent constraint: once shutter opens again, truth-publishing rules rewrite future editions.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete orbit metaphors—news orbits like planets, regret orbits choices. Final image (daylight pouring like warm inquiry) reweights “orbits of regret” without stating thesis. Subtext in caretaker’s shrug versus printer stall shows complicity. No sermonizing; ambiguity lingers about whether truth will stay uncaged.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>First-person lyric voice maintains perceptual signature: “the dome repeats harmless in a way that sounds like a cough behind a sentence.” Compression taught early—“stairs keep me honest with their patient turning”—paid off in echoing doubt. Syntax breathes with ascent: longer clauses climb, shorter beats halt at shutter. No head-hopping; psychic distance stable.</comment>

<comment>High density: “newsprint heiress carrying my father’s old rosewood pen nib” does three jobs—lineage, object, odor. Rhythm varies: spiral cadence mirrors climb; monosyllabic “hush” lands like shutdown. Metaphor coherence intact—lens as held breath, headlines as tides. Zero loops; no synonym churn. Closing line “a small spike” props final image without over-writing.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: astronomical observatory repurposed as media-orbit manipulator. Nib-as-compass twist recharges heirloom trope. Risk of meta-media critique balanced by sensory specificity—ink, cedar, snow-smell. Conceptual integrity held: no retreat from premise. Emotional specificity—caretaker’s gentle astonishment—avoids stock villain.</comment>
