<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied—“frost after the void,” “taste of river stones”—but the narrator’s decisive shift to joint custody is asserted rather than dramatized in a micro-choice; the emotional thaw is felt yet not visibly paid for in a single beat. Neri and Rae remain mirrors, not fully individuated voices under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the joint-custody verdict reweights the premise, felt through the jar’s hum and the narrator’s draining frost. Accumulative lens holds—pattern of complementary opposites taught early, tightened by the final water/fire swap—though the narrator’s causal role in the verdict is slightly off-stage.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Floating dojo, clouds as breath, jar sending static to teeth—selective sensory triad anchors every beat; the shifting statues and rewriting history evolve the space rather than decorate it. Micro-setting (the jar) literally vibrates to approve the final choice, constraining the custody decision.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stakes—who will awaken the ancestor—tighten once through the water/fire swap that forces joint custody; cost is legible in the narrator’s loss of numbness and the petitioners’ shared burden. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens; no reversal beyond the single cadence shift, sufficient at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of rejoining life through complementary opposites emerges from the sparring choreography and the final shared guardianship; no moralizing, only tasted river stones and static hum. Ambiguity lingers—will two opposites truly keep the mind awake—creating resonance without tidy closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>First-person voice carries a consistent lyric-philosophic texture—“slow rivers of breath,” “key fits a wound”—without losing immediacy; perceptual signature is distinct. No head-hopping; compression and elision (“history rewrites itself”) are taught early and paid off in the final image.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Rhythm modulates from long breathy sentences to short declaratives at climax; figurative language is dense yet purposeful, no mixed metaphors. Minor scaffold: “history rewrites itself” is repeated four times—once too often—slightly dulling the closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Clone-custody duel in a sky-borne dojo where sparring rewrites archival time feels genuinely fresh; the complementary-opposites martial philosophy reframes a legal dispute into embodied ritual. Risky lyric compression is sustained without clarity loss, yielding a singular speculative stance.</comment>
