<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The narrator’s interior contradiction—needing to trust again yet fearing theft of their music—powers every micro-choice from parcel-cutting to ladder-climbing; embodied tension in “the attic smells of glue and cedar, and the pigeons preen like small hearths” grounds the arc. Renunciation of suspicion lands with felt cost when the Mars chip is sewn to Lark, literalizing the gamble. The violinist remains off-page, so relationship crucible is moot; headcount stays legible. Flaw complicity is present but slightly underplayed—no catastrophic mistake is shown, only the memory of one—so the change feels more lyrical than crucible-forged.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a lyric Resonant Reconfiguration: the song rising from the square reweights trust, the cost audible in the chip’s exile. Causal linkage holds—dust-mote map → route choice → Lark’s launch → music returned—without gaps. Orientation is secure by line 4; no penalty. Lens is Accumulative/Textural: density of paper/dust/bird imagery tightens into the final chord. The only drag is the soft coincidence of the violinist being ready; because it complicates rather than resolves, it stays within lens tolerance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Attic as micro-setting constrains every tactical choice—dust motes become wind map, beam becomes perch, Mars chip counterweights slips. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven: foxed atlases and buckled ledgers noticed first, smell of glue last, mirroring the archivist’s priorities. Spatial choreography is immaculate; bodies, birds, boxes, hatch track cleanly. The final image reuses the skylight, now “blooming withering,” charging setting with closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—trust vs. theft of voice—tightens once: past betrayal → current parcel gamble. Escalation is textural: paper trails thicken, dust corridor narrows, Lark’s launch crystallizes risk. Visible price is the surrender of the meteorite shard and the exposure of the song; cost is legible. No reversal or external antagonist beyond memory, so pressure plateaus rather than spikes; still sufficient for lyric mode.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from iterative swap of paper for song, silence for sound, suspicion for release; no explicit thesis stated. Subtext lives in gesture—tying the chip to Lark’s leg speaks apology louder than confession. Final image reweights “echo of lost songs” as communal, not private, achieving resonance without moral. Ambiguity lingers: the violinist might still steal, but the narrator accepts that cost—complexity embraced.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>First-person lyric voice sustains a distinct perceptual signature: meteorite as “cooled ember from another trustless sky,” dust motes as “roomsized winds.” Syntax compresses under pressure—“I climb the beam… balance on wood that remembers storms”—without losing clarity. No dialogue, so voice distinction bullet is waived. Register remains poetic yet internally coherent; patterned elision (“we trade scraps, not names”) is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; most sentences carry two jobs (image + motion). Metaphors stay coherent—dust as clock, pigeons as hearths—no mixed vehicles. One minor loop: “paper trails braid our days, ledger to margin, feather to fingertip” restates the same braid twice; −0.2. No artifacts touch closure. Read-aloud rhythm varies; paragraph cuts are purposeful.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fusion of carrier-pigeon espionage with attic archivist is fresh; dust-mote cartography feels inevitable yet unseen. Mars meteorite as trust-calibrator transforms familiar token into emotional scale. Risk taken: lyric accumulation over plot reversals, paid off by resonant closure. Specificity—foxed atlases, orphaned hymn bars—prevents generic “artist betrayed” template. Synthesis feels singular, not checklist.</comment>
