<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Auricle/namer’s interiority is vivid—‘I test names the way dentists test nerves’—and the final refusal to drop the letter is an Earned Stasis that costs him the clean getaway he once sought; the only flaw is a touch of self-diagnosis in the chalk epiphany.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>A pure Accumulative/Textural arc: each sensory layer (heat, grit, violin note) tightens the choice until ‘meaning arranges itself like a flock’; the final Charged Poise—hand still holding the envelope—pays every image with felt cost and no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The arcade’s stone, benches, and chalk constrain every tactical move (kneeling, sliding, reading); the ‘ebony clipboard’ becomes micro-setting that warms under sun and vibrates under music—environment directly shapes the naming decision.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Pressure mounts by textured accretion: each chalk symbol decoded, each arch passed, narrows the option field until only one alias survives; the busker’s note is the visible price that crystallizes the stake in the body of the namer.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</question><comment>The story’s emergent theme—names as movable shelters against time’s glare—remains implicit; the final ear-shaped seal reweights every earlier echo of listening without ever moralizing, giving the reader quiet conceptual repricing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical first-person with consistent perceptual signature—sound of tuning violin ‘warms the stones,’ chalk read by knees—syntax lengthens and contracts with breath; no filter-verb clutter, no head-hop, fully earned compression.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Every sentence carries dual duty (image + causality): ‘digital highways…glare erases chalk’ distills the central paradox in nine words; zero loops, zero mixed metaphor, rhythm modulates from staccato chalk list to the long release of the final flock image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The ‘pseudonym creator via sidewalk chalk’ premise is fresh, but the deeper ingenuity is making nostalgia operate forward: the letter must age into meaning; the risk of withholding the drop heightens stakes without gimmickry, creating inevitable-in-hindsight closure.</comment>
