<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The narrator’s rational, truth-bound persona is vividly embodied in micro-choices—smearing clay to hide the eye, deciding what honesty need not reveal—yet the interior contradiction between evidence-seeking and relic-faith could be pushed further under patrol threat. The final “eye grows warm” moment registers earned endurance, but the cost feels lightly weighted against the stakes already survived.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the orchard steadies, the eye holds communal pain, and the narrator accepts perpetual foraging under persistent truth—cost is felt in the final image. Causal chain holds: smuggle → patrol interrogation → occlusion tactic → communal ritual → stasis with lingering warmth. Orientation is swift; only the patrol’s off-stage withdrawal is a mild ellipsis, but it serves the situational lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The hanging orchard, storm-beaten planks, and clay-smeared copper eye constrain every tactical move; the ravine’s sway literally keeps inspectors at bay. Sensory selection is POV-tuned—truffle scent, moss veins, rope bounce—and the orchard’s creak charges the final image of collective endurance.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—collective psychological survival via honesty—tightens when patrol lamps force the occlusion tactic; the communal eye-ritual then forecloses isolation. Cost is visible: relic risked, laughter cracked, shared pain exposed. One meaningful deepening suffices; no reversal is needed under situational lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme—safety as shared vulnerability, not secrecy—emerges through the eye’s glass gaze and communal laughter that snags. Final image of the warming eye reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext in patrol standoff and hive-of-skin metaphor keeps complexity intact.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>First-person voice carries a distinct rational-lyric texture: “rational truffle forager,” “veined advice of my rational odd mind.” Syntax tightens under patrol threat; diction stays within lexicon. No head-hopping; psychic distance modulates cleanly.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and rhythm; figurative language is selective, never clustering in high-pressure beats. No loops or scaffold. Strong verbs (“storms had planed,” “laughter snagged”) and concrete nouns propel momentum. Minor elevated phrase—“fractured grace is the only style we have left”—reads earned, not purple.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Empathy virus + antique glass eye as communal confessional is fresh; rational truffle forager guides the concept with occupational specificity. Risky lyric accumulation pays off in the warming-eye closure. Transformation test passes: swap truffle/eye/orchard and the arc collapses.</comment>
