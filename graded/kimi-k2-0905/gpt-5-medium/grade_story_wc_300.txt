<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The inspector’s interior contradiction—trained to seal bunkers, now seeking communion—is dramatized in the heartbeat of hesitation where the pearl is crowned; that micro-choice carries palpable cost as the badge’s authority is silently renounced. Emotion is embodied (eyes sting, palm brightens inward) rather than labeled. The shift from auditor to conduit is fully earned, not asserted, and the flaw of mistaking safety for solitude is confronted without therapeutic self-talk.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Charged Poise: the pearl’s placement reconfigures the cave, the bunker, and the inspector’s vocation in one quiet click; the cost is the inspector’s forfeiture of regulatory certainty, felt in the vow signed with silence. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout—images braid, density increases, and the final image reweights every etched confession. Causality remains intact: the shell, the pearl, and the directive spiral all precede the crown act. No orientation debt; who/where/when is clear by line 5.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The quartz spire functions as micro-setting that physically crowns the pearl, charging the final image; the cave’s hush and light-veins constrain the inspector to turn off sensors and later to listen instead of seal. Sensory detail is selective (frozen rain, scalloped throat) and filtered through professional wariness. Spatial choreography is clean: alcove → shell → spire → bunker door track without drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</question><comment>Dominant stake—“dissolve the walls between hearts”—is signaled early; pressure tightens when the directive spiral forces the inspector to choose between sealing the bunker or crowning the spire. The hesitation heartbeat is the decisive tightening that forecloses isolation and costs the inspector’s institutional authority. Agency is internal but visible; no outside antagonist required. Cost is legible: the pearl dims as radiance migrates outward, the door rewrites itself, and the inspector signs with silence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the braid of canned-peach lullabies, shallow-breathing sobs, and cultivated-pearl light—love persists inside armored spaces. The final image of daylight as “a door made of faces” offers a Conceptual Repricing that reweights every prior confession without moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture (bow without knowing to whom) and in the shell’s impossible depth. No thematic echo or final-paragraph thesis statement; resonance is felt, not told.</question>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>First-person voice is distinct—sensor-clicking auditor who notices “frozen rain” and “patient lace of ghost rivers”—syntax compresses under pressure (“I hesitated, and the moment opened”). Patterned elision (“I signed with silence”) is taught early and pays off at closure. No dialogue, so voice convergence is irrelevant. Psychic distance tightens from panoramic cave to palm-brightening pearl without unmotivated shifts.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Rhythm modulates from longer, image-stacked openings to clipped hinge-click final sentences; no template cadence or synonym loops. Metaphors are coherent (cave as listening ear, pearl as seed) and do not collide. Information density is high: “sensors ticked…clicked rude” carries setting, character, and theme in one line. Closure image is uncluttered, free of scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fusion of bunker-audit protocol with lyric confession-shell is fresh; the pearl grown from a tear reframes survivalism as emotional husbandry. Risk—quiet renunciation instead of explosive release—heightens coherence and pays off in the final hush that travels out of the cave. Specificity (scalloped alcove, canned-peach lullabies) prevents abstraction. Transformation test fails if any element is swapped; the story is inseparable from its crystal cave and seashell spiral.</comment>
