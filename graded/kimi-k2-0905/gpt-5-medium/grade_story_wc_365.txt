<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The sensory-map-maker persona is lived-in: every beat filters through scent, pressure, haptic memory. Interior contradiction—child-as-saboteur versus adult-as-cartographer—plays out in the micro-choice to re-witness, not erase, the log. Embodied cost arrives when the shard warms against palm accepting irreversible weight. Flaw: the mother’s silence is told more than dramatized, but the protagonist’s self-reintegration is earned and specific.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the protagonist re-weights her own childhood act as survivable cartography, not shame. The shard-refracted photolog supplies the decisive image; the final redirection of others’ paths shows the cost exported outward. Causal lattice holds: each universe-thread plants the same fuel-coupler command, tightening to the single moment the adult now owns. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) is taught early and paid off in the last “bay unlocked across differences.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting never stalls; every fixture—chains, frost, coolant coughs—doubles as sensory datum the map-maker weaponizes. The bay’s layout stays spatially coherent across mosaic shards; tools arranging themselves like a prayer wheel charges later image of “lanterns for the lost.” Micro-setting triumph: the shard itself becomes portable planet-scape. Gate met: recurring object constrains final redirection tactic.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—truth-weight of the sealed locks—tightens once the photolog replays child-redirect; options narrow from mystery to culpability. Escalation is textural: each parallel bay adds density until the same sighing coupler is unbearable. Cost visible: protagonist forfeits innocence in real time, shoulders responsibility for survivors-by-accident. No external reversals needed; internal pressure suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges without label: maps that lie become decoration; honest charts include the mapper’s crime. Subtext lives in gesture—mother squeezing shoulder to slow pulses—silence deleting logs. Final reconfiguration: “redirect” flips from betrayal to rescue strategy. Ambiguity preserved: no moral is stated, only the scent of metal and rain.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is lyric-cryptic yet sensuously precise: “planetary aurora poured into cheap tempered glass” is unforgettable. Patterned elision (“cyclically spontaneous”) is taught by line 3 and paid off in the child’s looping hand. No head-hopping; focalization glides across universes while remaining first-person anchored. Syntax flexes with pressure—fragments appear only when photolog strobe demands.</comment>

<comment>Read-aloud rhythm is deliberate, incantatory; sentence length modulates to mirror tidal rhythm of parallel shifts. No synonym loops; each metaphor extends the sensory map (“smell of metal and rain” becomes unit of weight). High information density: one sentence often layers scent, memory, and world-rule. Micro-slip: “redirect” used 10×; intentional refrain but borders template cadence—doesn’t dull closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Folding quantum multiverse into haptic grief-cartography is fresh; scent-as-coordinate re-sets portal tropes. Risk: lyric mosaic could obscure causality, yet pattern-teaching keeps legibility. The ethical inversion—child’s sabotage = community survival—avoids easy redemption. Specificity: shard refracts alarms, mother deletes logs with coat-covered console; these particulars could not transplant to another tale unchanged.</comment>
