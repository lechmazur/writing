<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The net-mender’s patient, observant interiority stays concrete—fingers “mapping hidden patterns,” wrists learning “tenderness under strain.” Contradictory impulses (showing vs. hiding effort) coexist in the same beats, giving credible complexity. The final handing-off of the whisk is an earned renunciation that forecloses the mentor path with visible social cost; however, the townspeople’s chorus remains largely functional, preventing the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of noticing → gathering → gifting. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the whisk transfer crystallizes the new communal stance; fireflies in the bowl make the cost of future neglect undeniable. Orientation anchored by line 3; no lens ambiguity. Price is persistent: the child now carries the burden of seeing. Meets 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Parapet stones, gutter water, and fireflies are filtered through the mender’s repair-eye; each detail either guides footing or becomes thread in the verbal net. The bamboo whisk’s tines serve as micro-setting that constrains the final bowled galaxy; without it, the closing image collapses. Spatial choreography is clean across the collective squatting and wiping. Meets 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—make invisible labor visible—tightens through each demonstrative beat: silent tea whisking → whistled echo → communal wiping. Escalation is textural: density of named invisible workers accumulates until councilor’s sash is sacrificed, felt price on page. No causal reversals, but pattern break is sufficient under Accumulative lens. Lacks one sharper constraint that would push 8.8+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges entirely from metaphor chain—nets, knots, froth, lichen—never sermonized. Final image of “narrow lanes of borrowed brightness” reweights prior material without moral statement. Ambiguity is meaningful: the town may still forget, but the child now bears the perceptual apparatus. No thematic echo penalty; insight is dramatized, not asserted.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>First-person voice carries a distinct perceptual signature: tactile precision (“wet cord memories a hand”), synesthetic leaps (“lantern throats”). Syntax tightens under communal pressure—final sentences shorten to imperative cadence. No head-hopping; collective “we” stays coherent. Whisk metaphor sustained without register drift. Minor firefly image repetition (−0.1) keeps from 9.0.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with task beats: long sentence for net-mending, staccato for firefly flicker. Figurative language is patterned (water threads, lantern throats) and paid off in bowl galaxy—no mixed-metaphor clutter. One paraphrase loop (“swells, collapses, and swells again”) is purposefully tidal, not artifact. High information density: single sentence often layers tool, body, and philosophy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Freshens the “quiet demonstration” trope by making silence the fireworks. Synthesis of net-repair + tea-whisk-storm is organic, not checklist; removal of either strand collapses the closure image. Moon-path navigation and scintillatingly somber fireflies feel inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric accumulation paid off with coherent closure under Accumulative lens—earns +0.3 bonus.</comment>
