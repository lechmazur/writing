<question>1</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Interiority is sensory-rich ("ache that arrives when something nearby wants to metamorphose"), but the narrator’s covert motive never visibly collides with on-page risk; choices are passive listening and cleaning until the final unforced acceptance. The single micro-choice—planting the arrowhead—arrives late and wins instant assent, so the cost feels abstract rather than wrested from prior contradiction. Earned stasis is asserted, not dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the garden inhales, re-weighting the premise with undeniable pressure. Causality is dream-logic ("the floor inhaled, and something below exhaled me") but holds within an Accumulative/Textural lens; pattern of breath, swing, and root growth teaches the rule early. Orientation is sketchy—no city name or garden layout until midpoint—but the lyric disorientation pays off in the final stair of vertebrae, so waiver applies. Cost is conceptual yet legible: the keeper must be kept.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The garden acts as micro-setting that constrains every move: swinging bulbs dictate gravity, roots guide touch, the drain offers the only descent. "Gravitationally playful" is not decorative; it choreographs the final staircase. Sensory hierarchy holds—the narrator notices soil scent, iron-tasting smiles, gravel weeping backward—filtered through cryptid-trained attention. Final image recharges the swinging bulbs as attendant constellations, locking place to closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will the narrator survive revelation?—is signaled early but remains atmospheric; escalation is poetic density rather than narrowing options. The phone-voice deepens knowledge, yet no concrete consequence threatens until the stair appears; agency is largely receptive. Persistent constraint (must keep silence while soil edits spines) is felt, but the final yes costs nothing that was previously foreclosed. Suitable for Accumulative lens, but pressure plateaus rather than tightens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges as metamorphosis of bitterness into shared, laugh-laden witness; the cosmic joke is shown when seedlings stand like citizens rather than declared. Arrowhead-tooth reprise reweights prior vanishings without moralizing. Final image resists tidy comfort—morning returns "without changing what it loved"—preserving ambiguity. Subtext thrives in silence: the herbalist’s unreadable smile, the phone’s copper taste.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>First-person voice owns a consistent perceptual signature: cataloguing bones in buckets, hearing gravel weep, tasting patience like iron. Lyric compression ("broom in hand, catalog in mind") is taught early and paid off in the final constellations of buckets. No head-hopping; psychic distance contracts under pressure to fragmentary pulses ("draft lifting the hairs on my wrists"). Register stays inside the narrator’s plausible lexicon; even cosmic jokes remain grounded in janitor choreography.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Rhythm modulates with breath-based cadence that mimics the garden’s inhale/exhale; sentence length varies to avoid drumbeat. Some metaphor density in peak beat—"seedlings stood up like citizens"—but pattern is taught and purposeful. Occasional filter stacks ("I told the tooth… I promised to witness") yet immediacy returns via tactile verbs. No loops or paraphrase artifacts; information is multiplexed without scaffolding.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Cryptid-janitor, arrowhead-tooth, and harmony untamed synthesize into a fresh emotional ecology; the premise feels inevitable in hindsight yet non-obvious. Transformation test passes:换掉names and the root-song of remade spines collapses. Gravitational play and soil-edited vertebral stairs take bold spatial risk that heightens meaning without gimmickry. Risk distinction +0.3 awarded.</comment>
