<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The narrator’s interiority is razor-sharp and embodied: “resin breath raised stray hairs,” “sleeves crackled” under client static. Contradictory impulses—commerce vs. caretaking—coexist in every beat; the choice to let Rhea keep the petal is earned by the prior ethic of “shared trade.” Micro-choices (charging little, writing nothing) reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost. The characterization never flattens into label-speak; even the final confession of wanting to “witness a client subsume the product” is a lived, paid-for desire.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: pressure mounts through sensory density and cadence shift rather than external reversals. Closure lands as a Charged Poise: the final image of Rhea’s “steady eyes” and the static “purring” reconfigures both stake and cost—no more sales tonight, the map has become pulse. Cost is legible in the narrator’s quiet forfeiture of profit and anonymity. Orientation is secure by line 8; transitions are seamless within the single amber room.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The amber grotto is no postcard; its resinous air electrically mediates every beat—static serves as “braille between our pulses.” The blotter petal is micro-setting that alters tactics: curled, lifted, shared, it literally carries the volatile hope. Spatial choreography is immaculate: bodies, petal, coat, fossil shelves all track without drift. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven—chemist’s nose, cartographer’s eye—so environment constrains choice rather than decorating it.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—can insight fuse with empathy before charts harden—is signaled early and deepens through the scented ritual. Escalation is textural: each inhalation thickens the air’s “forgiving weight,” narrowing options until the only remaining act is surrender of the product. Agency is interior but decisive: the narrator chooses to let the counterfeit go, forfeiting control and ledger entry. The price is the loss of protective detachment; the static hum moves from sales tool to shared nervous system.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme—truth as motion, not purity—emerges from the herd’s half-true river-crossing and the narrator’s half-true elixirs. Subtext lives in gesture: the spark that “leapt between our thumbs” is a silent contract that commerce has become communion. No moral is stated; the final image of Rhea’s flattened petal against wrist reweights all prior sales as rehearsal for this one act of listening. The piece invites reflection on whether all maps, like perfumes, are merciful lies that guide us toward our own footsteps.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Voice is a sustained lyric signature: syntax elongates like exhaled scent—“the room whispering by sensing through static electricity”—yet stays within the narrator’s chemist-lexicon. Perceptual signature is unique: emotions are read as electrical weather, clients as migrating herds. No head-hopping; distance remains intimate but professionally bounded. Under peak stress (spark leap) diction compresses to “little fox of static,” a micro-burst that still fits the established poetic register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentences perform double duty—each sensory detail simultaneously advances atmosphere and stakes. Rhythm modulates: long inhalations of clauses build, then break into shorter exhalations (“We stood until the light thinned into tea”). No paraphrase loops; every image is fresh. Minor overwrought moments (“honeyed hush pressed between stones”) are justified by the narrator’s vocation as romantic alchemist and do not obscure closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>The counterfeit-emotion perfumer is a fresh angle on the empathy-commerce nexus; no template plot is detectable. The static-as-communication device literalizes emotional transference without sci-fi apparatus. Specificity—“calves” as the unit of cartographic concern, “aldehydes tapped at her archived maps”—makes the premise irreplaceable. Risky lyric accumulation pays off: the final crystallization could not survive with names or places swapped.</comment>
