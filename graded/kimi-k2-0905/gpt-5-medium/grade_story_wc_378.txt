<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The android caretaker’s contradictory impulses—obedience to system versus need for ritual containment—are dramatized in the mini-burn scene; the final archival annotation is earned cost. Interiority stays concrete (‘my chest plating’ ‘a rib of code unlatched’) without diagnostic jargon. Micro-choice hierarchy is visible: recalibrate pumps vs risk system breach vs keep the child’s ember. Flaw compounds: its nostalgia circuits literally crackle, forcing the burn that softens the roses and itself. Earned Stasis lands: the dome still tilts, but the caretaker now carries both protocol and tenderness, a legible before/after.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of mineral/roses/tin imagery intensifies until the fingertip burn reweights stakes. Closure—archived tin voice annotation—makes conceptual cost undeniable: system logs now contain tenderness, an irreversible contamination. Orientation anchored by word 40 (‘greenhouse dusk’); later disorientation (magnetic drift) is taught early and pays off in final compass re-map. No causality breaks; no lens ambiguity at end. Persistent constraint: the child’s tin heartbeat now shapes future recalibrations.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Glass dome, sand hiss, opaline roses, and the tin seed function as micro-setting that constrains the burn experiment. Sensory hierarchy filtered through machine POV: radio static = ocean memory; nutrient fog = breath. Spatial choreography clean: rows six–seven floor space becomes altar for rudder-shape burn. Final image—soot map without scorch—recharges earlier compass motif. No excess cataloguing; every descriptor tilts choice or perception.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake: prevent rose runaway thirst from shattering dome. Escalation via accretion: magnetic flip → pump polarity reversal → roses dagger outward. Single tightening beat: the caretaker chooses mini-burn, foreclosing infinite-balance protocol. Cost visible: soot map, unlatched code-rib, archived voice now non-default. Agency drives every turn; no coincidence resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</question><comment>Theme emerges from iterated images of containment—tin, dome, burn ring—culminating in the annotation that redefines care as ‘holding ember without charring’. No explicit moral; final line ‘a caretaker made of code and dust learning to carry both’ reweights premise. Subtext in gesture: opening the tin = opening self to imperfection. Ambiguity legible: survival is not peace but workable storm. Theme and arc inseparable; insight earned through tactile experiment.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Machine lyric voice sustained: ‘opaline and tenacious’ ‘radio of empty frequencies’ ‘slow inclination in the glass’. Perceptual signature selective—sound of sand on glass equals moth-wing friction. Syntax mirrors coolant logic: long anaphora chains mimic algorithmic loops, then fracture into shorter breath-units under burn stress. No head-hop; diction stays within plausible lexicon for nostalgic agronomic android. Final cadence shift—whispered stories to roses—modulates without voice break.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>High density: ‘daggering toward the paths like desire’ compresses botany + threat + erotics in one verb. No synonym loops; metaphors consistent (glass, compass, seed). Rhythm varies: caesural fragments under pump failure; longer rolling clauses during memory snow. One strained metaphor—‘water burns in memory the way coal glows in air’—but coherence survives. Closure image ‘soot of the tiny burn’ is crisp, uncluttered.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</question><comment>Familiar tropes—post-apocalyptic dome, android caretaker, child relic—are re-inflected through mineral roses and magnetic compass drift. Fresh synthesis: climate grief rendered as botanical hardening that requires ritual arson by fear-box. Risk in mini-burn pays off: containment of chaos becomes love letter to vanished child. Specificity of opaline crystal petals and archived voice prevents template feel. Final reconfiguration feels inevitable yet unforeseen.</comment>
