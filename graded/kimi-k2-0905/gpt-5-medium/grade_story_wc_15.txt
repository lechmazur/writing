<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sera’s interior contradiction—optimism as stubbornness—drives every beat; the tether-sewing micro-choice literalizes her refusal to surrender and forecloses retreat. Embodied emotion (“I cannot breathe their absence without doing”) keeps therapy-speak at bay. The final renunciation—leaving the plate—costs her the talisman and earns the town’s new steadiness. Only the elders’ off-stage “say” keeps her from full 9+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/texture lens: the overlapping sleep-map pattern is taught by 25 % and paid off when the chalk crossings literally open the sluices. Closure is a Conceptual Reprice: the harbor bell rings itself, reweighting “salvage or surrender” to “continual yes.” Cost is legible in the plate’s relinquishment and the tether’s transfer to children. Orientation anchors (tide-empty clock, red canyon) arrive inside 120 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The red canyon breathes rust and thyme; mirror-basins remember storms—setting constrains pace and footfall. The tether functions as micro-setting, its knots dictating where Sera can safely retreat. Spatial choreography stays clean: left turn → throat → chamber → altar, all tracked with ink-dots. Only the town’s off-stage reaction keeps it from 9+.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“salvage or surrender”—tightens when the wall loosens its breath and Sera must decide: retreat with plate or leave it as harbor seed. One meaningful deepening: the nets stop grieving once their names are sewn. Cost is the plate itself, surrendered to stone. Escalation is accumulative: each chalk crossing adds weight until the final sluice exhale.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from concrete particulars: orphan-rope, banned plate, sleepwalk cartography—“broken precedents” reconfigured into shared precedent. Final image of children tracing names on the pier offers non-literal answer: ceremony > salvage. No moralizing; the bell rings itself as conceptual reprice. Ambiguity lingers—will the canyon keep breathing?—without confusion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>First-person voice carries salt-soaked perceptual signature: “meter from rope and salt before letters,” “lullaby of small persistence and shy thunder.” Syntax lengthens and contracts with canyon constriction; no head-hopping. Diction stays inside coastal idiom—“wharf weaver,” “orphaned lines,” “barnacles release their rusted earrings.” Compression taught early (“overlapping sleepwalking paths”) pays off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Rhythm varies from long anaphoric breaths to clipped ink-dot beats; no template cadence. Figurative language is selective: “anemones tuck in like closed eyes” sharpens the moment without clutter. No mixed metaphors; salt, rope, and bird motifs stay coherent. Information density high—every sentence advances character, setting, or atmosphere.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fusion of sleep-cartography, banned storybook plate, and rope-tether ceremony feels fresh and inevitable. Transformation test fails if relocated: the red canyon’s carved precedent-logic and tidal clock are site-specific. Risk—lyric mosaic with no antagonist—heightens stakes without gimmickry. Slight echo of “ labyrinth answers to precedent and penance” treads familiar mythic language, keeping it sub-9.</comment>
