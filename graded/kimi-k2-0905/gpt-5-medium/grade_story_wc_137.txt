<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>A single, consistent first-person voice carries contradictory skepticism and protective warmth; every micro-choice—offering tea, aligning the tile, surrendering the shell—springs from the declared motive. Interiority stays embodied (“ink looked like her ship’s wake”) rather than diagnostic. The moment of endurance/renunciation is the quiet choice to keep the tower door open: the cost is lifelong custodianship of others’ grief with no promise of belief—earned and felt.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern density (tile sums, whale spirals, ink geometries) keeps tightening until the silence “pours” and a conceptual re-pricing occurs—grief is not solved but given shared geometry. Closure is the crystallized image of two chairs in an immaterial “room,” a Charged Poise that reweights the premise: reflection itself becomes a forensic act with perpetual custodial cost. Persistent constraint: the keeper must transcribe endlessly; this shapes every prior beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Stone ribs, whale breath, salt chimes—setting is tactile, smelled, heard; parapet, transit scope, and tile are tools that literally steer attention and choice. The whale-road and cold-front arrival time the final alignment; tower architecture allows the tile-to-scope placement that triggers the closure image. Micro-setting (the shell’s whorl mirroring a constellation) constrains the pen’s spiral and final inscription. Setting evolves with weather and migration, never wallpaper.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: can disciplined pattern-making create a habitable space for grief without supernatural surrender? Escalation is textural—each new pattern (logbook smudges, tile sums, whale arcs) thickens the silence until refusal to “traffic in ghosts” softens into co-creating the immaterial room. Tightening beat: placing the shell in the center square irrevocably fuses data and memory; refusal to claim magic while still occupying the room forecloses pure rational exit. Cost is perpetual custodianship of others’ unfinished stories.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through iterative images: listening as friction that warms frozen passageways. Subtext resides in gestures—laying tea, aligning corners, leaving the shell—more than exposition. Final image of two chairs re-weights “sympathetic skeptic” into secular priesthood: meaning is made by patterned attention, not belief. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers—room may be projection, but its social cost (lifelong service) is undeniable.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Lyric, slightly archaic diction (“flukes sketched time,” “patient metronomes”) stays within a stargazer-auditor’s lexicon. Syntax lengthens and shortens with tidal rhythm; comma-phrase waves mimic inhalation. No head-hop; perception stays strictly to skeptical keeper—uncertainty is voiced, not claimed omnisciently. Patterned elision (“I began to transcribe what I saw, not words but…”) is taught early and paid off in final spiral script.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>High-density lines (“whales rose, leaving spirals of air that matched old ink drawings”) perform triple duty: motion, metaphor, linkage. No synonym loops; each sensory stroke is new. Metaphors are physically coherent—stone ribcage, whale breath as metronome—never mixed. Final paragraph cadence slows to match dawn pallor, creating a paragraph cut that changes emotional charge. Zero scaffolding; no filter-verb stacks.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fusion of magic square, whale migration, and archival grief is fresh; trope of “mystical object” is secularized into data-coherence tool. Conceptual risk—story resolves into invisible room rather than ghost—pays off by reweighting skepticism as custodial ethic. Specific detail (tile sums, shell whorl) prevents abstract anywhere-setting. The unheard symphony metaphor threads through without late gimmick, making quiet ending feel inevitable yet non-obvious.</comment>
