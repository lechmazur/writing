<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The historian’s desire for forbidden knowledge is vividly interior (“hunger of drought”), but the only choice that visibly costs her is the refusal to bargain with the tablets; the final “alignment” remains abstract rather than embodied. The bronze child functions as a catalyst, not a crucible, so relational pressure is muted. Still, the micro-choice of irregular steps to evade the archive’s pattern is specific and character-particular, earning the high-mid band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: the archive’s morphing architecture and cascading images tighten the stake in “permissions to feel.” Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—”to pursue forbidden knowledge is to love responsibly”—with undeniable social cost. The only minor drag is the late introduction of the bronze child who delivers the compass; because she appears after midpoint, causality feels slightly spoon-fed rather than earned in sequence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The archive itself is the micro-setting that constrains every move: hexagram tiles dictate gait, sideways stairs force new knees, the lake-ceiling reconfigures memory. “Twilight here was a verb” is a charged Poise image that repays the pattern. Spatial choreography is flawless—no floating rooms—and the bronze pagoda’s seed-pod opening is a tactile pivot that later folds back into shelves, reweighting the space.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>The dominant stake—permission to feel honestly—tightens when the chorus of names threatens to wound the speaker. The protagonist’s agency is the refusal to chant in pattern, which forces the lake to release its withheld images; this narrowing of method is the single meaningful deepening. Cost is felt in the final breath-exchange: “we could not steal… but we could be altered,” a conceptual forfeiture that forecloses conquest.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: knowledge as responsibility rather than conquest. The refrain “end of innocence” is reweighted from metaphor to calibration device in the final line, a CR that makes the stakes social rather than personal. No moralizing paragraph intrudes; the after-effect is the reader’s recognition that archives do not store facts but licenses to grieve.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The first-person voice is a perceptual signature: “dust rose… practicing breath,” “dyed my fingertips with rumors of vanishing.” Lyric compression is pattern-taught early (“twilight here was a verb”) and paid off at exit. No head-hopping; even the bronze child’s speech is filtered through the historian’s astonished ear. Rhythm modulates from incantatory long sentences to the clipped final teaching moment, aligning heartbeat with archive breath.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</question>
<comment>Sentences are dense but never congested: “I blinked without rhythm, stepped irregularly, and hummed no melody” does three jobs—action, evasion, character. Only one scaffold echo—“the lake was remembering fire / I saw…”—but it serves accumulative cadence rather than loop. Metaphors stay coherent under physical logic; no mixed vehicles. Final line “anguished joy that keeps opening rooms” is irreplaceable; removing it would gut the resonance.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>The archive that rearranges itself by breath and the compass that points to yesterday’s honest mistake are fresh syntheses of familiar tropes (living library, moral compass). The inversion—scholars must un-learn pattern to gain access—feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk is maximal: a wholly lyric, non-causal structure in under 800 words, yet closure remains legible. Specificity of “queen tossing gold coins into wells to buy humility” prevents abstract everywhere-setting.</comment>
