<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The protagonist’s timidity-to-song arc is embodied in micro-choices—handing over the hair, singing the wavering note—each carrying visible cost. Interiority stays concrete (“the tug of combs…cursing softly”) rather than diagnostic. The locksmith stays enigmatic yet purposeful, his minimal dialogue and ritual bowing revealing status and intent. The final renunciation of fear is earned through these staged, embodied beats, foreclosing the “no” path with felt vocal risk.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the song reweights the premise—loss becomes invitation—under an Accumulative/Textural lens. The broken-mirror courtyard crystallizes meaning and cost in one image; the sky’s hum answers with undeniable social/emotional price. Causality is intact: each symbolic action (hair placed, ribbon released) tightens the pattern toward the audible release. No orientation or lens ambiguity; transitions are legible, pattern taught early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The courtyard of mirror shards functions as micro-setting that literally angles the protagonist’s path and reflects interior rooms, constraining movement and charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective—velvet dusk, wet-teeth glint—filtered through lyric POV bias. Spatial choreography is clean: locksmith steps, path forms, mirrors inhale. Weather/starlight causally shapes the beat, not mere backdrop.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can voice survive fear—signals early and tightens through each ritual beat: silence laid over ribbon, mirror path forming, first-note risk. Protagonist agency drives every turn; no coincidence resolves. Cost is visible: the sung note wavers, exposing cracked vessel to sky. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length; options narrow to sing or stay silent, and the choice forecloses muteness forever.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from mirrored imagery and song act: trapped longing reframed as communal invitation. No explicit moral; resonance is in the sky’s echoing hum. Particulars (mother’s crescent smile, moth-flutter ribbon) reweight at closure without abstract statement. Ambiguity lingers—will the song continue?—yet emotional aftereffect is concrete and earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>First-person lyric voice maintains stable perceptual signature: synesthetic compression (“silence contagious”), rhythmic cadence that swells with song. Diction stays within plausible lexicon; no filter-verb stacks. Locksmith’s minimal speech is distinctively formal (“a lock is made of belief”). No head-hopping; psychic distance compresses naturally under starlit pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and rhythm; no template cadence or synonym loops. Metaphors are coherent—“mirrors bright as wet teeth” aligns with physical action. High information density: one line often advances atmosphere + motive + stakes. Zero scaffolding or paraphrase loops; final image is crisp and propulsive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: locksmith as conceptual therapist, mirrors as choir, song as key. Tropes of healing/closure are inverted—no lock picked, only belief swiveled. Specific detail (mother’s hair, ribbon snow-light) anchors universality. Risk-taking structure (lyric accumulative) heightens meaning without gimmickry; payoff feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
