<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The artist’s curiosity about why flowers bloom at night drives every beat and pigment; her interiority remains sensorial (“felt a hush move under it like a cat between rails”) without slipping into label-speak. Micro-choices—climbing the scaffold, waiting for twilight, grinding pigments past midnight—embody the “quietly driven” trait with visible stamina cost. The grandmother’s postcards function as an extension of character memory, tilting present tactics rather than serving as static backstory. Closure is an earned stasis: she foregoes certainty yet gains ancestral alignment, the cost felt in the final hand-steadying image.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the amber pavilion mural re-weights night as “the gentlest daylight,” undeniable conceptual cost paid in public exposure and private lineage. Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout—each seasonal layer of pigment and postcard scent thickens meaning until the final image crystallizes options. Orientation anchors (cathedral loft, winter→autumn timeline) appear by line 60, well inside the 120-word grace window. Causality remains intact: every because/therefore linkage (grandmother’s sketch → artist’s window study → scent-guided draft → mural panel) tightens toward the culminating reveal.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The etched-glass window operates as both micro-setting and tool: its hidden wind channels literally deliver night-blooming incense that guides pigment choices, constraining the final image. Sensory hierarchy is painter-specific—color, scent, negative space—never tourist catalog. Cathedral garden, nave hush, amber pavilion ribbing evolve with plot season-by-season, each weather note altering workability of pigments or audience footfall. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from scaffold to bell stairs to pavilion wall without impossible drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“will color consent to speak after dusk?”—is signaled in paragraph 1 and tightens through each seasonal panel. One meaningful deepening: twilight incense draft converts abstract question into concrete pigment layout, foreclosing daylight compositions. Cost is visible in sleepless grind (“stay past midnight to polish halos”) and in public vulnerability of the amber-panel reveal. Agency remains accumulative rather than causal-reversal, fitting the lyric design; pressure accrues like layers of glaze rather than via antagonist clashes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically from the material: night as collaborative partner rather than hostile void, shown through bats, beetles, moon moths, and finally the grandmother’s posthumous collaboration. No abstract sermon—final line “my murals were doors” reconfigures meaning without moralizing. Recurring postcard motif accrues pressure rather than serving token symbolism; each card revises the artist’s palette choices. Subtext operates in silence: the town’s “dawning hush” is never labeled sacred, yet accumulates reverence through sensory echoes.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>First-person lyric voice sustains a painter’s perceptual signature—color as scent, scent as score—without head-hop. Diction stays within plausible artist lexicon (“pollens rendered as lamps,” “umbral tenderness”) while rhythmic control mirrors pigment strokes: long breathless layer sentences alternate with single-stroke fragments. No dialogue, so voice coherence rests on interiority; interior monologue avoids filter verbs, instead welding perception to action (“I mapped the first panel”). Register never drifts into academic curatorial speak; even cathedral history arrives via verger’s spoken fragment.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies: cascading anaphora (“The second panel… The third…”) accelerates like brush-dabs, then slows into copper-leaf cadence for autumn reveal. Metaphors are selective, never stacked—max one per high-pressure sentence—avoiding purple overload. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence adds new sensory or emotional information. Occasional elevated diction (“nocturne,” “umbral”) is voice-motivated, justified by artist’s trained eye. Closure image is syntactically tidy, ensuring metaphor doesn’t cloud the reweighting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of night-bloom botany, cathedral glass craft, and postcard epistolary form feels fresh and inevitable. Grandmother-botanist-as-muse trope is subverted: she never appears alive, yet her data becomes pigment, turning scientific observation into collaborative art. Risk-taking—lyric mosaic structure, scent-as-color synesthesia—pays off by sharpening rather than obscuring closure. Specificity of “etched vine marking a wind channel for scent” anchors novelty in tactile mechanism, preventing abstract whimsy.</comment>
