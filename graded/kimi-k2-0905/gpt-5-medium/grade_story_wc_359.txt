<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The bell ringer’s interiority is vivid and embodied—synesthetic perceptions braid with the aurora to guide every micro-choice. The sculptor remains a functional silhouette, but the POV’s contradictory drive (“work and prayer”) sustains tension. The final renunciation—leaving the hush unfettered—pays the cost of never monetizing wonder; the prior causality of the amber sheet’s “trapped sunlight” earns this. One-POV default met; head-count waiver applies.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a crystalline Charged Poise: the sculpted hush becomes common air, a conceptual repricing that forces the world to “recalibrate every ledger.” Cost is legible in the bell ringer’s quiet departure—no applause, no commission, only the tuning-fork walk away. Accumulative lens holds: each ring thickens color-density until the final auroral lake mirrors the new standard. No orientation debt; pattern taught by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ice cavern acts as micro-setting furnace: frost-flowers bloom/melt in direct response to intent, constraining how softly the chisel may fall. Bronze bell, amber sheet, and marble block are handled in tactile loops that alter later options—sheet folded = covenant sealed, bell closed = wonder uncaged. Final image of “common air” reweights the entire spatial architecture. Synesthetic body becomes part of the setting—tongue tasting peach as auroral clock—qualifying for 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“certify wonder as essential”—tightens when each bell pulse risks no city reward, only the sculptor’s marble skin as collateral. One meaningful deepening: the pause between chisel taps becomes the only currency, forcing quieter breaths. Cost is visible in marble dust on sleeve and the aurora’s slowed river—options narrowed to hush or nothing. Accumulative escalation clean; no reversal needed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the negative space: a statue-shaped silence that revalues noise itself. No moralizing—final image of “common air” lets readers feel the budget line no audit can erase. Recurrent motifs (amber = trapped sunlight, bell = lung) shift meaning at closure without tokenism. Complexity preserved: wonder remains fragile, unowned, yet now measurably standard.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyric third-person hovers at synesthetic distance—tasting violet as iron—yet never drifts from the bell ringer’s perceptual spine. Rhythm modulates with pressure: long whale-road sentences swell, then fracture to “clean syllable” at climax. No head-hopping; sculptor’s interior remains Legible only through gesture. Patterned elision (“oscillating repose”) taught early and paid off in the tidal exit.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sentences carry triple duty: sensory data, metaphoric charge, causal push—“colors folded inward as if the sky were a lung exhaling.” Zero paraphrase loops; each image compounds prior pressure. Minor register lift (“mineral grace”) stays within POV’s numinous lexicon. One mixed metaphor skim: “architecture rearranged like a flock” −0.1, but does not touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fusion of synesthesia + aurora + fiscal metaphor (“ledger”) yields a non-obvious synthesis: wonder as certified currency. Risk taken—quiet climax in negative space—heightens stakes without gimmickry. Transformation test fails if names/places swapped: the hush must be quarried from marble under polar light. Fresh inflection: the aurora as metronome that dictates when to strike a bell—inevitable yet unforeseen.</comment>
