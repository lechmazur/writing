<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The “gardener of untended laughter” vocation is vividly particular, and the crocodile-tooth talisman embodies survival-turned-promise, but the sole on-page decision—plucking the harp to coax the woman’s laugh—arrives late and without visible trade-off; interior contradiction is asserted rather than dramatized in-scene, so the renunciation feels gently asserted, not paid for with on-page cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the woman’s laughter climbs “a crooked ladder toward a clearing,” reweighting the gorge’s rule-set and leaving the collector outside with “modestly fearless breath”—a visible, felt cost of exclusion under the Accumulative/Textural lens; pattern is taught early, anchors clear by line 5, and the final image crystallizes options without contradiction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The misaligned harp strung across limestone functions as micro-setting that constrains every sonic choice; echo gorge itself supplies the acoustic mirror that literally feeds back voices, guiding the collector’s tactics and charging the final ladder image—environment as instrument, indispensable to closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—retrieving laughter for the dead—tightens once when the woman hesitates, but escalation is largely atmospheric (voices “tripping like children”) rather than a narrowing of live options; the collector’s agency remains observational, so cost is felt more as lyric aura than tactical forfeiture.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: laughter as bridge for the dead is never moralized, only enacted; the final non-literal image of the ladder reconfigures the premise without sermon, leaving plausible counter-reading that humor itself may be a trap—complexity sustained.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>First-person voice carries a sustained lyrical compression (“spectral confessions trembling like light on oil”) that remains legible under pressure; perceptual signature is consistent—wind-tuned harp, crocodile humor—without head-hop, and rhythmic variation accelerates at the climax, fulfilling the 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Figurative density occasionally flirts with excess (“sun scattered coins of heat that pretended they were just another cloud”), but no mixed metaphors obscure causality; sentence rhythm modulates, information is layered, and zero loops or scaffold appear in the closure third.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The “laughter-healer of ghosts via detuned harp” premise feels non-obvious and inevitable in hindsight; risk-taking in lyric accumulative structure heightens coherence without gimmickry, and the transformation test fails if names or setting swap—freshness anchored in specific acoustic logic.</comment>
