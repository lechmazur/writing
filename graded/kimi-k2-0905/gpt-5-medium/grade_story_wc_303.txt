<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Ilya’s interiority is lush, plant-tuned, and action-anchored; the frost-woman promise and paycheck-vs-dream contradiction are felt in every micro-choice. The final renunciation (play→melt→walk away) is earned and costly, though the “mulberry ache” is named more than embodied. Still, the telepathy trait actively shapes perception beats, not just décor, keeping motivation organic.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: because he can hear plants, therefore he heeds their warning; because he swore to let the violin choose, therefore he plays it to death. One tight scene, one escalating pressure line (museum noon arrival) keeps orientation crisp; the dissolve of the instrument is a decisive change with visible cost (melt-water on tongue). No teleporting stakes; closure lands on-page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The velvet dome, midsummer heat, and ice violin constrain every tactic: heat literally perforates destiny by melting the instrument. Micro-setting (coffee cup, stained saucer-as-star-map) doubles as tool and divination surface, re-weighted in the final image. Sensory hierarchy is biased to Ilya’s plant-mediated perception, keeping description purposeful and plot-functional.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Single stake: keep the violin’s story alive vs. empire’s archival vacuum. Escalation is linear but effective—each minute of midsummer heat thins the ice, tightening the clock. The decisive tightening occurs when he tastes the melt-drop: that sensory price crystallizes the trade-off and forecloses surrender to the museum. The cost is microscopic but legible on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through recurring perforation imagery: destiny, tickets, melting ice, coffee archipelagos—all reconfigured when the violin dissolves. No moralizing; the final image answers the thematic question (dream vs. empire) by letting the artifact literally evaporate. The plants’ collective memory propagates the music, suggesting stories survive outside vaults—an oblique, resonant answer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Lyric, synesthetic prose stays inside Ilya’s plant-tuned sensorium; diction (“mulberry ache,” “gravity brushed its strings with a thousand soft eyebrows”) is consistent and character-specific. Rhythm accelerates with short, percussive clauses during the play-melt beat. No head-hopping; psychic distance compresses under pressure without register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>High density—most sentences do two jobs (image + causality). A few metaphor stacks (“breath became knives,” “jam-sweet”) flirt with excess but are pattern-taught early and paid off. No loops, scaffold, or synonym churn; closure line is clean. Minor over-writing in “thousand soft eyebrows” keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The ice violin that must melt to propagate memory is a fresh conceptual synthesis; plant-telepathy as archival network is non-obvious yet fully followed through. Risky lyric compression never obscures causality. The empire-as-choir-of-vaults image alone feels new, and the ending stakes the entire plot on evaporation—bold, specific, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
