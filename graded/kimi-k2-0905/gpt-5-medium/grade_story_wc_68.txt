<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The narrator’s “abrasive calm” is embodied in every line; the decision to risk exposing the chalk flood-marks to the three rivals crystallizes his hierarchy of values—save lives, keep the cog, hoard method over myth. Interior contradiction is alive: he aches to lie yet chooses the harder truth, paying the social cost of their dampened awe. The only minor slack is that the rivals’ individual voices remain slightly interchangeable, but since they function as a single pressure mass this barely dents the earned stasis.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the wheel catches, water sighs out, and the cost is the narrator’s future vulnerability now that the three factions have seen his power. Causal chain never loosens: cog → chalk records → sluice turn → immediate physical relief plus ideological recalibration. Orientation anchor (“sewer below the sunken city ruins”) lands within 30 words; the later flood-clock reference is an earned callback, not a patch. Lens is unambiguously causal; every beat is a because/therefore linkage that forecloses the option to stay neutral.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The chalk‐marked flood wall, the barnacled sluice wheel, and the soggy strata of drowned pamphlets are not backdrop—they are the tools that save the lower quarter. The environment literally steers the body: footing on algae, timing of tide, housing of the orphanage. Sensory triage mirrors urgency—smell of rot, metallic scrape of cog, cold water at shins. One minor flicker: the exact spatial relation of tunnel-to-dock could be one sentence sharper, but the final image of the wheel “snapping into place” re-charges every prior detail.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—keep the cog and the ancient method alive—tightens when the three emissaries arrive; each suggested melting of the cog is a live threat. Escalation is mechanical and visible: incoming tide → silt jam → knee-high water → narrator forced to reveal secret marks. The cog itself is the price: once inserted and turned, it becomes public knowledge, no longer private leverage. One decisive turn of the wheel rewrites all factions’ options; the cost is the narrator’s exposed advantage, felt instantly.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges entirely through concrete antagonists and objects: method vs. marketing, quiet record vs. loud rebranding. No character sermonizes “knowledge is power”; instead the chalk indices and brass cog enact it. The final damp silence—narrative still holding the now-proven cog—re-weights every prior slogan without stating a thesis. Complexity lingers: the city is still sick with certainty, but one lower quarter is dryer because a thief valued function over fable.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Voice is a sustained perceptual signature: every sentence is filtered through a man who parses philosophy through rust, gear ratios, and rat-muscle memory. Syntax tightens under pressure—“the wheel caught like a thought snapping into place”—without ever slipping into writerly self-exposition. Diction stays inside the POV’s plausible lexicon; even “sedimentary layers of paper and bone” sounds like something he would mutter while sifting. No head-hop, no filter-verb bloat, and abrasive calm modulates into exhausted relief without voice break.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet breathable; most sentences twin job: “Yesterday the dredgers found a seafarer’s chronometer cog lodged in a mussel shelf like a gold tooth in a cracked jaw” delivers world-fact, sensory snap, and metaphoric reverb in one strike. Rhythm varies; paragraph breaks land on hinge images. One microscopic stumble: “the reflex to agonize over the least harmful lie to tell” edges toward diagnostic label-speak, but the next clause snaps back to physical imperative. No mixed metaphors, no scaffold loops; closure line is clean and charged.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Post-plague drowned-library sewer-punk is familiar turf, yet the story’s angle—restoring flood prediction as insurgent act—feels non-obvious and fully committed. The chalk-index method repurposes archaeology into civil engineering, a fresh synthesis. Cog-as-method-not-magic resists fetish-object trope. The risk of lecturing is high, but voice keeps doctrine embedded in tactile procedure. A hair off perfect only because the rival trio skates close to symbolic triumvirate; still, their convergence physically enables the climax, so the gambit pays.</comment>
