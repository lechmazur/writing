<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Lida’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her knees “turn to memory,” the vine “borrows breath.” The contradiction between reverence for tradition and insurgent action is active in-scene, but the final swing to communal triumph feels slightly too tidy; the cost is poetic rather than palpable. The micro-choice to lift the amber is well-motivated, yet the council’s refusal is compressed into reported summary, muting secondary-character pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the seedling becomes a living scaffold that re-weights “destiny” from relic to co-authored tool. Causality holds under a lyrical-accumulative lens; each plant whisper and kite line layers density rather than tight because/therefore links. The mirror-of-fire-water moment is the visible cost—Lida risks scalding and exile—though the text drifts into choral affirmation rather than a single crystallized price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Hot-spring steam, basalt path, and porous rock are tactile and selective; the embryo’s weight “heavy as a wet loaf” grounds the vault scene. The volcanic setting physically constrains the unsealing—only the hottest pool softens amber—meeting the 9+ micro-setting gate. Spatial choreography stays clean across vault, spring, and infant walkway.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—who controls the future of the embryo—tightens when the council refuses and Lida acts alone. One meaningful deepening occurs: the amber softens only under live steam, forcing an irreversible on-stage act. Cost is visible (burn risk, social exile) but diffused into collective joy before the reader feels its sting.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: tradition is a living vine, not a nailed relic. The kite-tail code and reed chorus embody this without overt thesis. Final image of children climbing the learning-stairs reconfigures destiny as collaborative craft, avoiding moralizing. Some poetic abstraction keeps it from full resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric-accumulative, rhythm anchored in plant breath and steam hiss. Perceptual signature is strong: Lida hears “mince of syllables slide through cattail.” No head-hopping; compression like “groundmind of the valley” is pattern-taught early and paid off. Occasional elevated phrasing (“conceptual repricing” territory) slightly strains POV lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Sentence variety and sensory economy are strong;只有少数 scaffold phrases (“and the… and the…”) mid-paragraph. Mixed metaphors are controlled—steam/nectar/wet book work. No looped paraphrase or filter-verb stacks. Final third stays clean, allowing high-band eligibility.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The telepathic-grandmother who unseals destiny via kite-code and plant chorus is a fresh synthesis; insurgent horticulture feels inevitable yet new. Risk is taken with lyric-accumulative structure rather than causal plot, and coherence holds. Specificity of reed-whisper cryptography and embryo-as-talisman prevents swap-out with generic rebellion tropes.</comment>
