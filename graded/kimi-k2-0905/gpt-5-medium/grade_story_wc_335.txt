<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The archivist’s interiority is gorgeously textured—embodied in “I walk backwards when nervous” and the tactile handling of porcelain—but the absence of a second on-page character keeps the relationship crucible dormant, capping depth. Micro-choices (pouring, pacing, corking) do trace a credible hierarchy of values, yet the final stance crystallizes without a visible new cost beyond what the library already risks.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the council’s reluctant stay stamps a conceptual cost that reweights the library’s hinge function. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each shard, cup, and shadow accretes into the final corridor that forces the council to see its own exit/return. Pattern is taught early (“reversible exile”) and paid off when the corridor folds back into glass, but the Orientation Test is waived because deliberate disorientation (drifting swing, unnamed city) is later re-anchored by the council’s literal measuring tapes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>The library’s leaning stacks, chipped bowls, and dusk-filled bottle operate as micro-setting that directly constrains choice: only here can exile be corked and uncorked. Sensory economy is disciplined—three senses per beat, never a tourist catalogue—and the swing’s metronome outside keeps temporal footing without clobbering us with season clichés. Spatial choreography is immaculate; bodies and shards track cleanly across the single room. The final image of bruise-light underlining dates is environment-as-epitaph, charging closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—keep the city’s memory without hoarding grief—tightens once: the council’s decree forces the archivist to risk the library’s erasure. Escalation is textural: each mirrored letter, steeped cup, and poured shadow thickens the pattern until the corridor literalizes the return-path. Cost is visible—leader sets down tape, child speaks the hinge aloud—but the council’s retreat feels slightly convenient; no delegate votes a forfeited resource.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from particulars: “reversible exile” is never sloganized but dramatized as liquid shadow that can be re-bottled. Subtext resides in silence—the child’s decade-shaped quiet, the swing’s tapping—and in the chipped bowls that “hold without complaint.” Final image libraries as hinge, not hoard, reweights memory itself as a civic duty rather than private grief, avoiding moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>First-person voice owns a crystalline perceptual signature: dust instructs light to fold, history accepts a splintered reflection. Syntax coils and releases—“I walk backwards when nervous” compresses whole psychology into six words. No dialogue, so register remains consistent; compression never decays into drumbeat. Elliptical grammar (“the forgotten library remembers breathing”) is pattern-taught early and pays off at closure when library exhales the corridor.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm modulates from long inhalations (“I keep the city from forgetting itself…”) to clipped micro-beats (“I pour, I wait”). No paraphrase loops; each image advances. One mixed metaphor—“corridor like a bruise remembering light”—is forgiveable because it charges the closure image. Density is high: every sentence performs three jobs (image, emotion, concept) without purple swell.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Premise—librarian of reversible exile—feels fresh, yet the council-as-broom is a recognizable civic-threat trope. The shard-mirror archive and tea-leaf geometry are particularized enough to evade stock. Risk lies in lyric compression; it heightens coherence rather than gimmickry. The child’s decade-in-a-day growth is a quiet inflection that retroactively re-weights the swing’s first creak.</comment>
