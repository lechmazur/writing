<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Iria’s refusal of easy miracles and her insistence on labor-based revival are dramatized through concrete micro-choices—writing the charter with kelp ink, setting the bell, teaching the sailor to count thoughts—so her “rejects false comfort” trait is lived, not labeled. The interior contradiction between her longing for magic and her discipline of renunciation stays active in scene, powering the final renunciation of wishes. Cost is visible: she loses solitude, accepts endless rehearsal, and relinquishes omnipotence. The amber bottle acts as an externalized heart whose ticking she feels, anchoring emotion in object rather than abstract declaration.</comment>

<comment>The closure is a Charged Poise: the bell rings, people sweep, the bottle’s unheard ticking certifies that a non-wish civilization has begun; the cost is the perpetual rehearsal Iria embraces. Causality holds: each plan is tested against the bottle’s glass, then released, so the final image is earned. Lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of lanterns, maps, shells, bell, and bottle accrete until the shift from memory to shared labor is undeniable. One drift: “light the bell” is an impossible phrase that momentarily breaks physical logic, but the metaphor is brief and does not touch the closure image.</comment>

<comment>Paper-lantern cove is evoked through selective, sense-driven detail—salt coat, ash nails, bobbing lanterns, warped timbers—each filtered by Iria’s alchemical attention. The bottle functions as micro-setting: its weight and opacity constrain every tactical discussion, turning the skiff into a council table. Spatial choreography is clean: lanterns placed, bell set, square swept, bodies move with purpose. Weather and tide are not backdrop but agents that deliver the sailor and carry the shell-invitations, so environment actively enables revival.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake is clear: can a town live without miracles? Pressure tightens when Iria realizes wishes have ended and she must invent labor-based substitutes. The meaningful deepening occurs at “revival is not a performance but a rehearsal that never ends”—this reweights the task from miracle to perpetual discipline, foreclosing ease. No external antagonist is needed; the exhausted sky is the situational pressure, and her refusal of mercy is the agency that escalates cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges implicitly: community must be built on shared labor and witnessed obligation, not supernatural gifts. Subtext lives in gesture—passing the bottle like a candle, sweeping the square before debating—so the moral is enacted, not preached. The amber bottle’s shift from sealed mystery to communal heart reprices the premise: emptiness becomes capacity. Final image of unheard ticking offers resonant, non-literal proof that value can arise from refusal rather than fulfillment.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric, compressed, and rhythmically controlled: “salt in her coat and ash under her fingernails” is both sensory and symbolic without overwriting. Syntax mirrors alchemical process—nouns stacked like ingredients, clauses distilled to elixirs. Perceptual signature is consistent: Iria notices tools, notebooks, recipes, never tourist vistas. No head-hopping; even the sailor’s speech is filtered through her ear. The final “light the bell” metaphor is the single register slip, but its brief flare does not contaminate the overall cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose density is high: single sentences deliver setting, metaphor, and emotional state—“bobbed like faded thoughts” compresses object, memory, and tone. No scaffold loops; each line advances either plan or image. Metaphors stay physically coherent—lanterns as thoughts, bell as call to accountability—so figurative language sharpens rather than muddles. Rhythm accelerates naturally from solitary ink-grinding to communal sweeping, mirroring the town’s pulse returning.</comment>

<question>8</question><question>8.2</question>
<comment>The “post-wish ghost town” premise is fresh, and the alchemical lens on civic engineering—cisterns, firebreak gardens, dispute-dance square—transforms familiar revival tropes into lived procedure. Risk is taken in rejecting conventional miracle payoff, yet the story commits fully to the austerity premise. Specificity of kelp-ink charter and shell-invitations keeps the world from sliding into generic utopia. Bottle-as-heart is a novel civic emblem; removing it would collapse both metaphor and plot mechanics.</comment>
