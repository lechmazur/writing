<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The narrator’s “mnemonically gifted” trait is more than label: it enables the decisive act of drawing the lock whole and unlocks the box without force, a credible payoff. Interior contradiction is present—grief vs. survival economics—and the final micro-choice to sign Vera’s name beside his own shows earned, visible cost. Minor dilution: Vera is off-stage, so status/relationship crucible is absent, capping the top band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the jar’s dawn-pigment release reweights the premise—memory must be spent, not stored—under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality holds: each face-sketch accumulates until the cave crystals refract them, and the drawn lock reconstitutes the broken steel, a single meaningful tightening with felt cost. No orientation debt; pattern is taught early. One hairline slip: the laugh-echo frame is repeated three times, a micro-loop that nicks perfection.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Selective, urgent sensory filtering—charcoal grit under skin, mineral breath from the stair—anchors without catalog bloat. The crystal facets and the iron strongbox act as micro-setting that literally constrain choice: the crystals receive the charcoal drawing that unlocks the box. Environment mirrors internal thaw: frozen dawn shards warm into usable pigment. meets 9+ gate: environment charges final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—liberate suppressed creativity—tightens once when the drawn lock fuses imagination with mechanism, foreclosing the option to remain merely a boardwalk vendor. Escalation is accumulative: each stored face presses against the crystals until the visual pressure forces expenditure. Cost is legible: the lid sighs, pigment rains, and the narrator forfeits anonymity by signing Vera’s name. One beat short of 8.8+ because external antagonist (gallery contract) is only recalled, not re-encountered.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: art as mnemonic debt that must be repaid in public exposure. Subtext sits in the silence after the last laugh—commerce vs. vocation—and in the jar of dawn never before uncorked. Final image reweights earlier material: the same graphite that sold quick smiles now signs authentic work. No moralizing; complexity intact.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>First-person voice carries a charcoal-dust texture: syntax is slightly smudged, cadence lingers like after-echo. Perceptual signature—“I go down humming the pattern of faces”—is idiosyncratic and sustained. No dialogue, so naturalism not tested; compression and elision (“money was a rumor”) are taught early and paid off. Under stress, diction shortens to “The box yields,” mirroring breathless hush.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>High information density: one sentence often sketches setting, backstory, and emotional temperature (“We meant to rectify the wrong the world did to strange makers…”). Metaphors are coherent—lock as clenched jaw, crystals as frozen dawn—and never mixed. Minor template cadence in the triple use of “after the last echo of laughter fades” costs −0.2. No loops or scaffold in peak beats; closure image remains clear.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Risk-taking fusion of artisan realism with lyric underground crystal cave pays off: the surreal space literalizes stored memory. The charcoal-drawn lock that physically repairs broken steel is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis. Mentor’s undertow metaphor and dawn-pigment jar feel particular to this voice. Transformation test fails if names/places swapped, confirming originality.</comment>
