<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The lucid-dream chronicler narrator’s motive—decoding temple glyphs through variable-star grammar—remains concrete and intensifies when Mara arrives; the micro-choice to read star-light aloud together crystallizes his “heals with words” trait under pressure. Interiority is atmospheric but sometimes drifts toward poetic self-labeling (“I witness best when…”). The closing yes to keep witnessing costs him future solitude, a credible renunciation at this length.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the shared reading of star-grammar turns glyphs into live grammar, reconfiguring both characters’ burdens under a Charged Poise—the observatory stores the mirror-story “inside our breathing.” Causal chain holds: unopened telegram → Mara arrival → joint decoding → verbal sharing → earned charge. Lens is Accumulative/Textural: star flux density braids with dialogue to reweight meaning. Orientation and transitions are legible; no seams break causality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The observatory itself—red lamps, dome gears clicking, Cepheid vow—functions as micro-setting that constrains how and when they can “translate light into grammar.” Sensory selection skews auditory (domes click) and tactile (paper stones), reflecting chronicler’s night-trained perception. Spatial choreography stays coherent across the single scene; no floating props. Setting subtly guides choice: only variable stars at this hour can unlock the glyphs.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—decode inscriptions to ease shared burdens—tightens once when joint reading becomes the only path, narrowing options from solo to shared witness. Escalation is textural: star-flux graphs steady, dialogue counterpoints, meaning accumulates rather than flips. Cost is conceptual but legible: the chronicler forecloses lone mastery, accepts perpetual co-witnessing. No external antagonist needed; pressure is internal-relational.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</question><grade><comment>Theme emerges obliquely: pilgrimage with mirror of shared thirst reweights prior grief without moralizing. Daylily, telegram, and star-grammar form a sparse motif set that reprises at closure (“the sun can travel by paper”)—charged by shared voicing. No thesis statement; insight stays implicit in final image of stored mirror-story. Subtext in silences (delayed telegram, withheld names) invites rereading.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>First-person voice sustains a perceptual signature—star numbers on tongue, ink-stained fingers—without drifting into purple. Syntax modulates: longer breathless clauses under flux-reading, short fragments at charged poise. No head-hops; psychic distance stable. Dialogue minimal but distinct when present (Mara: “sufficient… world had bruised her with unsaid sentences”). Register stays within chronicler’s plausible lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Lyric density is high yet purposeful; metaphors (“lines trembling like held confessions”) stay consistent to astronomical/verbal frame. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn detected. Rhythm breathes with scene pace—caesuras during star waits, accelerando during read-aloud. Tense, punctuation clean; no simultaneity errors. Final sentence earns cadence without drumbeat. Minor scaffold: occasional stacked adjectives (“midnight hush pooled…”) but never near closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Temple inscriptions decoded by variable-star light-grammar is a fresh synthesis; pilgrimage mirror-as-practice rather than object offers non-obvious angle. Voice-level specifics (daylily telegram, dome gears) personalize the frame. Risk-taking in lyric accumulation mode pays off at closure. Could edge higher if temple lore were more culturally particular, but within length limits the concept feels transformed, not templated.</comment>
