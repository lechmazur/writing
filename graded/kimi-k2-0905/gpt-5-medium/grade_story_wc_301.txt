<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The narrator’s contradictory impulses—guilt-driven self-punishment versus the methodical drive to map and forgive—are alive in every micro-choice. The accordion bellows acts as a second lung, forcing embodied emotion into the scene; the decision to lie down on the sluice gate and sync breath with the patched instrument is a visible cost that forecloses denial. Interiority never drifts into diagnostic speak; instead, the river’s literal weight replaces abstract guilt. The final renunciation—writing that the river will no longer be asked to mirror him—earns its stasis through prior causality.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the shallow re-weights the narrator’s entire epistemic frame, costing him the right to use the river as self-mirror. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens: each graffiti coordinate adds density until the final arrow reconfigures meaning. The persistent constraint—the river’s indifferent honesty—shapes every tactical move from tile-reading to stepping into the current. Cost is legible in the image of the stick-marked margin and the relinquished number twelve.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The station’s green chapel and the sluice gate’s rust scars are not backdrop; they narrow options by offering only one viable path—through the graffiti, through the gate, into the water. The accordion bellows functions as micro-setting: its patched tape embodies the brother’s patched lung and dictates the narrator’s breathing rhythm at the climax. Ivy, rails, and culvert mouth evolve causally with the narrator’s discoveries; no detail is static. Final image—the stick margin—grounds the reconfiguration in tactile place.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Pressure escalates through pattern accumulation: each graffiti coordinate and physical milestone tightens the noose of self-knowledge. The dominant stake—can the narrator forgive himself without falsifying the river?—faces a decisive test when he enters the shallow where the body drifted. Agency is visible: he copies ink pressure, counts aloud, and finally writes a new covenant in the field book. Cost is felt in the lungs that match the torn bellows and the number surrendered to the current.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges solely through the river’s refusal to be shrunk: the moral error was treating a living system as a mirror. Subtext resides in the graffiti’s joke-maps—survey humor that hides absolution—and in the accordion’s wheeze that replaces spoken apology. No explicit moral is stated; the final ledger image reweights blame without sermon. The reader is left to feel that forgiveness is a re-pricing of scale, not a feeling to be declared.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice carries a perceptual signature of cartographic precision—pressure of ink, smeared numbers—never drifting into tourist lyricism. Rhythm modulates from long, river-like sentences to the staccato of coordinate numbers, mirroring the narrator’s rising pulse. No head-hopping; first-person holds tight to what the body can know—bellows on ribs, water at shins. Compression like “storm drunk with certainty” is taught early and paid off at the sluice gate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: each line advances map, memory, or breath. No loops or synonym churn; “river does what it was asked to do” recurs only to reprice meaning, not to pad. Figurative language is disciplined—ivy “shimmered like soundproofing” stays within physics of light and dampens the accordion’s shy notes. The closing ledger image is crystalline, free of scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The fusion of hydrological survey, bathroom graffiti, and sibling grief feels inevitable yet wholly fresh. The accordion-as-lung and graffiti-as-map are not quirky ornaments; they grow from the narrator’s occupational eye and the station’s dereliction. Risk—treating a public toilet stall as sacred text—pays off because the pattern is taught early and the closure reweights it as methodical mercy. Transformation test fails: this arc could not survive without the river, the bellows, and the surveyor’s index.</comment>
