<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The gardener’s quiet, methodical nature is rendered through embodied micro-choices (laying tools in a crescent, tapping the case, planting asters) that externalize grief without label-speak; the final shift from “blithe mask” to “respect” is earned by the causal discovery of the widow’s double truth. Interior contradiction is present but subtle—his buoyancy versus the velveteen gloom—yet the text keeps him slightly too composed for full 9+; no real misstep or flaw complicates the last beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the empty patch is re-priced from absence to honored secret, marked by the sovereign case and poppies—cost is the gardener’s acceptance of complicity in silence. Causal chain holds: chess-clock cue → tapestry decode → empty grave → lover’s papers → new marker; no teleporting props or retro patches. Orientation is anchored within 120 words (silo, night, tools), and the mosaic of shards (silo, grave, poplar) is taught early and lands under a single lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Selective sensory detail (velvet unwinding, migrating echoes, asters’ stubborn color) filters through the gardener’s professional eye; the silo’s metal ribs and the ring of asters function as micro-settings that constrain digging and planting choices. The cobalt silo under stars re-appears in the final line, now “charted by mercy,” re-weighting the atmosphere. One hairline slip: the poplar limb break is mentioned once and never felt again, keeping this just under 9.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—uncover the shape of intentions—tightens when the tapestry border reveals a missing grave, forcing the gardener to decide whether to expose or protect the widow’s lie. Agency is continuous: each decode step (untangling knots, tapping case, fishing with needle) narrows options until he chooses to plant poppies, a visible cost. Pressure is coherent but gentle; the story eschews overt danger, so the cost is moral rather than visceral, sufficient for this length but not quite 9+ intensity.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges obliquely: fidelity can demand both performance and erasure; the border’s grammar encodes love and deceit as inseparable. Subtext resides in objects—sovereign case as throne and witness, asters as cheerful camouflage—never sermonized. The final image of poppies ringing a now-honored absence reconfigures the premise without moral tag. No thematic echo or tidy maxim intrudes; complexity is honored, not resolved.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays tightly fused to the gardener’s perceptual signature: “tenderly organized,” “velveteen gloom,” “soft obligation.” Syntax lengthens and breathes during discovery, then contracts at the end: “He pockets the chess clock, resets it…”—rhythm mirrors stance crystallization. No head-hopping; compression (“uncharted echoes drift down like migrating birds”) is taught early and paid off. Voice remains distinct under pressure without register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet limpid: each sentence advances image or stakes (“coins worn smooth, a glass needle, and scraps of thread that drink the lamplight”). Figurative layering is purposeful—echoes as birds, knots as punctuation—never crowding causality. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; opening and closing lines book-end with velvet/cobalt motifs. A single mixed metaphor (“velvet unwinding from a well-kept secret”) is allowable at this register and does not dull the closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fusing chess-clock cue, tapestry cryptography, and war-time disappearance into a cemetery miniature feels fresh; the widow’s double burial is revealed through thread cartography rather than exposition. Risky lyric accumulation could have collapsed into purple haze, yet every image is grounded in the gardener’s tools and motions. The synthesis is specific enough that swapping any core node (sovereign case, asters, border grammar) would break the emotional logic, keeping this just shy of 9.5 only because the premise’s historical echo is faintly familiar.</comment>
