<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Interiority is richly embodied—"my hands carry the polish of years spent listening"—and every micro-choice (breathing with the crack, sewing without silencing) flows from the caretaker’s vocation. The only reason this isn’t 9.5 is that the personal flaw/peril never sharpens into a contradictory impulse that could fail; the success feels pre-destined by craft rather than wrested from risk.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: lyrical density and pattern-break reweight the stake of remembrance. Closure lands as Charged Poise—"I feel permitted to sleep"—after the healed chime rings and the name returns to the world; the cost is the caretaker’s perpetual vigilance, felt in the salt-and-dust taste. Causality is internal but coherent: because the caretaker listens, therefore the name survives. No orientation debt; sky-library rules are taught early and paid off at the rail.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The opal library, cloud-skin balloons, and lightning-glass cliff are not picturesque backdrop; they constrain every move—lantern swing, tether hum, balcony offering. The bamboo tube’s fracture and velvet pillow focus the entire drama into a single micro-setting that must be mended without muting its voice. Sensory hierarchy is caretaker-biased: sound and touch dominate, sight is pearly half-light. Setting charges the final image—the chime’s ring travelling to rooftops—making the library both womb and transmitter.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"never lose a name again"—is signaled in the flash-back to the rain-dial failure and tightens when the crack threatens to loose the memory into nothing. One meaningful intensification: the caretaker’s heartbeat "falters like a deer on unfamiliar ice" while sewing; the cost is the perpetual burden of perfect stewardship. Agency is caretaker-driven; no outside rescue. The escalation is textural—pressure mounts through sonic leakage and tactile tremor rather than external antagonist—but the cost is unmistakable on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: memory is a fragile acoustic object that can only be preserved by someone willing to absorb its dust and salt. The foxglove-regret tone and glass-orchid imagery reconfigure into a final non-moral: stewardship is love that refuses romance. Subtext lives in gesture—naming the petal, tasting salt—rather than explanation. The ending’s "faintest grace note" reweights every prior echo, offering conceptual repricing of caretaking as endless, unsung duty.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is caretaker-specific: "opal library above clouds," "museum of extinct feelings," "mothwing of cooled thunder"—diction impossible outside this voice. Syntax lengthens and breathes with the sewing rhythm; fragments ("A kit hangs…") mimic lantern sway. No head-hopping; unreliability is impossible because the narrator admits limits—"I do not watch them reunite." Compression is taught early ("humming with foxglove regret") and paid off in the final grace-note answer, legible under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence layers image and job—"I sweep the aisles with my feather broom, coaxing dust into jars labeled with seasons" advances caretaker ritual, world rule, and sensory texture. Metaphors stay internally coherent (sound = glass, memory = dust) and never collide. No loops, scaffold, or register drift; elevated diction is caretaker-native. Closure line—"whose coins of light pay our debt to the sky"—is crystalline, no artifact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.8</grade>
<comment>Floating memory-library is not whimsical set-dressing but a fully worked ontology where acoustic objects can be stitched without silence. The risk—lyric accumulation risking opacity—is transcended because pattern is taught in the first paragraph and closure reprises it with new sonic weight. Fresh inflection: remembrance as literal sewing of vibrating bamboo. The concept commits entirely; no retreat to metaphoric safety. Transformation test fails if caretaker or library is swapped—specificity is absolute.</comment>
