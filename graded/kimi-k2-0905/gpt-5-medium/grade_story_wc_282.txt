<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The lone cartographer’s interiority is sensor-rich and consistent—micro-choices (wedging into the throat tunnel, trading the leaf for residency) enact the vow “speak carefully.” Flaw: no contradictory impulse under peak pressure; the cave’s welcome feels fated rather than fought-for, blunting cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens: each beat adds strata of memory—leaf, limestone, storm—until the amber plateau reweights “voice” as reciprocal listening. Closure lands: the fossil left behind = Earned Stasis with conceptual cost—he can no longer claim pure outsider status. Minor slip: orientation anchors (who/where) arrive after 120 w but the poetic delay pays off.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting-as-constraint: mineral “hair” curtain, tidal throat, heat-map grammar physically narrow his moves; the fossil’s niche dictates the final contract. Micro-setting (black pool) forces the float that triggers the chamber’s memory-spike. Spatial choreography is immaculate—no drift in body-to-wall distances.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—exchange legitimacy with the unknown—tightens when storm surge threatens to erase the warm plateau; renunciation of the fossil forecloses retrieval, paying visible price. Escalation is situational, not causal: tide rises, options compress, stance crystallizes. Could use one earlier micro-loss (tool, time) to sharpen tactics.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges via refrains of memory and breath; the final image—amber trust on the cave wall—conceptually re-prices “voice” from human narration to joint utterance. Avoids overt thesis; no “I now understand” line. Minor echo: “remember” is iterated enough to flirt with motif-checklist but each use is grammatically distinct.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Liquid, tidal syntax—long sentences swell then break into short drops—mirrors the POV’s sensory immersion. Diction stays inside a field-scientist lexicon; no corporate register drift. Perceptual signature is unmistakable: “colors lace along the walls, not visible to eyes, but visible to the map.” No head-hop; “we” remains collective stance, not individuated.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Rhythm breathes with scene tempo—pre-surge lull vs. post-surge propulsion. Metaphors (cave as slow animal, throat tunnel) stay coherent; no mixed vehicles. High density: one sentence often layers sensory data, tool action, emotional translation. Minor loop: “remember” stem appears six times—pattern feels intentional but edges close to over-chant.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise flips hibernation trope into post-human negotiation; heat-mapping emotions via paleo-fossil interface is fresh synthesis, not gimmick. Risk: lyric abstraction could have dulled stakes, yet specificity of tidal time, mineral hair, and amber plateau keeps it grounded. Transformation test fails if leaf is swapped—proving irreplaceability.</comment>
