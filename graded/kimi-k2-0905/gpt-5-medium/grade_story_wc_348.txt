<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The interior contradiction—guilt over the shredded packaging vs. the childhood “listening”—is vivid and embodied; the chrysalis test in palm gives a micro-choice that crystallizes the new polymer rule. The final renunciation (returning to the city with damp boots and Braiding) carries visible cost and is earned by the river cadence work. Mentor/sister rift is told more than staged, so relationship-as-crucible is weak, but single-POV pressure suffices. No diagnostic label-speak; flaws complicate the closure choice rather than being smoothed away.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the reversible-ring copolymer sketch reweights the premise with undeniable social cost (lawsuits, scorn) and is signaled by the chrysalis-in-notebook image. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—foam patterns teach cadence, density increases until the insight reconfigures meaning. Orientation is anchored by word 30 (“braided ravine”), well inside 120-word window. No lens ambiguity; pattern taught early (foam = score of entrances) and paid off in final sketch.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Ravine, alder shade, wet stones, swallow seams—selective sensory triangulation mirrors internal state without cataloging. River topology constrains the insight mechanics (braid → reversible rings) and charges the final image. Micro-setting (chrysalis, notebook, compass) functions as tactile tools that alter choices. Spatial choreography clean: cobbles climbed, boots remain damp, tangible exit cue. No occupational exposition dump; polymer accuracy surfaces only when it affects design stakes.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“translate separation into connection”—is signaled early and tightened when foam teaches that connection is a readiness to give way. One meaningful deepening: the shift from “stronger = better” to “listen, loosen, rejoin” costs the protagonist lawsuits/scorn, price legible on page. Agency resides in attention/attention-turned-design, not external antagonist; pressure coheres under Accumulative lens. No coincidence; escalation is cadence accumulation rather than multiple reversals, sufficient for 600-word scale.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from particulars: chrysalis husk, river foam, reversible rings—no abstract sermon. Final image (damp boots + plan) offers Charged Poise that reweights “atonement” as ongoing listening, not erasure. Subtext in gesture: curling fingers around husk = polymer aging test, silence avoids courtroom confession. No thematic echo sentence; complexity (innovation = vulnerability) lingers without tidy moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Perceptual signature is chemist-poet: “polymer chains whisper curvature,” “swallows stitched the air”—lexicon stays within plausible hybrid register. Rhythm modulates: long lyrical sentences mirror river flow, then tighten to percussion metaphor (“cross-links like percussion”). No head-hopping; first-person past stable. No filter-verb stacks; syntax reflects mind under pressure without drumbeat monotony. Dialogue absent, so no voice convergence issue.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>High density: “barbed tatters, snagging birds and throats of reeds” does three jobs (visual, moral, ecological) in one image. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances knowledge or charge. Metaphors stay coherent (foam = musical score) and physically viable. Minor elevated diction (“symphonically minded”) is seeded early and earns its keep in closure cadence, so register drift waived. Final third clean of artifacts, closure image pristine.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: packaging failure → river foam → reversible polymer architecture, all driven by earned interior logic. Risk in lyric-scientific hybrid pays off; without “Braiding” concept the emotional arc collapses. No close echoes of famous eco-fiction; specificity of pH-shift loops feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Transformation test passes—story fails if polymer chemist, ravine, or chrysalis swapped out.</comment>
