<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Oris’s contradiction—statue stillness vs. tidal thought—drives every beat; the decision to thread the ampoule crystallizes his promise to “welcome nuance.” Interiority stays embodied (“stone knees stirring anemones”). Cost is felt when the scholar’s doubt ripples back through him. The only bar to 9+ is that the renunciation is more conceptual than viscerally paid on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: time pours “wide,” the city learns delay is strategy, the scholar’s certainty re-opens. Causal chain holds—reveal → scholar recoil → threading → diffusion of decision—each because/therefore tightening options. Orientation is taught by line 3 (“I am Oris…”) and spatial logic never breaks. Persistent constraint: the lattice breach remains a “listening wound,” a price that keeps shaping future argument.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Foxglove-stained glass, coral wrist, eelgrass filament—every object is handled, not catalogued, and each constrains the threading action. The underwater garden’s pressure (plankton storm risk, barnacle ushers) directly enables/disables moves. Final image of “patient gold” sunlight through empty ampoule recharges the tint’s earlier warning/hymn duality. Spatial choreography across dome crack, bronze bench, founder statue is immaculate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake: can hesitation be civic courage, not cowardice? Escalation is causal—each inch of threading unlocks another city “room,” narrowing the scholar’s options until she tether-bells permission. Mid-story reversal: ampoule is memory, not poison, forcing recalculation of moral cost. Price is legible: the breach stays open, the city must keep arguing on coral cushions—permanent vulnerability traded for mercy.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: delay as radical care. Foxglove’s “tempo” and the garden’s stall-tactic reweight speed-as-virtue. Final image of benches “for arguments yet to bloom” offers resonant, non-moral answer. Subtext lives in gesture—founder bowing, bell asking permission—never exposition.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is crystalline, tidal, statue-still: “I speak… careful as tide.” Syntax lengthens/shortens like breath, taught by line 4 and held to last line. Lexicon stays within Oris’s mineral-aqueous cognition—no human slang leaks. Compression (“Purple ghosts… warning and hymn”) is patterned, paid off in final tint.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops; every sentence advances knowledge or image. Metaphors are coherent water-stone-glass system, no mixed vehicles. Rhythm modulates with pressure—short beats when threading, expansive when time pours wide. No scaffold, no filter-verb stacks; high information density throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Living statue telepath threading bottled hesitation through a cracked underwater dome is sui generis, yet emotionally grounded in the universal fear-of-waiting. Transformation test fails if you swap any component—statue, foxglove, delay-poison, garden. Risky structural choice (lyric accumulative) heightens meaning without gimmickry. Specificity anchors abstraction: “school of glassfish spelled names I had forgotten.”</comment>
