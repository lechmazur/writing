<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The seed-sorter’s quiet, ritualized agency is credibly embodied; the moonstone’s warming and the decision to “prod myself” dramatize contradictory impulses under pressure. The final renunciation—knowing the hearer, not the leaf, is transformed—carries visible cost in the dawn descent with ash-flecked hair. Interiority stays concrete and moss-bitter; no therapy-speak intrudes. The only cap is the gentle scope: no second character onstage, so relationship crucible and status dynamics cannot test higher bands.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the decoded sentence reweights the entire arbor-dialogue, costing the sorter their former certainty and loaned height. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout—pattern taught early via leaf-stacks and monuments, cadence deepening until ash sifts like sugar. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 3; no penalty. Persistent constraint—the need to keep ears growing—shapes the final image and future duty.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The arbor’s ash-sift and lichen-understory constrain every sorting choice; the moonstone’s refractive halo literally lets the sorter read veins, charging the final decoding. Spatial choreography is immaculate: trays, monuments, and leaf-landing sites track cleanly. Weather (coal-pale wind) activates the release beat. Micro-objects (prayer peg, sparrow-skull cairn) function as setting pivots. No credibility stumbles; world-rules stay internally coherent.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—can the future be grounded before rumor flies—tightens when the leaf-phrase forces the sorter to build seed-monuments, trading passive decoding for active creation. One meaningful escalation: the shift from reading leaves to building from seeds narrows options and demands visible labor. Cost is legible in ash-dust hair and the arbor’s shiver. Under Accumulative lens, density and pattern-break suffice; no external antagonist required.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: memory must be monumented or it weaponizes into prophecy. The final image—laughing under the generous ashen sky—reweights earlier folklore without moralizing. Recurring motifs (monuments, ash, moss) accrue new charge at closure. Subtext in leaf-patterns and bone-buttons invites counter-readings about erasure vs. preservation. No platitudinal echo; insight stays rooted in tactile particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Perceptual signature is distinct: “mossy delight,” “sift of lightfall,” “grammar only the arbor and the careful can hear.” Syntax lengthens and breathes with spiral leaf-fall, then compresses during prod-and-sort beats. No head-hopping; single POV holds. Lyric elision (“I write the decoded sentence on birch bark and feed it to the airstream”) is pattern-taught and paid off. Dialogue absent by design; voice coherence never wavers.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is lush yet propulsive; each sentence layers image, action, and world-rule. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn; metaphor stacks (ash like sugar, petals from silence) are patterned early and justified. Information density high: one line can sort seeds, date centuries, and anchor folklore. Register stays inside sorter’s mystic vocation; no academic drift. Minor overgrowth in peak beat (−0.1) but clarity at closure untouched.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Floating memory-arbor that converses via leaf-vein syllables is a non-obvious synthesis of meteorology, archive, and divination. Risky second-person address to self (“I prod myself”) pays off by crystallizing agency. Specificity—lichen sipping thunder, nutshell idols—anchors the fantastical in tactile craft. The decoded mantra’s reversal (hearer, not leaf, transforms) feels inevitable yet fresh. No derivative scaffold; premise commits fully without retreat.</comment>
