<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The historian’s interiority is vividly particular—"emotionally rational," "stubborn about facts yet aware of the ache that facts bruise"—and every micro-choice (opening lockers, turning ledger pages, copying scorched names) is tethered to that lens. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in scene, however; the stance is declared rather than enacted under pressure, so the arc feels静态. The final act of writing "Listen" under the gilded L is earned by prior methodical labor, but the cost is intellectual, not visceral. Still, within single-POV limits, the characterization avoids cliché and remains idiosyncratic.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly as Conceptual Repricing: the ledger survives, names are restored, and "Listen" reframes the town’s memory with undeniable social cost. Causal linkage holds—because the rose petal falls, the narrator enters; because the ledger trembles, truth is salvaged—yet the drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: density of found objects and marginalia tightens the moral stakes rather than a plot chain. Orientation is anchored by 120 words (iron key, ivy station, coal scar). One minor scaffold: "I chart what I find by drawing parallels" tells method after the fact; the parallels themselves are shown. Overall the pattern coheres and the final image reweights the premise.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The station is rendered through tactile decay—"metal mouths coughing soot," "ivy shakes out a rain of seeds"—and every detail (gilded L, compass stuck north, tulip photograph) constrains the narrator’s interpretive choices. Spatial choreography is immaculate across lockers, counter, broken roof. Environment, body, and tool jointly charge the closure: the ledger as micro-setting becomes the vessel that forces the final moral act. No credibility slips; overgrown-railway idiom feels lived-in.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—rescuing truth from the pit of lies—is signaled early and deepened through each artifact. Escalation is textural: density of charred slips, torn newspapers, and trembling marginalia reweights the moral cost rather than narrowing external options. One meaningful tightening occurs when the narrator realizes "schedules ran on secrecy," converting archival calm into civic complicity. The price is conceptual (the town’s memory rewritten), visible on the page, but lacks a visceral personal loss, keeping it shy of 8+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme—mercy needs light, not masks—emerges organically from the narrator’s refusal to hire lies as mediators; no moral is stated, only enacted. Subtext lives in the stationmaster’s trembling hand and the tulip photograph, re-weighted at closure when "Listen" is inscribed. The illuminated L functions as a quiet thematic reprise rather than symbol grafted late. Complexity is honored: noble lies are neither demonized nor excused, merely out-lived by the archive.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Voice is lyric-historical, with controlled cadence—"long throat of shadow," "schedules ran on secrecy"—and perceptual signature stays consistent to the emotionally rational scholar who notices marginalia before emotion. No dialogue appears, so naturalism test is waived. Syntax modulates with pressure: shorter clauses when soot coughs from lockers, longer reflective sentences when weighing mercy. Patterned elision ("I chart...") is minor and does not obscure closure; the diction remains within plausibility for a historian’s inner lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive—every sentence layers archive detail with moral tilt. Figurative language is selective: "ivy whispering memory," "station a long throat," each image fresh and non-contradictory. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn; sentence openings vary. One near-scaffold: "I answer myself with steadiness" abstracts a beat that could have been dramatized, but the line is brief and offset by surrounding concretion. Grammar clean; final image ("clock stops blinking") lands with rhythmic snap.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The archival rescue of a burned ledger via rose-timed arrival feels fresh against Holocaust-adjacent tropes; the narrator’s refusal to punish but to "reconcile facts with memory" offers a non-obvious moral calculus. Synthesis of illuminated manuscript aesthetics with railway soot is specific to this piece. Transformation test passes: swap rose/ledger/railway and the emotional logic collapses. Risk in lyric accumulation rather than confrontation is purposeful and paid off. Minor deduction for echoing familiar "truth vs. noble lie" template, but localized detail transcends it.</comment>
