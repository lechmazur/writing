<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The keeper’s wry self-definition—“I am just the last person who said yes”—gives immediate, particular interiority that persists. His micro-choices (lighting the candle, pressing sea-glass to palm, stacking stones) embody the need to “bottle safety,” yet the arc is endurance rather than change; the cost feels diffuse because the prior keeper’s drowning is told, not dramatized. Reticent skipper functions as silent pressure source, but his choices are observed, not enacted, so relationship crucible stays latent. Emotional stakes stay credible and flawed, but the absence of a decisive pivot or visible forfeiture keeps the arc just shy of high-band impact.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of letters-stones-glass tightens the keeper’s duty into communal guardianship; closure lands on “Thank you” left with five stones—an Earned Stasis that forecloses escape from the island role with felt loneliness as cost. Orientation is swift (lamp dies, room, storm), transitions inside mosaic shards are legible, causality is lyric rather than plot-driven. No meaningful pressure turn beyond the lamp failure, so escalation stays modest, but the final image reweights the premise cleanly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lantern room, stone stacks, sea-glass, and candle stub all act as micro-settings that constrain choice and charge closure. Sensory filter is POV-true: keeper notices rust, fog breath, wings on glass, salt dust—details that mirror his haunted vigil. Weather and stones directly guide the only communicative acts available. Spatial choreography stays coherent across bird-invasion and stone-building beats.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—keep the coast’s “tender hush” alive—remains stable; escalation is textural (lamp dies → birds invade → candle lit) rather than causal reversal. Agency is caretaking continuation, not reversal, so cost is atmospheric, not tactical. Because the closure simply affirms endurance, pressure plateaus rather than tightens decisively, keeping score in strong but not exceptional range.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme—safety as shared, anonymous labor—emerges from stone syntax and unsigned letters, never sermonized. Subtext lives in skipper’s silent glance, five-stone code, and “luminescent ache,” all resisting tidy moral. Final image of paper-boat warmth crystallizes the concept with earned poignancy. Minor abstractions (“coast in a jar”) flirt with pseudo-profundity but stay tethered to concrete objects.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lyrical first-person voice sustains a salt-tinged, tidal rhythm; syntax mirrors keeper’s watchful patience—long sentences swell, then shorten into stone-count brevity. Perceptual signature is strong: glass “green as a harbor light,” fog “like breath around a sleeping child.” No dialogue to test, yet internal diction stays within keeper’s plausible lexicon. Filter verbs appear but feel voice-motivated; no head-hop, no register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Metaphor density is high yet patterned early (“room remembered every shipwreck”) so it reads as taught lyric, not clutter. Only two paraphrase loops (“weather and balm, and sometimes both”; “safety is not the absence of loss…”)—minor, not closure-touching. Sentence variety and paragraph rhythm serve emotional cadence; no scaffolding or synonym churn. Prop tracking (glass, stones, letters) stays exact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: anonymous letter-chain + stone semaphore + haunted lighthouse turns familiar maritime solitude into collective haunting. Sea-glass as interior lighthouse reframes obligation as translucent fragility—specific, inevitable in hindsight. Risk in lyric mosaic structure pays off with clear closure. Only near-echo is “lighthouse keeper madness” trope, but communal angle transforms it.</comment>
