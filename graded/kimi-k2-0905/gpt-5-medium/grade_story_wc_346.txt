<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Interiority is lyrical and specific (“bruised awe lived under my ribs”), but the narrator’s agency is largely observational; the filing of one gear is the sole micro-choice that alters the present. The puppet head provides externalized conscience yet never forces a visible trade-off; the final song is tender but not predicated on any prior mistake or flaw. Earned stasis is present—the keeper accepts endless vigil—yet the cost feels abstract rather than bodily or social.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the keeper’s sung lullaby crystallizes a vow whose cost is the perpetual burden of delay. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: patterned nested gears, hush-pane, and lullaby motifs tighten into a final cadence that reweights the world’s noise. One causality micro-slippage: the bent brass tooth is filed, but the story never shows how this literal fix alters the beam’s reach; the song’s power is asserted rather than mechanically traced. Still, the ending image carries undeniable conceptual cost—time itself is borrowed at the price of one human throat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Hidden lighthouse, dusk, pane of hush, and salt-crusted body function as micro-setting that constrains every action: soundless glass dictates the keeper’s silent ritual. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: oil scent on thin gloves, thunder swallowed mid-air. Spatial choreography is clean—stones, sill, gears, window—each object handled in sequence. Final image of lantern beam touching riot horses is hyper-real yet anchored by the prior rule-set; environment directly shapes the tactical outcome.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—delaying apocalypse—declared early; pressure escalates via browning sky and needle lean. Yet escalation is atmospheric, not tactical: no new constraint alters the keeper’s available actions until the final song; the bent gear is fixed without ripple. Cost is conceptual (eternal vigil) rather than visceral or resource-based. One meaningful tightening occurs when the sky browns and the pane thrums, but the keeper’s response is identical to prior nights—sing—so option set does not visibly narrow.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges as the ethics of borrowed time: every lullaby purchases heartbeats for strangers at the price of the singer’s own infinity. Subtext lives in the puppet’s one-eyed reflection—the grin’s counsel “fail singing” is the story’s moral core articulated without sermon. No abstract thesis is stated; meaning accrues through recursive images of nested gears and swallowed thunder. Final image reconfigures prior material: the same song once hummed on a porch now pauses riots, reweighting domestic memory into global mercy.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>First-person voice is singular, salt-crusted, and rhythmically controlled; long liquid sentences mimic tide, then compress under pressure (“I wound the kernel spring, then the next…”). Perceptual signature is consistent: metaphors drawn from clockwork and ocean, never external tech. No dialogue, hence no convergence risk. Patterned elision (“a low bell struck under miles of dark water”) is taught early and paid off in the final hush-concentration. Voice is the story’s primary instrument and never slips register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Figurative density is high but purposeful; every metaphor services the clock/ocean lexicon. No mixed metaphors or contradictory physics. One template cadence risk: repeated “I wound…then…” triple that could read as scaffold, yet it mirrors gear nesting and is justified by voice. Information density strong: one sentence often fuses sensory, emotional, and conceptual work. Final line rests hand on machine—quiet, concrete, perfect cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Premise fuses apocalyptic clock, sound-swallowing glass, and lullaby-as-insurgency—fresh synthesis of mythic and mechanical. Puppet head witness and nested gears feel inevitable in hindsight yet non-obvious at entry. Risk taken: entire world saved by song without battlefield scene, but cost is shifted to keeper’s endless vigil, avoiding sentimental miracle. Specificity of “pane of hush” and “calculus of mercy” prevents template drift. Not quite 9.5 because global stakes remain conceptual, not socially grounded.</comment>
