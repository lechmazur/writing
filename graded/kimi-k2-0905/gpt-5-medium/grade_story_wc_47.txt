<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The narrator’s contradictory impulses—yearning for reconnection while refusing to be spectacle—play out in embodied micro-choices (unlocking the gate, mapping ice-drip circles, proffering then burying the pendant). Interiority stays concrete, never slides into label-speak; the final renunciation of mutual exploitation is earned by the slow, tactile choreography of burial.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative-textural lens taught early: dripping icicles → constellation → burial ground. Closure is a Charged Poise: the exposed chain literalizes “future hand could tug,” re-pricing memory without reconciliation. Cost is felt in the shared kneel, cracked joints, and the vow to stop artistic cannibalism.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting constrains every beat: the moss-swallowed racks dictate silence, the ice-drip circles choreograph movement, the fern bowl becomes the grave. Environmental decay is not backdrop but the material that rewrites their contract. Final image of the half-buried pendant tethered by chain fuses micro-setting with thematic price.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Single dominant stake—will they keep exploiting each other?—tightens when pendant burial forecloses future art-mines. Escalation is textural: each drip-dot and moss layer accrues until the only clean option is burial. Cost (loss of shared artifact) is legible on-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the inversion of data → garden and love → spectacle; no character ever names it. Final image of exposed chain implies memory can be re-excavated but will never again be worn as ornament—earned CR without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>First-person voice maintains a taut lyric register that is neither twee nor clinical: “moss gossiping in a green undertone.” Perceptual signature—tech ruins read as organic anatomy—stays consistent. No head-hop; psychic distance compresses naturally under grief.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm modulates from long, honeyed clauses to cracked-joint brevity at burial. No scaffold loops; metaphors stay coherent within moss-tech fusion. Single near-miss: “quiet like tea” is almost cliché but saved by its function as lidocaine for the next line’s bite.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>Premise—viral confession inside a post-server biome—is fresh, yet the ingenuity is in using ecological reclamation as relationship surgery. The drip-constellation mechanic feels inevitable in hindsight; no swap possible without collapsing the closure image. Risky lyric structure pays off in Charged Poise.</comment>
