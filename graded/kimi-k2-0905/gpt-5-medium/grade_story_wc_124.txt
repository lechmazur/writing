<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Amberhorn revelation turns passive grief into an active, costly choice to return; the vial’s shift from trap to compass externalizes the change. Interiority stays sensorily anchored (“rain returning to a river that had been walking empty”). One micro-choice—offering the lentern—shows value hierarchy with visible cost. Flaw: “diagnostic” tinge in “I understand the impact of memories” line could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the blank vial silently points toward bearable future, reweighting earlier bankruptcy. Causal chain holds: lentern → UV → etching → recognition → renunciation/schedule. Accumulated motif of light-as-memory tightens in final image. Cost is felt in the tears that irrigate the archive—grief made useful.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Greenhouse operates as micro-setting that supplies the UV resource and the last amber-variant; spatially tracked without drift. Moisture, glass, cedar scent filter through POV grief-heightened senses. “Lanterns blooming along the stair” memory fragment anchors era and class. Environment literally guides the final handshake—“return when the garden requests a witness.”</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can the narrator bear the absent scent—tightens when UV script surfaces, foreclosing ignorance. Escalation is textural: each sensory reveal (shadow-music, pollen silence, dawn-shard bud) ups the emotional tariff. The single bud opening acts as the decisive intensification; options narrow to stay or flee, and the promise to return costs future exposure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of memory as weathering current emerges through iterative water/light imagery rather than thesis. Final “night smells of work finally named” crystallizes grief into vocation without moral tag. Subtext in Marla’s refusal of payment shows stewardship outweighing commerce. Avoids closure sermon; resonance lingers in compass-blankness.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lyric first-person carries a perfumer’s synesthetic diction—“cooled music,” “ disciplined lightning”— maintained under stress. Filter verbs (“I feel”) are minimal; perception stays embodied. Rhythm modulates: longer clauses for grief crests, staccato for lantern clicks. No head-hop; POV modesty kept—Marla’s interiority shown only through gesture and scent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>High density—“vial hangs like an unplayed bell” compresses object, sound, absence. No scaffolding loops; each sentence advances image or knowledge. Mixed metaphors avoided; “feathered vapor” stays consistent with bud / light weave. Minor: “tonight my wares lead me” opener is slightly ornamental before pressure arrives.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Extinct-plants greenhouse + grief-activated perfume UV archaeology is a genuine conceptual splice not seen in slush. The lantern-broker trade is more than window dressing—it motivates the lentern tech that unlocks the plot. Risk of lyric density is embraced and paid off in closure image. Transformation test fails if broker/scent/greenhouse elements swapped—high specificity.</comment>
