<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The “scientifically romantic” narrator shows a layered interiority—equations that rhyme, pocket-sun ethics—yet never tips into self-diagnosis. Micro-choices (striking phosphorus, cupping the thimble of proof) externalize the internal contradiction between wonder and methodology. The relationship crucible with the friend is palpable: status shifts from tease to co-witness under shared risk. Only a hairline slip: the final “promise to keep the chamber open” is voiced in summary, not dramatized, so the cost feels fractionally softer than the earned stasis demands.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens: each return to the spiral deepens density rather than re-plots causality. Closure is a Charged Poise—the thimble of weighted clarity reconfigures what a second can carry, with conceptual cost legible in “presence is a metal that refuses to alloy with hurry.” Orientation is taught lyrically by line 3, waiving any anchor penalty. No loop or teleport; the forge trees, ash crownlets, and shell track spatially across beats.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The ember nexus is not backdrop but apparatus: sparks knit constellations that the protagonists must calibrate rather than merely admire. The nautilus columella curl functions as micro-setting—its spiral gutter literally guides the pocket sun’s bead, constraining the final calibration. Sensory economy favors tactile heat over visual catalog; twilight is felt as “eclipse shadow” temperature shift. One hairline over-ornament: “moths that have learned metallurgy” momentarily swerves the POV diction toward fey, but the image pays off by charging the ash crownlets that settle on hair.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: can presence be weighed without dilution? Pressure escalates via density increase—each orbit of the spiral adds ballast until options narrow to “spend it carefully.” Agency is collaborative attention, not confrontation; the cost is forfeiture of haste and the shared burden of future vigilance. No external antagonist needed; the conflict is ontological—time itself must be re-priced. A sharper tactile loss (a spark burn, a shell cut) could have raised the visceral tariff, but the conceptual repricing still lands.</question>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</question><comment>Theme emerges from the reframing of measurement itself—presence as metal, seconds as currency—without ever naming “love” or “time.” The nautilus’s logarithmic honesty becomes a quiet answer to the opening whispered doubt. Subtext operates in the un-kiss: intimacy is calibrated, not declared. Final image reweights the premise: ordinary steps become thresholds, a non-literal moral that feels earned rather than asserted.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</question><comment>First-person voice owns a perceptual signature that fuses lab-book precision with erotic synesthesia (“your whisper tastes of juniper and doubt”). Syntax spirals like the shell—nested clauses that mimic coiling—yet stays legible under pressure. No dialogue contamination; the single spoken phrase is implied, not quoted, preserving lyric distance. Register remains within the alchemist’s plausible lexicon; even “capillary time” sounds coined on the spot, not thesaurus-itis.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Rhythm breathes with the forge trees’ exhale—long sentences swell, then fracture into emphatic monosyllables (“We do not kiss; we calibrate”). Information density is high: one sentence often layers tool, emotion, and world rule. One minor scaffold: “each return loosens a knot… then winds it” is a near-paraphrase of the prior sentence’s structure, but the re-winch notion justifies the echo. No mixed metaphors; pocket sun, spiral gutter, and weighted clarity stay physically coherent.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</question><comment>The core premise—alchemical capture of interpersonal density—feels fresh yet inevitable in hindsight. Risk is taken in lyric repetition of spiral returns, but the pattern is taught by line 7 and pays off in the final thimble of light. Transformation test fails if names/places swap: the specificity of “ember nexus,” “phosphorus chord,” and “capillary time” is inextricable from the emotional patent. No familiar trope is left untwisted; even the pocket-sun trope is re-cast as listening device, not weapon.</comment>
