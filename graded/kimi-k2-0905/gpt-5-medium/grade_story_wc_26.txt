<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira’s gently obsessive caretaker interiority is vivid—her pocketed river-stone ritual embodies contradictory needs for weight and drift. The bargain she strikes, sacrificing her bottled dream-life to free Ilen’s shadow, is a micro-choice that reweights her hierarchy of values on the page. The only friction is that Ilen’s pressure on her is reported rather than enacted in scene, muting the crucible intensity this length demands.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: Mira’s luminous regret is poured literally into the orchard soil, branding the sky with her name as payment—felt cost made undeniable. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the library’s jealous vines, sighing shelves, and petal-applause cadence tighten until blossoming index renames the clouds. The single-scene window is anchored by line 3 (“In the blooming library above clouds”), eliminating orientation risk.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>All detail is sensory-filtered through Mira’s dusk-noticer bias—colors fade, dew settles on pages, rafter-letters bloom—never tourist-catalog. The river stone migrates from pocket to balcony silhouette and finally to Ilen’s palm, constraining both characters’ tactics under the Accumulative lens. Spatial choreography is flawless across reels, bridges, stair-petals; the final sky-blossom ink reweights the setting itself.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—library’s claim versus shadow’s return—tightens once: Mira’s dream sacrifice forecloses her own unlived futures (“empty casing where her dreams had been”). Under Accumulative lens, the tightening is a density/cadence shift rather than causal chain, but the visible price (her bottled roads surrendered) is on-page and alters tactics. No reversals needed; one meaningful deepening suffices for sub-800 words.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the concrete bargain: hope is not a gift but a repossession that demands living currency—Mira’s regret sweetens the orchard roots. The final sky-inscription quietly answers “what does hope cost?” without moralizing. The luminous regret tone crystallizes into conceptual repricing rather than stated thesis, meeting the 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Diction is dusk-attuned: “softly deliberate gait,” “cooled embers,” “skittish ivy”—a perceptual signature consistent with Mira’s chromatic synesthesia. Rhythm modulates: elongated clauses for mist-drifting, staccato for vines tightening. No head-hopping; POV distance stays interior-third with modest inference. Non-standard capitalization is absent, but intentional lowercase cadence in “careful applause” is voice-motivated and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet breathable: “Light rained from the rafters, not burning but washing” performs image, cadence, and causality in one stroke. No filter-verb clusters; simultaneous actions are cleanly sequenced. A hairline slip: “tested distance” leans abstract where a kinetic verb could body the shadow, but it does not touch closure. Overall rhythm and specificity satisfy the 9+ quick test threshold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The “library above clouds” premise is freshly synthesized: dream-orchards watered by sacrificed regrets literalizes hope as commodity. Risk in poetic compression heightens rather than obscures stakes. Transformation test passes—Mira’s specific bargain and name inked in sky could not swap into another tale without collapse. Shadow-detachment trope is reweighted through horticultural-transaction logic rather than gothic curse.</comment>
