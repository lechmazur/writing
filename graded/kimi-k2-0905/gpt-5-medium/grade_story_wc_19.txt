<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator’s contradictory fear of walls vs. hunger for weightless quiet is vivid and embodied; the porcelain doll acts as a second heart, externalizing choice. The final sharing with the father turns a private obsession into mutual architectural mercy, a credible renunciation with cost. Interiority occasionally drifts into abstract flavour lists that flatten moment-to-moment pressure. Still, the micro-choice to “limit exposure” anchors agency and stakes throughout.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the father softens bunker plans into arches after tasting gilded hush—cost is the foreclosing of pure safety in favour of welcoming space. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each tasted silence layers density until the shared sample reweights what “safe” means. Orientation is taught early by inverted-gravity rule; no teleporting props. One minor causality gap: how the doll stores breath is asserted, not demonstrated, but doesn’t break the final beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The xenial trellis—corner-less, cloudgrass tea-cups, lung-like minutes—functions as a micro-setting that actively teaches the narrator wider breath and later informs the redesigned bunker entrances. Specificity is selective: citrus after-laughter, copper apology, mint-before-kiss silence all filter through the protagonist’s synaesthetic goal. Spatial choreography stays clean during gravity inversion; city re-entry ribbon is anchored. Environment, body, and tool (doll) jointly constrain the final image, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“collect a silence my father could understand”—is signaled early and tightens when the rare gilded hush must be rationed. The middle turn narrows options: too much and the narrator loses desire for doors; limiting exposure becomes a tactical necessity. Father’s softening under the shared hush pays the visible cost of abandoning blast-door absolutism. Pressure escalates by accretion rather than reversal, fitting the lyric/accumulative lens cleanly.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: fear vs. welcome, concrete vs. ineffable safety. Silence as tasteable pollen, copper, mint avoids thesis statements; meaning accrues through sensory catalog. Final image of “mapped hush” in father’s hands offers non-literal answer—home as breathable quiet, not locked room. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in the risk of doorless desire.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>First-person voice sustains a synaesthetic perceptual signature—tongue as collector, pulse as moth—without filter-verb clutter. Rhythm contracts and expands like the lung it describes, mirroring tension. Diction stays within poetic but believable lexicon for an anxious, sensory-hungry child. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk is nil; compression and elision are taught by line 3 and paid off at landing.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Sentences vary in length and cadence, propelling the gravity inversion sequence. Figurative layering is dense but patterned, never muddled at the closure beat. Occasional noun-phrase stacks (“gilded hush blown through its beams like pollen”) risk purple, yet serve the textured aesthetic. No loops, paraphrase churn, or scaffold; pronouns track cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Inversion-hour city, tasteable silence archive, and bunker redesign fuse into a singular conceptual stance. The premise reframes claustrophobia as curatorial hunger—fresh without gimmickry. Risky lyric density commits fully and lands coherently under accumulative lens. Specificity of flavours and architectural consequence prevents swap-out with generic fantasy tropes.</comment>
