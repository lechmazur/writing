<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The janitor’s interiority is rich—transparent under starlight, kneeling to panel hums, speaking names of dead engineers—but the arc is a steady deepening rather than a sharp turn; the final “gentler beat” is payoff yet not a fork that forecloses a path, so the cost feels contemplative rather than irreversible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: each meteor streak thickens the station’s sentience and the narrator’s transparency; the midnight power-fail provides the single tightening that reweights stillness into shared kinship; closure is the green flare + slowed heartbeat—a Charged Poise with conceptual cost, though the causal linkage is more lyrical than irreversible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Every sensory pick is filtered through custodial attention: copper-tea floor smell, honeyed lantern glass warming gauges, finger-smear fossils of absent engineers; the station itself is micro-setting, its console ribs and vacuum valves guiding the narrator’s rag and ritual; the final roof-open moment lets ice-wind salt the face while lantern light drapes the gauges—setting actively charges the image and constrains the stance.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: caretaker v. erasure—proving neglected things still warrant witness; pressure escalates via accumulating meteor squeals that map to ignored relays; the power outage is the single tightening that forces roof-open vulnerability; cost is the realized transparency—no longer hiding from grief—but the external station remains unchanged, so the price is internal and felt yet not materially irreversible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from maintenance as devotion: polishing scars instead of erasing them; the station’s memories of a boy and his mother refract the narrator’s own cracked heart; the ending’s spared collision reconfigures stillness into chosen vigilance rather than abandonment—no moral stated, only the image of lantern light on ice, reweighting prior dust.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>First-person lyric voice sustains perceptual signature across the whole piece—syntax breathes with fan rhythms, metaphor clusters are pattern-taught early (constellation stitched to work shirt) and paid off in the green flare; no head-hopping, no register drift; the diction stays within a modest custodial lexicon while reaching for cosmic scale, creating a distinctive rhythmic texture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>High density lines do triple duty: “the station wake like a patient animal unbending its ribs” advances atmosphere, character, and stakes; no paraphrase loops or template cadence; occasional stacked metaphors (“fossil pollen,” “shore loves storms”) stay coherent because the narrator’s spiritual curiosity justifies the reach; closure image is clean, no figurative muddle.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Cosmic janitor as lens onto abandoned infrastructure feels fresh; the method of divining machine aches via meteor streaks is specific, non-obvious, and inevitable in hindsight; risk—using lyric stillness rather than plot reversals—heightens meaning without gimmickry; minor deduction for echoing the “cracked open by love” trope, but the station’s personification transmutes it.</comment>
