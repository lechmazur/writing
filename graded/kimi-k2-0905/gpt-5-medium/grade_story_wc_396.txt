<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The peacekeeper’s calmly intuitive patience is shown through embodied micro-choices—climbing, wrapping, waiting through arguments—rather than labels; the final commitment to stay a season carries visible cost. Interiority stays concrete, but the child-backstory motive is delivered in a single reflective block that slightly flattens the moment it is revealed. Still, the renunciation of certainty and embrace of “walking that follows” feels earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each mirror-loan, shard-angle, and community nod follows because/therefore logic toward the Earned Stasis closure—peacekeeper elects to live there, mantle tightening. Orientation is immediate—basalt steps, ice bite, lantern pears—and the split-scene structure (orchard → vintage store → orchard) is cleanly cued and repaid when the reconstituted sphere hovers. Cost is palpable in the final line: “shadows lace me tighter.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The lighthouse orchard and shifting ice floes are not backdrop—they force the beacon-sapling solution and timed watch shifts. The vintage store’s mirror-choir literally supplies the mechanics of reconstitution, constraining tactics. Micro-setting (silk-wrapped shard, lantern-pear light splash) charges the final image. No other story could swap these places without collapsing.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—how to keep children from vanishing through ice—tightens when the mirrors reveal the shared delay. The protagonist’s agency is to propose the map of amends; refusal to impose certainty narrows options and raises social cost. One meaningful escalation: the floe-split page-turn sound under their first synchronized nod makes the risk audible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme—peace as iterative practice, not verdict—emerges through the sphere’s reassembly by consent and the final image of “practice, finally, is how peace keeps.” No moralizing; the child is reframed as “courageous anomaly,” a conceptual repricing that reweights blame. Subtext in Harun studying the ground and Matilde wiping brine shows theme lodged in gesture.</answer>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>First-person voice maintains a lyric-compressed texture—“trees bowed under fruit that held small moons”—without purple overload. Perceptual signature is steady: brine, smoke, unslept prayers flavor every observation. Syntax modulates—long sentence for mirror hum, fragment for “a floe split with a sound like a page turning”—under peak pressure. No head-hopping; vintage-store owner stays external.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with scene tempo—short clauses during nod, expansive during mirror assembly. Information density high: “shard catching lost angles from glass that had watched a hundred unspoken bargains” does three jobs. No filter-verb stacks, no mixed metaphors; only one paraphrase loop (“not together and not apart”) that serves cadence. Closure image pristine.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Frozen lighthouse orchard with moon-fruit and vintage mirror-reconstruction is a risk that pays off: the implausibility is taught early and becomes the only path to the closing sphere. The child-ice crack memory reframed as “courageous anomaly” flips standard blame narrative. Synthesis of cli-fi, magical realism, and restorative-justice procedural feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
