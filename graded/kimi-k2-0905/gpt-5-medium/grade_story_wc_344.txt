<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>The locksmith’s interior contradiction—driftwood nostalgia vs. the need to mend time—stays embodied (cedar breath trembles the clocks). Micro-choices (filing the notch, leaving the crescent key) trace a credible renunciation that costs him permanence. Yet the “repair” motive is declared more than dramatized until late; earlier beats lean on atmospheric gesture. The final nod to younger selves crystallizes growth, but the emotional ledger could carry sharper loss.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the palm-sized wheel spins as “steady heart,” daylight spills, and the library creaks—cost is the perpetual loan of his attention. Causality holds under Accumulative lens: each gear tweak accrues until mirrors thaw, reconfiguring meaning. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are taught by line 3 and paid off when younger selves appear. One causality hairline: the prophecy bottle’s power is externally granted, but cedar memory motivates, softening the break.</comment>

<comment>Frozen library above clouds is no postcard; cold contracts leather gloves, glass fogs then clears, constraining finger dexterity at the decisive gear-touch. The hall-of-mirrors micro-setting reprises: each pane reflects intention, not face, steering his tactile route. Spatial choreography is flawless—lectern of rime, kelp-ribbon vellum, moon-lampshades track without drift. One notch above 8.7 because the setting itself charges the final image: thaw-creak becomes harbor bell.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—repair as reciprocal attention—tightens when mirrors shiver with embarrassment; each gear adjustment forecloses another minute of his life. The cedar uncapping is the visible price that steadies the clocks but exposes his memory to communal use. Agency is attention-based, not violent, fitting Accumulative escalation. Could breach 8.8 if a tangible object were permanently forfeited; the wheel is left behind but its cost is only implied.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as “attention is the only tide we can borrow.” Subtext lives in gesture—setting the gear among mirrors donates his heartbeat to the library. No moralizing; final dawn poured into ink reweights earlier snowfall without sermon. One tick down because driftwood nostalgia is named twice; the second articulation edges toward echo rather than earned reprise.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric-technical, filtering locksmith perception through gear-teeth and eyelash clicks. Syntax mirrors clockwork: clauses slot like cogs, then release into tidal cadence. No head-hopping; frost librarians stay external, seen only as reflective “bright.” Perceptual signature sustains from “soft hush of a distant morning” to final “creak like old boats,” an auditory through-line that modulates with pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is high-density yet breathable: “the air rang thin” fuses sensory and spatial data in four words. Mixed metaphors avoided; clock, tide, and mirror vocabularies interlock cleanly. One minor scaffold—“mirrors turned from ice to water to window”—lists states without new pressure, a −0.2 loop. Otherwise rhythm varies, paragraph cuts are surgical, and final line lands with image-propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses eclipse-keysmith, sky-library, and mirror-hall into an inevitable constellation; removing any layer collapses the whole. Risky lyric accumulation succeeds under Accumulative lens, proving quiet attention can supplant plot explosions. Driftwood nostalgia transformed from sentimental cue into operational memory-gadget. Fresh inflection: repair as tidal loan, not ownership. One step below 9+ only because the prophecy bottle introduces external magic that slightly dilutes the locksmith’s own ingenuity.</comment>
