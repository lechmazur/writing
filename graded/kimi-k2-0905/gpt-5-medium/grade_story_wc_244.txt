<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The logistician’s “desperately jocular” fatigue is vivid in early lines, but interior contradiction never sharpens into a visible micro-choice; the smile stays a label rather than a lever. The child who pockets the moon rock at the end is the only figure who undergoes a legible shift, and that moment is off-stage from the POV. Because the narrator’s own stake in reciprocity is asserted rather than dramatized, the emotional cost is felt second-hand. Still, the cast’s collective performance of kindness is specific enough to keep the score in the strong band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the moon rock passed to the child crystallizes the “cure” as a living relay, not a delivery. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—rumor, soup, postcards accrue until the final image reweights the premise with undeniable social cost. Causality is lyrical, not linear, yet each beat adds density; the midnight trolley arrives as a credible materialization of accumulated goodwill. The ending’s cost is palpable: the logistician erases their name, trading identity for system, a sacrifice legible only because the pattern was taught.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The ivy-choked platform is more than backdrop: leaky skylight dictates candle logistics, timetable folds become speaking rostrums, gutters sing louder than the cellist—environment constantly steers tactics. Spatial choreography stays crisp even with a crowd; bodies queue, pass thermoses, circle under leak. The moon rock functions as micro-setting, its heft anchoring turn-taking; its final relocation to a child’s pocket charges the closing image. Weather arrives as causal partner, not ornament, forcing the power outage that triggers the logistician’s fastest move.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—loneliness cured by reciprocity—is signaled early and tightens once: postcards cost “a memory, prepaid by whoever hugged you last,” a rule that forecloses casual participation. The trolley’s arrival is not coincidence but the materialized answer to that rule, turning abstract rumor into concrete social debt. No antagonist is needed; pressure is the growing queue of promises. The final applause is earned because every prior beat ladled soup or chalked a name, making the community the agent that resolves its own need.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges without sermon: reciprocity is shown as logistics, not morality—take soup now, return a joke later. The moon rock’s migration from timetable to child pockets reweights “gift” as obligation that outlives giver, a conceptual repricing that lands in the final whisper. No character states the moral; instead the closing note’s map of favors owed becomes the story’s moral ledger. The result is an aftertaste of collective responsibility that feels earned, not asserted.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The narrator’s perceptual signature is lyric-cumulative, filtering the station through synesthetic lists: “tea brewed in a signal lantern,” “rain that smelled like green metal.” Syntax stretches into breathless catalogues that mimic rumor’s sprawl, yet rhythm tightens at each tactile moment. Compression like “tidied the chalk, thanked the pigeons” teaches the reader to accept elision; the final quiet mislaying of the name pays it off. Voice never breaks POV—collective “we” stays consistent, individual interiorities surface only through gesture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Line-level density is high: single sentences often couple sensory snap with social calculus—“laughter from the station to the street” compresses redistribution into image. Mixed metaphors are avoided; “a tent being opened” stays within the logistician’s jocular register. One scaffold loop—“return later, return different, return real”—is purposeful pattern, not artifact. Only a trace of template cadence in the triple-rule chalkboard keeps this shy of 9.0.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The premise—disaster relief as anarchic kindness theatre in an abandoned station—is non-obvious and fully committed. Reciprocity-as-logistics reframes mutual aid as aesthetic practice, not policy brief. Risky lyric accumulation could have collapsed into twee, but the final image of the nameless logistician vanishing while favors circulate proves the concept. Specificity of props (moon rock, signal-lantern tea) grounds the fantastical frame, making the freshness feel inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
