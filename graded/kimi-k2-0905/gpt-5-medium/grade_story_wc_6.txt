<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Interiority is lyrical but embodied through kelp-scent, coin-weight, hose-rack memory; her unarticulated hierarchy—“answer alarms and answer water”—crystallizes a credibly split self. The boy’s bandaged hand and olive graft supply relational stakes, yet his interior is ventriloquised (“smiled as if forgiven”) rather than owned. Father-inheritance is handled as wind-reading skill repurposed, not psychologised, so motive stays coherent. The final stance costs her the private song-exchange, a visible forfeiture that satisfies earned stasis.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: density of elemental echo (black sand, red thread, obsidian, graft) intensifies until the olive-tongue graft and coin-pinning reconfigure meaning. Closure is Charged Poise—“a tide worked steadily…”—where cost is felt as perpetual double duty, not explained. Orientation anchors by line 4; no ambiguity. Persistent constraint: she must keep answering both fire and water, a price legible in the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Micro-settings—black-sand pinch, coin pendulum, olive seedling—function as tactile tools that constrain tactics. Obsidian lagoon mirrors internal glass-edge while remaining a real geothermal vent; choreography stays clean. Sensory economy favors salt-lava-kelp triad, never tourist catalogue. Final image of coin above hose rack re-weights workplace sanctum, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: can the town hold its story without burning? Pressure tightens when the coin’s west-lean blesses the lagoon ritual, foreclosing retreat. Protagonist’s agency is attention/ritual, not fight; cost is the exposed, perpetual double-allegiance she accepts. Escalation is accumulative—each echo (sand, coin, graft) raises the ante until the olive splice makes the transfer irreversible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges as transmission of harm-transformation: fire-heritage → wind-skill → water-song → grafted olive. No thesis stated; final “graceful delay that gave breath a chance” is imagistic answer. Subtext in boy’s bandaged hand and her unspoken match-rattle memory keeps complexity open. Conceptual repricing: compassion is not forgiveness but a forced synchrony of opposites, priced as lifelong tension.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyric-accumulative voice taught early—“kelp-drift peace clung…”—and held; patterned elision (“she spoke her name and her father in the same breath”) is legible. Perceptual signature: firefighter notices draft direction, char-float, hose-rack; never generic nature gaze. Rhythmic control under pressure: short beats (“Westward, the coin leaned…”) sync with decision moment. No head-hopping; boy’s smile is external read.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High information density—each sentence layers sensory, symbolic, causal work without scaffold. Figurative language is disciplined: volcanic glass = pupil, gulls = runes, yet metaphors stay physically coherent. No loops or synonym churn; varied sentence openings create tidal rhythm. Minor elevated diction (“pale runes”) is POV-consistent and does not blur peak beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fusion of arsonist-child + firefighter + lava-lagoon song is non-obvious synthesis that feels inevitable. Risk in lyric accumulative structure pays off: closure image of coin above fire-station door recharges every prior element without repetition. Transformation test: story collapses if olive/graft or volcanic sand removed—specificity anchors novelty. Avoids stock disaster tropes; stakes are civic memory, not spectacle.</comment>
