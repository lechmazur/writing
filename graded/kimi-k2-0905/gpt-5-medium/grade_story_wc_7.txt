<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The chef’s synesthetic gift is embodied in every beat—tasting rust, chalk, birthday smoke—so motivation stays sensory and urgent. Interior contradiction surfaces when he spits guilt onto the soil, admitting complicity in forgetting; this micro-choice tilts the present. The final act of feeding neighbors crystallizes his hierarchy of values: memory > safety, with the cost of exposure to council censure legible in the chipped cups. No stock therapy-speak; even “rebellion” is shown via pruning, not labels.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the soup circulates, synapses rewire, and the city’s discarded stories regain currency—cost is the chef’s future vulnerability. Causal chain holds: alignment → seed sprouts → pruning edits memory → communal tasting reconfigures social fabric. Orientation is swift—rusted greenhouse, drowned district, celestial clock—all within 60 words. One lens ambiguity: is the tree’s growth literal or metaphor? The final image reweights the premise either way, so waiver applies.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Greenhouse as micro-setting constrains every move—glass shards in soil, copper-veined leaves brushing cracked panes—so environment literally shapes pruning choices. Weather (wind rehearsing old song) and planetary light curve act as timers, forcing the chef to taste faster. Spatial choreography is clean: door sigh, soil sift, palm press, ladle lift—bodies track without drift. The color “human tongues never name” charges the final image, meeting 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can memory survive civic erasure—tightens with each cut: every pruned branch deletes a neighborhood story to make room for new growth. The council’s ordinance against memory food externalizes pressure; the chef’s gentle refusal to hate escalates risk. One meaningful reversal: tasting the classroom’s unfinished equations turns bitter, forcing him to spit—this act narrows options and commits him to shared ingestion. Cost is visible: the seedling’s luminous bark exposes the greenhouse to surveillance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through edible archives: collective memory is a public utility, not private nostalgia. Subtext lives in gesture—neighbors “slip inside like wary birds,” accepting soup equals accepting surveillance risk. No moralizing; the final image of synaptic soup circulating reweights the premise without sermon. Ambiguity lingers: will the council crush them tomorrow? The possibility remains, charging the quiet victory.</comment>

<comment>First-person voice carries a chef’s perceptual signature—flavors confess, broth is the color of old copper—syntax tastes and serves. Rhythm modulates: long lyrical sentences for alignment light, clipped fragments during pruning cuts. No head-hopping; interiority stays strictly bounded to what tongue and palm can know. Experimental compression (“shadows curved like commas”) is pattern-taught early and paid off when the final sentence offers a grammared city rebuilt.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sentence variety is musical—participle openers, em-dashed interruptions, single-word beats—yet causality stays lucid. Figurative density is high but purposeful; every metaphor (planets falling into geometry, seed smooth as polished thought) reappears reweighted at closure. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold. One mixed vehicle: “boot prints blooming with rust” stretches bloom semantics, but the image is brief and doesn’t tangle the climax.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Memory-tasting chef planting synaptic fruit during planetary alignment is fresh, yet grounded in haptic detail—no airy conceit. The gentle rebellion via soup tasting flips typical dystopia tropes: no explosions, only shared spoons. Risk: lyric horticultural SF in under 800 words could collapse into whimsy, but specificity of dumpling-blackout and paycheck-burning keeps it earned. Transformation test fails if chef is swapped out—his palate is the plot engine.</comment>
