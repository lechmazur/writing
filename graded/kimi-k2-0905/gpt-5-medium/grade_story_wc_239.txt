<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The lone narrator’s contradictory impulses—desire to judge vs. need to listen—are embodied in the dictionary-handling beats and the final renunciation of verdict. Interiority is concrete (“dictionary cracked softly”) and avoids diagnostic labels. The earned hinge-stance costs certainty and is legible in the last marginal note.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each spiral circuit thickens meaning-density until the final Charged Poise re-weights the premise. Orientation is taught by line 3; the hush-body metaphor signals pattern. Closure lands with conceptual cost—“Be listening” forever surrenders the authority to speak last.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Temple floor mosaic, meteor-stone lectern, and sun-bleached dictionary are tactile, choice-limiting objects that charge the final image. Spatial choreography is clean—spiral path, strap-loosening, scroll-placement track. Selective sensory detail (taste of further air) sustains lyric momentum.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</question><comment>Dominant stake—can memory be stitched without lying—tightens as each spiral loop trades certainty for clearer questions. The reversal is the protagonist’s abandonment of adjudication; cost is the permanent exile from declarative history. Agency is interior yet forecloses external authority.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the spiral-image: meaning is not fixed but breathed into by listening. Final marginal note re-prices the quest from mastery to hospitality. No moralizing; resonance arises from the hush inhaling through stone and bone. Complexity—truth vs. continuity—remains unsettled yet legible.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Lyric first-person voice sustains perceptual signature (“long held chord,” “wanderingly exact letters”). Syntax modulates with pressure—short clauses under spiral walk, longer breaths at lectern. Non-standard capitalizations (“Listen”) are pattern-taught and paid off. No head-hopping; distance stable.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</question><comment>High metaphor density is justified by accumulative design; mixed metaphors are avoided. No loops or template cadence. Sentences do multiple jobs: “The hush agreed with a tremor” fuses setting, character, and consent. Final line gives cadence resolution without scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</question><comment>Fresh synthesis: cosmic archivist + spiral dispute court + dictionary margin as verdict. Risky lyric structure held by taught hush-body metaphor. Transformation test fails—swap dictionary for scroll and spine remains—but specificity of “obsolete sense: to make room within” is irreplaceable. Conceptual integrity intact.</comment>
