<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The narrator’s interiority is textured and embodied—kneeling to the ridge, feeling the star warm in the palm—but the guides remain symbolic instruments rather than pressure agents; no contradiction is staged between them, so the relationship crucible is dormant. The final reach for courage is credibly prepared by the vigil beat and the persistent shimmer at the ankles, earning the Earned Stasis with cost: the skiff nested inside the ribs is a visceral forfeiture of pure return. Still, the guides’ dialogue drifts toward maxim-speak (“no wrong, only unfinished”) that slightly flattens individual voice. Overall, a strong single-POV arc of hesitancy-to-carry, but secondary characters do not exert status or tactical force.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the star-mapped palm and internalized skiff constitute a Charged Poise—options reconfigured, future rowing now inevitable, cost felt. Causality is lyric-accumulative rather than strictly because/therefore; the ridge appears when the leash breaks, the ferry floats on choices, and each bend walked converts fear into path—tightening achieved through pattern, not reversal. Orientation is deliberately dreamlike but anchored early by the bay’s stones and moon-stitched ridge; disorientation serves closure, so Orientation Test waived. One minor slack: the phrase “skiff nest inside my chest” is the first intimation of interior ferry; the metaphor arrives late yet still reweights stakes on the final line, satisfying the cost test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Every grain of sand clicks like a clock, the fog is “quiet linen,” the tide lays a hand on the back—tactile, auditory, kinesthetic specificity filters through the narrator’s twilight vigil bias. The veiled ridgeway and silver-water ferry are sketched with minimum brushstrokes yet constrain every step: the path stiffens into memory, pools remember sky—environment as moral meter. Spatial choreography holds: from mud-kiss to ridge spine to town lights, bodies and distances track. The star stamp on the palm finally re-enters the body as oar-lock, satisfying the 9+ gate by charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—finding unused courage—threads every beat; indirect routes and star-forks tighten options without external antagonist. Pressure escalates accumulatively: each bend walked converts abstract fear into concrete path, star-click serving as micro-yes cadence. Cost is visible: the skiff is no longer external but nested behind ribs, a permanent burden/choice. No coincidence resolves; the protagonist’s own feet and reached hand crystallize stance—Earned Stasis with felt weight.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: broken leash → bay hush → star map → internal skiff; no explicit thesis stated. The lullaby motif returns as surf-thread that binds steps to guides, reweighting earlier music into responsibility. Final image answers the story’s question—courage is not found ahead but beside, in the silence that follows—achieving Conceptual Repricing without moralizing. Minor dock for proverb drift in guide dialogue, but subtext elsewhere rests in gesture and oar-rhythm.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>First-person lyric voice maintains consistent perceptual signature: tide slackens “like a sigh,” ticket punch glints “like frost,” diction stays within twilight introspection register. Rhythmic control mirrors emotional pressure—long flowing sentences in vigil, shorter clause-pulses at star-clicks. No head-hopping; guides speak but focalization stays tightly interior, their words filtered through the narrator’s ear. Compression (“water is thin and silver”) is taught early and paid off when the same water is internalized, achieving patterned legibility at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>High information density: each sentence layers metaphor and action—“skiff kisses the mud with the sound of a yawn” does setting, tactile sense, and mood in one stroke. No paraphrase loops or template cadence; sentence openings vary, paragraph lengths breathe with scene tempo. Figurative language is selective, never overwrought; mixed-metaphor risk avoided by staying within maritime textile lexicon (linen, stitch, seam). One clause-borderline: “eddy of silence that follow my ankles” could read as personification overstock, but it immediately earns tactile payoff when the narrator reaches and finds warmth, so artifact does not touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The ferry-that-floats-on-choices is a fresh ontological tilt on the afterlife/quest trope, fused with ticket-punch star map—specific, not borrowed. Vigil in twilight converted into clock-sand ridge that remembers unlived doors feels inevitable in hindsight, not gimmicky. Risky lyric compression is sustained without clarity loss, heightening emotional stakes. If names and geography were swapped, the internal architecture would collapse—proof of irreducible originality.</comment>
