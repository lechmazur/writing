<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The collective “we” generates a diffuse, shifting interiority; while contradictory impulses flicker (“unsure whether to sing or remain discreetly rooted”), no single character’s micro-choice visibly costs them. The guard’s badge drop is emotionally legible but elided—the beat is summarized, not dramatized—so the renunciation feels convenient rather than earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the widening doorway and shared breath reconfigure meaning with undeniable conceptual cost (“we go through”). The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern builds through echoing hums, fogged glass, and thawing ice—yet the final image crystallizes stakes cleanly. Orientation is swift; who/where/when anchors by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The cobalt atrium, humming quartz, and frozen lake evolve from backdrop to tactical pressure: the colonnade’s harmonics literally steady the walkers, the lake’s cracking stanza externalizes permission. Micro-setting (fogged glass as “diaphragm”) constrains visibility and thus courage. Sensory triangulation (mineral, ink, snow) is filtered through collective awe, never touristic.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—will collective voice risk re-opening?—is signaled early; pressure deepens via synchronized breath and the guard’s audible tear, narrowing options to cross or retreat. The lake’s audible crack is an earned micro-turn that complicates rather than rescues. Cost is atmospheric yet legible: the ban’s internalized fear thaws into shared vulnerability.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without sermon: “thresholds remember why they exist” reframes prohibition into invitation. The paraphrased decree’s inversion from “Keep afraid” to “Touch gently” reweights prior tape-and-X imagery. Final image of porous boundary offers resonant non-moral: community as weather moving across faces, blurring without erasing contours.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Collective first-person plural maintains coherent interiority; no head-hop occurs. Perceptual signature is lyric, compressed, pattern-taught (“lantern-moth hush” repeats with shifting emotional charge). Syntax mirrors inhaled suspense—clause-stacking, en-dash breathlessness—then exhales into open cadence at the threshold. Register stays within communal mythic idiom; no academic leakage.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>High information density: each sentence layers sensory, metaphoric, and causal work. Figurative language is deliberate—humming quartz as throat, lake as stanza—without purple overload. Minor template cadence in “they say the law once read…” is voice-motivated, paid off at closure. Zero paraphrase loops; pronoun and tense control exact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Premise—post-ban collective re-entry via poet-led breath ritual—feels fresh yet inevitable. Synthesis of civic protest, acoustic architecture, and lyric hush transforms familiar “ thaw” trope into lived civic moment. Risk in collective POV pays off: chorus becomes character. Transformation test fails if names/places swapped, proving specificity.</comment>
