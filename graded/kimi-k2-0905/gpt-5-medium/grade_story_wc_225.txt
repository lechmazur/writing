<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The exiled tutor’s guilt is viscerally embodied in the frozen village; every micro-choice (touching threads, counting knight-steps) externalizes self-forgiveness as a literal unweaving of time. Interior contradiction—strategic detachment vs. remembered pity—drives each tug of thread. The final renunciation of instant release carries visible cost: he dooms himself to lingering memory (the pigeons stay frozen) and the choice is earned by the prior chain of causality. Flaw: “strategy must ignore pity” edges toward diagnostic label-speak; a −0.3 there keeps this just outside the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the village exhales in increments while the protagonist accepts a lifelong partial penance; cost is felt in the image of the still-pigeons he must forever carry. Causal lattice holds: each thread-pull tightens options under the “because/therefore” lens—wrong tug tastes ash, right tug frees a droplet. Orientation is taught early (time-frozen square by line 3) and pays off in the fountain’s first overflow. One persistent constraint—the frozen pigeons—shapes the final image and guarantees the price keeps working on him.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Platinum labyrinth fountain operates as micro-setting: its mirrored channels constrain every thread-pull, guiding which droplet will move and charging the final overflow. Sensory hierarchy is POV-tuned—dust taste, rasp of thread, hush as loom-pressed—never tourist catalog. Spatial choreography is immaculate: knight-step count across border knots is tracked without drift. Weather (held thunder) functions as coherent pressure, not backdrop. The object’s reweighted return (overflow only after last thread choice) lifts this to high band; environment actively shapes tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—self-forgiveness vs. risk of repeating sacrificial logic—is signaled in paragraph 5 and tightened when wrong tugs literally taste ash. Escalation is incremental but causal under chosen lens: each correct thread-pull narrows future options (some paths now barred by new anchors) and raises visible price (ash taste, squeezed ribs). No coincidence resolves; storm stays held as protagonist’s choice pends. Cost is legible but stays internal; a slightly stronger external forfeiture would push this into 8.8+ territory.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particular: frozen time as externalized remorse, unweaving as gradual atonement. No abstract sermon; meaning accrues via returned laughter of barmaid and mason—proof that villages need not be sacrificed. Final image (overflow mirrored maze) non-literally answers “can forgiveness be winnowed from silence?” with a visual yes, but only partial, paid for by perpetual pigeons. Resists tidy moral; complexity lingers in the breathing hush that still holds some motionless wings.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>First-person voice carries a chess-tutor’s perceptual signature: strategic metaphors (knight-pace, pilgrim regards shrine), numerical counting, filtering world as board patterns. Syntax modulates from long lyrical coils to staccato “I tugged gently” under pressure. No head-hop; interiority stays strictly bounded. Diction stays within plausible lexicon of a tutor trained in courtly war-games. Distinct rhythmic control—compressed fragment “I breathed until…” heightens tension without clarity loss—earns the high band.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: each sentence layers image, metaphor, and causal cue (“dust rose as if listening”). Figurative language is patterned early (loom, maze, game) and pays off without muddle. No loops or scaffold; near-zero paraphrase. Minor register spike—“conceptual repricing” territory in “kernel of time from chaff of regret”—is justified by tutor’s analytical mind and doesn’t obscure closure. Strong sentence variety; paragraph cuts land on image-turns that advance rather than restate.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses fantasy time-stop with allegorical tapestry-rewriting; synthesis feels fresh yet inevitable. Frozen-increment release avoids familiar instant-thaw trope; choice to keep pigeons suspended is a bold risk that sharpens thematic cost. Transformation test passes—story would collapse without chess tutor’s exact guilt and method. No close echoes of famous scenes. Voice-level originality (platinum labyrinth as mirrored game, knight-paced threading) elevates standard redemption arc into memorable territory.</comment>
