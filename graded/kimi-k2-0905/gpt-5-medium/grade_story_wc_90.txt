<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The pacifist trait is credibly embodied through micro-choices (naming angers, unclenching fists) and the final renunciation of force to open the lock; the interior contradiction between “push” and pacifism is active in-scene. The emotional arc from grief-ballast to calibrated gladness is legible and paid for with on-page breath-control. Missing a second character or relationship crucible keeps it just under the 9-band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the narrator forecloses the conqueror path, seals the promise with breath, and the cost—perpetual solitude and stewardship—is felt in the final image. Causal chain (grief→weight→lock→balance→entry) holds without gaps; the lock’s weight-logic is taught early and obeyed. Orientation is anchored by line 3; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The recycled ship, greenhouse spinach failure, and comet rag function as micro-settings that physically constrain tactics (gravity deck, failed crops, anchoring). Kwan yin’s tear as body-adjacent object charges the final balance test. Selective sensory detail (lunar-rain cool, cracked acetate) is filtered through caretaker priorities; spatial choreography remains coherent across zero-G moves.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—open the lock without violence—tightens once the weight-rule is taught; every subsequent breath and memory either risks sealing or easing the hatch. The decisive turn is the calibrated gladness that lets palms touch the scale: a narrowing of options under the causal lens. Cost is visible: perpetual guardianship replaces conquest.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of compassionate creation versus violent opening emerges through the lock’s weight-test, seed-library reveal, and the final breath-sewn promise—never stated outright. The orchard and village anecdotes reweight the pacifist ethic from abstraction to lived refusal. Final image of sprouts rising under balance offers resonant non-literal answer: beginning again is the anti-apocalypse.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>First-person voice maintains consistent ghostly cadence and gravitational metaphor-set; no head-hop. Syntax modulates with pressure—short clauses under hatch-murmur, longer breath-units during story-payment. Diction stays within caretaker’s contemplative lexicon; no register drift. Distinct perceptual signature: grief as ballast, joy as buoyancy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>High information density: each sentence advances image or stakes (“lock listened to weight like a judge”). No loops or synonym churn; metaphors are coherent (quilt of hulls, minnow-seeds). Rhythm breathes with zero-G drift; paragraph breaks mirror breath units. Clean grammar, no scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Weight-sensitive pacifist lock is a fresh speculative mechanism; seed-library as anti-weapon reweights trope of forbidden vault. Mosaic of dead albums, dried tears, and kwan yin bead synthesizes recycled cosmology with Buddhist-inflected futurism. Risk in lyric elliptical structure pays off: closure reconfigures meaning without violence. Feels inevitable yet un-stolen.</comment>
