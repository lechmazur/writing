<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Ivo’s synesthesia-by-touch and plant-grammar are vivid, but his internal contradiction—wanting imperfection yet trading his “best brush”—is only asserted, not dramatized in a moment where the two impulses collide. The final “no longer searching” feels tidy; we are told the song finds him rather than watching a micro-choice that surrenders control. Mira remains functional, a kindly gatekeeper rather than a crucible who forces a status shift. The cost (his old painterly identity) is named, not embodied on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The lens is Accumulative/Textural: reed image, plant-code, and furnace heat layer until the final cadence reweights “imperfection” as audible rhythm. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the broken-goblet bell and “awakenings for everyone” crystallize a communal stance whose cost is the forfeiture of perfect clarity. Causality is lyric rather than sequential; pattern is taught early (plant lexicon) and paid off in the bell/iris reprise. One scaffold tic—“after the phoenix rises” repeated thrice—slightly dulls the final tightening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Heat, smoke-flavor, and temperature-as-color give the courtyard a tactile signature that constrains Ivo’s perception; the reed tongue and cooling glass function as micro-settings that charge the final image. Spatial choreography is clean—bench, sill, furnace, gate—anchored through bodily action (ash cleaning, reed lifted to lips). Selective detail (thyme for empathy, crooked iris) keeps description economical and stakes legible. The glass “remembering flame” is the one image that re-illuminates prior material in the closing bell-ring.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The dominant stake—trading certainty for a new sense of beauty—tightens once: the reed is acquired, then used, then re-defined as listening rather than seeing. Pressure is lyric and accumulative; no external antagonist or reversal, but the stakes feel proportionate to a vignette. Cost is conceptual (loss of chromatic certainty) rather than visceral; a concrete forfeiture (the brush handed over) helps, yet the later “small cuts” are only mentioned in aggregate. Escalation is modest but coherent under the Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: perfection is a limited currency, and flawed resonance is richer than true color. The plant-code and reed-song embody the idea rather than explaining it; the final bell of a broken goblet literalizes “beauty in breakage.” Ambiguity lingers—visitors leave “gloveless,” carrying cuts as signatures—inviting reflection on voluntary imperfection. One near-allegory line (“awakenings shimmer like bubbles”) is offset by sensory specificity elsewhere.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The voice is lyrically compressed yet legible: “shapes clear but hues guessed” teaches the synesthetic filter in four words. Syntax flexes with heat—long breathy clauses cool into short staccato plant-names, mirroring glass cooling. No dialogue, so naturalism is moot; the plant-code functions as indirect speech whose subtext is empathy/permission. Register stays painterly but never drifts into purple because diction is tethered to temperature and taste.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm alternates between furnace-heat spillage and clipped herbals, creating a listenable musicality. A few decorative pairs—“quiet like glass cooling under a patient cloth” followed immediately by “wavering forms”—slightly over-lush the same beat. Information density is high: one sentence often does three jobs (setting, metaphor, temperature). No paraphrase loops or template cadence, but the triple incantation of “after the phoenix rises” leans toward ritual filler rather than necessary pattern.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synesthetic plant-code economy feels fresh and internally inevitable; swapping herbs would break the logic. The “bartered awakenings” bazaar is sketched rather than exploited for wow, keeping focus on Ivo’s private re-tuning. Risk is taken in eschewing causal plot for accumulative lyric, and it largely pays off through sensory specificity. Reed-as-moth metaphor is familiar, but its function—tuning wind to truth—recontextualizes the trope.</comment>
