<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid—“I move people like water”—but the prophetic knack is asserted, not embodied in a moment of failure or cost. The narrator’s choice to scatter the specs through light is active, yet the emotional contradiction inside that decision remains off-stage. We learn traits, but the stakes never test them under pressure; the only risk is the agent’s blank report, which the narrator never learns. Relationships (keeper) are atmospheric rather than crucible; no status shift hinges on her.</comment>

<comment>Causal chain is lyric but traceable: envelope → microdot → fortune-cookie translation → lighthouse projection → town sees its own open secret. Closure is a Conceptual Reprice: the sentence “You already know” reweights years of silence; cost is the townspeople’s inability to keep pretending—felt in their “thank you” shoulders. Orientation is taught by image rather than exposition—neon fizz, salt-white boots—and pays off at the lit-wall reveal. One causality wobble: the agent’s future blank report is predicted but never verified on-page, so the dare’s price is prospective, not lived.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Harbor, causeway, and lighthouse are filtered through a night-walker’s selective eye—“the lens grumbles in its sleep”—so setting becomes character. The sugar-sticky hands and salt-white boots tether the final image to tactile consequence. Spatial choreography is clean: from dock to causeway to lantern room without drift. Weather is used as moral barometer—“the tide thought things over”—but the metaphor is anchored in the narrator’s footfalls, not authorial ornament.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: can the narrator make the town acknowledge its own open secrets? Escalation is accumulative: each fortune cookie tightens the whisper-net until the lighthouse flash forces visibility. Agency is present—he brews ink, feeds the lens—but the cost is borne by others; his own flesh never pays. The tightening lands cleanly: “everyone finally looked,” a Charged Poise that forecloses the old etiquette of seeing/not-seeing.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from refracted light and refracted truth: arranged visibility is kinder than exposed secrecy. The microdot-as-confession and fortune-as-oracle braid into a single moral: recognition hurts less when it feels self-authored. No moralizing sentence utters this; it’s coded in the almond biscuit and the silent thank-you shoulders. The final refrain “see what you have done” invites plural readings—accusation, invitation, mirror—without pinning allegiance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is a hushed, night-breathing cadence—syntax lengthens and contracts like tide sludge. Perceptual signature is salt-specific: “hair lit with ember ends from the lamps” could belong only to a lighthouse keeper sharing cigarettes. No head-hop; “I” stays consistently half-drunk on its own metaphor. Dialogue shards—“Got your fortune”—are idiomatic and status-coded without quotation clutter, preserving the lyric flow.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm is oceanic: long swells, then short breakers—“We boiled sugar, inked rice.” No scaffold loops; each line advances image or action. Metaphors stay inside physical logic—light squares on kitchen walls—avoiding purple drift. Only minor register lift: “Conceptual Repricing” is evaluator language, not prose flaw. Final line “see what you have done” is syntactic cliff that lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fusing espionage microdot with fortune-cookie aphorism is fresh synthesis; the spy-thriller gadget becomes a vehicle for communal self-confrontation. The lighthouse as projector of collective unconscious rewrites a tired trope into moral instrument. Risk is high—lyric accumulation instead of plot twists—yet coherence holds. Specificity of almond biscuit and salt-white boots keeps the concept rooted; without them the frame would feel gimmick.</comment>
