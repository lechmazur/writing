<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Miren’s contradictory impulses—preservation vs. intervention, solitude vs. communal gift—are alive in every micro-cut she makes; the “seed’s hunger for testimony” externalizes her interior conflict without slipping into label-speak. Her embodied emotion (“breathed on it, the glow shivered”) and tactile ritual (pruning, moss, locket) keep knowledge strictly character-bound. The final renunciation—planting the seed in a mere seam—carries visible cost: she surrenders control of the heirloom to the valley’s collective dawn-watch, earning Earned Stasis. Interiority never drifts into therapy-speak; even the child’s arrival tests her hierarchy of values under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the seed planted in the parapet crack crystallizes a new covenant—wonder will now root itself nightly, no longer hoarded in a locket. Cost is unmistakable: Miren relinquishes sole custodianship of ancestral memory, accepting perpetual vigilance by a child she cannot command. The lens is Accumulative/Textural: each pruning cut adds testimony-scent to the seed until the final cadence shift reweights the valley’s taste. Orientation is swift—parapet, waterfall, dawn—and the pattern of testimony-feeding is taught by 25 %, satisfying Track B mosaic rules.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The parapet crack, waterfall mist, and applewood locket are not backdrop but tactical instruments: the seam refuses brooms, forcing the seed into an ungoverned interstice where worlds already greet. Micro-setting (the child’s cracked sugar-jar) literally funnels loneliness into the seed, constraining how testimony can be transferred. Spatial choreography is immaculate: jar → seed → crack, each object handled on-page with evolving state. Environment charges the final image: mist beads become the visible cost the valley must nightly polish to keep wonder bright.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve wonder’s color—tightens when the orchard’s taste dulls and the child’s jar proves the valley’s window has turned from dawn to gray. Escalation is textural: each pruning cut pumps scent into the seed, increasing density until the final cadence shift makes the cost of sharing unavoidable. No antagonist is needed; pressure is the orchard’s own forgetting, answered by Miren’s agency to plant the heirloom where she cannot police its sprouting. The visible price is her loss of exclusive stewardship, foreclosing the option to keep wonder portable and private.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the particular act of pruning memory into a seed, not from any stated thesis about wonder. The final image—mist beads on a flagstone seam—offers a non-literal answer: maintenance, not miracle, keeps wonder alive, inviting reflection on collective versus solitary custodianship. Subtext resides in gesture: the child’s muddy shoes carry the valley’s exhaustion uphill, yet the jar’s cracked glass refracts sunrise back into the seed. No morals are pronounced; resonance is built from bread-rising scent and lantern-in-fog memory, eliciting concrete aftertaste.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Third-person omniscient stays modest, tethered to Miren’s perceptual signature—“sap and memory,” “color she could not name”—without claiming knowledge beyond her craft. Rhythm modulates: long breathy clauses for mist-laden hush, staccato clips for shearing scars, mirroring pruning cadence. No head-hopping; the child’s interior arrives only through Miren’s inference from cracked-glass reflection. Diction stays within orchard lexicon: “succor,” “crosshatched,” “congregants under blessing,” none sounding like committee voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or synonym churn; each sentence advances at least two jobs (scent-release + testimony-feed, jar-reflection + sunrise-return). Metaphors stay internally coherent—“scent like bread learning to rise” marries orchard and kitchen without mixed vehicle collision. Information density peaks in the seed-handling beats, yet clarity survives: “glow shivered… searching for lost stories” compresses animate hunger into one motion. No filter-verb stacks; immediacy is kept through tactile verbs—“tapped,” “tilted,” “clipped”—anchoring abstraction in bone-and-bark action.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The premise—pruning not wood but the exhaustion that makes stories fall asleep—offers a fresh inversion of arboriculture-as-memory-therapy rarely seen in flash fiction. Specificity of testimony-scent rising from a wrongly-healed scar transforms a familiar eco-fantasy trope into lived orchard craft. The cracked sugar-jar as loneliness conduit feels non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight, reweighting mundane refuse into sacramental vessel. Risk in lyric accumulative structure pays off: no causal showdown, yet the final mist-bead image crystallizes cost without gimmickry.</comment>
