<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The traveler’s vocation—writing “obituaries for the living”—gives him a crystalline, idiosyncratic motive that intensifies with each knot he ties; his interiority stays sensuously concrete (“breath threaded with salt and brass”) and the final wrist-loop act visibly costs him a palpable filament of his own detachment, earning the closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the woman departs literally trailing the palace thread, her grief cartographically “explained into a breathing space,” a reconfiguration that costs the traveler part of his protective anonymity and us our certainty that absence can ever be mapped; the lyric-accumulative lens is taught by line 3 and held without waver.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The garden’s quince, moth-bit coat, copper-kelp air, and the fountain’s cracked lip all double as emotional instruments—objects that constrain distance, dictate seating geometry, and finally applaud the woman’s weeping by fruit-fall; the thread itself functions as micro-setting, its tension dictating when the bridge of presence can be crossed.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>One dominant stake—how to make disappearance breathable—tightens through each naming ceremony; the latitude/horizon metaphor escalates from abstract cruelty to a mapped “inland sea beside the teacup,” foreclosing the option of permanent erasure and forcing the woman to inhabit absence differently, with visible cost paid in the wrist-loop ritual.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The theme that grief is a geography one can learn to breathe inside emerges wordlessly through the thread-map, the quince drops, and the fountain’s geometry; no character ever moralizes, yet the final image of a garden “spangled with the stubborn brilliance of leaving things” reweights domestic absence as tidal and navigable rather than void.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Voice is a sustained salt-air incantation—compressed, elliptical, pattern-taught (“latitude is crueler,” “names she never spoke aloud”)—with rhythm that swells and subs like tide; the narrator’s perceptual signature is unmistakably his own, never slipping into committee lyric, and the final brass-salt breath crystallizes the cadence without overwriting.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Almost every sentence performs triple duty (image, emotion, concept) without scaffold; only a faint perfume of metaphor density in the fountain paragraph nudges toward purple, but the logic of “bruise themselves fragrant” holds botanically and emotionally, so clarity at closure remains unbreached and the ear stays pleased.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</question>
<comment>The conceit of “obituaries for the living” is freshly inverted into cartographic grief-work; the palace thread, orphan-hearth bridge, and quince applause synthesize into a singular ritual that feels both ancient and newly minted, with risk-taking that eschews conventional scene beats yet lands an undeniable reconfiguration.</comment>
