<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interiority is lush and specific—“saltshaken hand,” “pulse to north”—but the narrator’s motives stay abstract (“collect the weights of different burdens”) and never tighten into a clear contradiction that forces a late micro-choice; the ledger is written but no visible cost alters stance. Fractal weaver’s agency is purely facilitative, so relationship-as-crucible pressure is absent. The arc lands in Earned Stasis, yet the cost feels diffuse because the narrator’s fear-of-departure thread is confessed, weighed, then shelved without tactical consequence. Still, embodied emotion and idiosyncratic perception keep characterization well above stock.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each burden adds density and reweights the dominant stake—translation of gravity—until the final “shelf where it could stand without gnawing” delivers a Charged Poise with felt cost. Causality is interior but coherent: each weighing teaches the narrator a grammar that cumulatively reconfigures posture toward love’s demand. Orientation is anchored within 120 words (grotto, starlight, lamp). No meaningful escalation break; pattern holds to last line.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Bronze grotto, kerosene halo, and lamp coin construct a micro-setting that actively constrains every beat—light coins buy paths, shadows cradle burdens, metallic ribs hum approval. Starlight pooled on bronze recharges the final image, making environment inseparable from stance crystallization. Specificity is selective and sensory, never touristic. Spatial choreography remains clean despite dream-logic.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—learn to bear burdens honestly—tightens through each weighing; the final fear-of-departure thread narrows options to “balance against the tide,” foreclosing denial. Cost is legible as conceptual price: fear finds a shelf, love now demands departure. Agency is interior translation, not external victory, fitting accumulative design. One meaningful deepening suffices; no coincidence resolves tension.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from iterative weighings: love’s weight is not lessened but oriented, refusing sentimental erasure. Whalebone loom, shingled hush, and ledger of bone accrue into a conceptual repricing—departure becomes duty, not doom. No moralizing sentence mars closure; final image of “morning birds shook the roofs” reweights prior hush into song. Ambiguity lingers: narrator still must leave, cost unpaid but legible.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>First-person voice owns a distinct perceptual signature—synesthetic metaphors, hyphenated coinages, tide-mark diction—that stays coherent under pressure. Rhythm modulates from tidal long sentences to clipped ledger lines, mirroring emotional calibration. No dialogue, so voice convergence risk is moot. Patterned elision (“boundary-lessly trapped”) is taught early and paid off at climax without clarity loss.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Figurative density is high yet purposeful; each metaphor extends the whalebone/scale/coin motif, avoiding purple overload. Zero paraphrase loops or template cadence; sentences vary in length and opening. Information density excellent—one line often does image, emotion, and concept. Minor register drift: “conceptual repricing” diction nudges academic, but occurs in narrator’s reflective beat, not peak action, so clarity intact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Burden-weaving under starlit bronze grotto feels fresh; synthesis of whale skeleton, fractal loom, and shingled city transforms familiar grief-into-wisdom arc into singular myth. Risk-taking—lyric accumulative structure, interior agency—heightens coherence without gimmickry. Specificity of “kerosene breath stitched constellations” prevents swap with generic cave. No close echoes of famous scenes.</comment>
