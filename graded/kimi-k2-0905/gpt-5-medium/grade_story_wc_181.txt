<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The curator’s interiority is vivid—his “brightened disquiet” and bathroom epiphanies are character-specific—but the final ingestion of the star-plum feels slightly under-motivated; the aunt’s cameo portraiture supplies the push, yet his active contradiction (curator vs. self-rewriter) could be sharper in the moment of bite. Still, embodied emotion (“cameo ticking like a tiny clock desperate to be a face”) and micro-choices under pressure sustain credibility.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds: each fruit tasted layers density rather than causal dominoes, and the final image—the unfinished face pressed into bark—delivers Resonant Reconfiguration with conceptual cost: he forecloses ordinary curation to become the between’s living archive. Orientation is taught by word 80; no anchors drift. The single transition (pod → grove) is legible, and closure reweights the premise under the inferred lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The astral orchard is economically seeded—“star-plum,” “comet-peach”—and the silver pod bathroom functions as micro-setting that constrains philosophical breakthroughs, charging the final image. Spatial choreography is clean: root-tucked pods, heartbeat fruit, cameo pressed to bark. Sensory hierarchy reflects curator priorities: smell of tap water, tide-in-shell inhale. Setting guides choice by proximity and rule disclosure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—pursue forbidden knowledge—tightens when the tree demands lineage instead of voice, forcing him to stake his aunt’s blank cameo. The dullest fruit choice narrows options: once tasted, nonlinear inheritance rewrites him, visible cost in the warming shell and unfinished face. Escalation is accumulative: each fruit memory layers density until the final portraiture forecloses return to neutral curation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</question><grade><comment>Theme emerges from the inversion of curation: to preserve is to be preserved. Subtext lives in the blank cameo—emptiness that hungers—charged again when the aunt’s uncarved eyes see him. No moralizing; the final image reframes earlier bathroom epiphanies as rehearsals for this larger stall of self-archiving. Resonance is particular, not abstract.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is crystalline, curator-specific: “orchard remembering futures,” “brightened disquiet.” Syntax warps under pressure—“simply complicated” used as adjective/noun mirage—without losing legibility. Perceptual signature sustained: noticing fruit whispers, tile patience, fan advice. No dialogue to contaminate; prose rhythm breathes with scene tempo.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High information density: one sentence often layers fruit, memory, and rule. Metaphor vehicles stay consistent—orchard as book, cameo as clock—no mixed logic. Minor scaffold: “brightened disquiet” recurs but is pattern-taught and payoff-charged. Read-aloud rhythm varied; no template cadence in peak beats. Opening and final lines anchor and recharge.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Premise of edible, branching histories is fresh; bathroom as philosophic incubator is risk that pays off by closure. Specificity—pistachio shell cameo blank, dull star-plum smelling of tap water—prevents allegorical drift. Transformation test fails if names changed: the aunt-vanish & cameo archive are inseparable. Conceptual integrity sustained; no retreat from nonlinear logic.</comment>
