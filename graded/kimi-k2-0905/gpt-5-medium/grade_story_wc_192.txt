<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The keeper’s interior contradiction—drawn to vanish yet refusing others’ vanishing—ramifies in every beat; the micro-choice to withhold the girl’s vanishing crystallizes the arc. Scars as sole conduit translate abstract duty into tactile cost, earning the final quiet step-aside. No stock phrasing; perception stays charcoal-specific, body-bound, moon-cold. The only cap: we never learn why scars became the channel; the lack nicks motivation at the edge.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Situational lens: coherent pressure forces stance crystallization; closure is Earned Stasis—stepping aside forecloses mentorship with visible fatigue. Orientation taught by disorientation: star-bowl, door-without-house pattern set <120 words and paid off when the girl crosses alone. One shard, single POV, dominant stake legible: keep the threshold open by teaching others to breathe their smoke. Cost: the ashes reread in the final line prove the bridge-burn price persists.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Star-bowl sky, charcoal ground, and the moon-cold ring operate as micro-setting that literally gates entry; spatial choreography stays clean in the barefoot pivot. The sanctuary’s rule—“speaks only through scars”—is learned through action, not exposition, and determines the final palm-to-palm beat. Sensory hierarchy obeys crisis: cold metal, dust taste, hush-throat night narrow perception under pressure. Environment constrains choice: only scars unlock the door, charging the final image when the keeper’s scarred hand lets go.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—keep the fading threshold viable by midwifing breath—tightens once: the girl’s near-vanish becomes the test. Agency: denial of her vanishing (quiet stand-still) escalates tension under situational lens; cost is the chill that pours into bones and the ashes that stay bright to read. No reversal, but the single deepening reweights solitude into stewardship with felt price. Coincidence absent; pressure coherent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges: leaving as stewardship, burning as witness; no moralizing line states it. Subtext lives in gesture—hand on cool ring, palm on scar—never in commentary. Final image reweights earlier bridge-ash: “ashes… bright enough to read” reprises the opening act of burning, now legible as text. Conceptual repricing: the cost of clarity is permanent solitude; ambiguity lingers without confusion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>First-person lyric voice owns a perceptual signature: moonwater, throat of night, smoke shapes—never generic. Syntax mirrors breath-counting cadence, shortens under chill pressure, lengthens in star-gazing calm. No head-hop; interior access stays strictly bound to keeper’s scarred skin. Diction stays within plausible rural-myth lexicon; no register drift. Elliptical compression is taught early (“door without a house”) and paid off at closure when door finally becomes true.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>High density: “I breathed in the dust of the bridges I had ended, then breathed out names” does triple duty—memory, cost, action. Rhythm modulates: longer clauses for star-contemplation, fragments for breath-count drill. One mixed metaphor only—“lighthouse with its lamp hooded”—but it resolves on second read. No loops, scaffold, or paraphrase; each sentence advances image or stakes.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Premise—mentoring ghosts to breathe via scar-to-door circuitry—feels fresh against familiar afterlife tropes. Risk: lyric elliptical mode could have collapsed into obscurity yet stays legible under situational lens. Specificity of ash-collecting as proof of careful leaving transmutes mundane phrase into haunting ethic. Synthesis inevitable in hindsight: scars + ash + threshold = pedagogy of absence.</comment>
