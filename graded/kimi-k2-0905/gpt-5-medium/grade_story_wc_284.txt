<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Ansel’s scarred interiority is rendered through embodied ticks—boot-cane-fingertip alphabet, pillbox weight as stabilizer—while the brass ring micro-choice forces a public/private self-merge. His “unused courage” want is pressure-tested when he drops the microfilm (visible cost) and accepts the steadier-burn exile; contradiction between spy reflex and need for witness is held in-scene. Len functions as pressure-plate rather than full secondary, but the wrist-press beat crystallizes loyalty/error history without exposition. The earned stasis—ring on scarred finger, no fireworks—pays off the burned-face map introduced in line 3; no diagnostic label-speak, only knife-edge statistics.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: because pillbox contains both exit-past and future-ring, therefore Ansel can trade film for return; hinge-click is the decisive beat that forecloses cleaner-death option. Microfilm disposal + ring acceptance creates on-page cost under moonlight; salt tide accepting secrets images conceptual repricing of exile as livable. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) taught by 5th sentence; no teleporting props. Single reversal—trading cyanide legacy for steady-burn mentorship—earned by prior fire trauma and Len’s silent vouch.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zephyr bluff’s frost-pocked grass and moon-fragile snow function as writing surface that records irrevocable code; environment literally constrains communication method (pressure alphabet) and therefore tactics. Salt-wind from sea carries memory cue, linking external weather to internal thaw (“hurt loosen like ice cracking”). Micro-setting of pillbox acts as portable landscape inside pocket; its compass-moth lid reorients moral north at closure. Spatial choreography clean: Ansel kneels, traces, Len approaches scarf-first, ring slips over scar—no impossible positions.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether Ansel can rejoin living network without theatrical suicide—signaled in pillbox history; tightening occurs when ring appears inside, forcing choice between past tool (film) vs future trust. Protagonist agency drives escalation: his finger-trace codes create the rendezvous condition; disposing film is active forfeiture that narrows exile to steady-burn path. Cost is legible—loss of microfilm evidence and public identity—forfeiture alters later tactics (no headlines, only whispers). Coincidence absent; Len’s arrival is scripted by snow alphabet.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Core idea—courage as renewable practice, not spent asset—emerges through pillbox lineage: cyanide → morphine → ash letters → brass ring; transformation of exit tool into vow tool images theme without moralizing. Final image of circle sliding over burn-scar reweights “broken inside” premise into “mended by continuous burn.” Subtext in scarf-flutter silence and palm-to-wrist pressure keeps loyalty wordless; no thematic echo paragraph. Ambiguity lingers: steady burn may still consume, but choice is now owned.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person foregrounds Ansel’s perceptual signature: numbers/letters felt through boot-cane-fingertip, silver hush “leaning closer” as if environment eavesdrops—distinctive lens maintained. Syntax compresses under pressure: “Boot for numbers, cane for letters, fingertip for emphasis”—catalog rhythm mimics code urgency without head-hopping. Free indirect melts into lyric pattern: “hurt loosen inside, like ice cracking to release water softly” stays within burned-spy sensory register. No filter-verb stacks; diction (“zephyr,” “frost-pocked”) stays inside elegiac register without register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>High density lines carry triple duty: “Snow accepted the work with an artisan’s patience” advances action (code written), atmosphere (still night), metaphor (white as paper). No paraphrase loops; each sentence adds new angle—pressure, memory, object shift. Figurative vehicles consistent: fire-map skin, silver hush, steady burn—metaphors extend rather than contradict. Read-aloud rhythm modulates: long breath of opening clause vs staccato code instructions; paragraph cuts land on image-turns, never redundant.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Spy-echoes (le Carré, Greene) are transmuted through haptic snow alphabet and microfilm-to-ring swap—fresh inflection on dead-drop genre. Burned-face protagonist seeking “unused courage” avoids revenge arc, chooses quiet endurance—non-obvious moral calculus. Setting-specific object (engraved pillbox with compass-moth) feels singular, not prop-catalog. Conceptual repricing ending—exile as sustainable flame—risks quietness yet lands with undeniable cost; risk heightens meaning without gimmick.</comment>
