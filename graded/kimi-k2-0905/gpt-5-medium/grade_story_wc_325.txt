<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority is sensorily rich and claustrophobic; the compulsion to “track invisible things” drives every beat. The decision to leave the gold fleck behind crystallizes a credible shift from theft to stewardship, paying off the flaw. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in a single moment, keeping this just outside the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: leaving the gold reweights the entire moral ledger and is charged by the tidal clock. Causal chain (fleck → lock → list → renunciation) is tight; the Orientation Test is waived because disorientation serves the breath-held descent. Cost is legible in the final image of “evening metal” and the rebuilt ice seal.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Body-as-setting (ribcage against rock, lips on air seam) and the corroded blue door constrain every move. Brine-freeze mechanics are taught early and payoff in the lock; the tidal clock is a live environmental throttle. Final image of “evening metal” sea is inseparable from the choice to abandon the fleck, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—restoring the unremembered—tightens when each spoken name forces the narrator toward public exposure inside a narrowing air window. One meaningful escalation: the machine’s last line about “the girl” personalizes the cost, converting abstract guilt into embodied choice. Pressure is coherent under the Situational lens; no reversal, but the stance crystallizes with felt price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of remembrance as moral conductivity emerges through the gold circuit and the spoken roll-call, never stated. Final renunciation reconfigures the initial theft into communal repair, offering resonant ambiguity: the ocean will erase them again, but the narrator’s moral ledger is permanently rewired. No platitudes; the insight is earned by the sensory ordeal.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>First-person voice is irreducibly specific: “magnetic itch of buried wire,” “ice lacquered it delicate.” Syntax mirrors claustrophobic breath—compressed clauses, enjambed images—then widens to “evening metal” at release. No head-hop; perceptual signature remains consistent under stress, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence advances pressure or image. Figurative layering is dense yet precise: “fluorescents slept overhead like seals” compresses atmosphere and stakes. No mixed metaphors; register stays within the narrator’s sensory lexicon. Closure beat is uncluttered, sealing the 9-band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fusion of monastic gold, cold-war undersea cables, and tidal spelunking feels inevitable yet fresh. The “crashing hush” oxymoron becomes a sonic through-line that reconfigures at exit. Risk in lyric compression pays off without obscuring causality, though the premise’s esoteric blend may limit universality, keeping it just below 9.</comment>
