<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The gilded-leaf calligrapher's interiority is vivid—emotions are embodied in leaf-curl, mildew-taste, shoulder-sag. The "wilts near dishonesty" trait is dramatized twice (refusing to gild the lie; halting leaf-post) with visible cost: greenhouse dims, clientele murmurs truths. The final micro-choice—leading the city to the hatch—earns the earlier hunger for lost conversations. Voice remains coherent; no stock therapy-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of withheld/canned candor builds density until the jars’ release reweights survival. Closure is Conceptual Repricing: “we measured survival together in truths” revalues the city’s rule-set with undeniable social cost. Orientation is clean by line 3; no lens ambiguity. Postal fragment → shredded map → jar archive linkage is taught early and paid off in final hatch image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Greenhouse city breathes “like a frightened lung,” condensate “like punctuation”—selective, POV-filtered, never tourist-catalog. Zinc plate, citronella sprig, and jar gutters are micro-settings that constrain knife-work and archive choices. Spatial choreography is impeccable: bench → tunnels → fern hospital → hatch without drift. Final image of mist feeding lettuce is tactile and charges the reopened archive.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake: access to withheld candor. Escalation occurs when the protagonist’s rereading discovers the map, narrowing options to confrontation. Cost is visible: greenhouse dims, clientele forced into live confession, postmaster’s tin hands tremble. The final release of jar-vapor is the decisive intensification that reweights survival tactics.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from pattern: candor as scarce water—redirected, archived, then released to prevent civic crack-up. No moralizing; final image of “shy rain” recharges earlier leaf-curl metaphor. Subtext in postmaster’s fogged-window smile and ungilded sprig enacts mercy-vs-truth tension. Complexity remains: archives both saved and stifled marriages.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>First-person voice is lyric yet controlled: “moved tasted like mildew,” “vents laughed.” Perceptual signature—attention to sap, gold, zinc—stays consistent. No head-hopping; distance stable. Patterned elision (“we send leaf-post…”) is taught early and paid off at hatch. Rhythm accelerates during jar-release without syntactic monotony.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>High information density: one sentence often embeds metaphor, world-rule, and emotional tilt—“leaves drink the candid and curl from the false.” No synonym churn or template cadence. Metaphors stay coherent (lung/breath, punctuation/condensate). Final line “we measured survival together in truths” is crisp, propulsive, artifact-free.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Premise—living leaf-letters vs. canned confessions—is fresh synthesis of bio-punk and epistolary dystopia. Risky accumulative structure pays off: jar-archive reweights entire greenhouse ecology. Specificity of “tin-stained fingers,” “square reefed with arrows” prevents generic slip. Transformation test fails if relocated: leaf-post, spore-porters, and citronella are irreplaceable.</comment>
