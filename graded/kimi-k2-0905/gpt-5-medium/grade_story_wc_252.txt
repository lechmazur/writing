<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The dock-worker narrator’s contradictory self-image (“grace is what I hide in my muscles,” “hardshell” vs. the sunlight-bending name) is embodied in every beat: micro-choices such as threading mooring lines through the belt as “meanings,” the decision to speak the unapologetic name aloud, and the final offer to ferry the townsfolk back. Interior conflict stays concrete—fear of softness versus need to be seen—and the renunciation of guardedness carries visible social cost as the crowd watches in “heavy silence.” Voice and muscle memory integrate; no therapeutic paraphrasing. The only bar to 9+ is that the crowd remains an anonymous chorus, so status dynamics are inferred rather than dramatized on-page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: lyric repetitions of “disappearing” vs. “holding” tighten until the narrator’s spoken true name reweights the entire fog-staircase image. Closure is a Charged Poise—the island thickens, the whale presence offshore crystallizes a new social contract, cost felt in the exposed self-naming. Causality is poetic but legible: scrimshaw activates → whale call → speaker’s naming → island stabilizes. No orientation debt; spatial anchors (dock cleats, tide step, sublittoral fringe) are clear within first 120 words. Persistent constraint: the post-Pacification rule that bodies can only be touched by consent, which shapes the entire public ritual.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The maritime micro-setting (bollard, cleat, eelgrass combing water) doubles as moral instrument: the dock’s ropes literally become the belt of meanings, the sublittoral fringe returns lost names, the whale offshore functions as living cathedral. Weather and tide are not backdrop but timing devices—fog lifts exactly when the naming occurs. Spatial choreography is flawless; no impossible positions as skiffs push off. The scrimshaw at highest tide mark charges the final image, reappearing as teaching tool for the harbor’s new “please.” All 9+ gate met.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single dominant stake—will the narrator risk self-naming to make the island hold? Escalation accrues via textured refrain: each time the island thins, the whale call deepens, until the spoken name forecloses the option of perpetual disguise. Price is on-page: the public unmasking in front of barnacle-crowd whose “silence was heavy enough to crush careful lies.” Under Accumulative lens the tightening is the thickening of resolve, not a causal duel; still, the protagonist’s agency drives the final act and costs social safety.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges as the paradox of gentle coasts requiring uncovered violence within: “after violence becomes impossible, even the waves learn restraint.” The narrator’s shift from guarded to unguarded heart enacts that paradox, reweighting the scrimshaw’s carved knife-kiss into a ribbon-cutting celebration. No moralizing summary—final image of ferrying townsfolk crystallizes ongoing responsibility rather than a thesis. Ambiguity lingers: the island may still vanish, but now they possess a repeatable ritual. Insight is earned, not declared.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>First-person lyric voice owns a muscular, salt-stained diction: “chain singing as it learns it was never a chain,” “combative tenderness.” Syntax shortens under pressure—“I said my name”—then widens into cathedral metaphor, mirroring breath-control of the whale call. No head-hop; perceptual signature remains dock-worker specific (noticing rope fiber, salt bucket acoustics). Patterned elision (“the one without hardshell”) is taught early and paid off in final naming. Dialogue is absent by design; voice coherence never falters.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies: long anaphoric accumulations crash against single-sentence beats. Information is dense—“ropes unknotted themselves like old grudges being kissed goodbye” does three jobs in eleven words. No synonym churn or template cadence; each metaphor extends prior physical logic. One mixed metaphor hairline: “fog into a staircase” is abstract, but closure re-grounds it via the skiff’s literal ascent. Minor scaffold: “they say” twice about pirate lore could be cut, yet doesn’t dull final image. Closure beat is crystal.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Freshens familiar “returning island” trope by welding it to post-violence pacifist world rule and whale-call naming ritual. Transformation is specific: only this narrator’s workspace (dock cleat, bollard) and occupation (rope-threading as meaning-braiding) make the arc possible. Risk taken: lyric accumulative structure instead of causal duel, yet coherence holds. No derivative premise penalty; the pacified coast concept is non-obvious and followed through. Final ferrying duty feels inevitable, not tacked.</comment>
