<comment>The vendor’s desire “to find the place where stories begin” anchors motive, but interiority drifts into lyric cipher (“ledger of returned regrets”) rather than conflicting impulse. No contradictory desire is staged in scene; the micro-choice to pour moonlight is poetic but not dramatized as fraught. The ending’s acceptance of the comma-seed registers as quiet image, not visible cost to the self.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the comma-seed reweights the premise that beginnings must be earned by attention, not ink. Causality is lyric-Accumulative; the hinge-air is taught early via “quantifying absence” and paid off when moonlight outlines the hinge. Orientation is clear by line 8; the withheld “where” becomes the thematic quest, not confusion. Cost is conceptual—stories now carry the weight of silence—but not felt as personal loss.</comment>

<comment>Glass orchard and cloud-sea function as micro-setting: the floating floorboards, vellum door, and glass apple materially constrain movement and supply the hinge image. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven—moonlight glare, dust inches—never tourist catalog. The countertop map literalizes “paths threading aisles like veins,” charging the final corridor. Setting never stalls; every detail is woven through the vendor’s goal-directed discovery.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—entry to the seed vault—signals early; pressure tightens once when the hinge air swings open, narrowing options to “sign with silence.” Agency is attention, not combat; the vendor’s quantifying act forecloses the path of ordinary language. Cost is conceptual (stories born mute) rather than visceral, keeping escalation lyric-subtle. The comma-seed’s weight is poetic, not tactical, so escalation feels cerebral, not urgent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through recurring absence: unlettered vellum, blank pages, comma-sized seed. No moral is stated; the final image reconfigures storytelling as withheld breath. Subtext operates in silence—apple trembles “as though listening for an edit”—inviting reflection on editorial violence. Ambiguity is purposeful: beginnings remain unreadable, resisting tidy profundity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric-philosophical with perceptual signature: “moonlight shows what words intend when they forget to pretend.” Syntax coils like glass tendrils, mirroring the orchard. Register stays within the narrator’s metaphysical lexicon; no head-hopping. Diction is controlled, though occasional lushness (“sea of clouds is the waiting room”) edges toward ornament without muddling clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Prose is rhythmically deliberate; sentence variety sustains trance. Figurative density is high but patterned—moonlight, glass, hush—taught early and reprised at closure, so coherence holds. Minor scaffold: “to incise is to cut light from shadow” defines a term the reader already intuits. No mixed metaphors or paraphrase loops; information density stays high.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Premise—floating library growing glass fruit that seeds blank stories—is non-obvious yet internally coherent. Risk lies in lyric abstraction, but specificity of map-veins, ledger-dust, and comma-seed grounds the conceit. Transformation test: swap glass orchard for any orchard and the hinge logic collapses. Fresh inflection: editorial parole as literal judicial process for unborn narratives.</comment>
