<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The skimmer’s interiority is lyrically particular—tuning breath to birds, counting beats that “refuse me and allow”—and the renunciation of motion is a credible, costly stance. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in scene, only described, so the arc is slightly static; the final “map inside me” is earned but not viscerally paid for in the moment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the canyon folds, the pulse is heard, the protagonist travels without moving—cost is the emptied cord and the ancestral solitude now shared. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: every echo thickens the pattern until the final image reweights stillness as motion. No orientation debt; anchors clear by line 4.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The towers of bone, seep-mirror, and corded arrowhead function as micro-setting—each constrains the skimmer’s listening stance and is charged in the final cast. Sensory hierarchy obeys POV: sound > sight > touch. Spatial choreography is immaculate; no impossible shifts.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—hear the wandering pulse without moving—is signaled early and tightened when the canyon folds inward; the price is the surrender of physical navigation. No external antagonist, but internal pressure escalates through sonic density; the final click of the arrowhead is the single decisive intensifier.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the paradox of stillness-as-motion; no abstract statement, only the final image of an emptied cord that once carried prayer. The pulse left wandering reframes ancestry and solitude into shared resonance—Conceptual Repricing with emotional cost. No moralizing, only charged poise.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is relentlessly sonic—"measure returns a map," "grammar of the air"—with disciplined lyric cadence that never breaks into prose clutter. Compression and elision are pattern-taught early ("I do not move; I let the hum...") and paid off in the final hush. No dialogue, so no voice contamination; POV modesty perfect.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm modulates from long breath-invocations to staccato clicks; no template cadence or synonym loops. Figurative language is dense yet coherent—"time is a spiral winding around bone"—and never muddles causality. One near-purple phrase ("black mirror that knows more of sky") survives because it recharges the final scent-of-lichen echo.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The harmonic stone skimmer who navigates by bird-pattern and ancestral echo is a fresh synthesis of mystic cartography; no genre template matches it. The renunciation of motion as the ultimate journey is a bold, fully committed conceptual turn. Risk heightens meaning without gimmick—stillness becomes locomotion—and the closure would collapse if any trope were swapped.</comment>
