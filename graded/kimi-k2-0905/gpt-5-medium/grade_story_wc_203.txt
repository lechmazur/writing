<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The narrator’s vocation and ghost-negotiating habit are vivid, but the interior contradiction between duty (fixing elevators) and compulsion (hunting ceilings) is asserted rather than dramatized in scene; the final choice to wind the barrel backward is credibly earned, yet the emotional cost is more conceptual than embodied, keeping the arc just shy of high-band intensity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: winding the mainspring backward is a Decisive Change that releases the ghosts and reweights the ledger; the Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout—dust patterns, cracked paint, and coiled time build density until the final cadence shift; cost is legible in “the ticket office seemed lighter by the weight it lost,” a Conceptual Repricing felt on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Setting is inseparable from action: the sagging ceiling tile literally guides the protagonist’s climb and conceals the barrel; the ticket window’s smell of “coins, mouse nests, and roses too old to remember their color” is filtered through a repairman’s sensory hierarchy; the final dust resettlement is a micro-setting beat that reconfigures the space after the clock is unwound.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—balancing vertical duty against horizontal curiosity—tightens when the ceiling’s sag forces a choice: leave or engage the spring; the protagonist’s agency drives the turn, paying with the conceptual cost of admitting the ringmaster’s theft; escalation is single but meaningful, sufficient for this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the repurposed mainspring: time as pilfered currency; the final image of the un-flaking smile reweights the earlier “cracks” without moralizing, offering a quiet, resonant answer to what ceilings hide—accounted debts and released breath.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>First-person voice is lean, haunted, and technician-practical; perceptual signature is consistent—gravity prints, dust constellations, ledger-moth; no head-hopping; lyric compression (“a hush slid down like silk let go”) is taught early and paid off at closure; diction stays within a repairman’s plausible lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is taut, high-density; each sentence advances image or stakes; no synonym loops or template cadence; metaphors are cleanly stacked (“dust lift…settle in a new arrangement”); opening and closing lines anchor voice and recharge motif; minor scaffold in “coins, mouse nests, and roses” list is purposeful and brief.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</question><comment>Premise fuses elevator repair, ghost arbitration, and horological theft into an inevitable micro-myth; the mainspring-as-bank is a fresh, grounded reconfiguration; risk in lyric time-release pays off without gimmickry; specificity of circus ticket office and dust alphabet feels authored, not templated.</comment>
