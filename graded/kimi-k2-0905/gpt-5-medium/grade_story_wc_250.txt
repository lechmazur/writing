<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>The narrator’s grief over his brother’s suicide is viscerally embodied (cold hand, withheld secret). The guardian’s silence and “spiralingly calm” demeanor remain consistent yet cryptic, creating credible mystery. Interior contradiction surfaces when shame retreats yet the brother’s refusal still aches—both states held simultaneously. The micro-choice to accept the mirror and angle it at the arches crystallizes a hierarchy of values: speak light where speech failed before. Cost is legible—“the night bruises easily,” the brother’s refusal felt as a lifted door—yet the guardian’s motives stay opaque, blocking full 9-band entry.</comment>

<comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure mounts through mirrored light, shutter patterns, and repeated “spiralingly calm” cadence rather than causal reversals. Closure is a Charged Poise: the narrator cups a “small star,” poised to ferry light elsewhere; cost is the ongoing, fragile responsibility he now bears. Anchor who/where/when lands by line 4 (cobalt dock, after rain, I/him). The final image reweights earlier motifs—mirror, water, stars—into a single charged stance. No causality breaks; ellipsis (how the brother’s refusal is sensed) is justified by the lyric contract taught early.</comment>

<comment>Micro-setting supremacy: the dental mirror, shutters, piling rings, and canal surface act as movable set pieces that constrain tactics. The mirror’s angled beam literally dictates where the narrator looks and later where he “walks.” Oily-rainbow coat, tar-and-nettle scent, and “rope snoring” render the dock tactile without catalogue excess. Weather is not backdrop—rain color governs visibility and the mirror’s efficacy. Spatial choreography is flawless: guardian moves from dock to house fronts, narrator follows, both end walking alleyward; no impossible positions.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: can the narrator convert private grief into usable light without betraying his brother’s silence? Escalation is textural—each mirror flash thickens the emotional density rather than narrows external options. The decisive intensification is the beam becoming “a narrow road” the narrator must walk—an attentional commitment with felt risk (“the night bruises easily”). Cost is visible: he relinquishes the safety of withheld speech and accepts the mirror’s ongoing duty. Guardian agency drives every escalation; no coincidence taints the turns.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through concrete imagery: light as salvageable memory, darkness as unspoken grief. Subtext resides in gesture—circle traced in air, mirror handed over—never thesis. The final image reweights “darkness” from abyss to recipient of stars, accomplishing Conceptual Repricing without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers: we do not know if the narrator will succeed, only that the task is now his. The brother’s suicide is treated as irreparable fact, not lesson, resisting tidy redemption.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>First-person lyric texture sustains a hushed, tidal cadence; sentence length swells then contracts like canal water. Perceptual signature is patinated: every surface carries stain—oil rainbows, bruised clouds, brown floodwater—mirroring the narrator’s guilt-slick attention. Filter verbs (“I watched,” “I felt”) are voice-motivated, emphasizing witness rather than immediacy, coherent with the reflective brief. Diction stays within plausible lexicon yet lifts toward the numinous (“a shimmer rose, not a ghost but a noticing”). No head-hopping; guardian’s interior remains responsibly opaque.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>High information density: one sentence often layers sensory, metaphoric, and kinetic data (“He angled it with a patience that felt like silent empathy turned into motion”). Mixed metaphors are controlled—rain “slick as a whispered oath” merges texture and secrecy without contradiction. Rhythm modulates: longer hypotactic lines for stillness, abrupt fragments for shutter clicks. No synonym churn or template cadence; repeated “spiralingly calm” is purposeful motif, not artifact. A single paraphrase loop (“the night bruises easily” echoed as “the night newly complicated by stars”) is minor and functional, not penalized.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fusion of dental-mirror-as-star-guide and shutter-morse-code feels freshly specific, not allegorical. The canal as psychic confessional is familiar, but the guardian’s profession of “silent empathy” enacted through reflected light is non-obvious. Transformation test fails if relocated: the town’s shutter architecture and oily dock are necessary media. Risk—lyric accumulation instead of causal plot—heightens coherence because closure crystallizes attention rather than explains. Minor detraction: guardian archetype skirts mystic drifter trope, though local details (tar, nettle, barge pilot nod) particularize him.</comment>
