<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The astronomer’s interiority is precise—counting oil, aligning wires “when a planet rounded the south corner”—and his frugality becomes a moral engine. His pledge to “keep the arithmetic waking each dusk” crystallizes an earned stasis that costs him grandeur yet grants stewardship; the contradiction between mocking rites and counting angles is held in embodied tension. No secondary character appears, so relationship bullets are waived; the solo arc still satisfies the 9+ test because the final renunciation is causally tied to every prior micro-choice of thrift and attention.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a quiet Conceptual Repricing: the disk’s stop and the map’s request reweight his life toward perpetual maintenance without glory. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density of wires, soot, water rivulets—until the final cadence shift where “the unknown will note my thrift” makes the cost social and eternal. Causality is lyric but intact: each schematic sum leads to the bead, the urn, the pledge. Cost is legible in the final image of brushing footprints backward, sealing the vow into anonymity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The palace is not backdrop but instrument: bronze pins, cracked drain, blind alcove guide his body and tools; the wires function as micro-setting that constrains every alignment. Dusk is a repeating environmental texture that modulates with stakes—first a clock, finally a taste of reeds. The magic square tile reappears inside the urn, charging the closing map with recursive specificity. 9+ gate met: the urn grooves physically shape the water test that unlocks the disk.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—maintenance of cosmic listening without resource—is signaled in the opening ledger tally. Pressure tightens once: the water must equal the sums or the urn stays sealed; that single test forecloses failure and legitimates his vow. No antagonist is needed; the regime-change backdrop keeps threat ambient. Cost is visible: he gives away recognition, accepts endless gutter-mending, and the disk stops turning to lock him into service.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges as devotion without expenditure—faith measured in chalk, not incense. The encrypted square is never decoded; its meaning stays arithmetic, so the theme resists moral slogans. Final image of “dusky harmony” reweights earlier dusk mentions from mere time-keeping to sacramental tone. No thematic echo is spoken; the pledge is scratched faintly inside the square, letting resonance stay subtextual.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>First-person voice carries a frugal perceptual signature: verbs are spare, nouns concrete, numbers replace adjectives. Rhythm tightens under lamp-oil scarcity: short clauses mimic rationed breath. No dialogue, so no voice convergence risk. Occasional lyric compression (“the room tasting suddenly of pepper and rain”) is pattern-taught early and echoes at closure, justifying the slight heightening.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Lines are scaffold-free; each sentence advances either schematic process or atmospheric charge. Metaphors are sparse and mechanical—“plaster buckled like a dried river”—never layered into purple. No synonym loops; “wires,” “sums,” “dusk” recur with accretive meaning. Opening and closing lines are image-driven, not expositional, satisfying read-aloud ear test.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>Fusing Babylonian palace with DIY radio-astrolabe feels inevitable because every detail is thrift-scavenged. The magic square as physical key and spiritual covenant is a non-obvious synthesis. Risk is taken: quiet maintenance replaces heroic discovery, yet stakes feel larger for being microscopic. Fresh inflection: the vow is sealed by brushing footprints backward—an act of erasure as covenant.</comment>
