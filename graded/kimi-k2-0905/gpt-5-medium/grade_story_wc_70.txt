<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The toll-keeper’s involuntary candor is dramatized in every exchange, squeezing him into a single, painful micro-choice—hand over the lacquer box—whose cost is the surrender of his protective filter. Interiority is sensorily grounded (“truth pinned my tongue”) and contradictions play out in real time rather than summary. The final stance—continuing to sit and ask wonder for coin—earns its poise because the earlier surrender has already bled. Voice remains distinct from Mara’s, and status shifts are legible in the stair-climb choreography.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causality is crystal: blackout → tower restart → keeper must decide who deserves the queen tone. The riddle beat is a causal gate, not ornament—fail and the hive stays mute—so the keeper’s openness is weaponized against him. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the queue reforms, the ritual returns, but the keeper has forfeited anonymity; the cost is felt in the final line’s “no pocket for delay.” Orientation anchors (tower, dusk, post-blackout) appear by line 4; no disorientation penalty applies.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The tower’s metal scent and “stormfruit” capacitors are tactile tools that calibrate the final image; the lacquer box is handled in three states—hidden, opened, surrendered—charging the closure. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly up the iron stairs; bodies never ghost. Sensory hierarchy is POV-filtered: the keeper notices honey smells and waggle coordinates, not street names. Environment constrains the pivotal choice—only the crown platform can mate lightning to crystal—meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake: will wonder survive routine crisis? Pressure tightens once: the keeper must surrender his filter (the hidden tray) to the right listener or the city stays mute. The surrender is irreversible and narrows his future anonymity; options close. Cost is visible on-page: “truth leaves no pocket for delay.” Escalation is single-point but sufficient for 700-word frame; no reversal is needed when the surrender is this sharp.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme—ritual as the immune system of civilization—emerges through images (riddle, box, queue) rather than thesis. The final image of citizens lining up to resume “repeating” reweights the entire blackout as a mere pause, implying the next failure is inevitable. Subtext operates in gesture: Mara’s smoke-smelling hands signal burnout long before any diagnosis. No moral is stated; the keeper’s obedience to candor is the answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>First-person voice owns a perceptual signature: synesthetic metaphors (“nectar dusk,” “stormfruit”) that feel like a mind that tastes electricity. Compression is taught early—“I kept the toll there, a small desk of scars”—and paid off in the final compression of truth. No head-hopping; Mara’s interior is inferred only through observed fatigue. Rhythm modulates: longer honeyed sentences in calm, staccato exchanges under the capacitor hum.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Read-aloud ear test passes: sentence lengths swell and contract with lightning’s intake. Metaphors are coherent—honey, bees, thunder form one ecosystem—and never contradict physics. Zero scaffold loops; each sentence advances image or stakes. “Lacquer whispering” is the sole risked personification, but it earns its place by priming the box’s later song.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The apiarist-of-code trope is inverted: Mara tends firmware hives with smoker tools and beekeeper muscle memory. The lightning-collection tower feels fresh because its mechanics are revealed through ritual use, not exposition. The candor toll is a conceptual risk that pays thematic dividends larger than plot twists. Synthesis is specific: this exact keeper, box, and dusk could not be transplanted without collapsing the story’s resonance.</comment>
