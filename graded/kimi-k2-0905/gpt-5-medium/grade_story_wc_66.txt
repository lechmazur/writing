<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The copyist’s compulsive transcription of silence into scored measures is a vivid, embodied motive that escalates from private ritual to pact with the pirate voice. Interiority stays concrete—numbering rests, tapping pencil—yet the contradiction between preservation and erasure remains felt rather than stated. The final promise to “leave a score wherever ash settled” is earned: diligence and loneliness converge into a costly vow that forecloses retreat to mere copying. No secondary character appears, so relationship crucible is N/A; head-count clarity is immaculate.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Drive lens = Accumulative/Textural: each lyric refrain layers density until dust itself becomes articulate; closure is a Charged Poise—the floor murmuring with “fluent” ash while the narrator keeps conducting in sleep. Orientation is taught early (ember alcove, shortwave, famine aftermath) and pays off when the same ash re-enters as speaking text. The “promise to carry tempo forward” is the visible, felt cost that reconfigures the narrator’s future. No causality gaps; every image of ash, radio glow, or scored silence recurs with tightened meaning.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The alcove, radio dial, and drifting ash function as micro-setting: they constrain listening posture, hide the illegal signal, and literally provide the “pages” on which dust writes. Selective sensory economy—glow as “small lunar theater,” ash “warm as memory”—mirrors the narrator’s attenuated attention. Spatial choreography stays clean: shawl cloaks glow, moths orbit dial, floor murmurs after ash is blown. Weather (needle-snow, thistled calm) externalizes the barbed hush that defines the broadcast’s cadence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—keep the evacuated world verbally alive—tightens when the pirate voice demands future transmission as payment; the narrator’s option to remain a passive copyist is foreclosed. Escalation is textural: each song lyric increases the dust’s legibility, turning absence into mounting pressure to speak aloud. Cost is legible in the final promise, a lifelong burden that will expose the narrator to unknown listeners. Agency is attention and inscription rather than overt rebellion—exactly what a copyist can credibly offer.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: art’s survival in scorched aftermath through devoted, almost monastic transcription. Subtext lives in silence given bar-lines, ash given consonants—materiality of ruin re-enchanted by listening. The closing image of pages turning themselves during sleep offers a resonant, non-moral answer: stories will self-conduct if someone keeps time. No thematic echo or final-paragraph moralizing; meaning stays lodged in physical details (ledger, ember, shawl).</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>First-person lyric sustains a hushed, incantatory cadence that mirrors musical phrasing; perceptual signature is precise—“tied slurs,” “spider-thread barlines.” Patterned elision (“Cinder asked… I answered by tapping”) is taught early and repaid when the wall-shadow soloist appears. No head-hopping; distance stays shallow but consistent with a lonely copyist’s hyper-attentive ear. Syntax modulates: longer breathless sentences during broadcast arrival, curt fragments when payment is demanded.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>High information density: each sentence layers metaphor atop function—ash both medium and motif, radio both heater and stage. Figurative language is disciplined; no mixed metaphors or overwritten stacks impair closure. Rhythm breathes with scene tempo—hissing radio, snowfall pauses. Minor template cadence in “They wrote…” anaphora is purposeful, replicating score repetition. No scaffolding, synonym loops, or register drift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: post-apocalyptic setting refracted through orchestral notation, piracy, and dust typography—none feels grafted. Conceptual risk—silence as score, ash as alphabet—pays off when floorboards literally vocalize. Transformation test passes: only this copyist in this kiln-city could catalyze narrative from cinders. No derivative premise debt; the piece commits fully to its lyric logic without retreating to safer metaphor.</comment>
