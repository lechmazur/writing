<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The keeper’s motivation—tracing vanished footpaths—remains steady and personal; every micro-choice (tapping, radioing the village, pressing Assemble) flows from that want. Interiority is concrete, not therapeutic: “my vertebrae were lanterns gatehinged to the sea” embodies loss and responsibility without naming feelings. The final endurance—rewriting beats onto the orphaned atlas page—carries visible cost: acceptance that maps must stay loose-leaf. Only the absence of a second on-page character keeps relationship pressure off the table, so the score stops just short of the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the corridor’s breathing geometry is named, shared, and will keep migrating; the cost is the keeper’s nightly labor of re-inscription. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens: tapping patterns → decoded atlas → corridor revealed → village procession. Orientation is anchored by line 3 (“sea level monitoring station sat on pylons”) and never slips. No teleporting props or retro-patches; the torn page’s payoff is set up by its first appearance and fulfilled when beats are rewritten onto it.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The station, tide gauges, lanterns, and even the console’s brushed-steel key are tactile tools that constrain action: you can’t tap rhythm on plastic, you can’t light lanterns without wet-shiver sand. The corridor itself—an ephemeral sand spine—functions as mobile setting that dictates where feet can fall; its disappearance is the story’s central pressure. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: a reef refugee notices “plankton like hinges,” not tourist sunsets. Environment directly charges the final image: lanterns tumble and reset each night, proving the corridor’s perpetual drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will the keeper decode the vanishing paths before someone else drowns?—is signaled in paragraph 5 and tightens when the console’s ribbon answers his taps, narrowing options to one living corridor. The reversal is micro but decisive: the path isn’t erased, it is time-locked; this reframes the red-lined atlas from lie to schedule. Cost is legible: perpetual nightly labor, “rewinding the recordings,” accepting impermanence. Under Accumulative lens the pressure deepens through pattern density (tide + lunar + tapping) rather than causal dominoes, satisfying the lens-specific escalation test.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: adaptation versus cartographic certainty—maps fail when living systems breathe. Subtext lives in gesture: tapping is both human plea and geological answer, suggesting collaboration with a wounded planet. No moral is stated; the final image of a page that “had to live alone” lets the reader feel the cost of flux. The reef’s bleached ghost stays particular, not symbolic, grounding universality in one shoreline’s pulse.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>First-person voice is lyric yet disciplined: maritime precision (“neap tides,” “slackening during spawning nights”) braided with compressed metaphor (“patient as kelp”). Rhythm mimics subject: tap-pause sentences mirror swell intervals, teaching the pattern by example. No head-hopping; knowledge stays strictly within what a lone keeper can hear or infer. The occasional elevated phrase (“periodically eternal”) is earned by context and repetition, not register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary from short percussive beats to long fluid coils, propelling the tide-like cadence. Figurative language is selective: one sustained metaphor of the corridor as spine/river/breath, avoiding mixed-vehicle clutter. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; each line adds new sensory or causal information. The final clause “nothing assembled stays assembled if it cannot move” crystallizes the arc without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The fusion of climate-science premise with percussive code-breaking feels fresh; no existing template matches “tidal rhythm cryptography.” Specificity anchors novelty: lunar-spawn slicks glue sand grains, a detail unfamiliar to most readers. Risk—lyric compression that could obscure causality—pays off by making the corridor’s reappearance feel like remembered music. Transformation test fails if you swap reef for forest or tapping for whistling, proving irreplaceability.</comment>
