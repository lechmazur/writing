<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>The servant’s gentle, curiosity-driven motive is credibly particularized through tactile micro-choices (humming to bolts, angling goggles), and the final renunciation—leaving the diary open—pays off an interior contradiction between assignment and compassion. Emotional embodiment is mostly vivid (“breath borrowed from cold saints”), yet a few abstractions (“joy beneath anguish”) slightly dilute full irrational complexity. No second on-page character, so relationship bullets skipped; internal arc cleanly tied to closure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each floor adds a density layer that reweights the stake from retrieval to compassionate curation; closure lands with Conceptual Repricing—diary left open reconfigures meaning of “servant” and “vault.” Orientation anchored by line 3; causality intact. Cost legible in final image; persistent constraint (elevator as throat) shapes tactics throughout. Minor late abstraction keeps it sub-9.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Icebound spire, frost-bitten rail, crazed goggles, and scattered-light cipher all constrain choices and charge the final shelving act; micro-setting (elevator cage, tin polish) functions as embodied tool. Sensory economy favors ice, metal, breath; selectivity supports tone without checklist. Spatial choreography across ten floors is crystal-clear; weather and altitude affect tactility. Gate for 9+ met: environment shapes final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—retrieve diary vs. tender preservation—tightens at floor 6 when servant realizes Mirek was also a servant; each ascent escalates by accrued artifact and emotional density under Accumulative lens. One meaningful deepening suffices; cost is the exposure of vulnerability in leaving book open. No antagonist needed; coincidence (wind gust) complicates but doesn’t resolve. Agency visible in shelving decision with felt social/ethical cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme—mercy as archive—emerges through concrete shelving act and light-scattered cipher rather than thesis. Final line’s “keeps the bolts from tiring” offers resonant, non-literal answer. Ambiguity (whose laughter? which strays?) invites reflection without confusion. Avoids explicit moral; image of diary left open reweights premise. Minor echo of “joy beneath anguish” phrase slightly caps below 9.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>First-person voice carries consistent perceptual signature: cold saints, throat-clearing elevator, frost flowers as coins. Syntax modulates with altitude—shorter pulses at higher floors. No dialogue, so bullets skipped. POV modesty maintained; knowledge bounded by immediate sensorium. Patterned elision (goggles → cipher → diary) taught early and paid off. Rhythm control under pressure peaks in final line cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentence openings avoid monotony. Figurative layering is dense yet coherent within lyric mode; no mixed metaphors. Information density high: one sentence often carries sensory, emotional, and symbolic load. Minor scaffold: “on the X rise” template is deliberate pattern, taught early, so waived. Zero paraphrase loops; pronouns clean. Closure image unmarred by clutter.</comment>

<question>8</question><question>8.7</question>
<comment>Premise—elevator-as-confessional ascending into ice-cloud archive—is non-obvious synthesis of gothic, steampunk, and lyric modes. Transformation test: entire emotional arc depends on specific goggles-light-cipher mechanic; could not swap diary for generic relic. Risk in ten-floor repetition pays off via accumulative intensification. Closest cultural echo is Calvino’s “Invisible Cities,” but voice and cold-saint imagery feel fresh.</comment>
