<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The clock-maker’s interior contradiction—hunger to unmake fate vs. the cost of another’s life—plays out in embodied micro-choices (blood drop, yoyo key, final release). The renunciation is earned because the stone’s visions have already bitten his ribs. Only the keeper’s status shift is under-dramatized; her single call carries the whole relationship turn.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the yoyo’s ascent snuffs the door and re-weights “being escorted” vs. choosing the keeper. Causal chain holds: reverse-yoyo logic → stone opens → visions paid in blood → refusal costs futureless mornings. Orientation is anchored by skiff arrival and lantern placement; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lighthouse, spiral stairs, tidal stain rings, and body-as-tool (brass-smelling hands) constrain every move; the cracked lens and floodmark dictate lantern placement and final gesture. The hunger stone’s pulse literally charges the closing image. Salt-sweat, pitch, and orchard-wind anchor era without exposition.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“step beyond fate”—is signaled in paragraph three and tightened when the keeper’s death-thread appears. One meaningful turn: after the blood price, stepping through becomes possible yet is renounced, foreclosing the supremacy of clocks. Cost is the forfeited orchard-room and the retained burden of her survival.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the mechanism itself: time reversed exposes the moral cost of unmaking consequence for others. The yoyo’s fossilized hair string reappears as the noose the narrator refuses to let tighten around the keeper. No moral is stated; the final image of the unbroken tide re-prices “fate” as shared vulnerability rather than escape.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>First-person voice carries a distinct perceptual signature of gears, brass, and backward logic; syntax spirals like the staircase. Compression (“wind spoke…like old lovers”) is taught early and paid off when wind exhales from the stone’s crack. No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens under pressure. Register stays within a tinkerer’s lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; metaphor density is high but patterned (clock/sea) and never muddies causality. No loops or scaffold. Information dual-loads: “stones…sweated salt and secrets” advances both setting and theme. The final clause “unbroken tide” lands clean without figurative overload.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</comment>
<comment>The backward yoyo as key to a hunger stone that shows futures you must pay for is a fresh synthesis of folk-tale and steampunk. Risky lyric accumulation stays coherent because the pattern is taught by line 5 and closure reverts it. Specificity of the bone-and-lead yoyo prevents swap-out. Not derivative.</comment>
