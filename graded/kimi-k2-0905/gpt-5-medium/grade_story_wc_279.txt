<comment>The narrator’s “socially perceptive” label is asserted early but only once dramatized—when she nudges the bearded man’s pebble—does it alter the mandala’s chemistry. Interiority is lyrically textured yet distances emotion through abstraction (“chest veer, a kite tugging”). No contradictory impulse is staged in scene; the shift from observer to mild conduit feels smooth rather than costly. Closure is a collective hush riding home, so the personal arc plateaus at observer-moderator rather than tested agent.</comment>

<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: patterns of sand, chalk, mist, and flake accrete until the final “emergent hush” reweights listening itself as the earned prize. Orientation is swift: grotto, artist, three-day rite within first 90 words. Causality is loose but coherent—each grain moved or chalk arc drawn slightly re-tunes the social weather until the hush arrives as a collective stance. Cost is conceptual: the group leaves “carrying nothing,” yet the hush now lives in their breathing—a Charged Poise that forecloses certainty without verbal decree.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Limestone licked by mist, chalk dust on slate, and the curved tile flake all double as micro-settings that literally guide where sound and gesture land. The grotto’s acoustics and the flake’s echo-channeling are not backdrop but active physics the facilitator exploits. Sensory economy is high—no tourist catalogue, only the cold moss shawl the child wears, the warm crescent in the palm—each chosen to modulate listening. Final image of mist exhaling in “patient loops” recharges the opening visual and anchors the conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: can the group let pattern emerge without forcing meaning? Pressure mounts through micro-alterations to sand and chalk; the bearded man’s confession is the single visible tightening that widens the circle. No option is foreclosed—the grotto permits endless rearrangement—but the hush itself becomes the irrevocable shift, a collective renunciation of glib certainty. Cost is diffuse: individual stories are voiced yet left unresolved, a social credit spent for shared porousness.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of “staying messy long enough for pattern to step forward” is embodied in the ever-shifting mandala rather than declared. The child’s equation of tile-as-tooth crystallizes the motif: understanding can bite or chew, neither tidy. Final image of hush riding home invites ongoing reader reflection without moral tag. Subtextual drift—daughter grief, unspoken divorces—lingers unfinished, enforcing the theme’s resistance to closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>First-person voice sustains a lyrical, chalk-dusted diction (“chalk is a listening stone”) that never falters into generic workshop voice. Perceptual signature is sharp: narrator clocks silences the way birds read thermals. Syntax modulates from short percussive openings to looping mist-clauses that mirror the grotto’s breath. No head-hop; even Pallas’s nod is filtered through narrator’s social read.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but controlled; mixed metaphors (“echoing bowl glazed with breath”) are coherent within the acoustic grotto logic. Occasional overgrowth—“lilac unease, delicate but sure, like dusk deciding”—threatens purple yet stays purposeful to tone. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or social pressure. Filter-verb clusters absent; strong verbs (“licked,” “smudged,” “curled”) keep immediacy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The whispering-gallery-tile-as-moon-tooth fusion is fresh, grounding acoustics magic in tactile relic without genre defaulting to full fantasy. “Unlearning” as ritualized sand-mandala erasure reworks familiar grief-workshop tropes into sensory praxis. Risk of collective protagonist pays off: hush becomes a distributed character. Final reconfiguration—meaning discovered by refusing to tidy the mess—feels inevitable yet non-obvious.</comment>
