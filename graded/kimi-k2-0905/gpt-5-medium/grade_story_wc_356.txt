<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Interiority is gorgeously embodied (“smell stitched the canopy”) and motives tighten with each beat; the final acceptance of stewardship is earned by the corpse-flower ritual. Ambition is held in contradictory tension—restlessness vs. serenity—visible in micro-choices (soaking roots in jasmine-ash tea, inhaling until eyes water). One slip: elders/villagers drift from distinct faces to choral backdrop, so status pressure is felt but not individualized. Closure carries visible cost: the narrator’s vow “softened,” foreclosing prior ambition while still tending the foul bloom—an Earned Stasis that pays its bill on the page.</comment>

<comment>Closure is immaculate: “ambition softened into stewardship” crystallizes a Charged Poise; a conceptual cost (permanent caretaking of a hated plant) rewires prior stakes. Causal chain is tight: parcel → seed → ritual → bridge steadied; each beat because/therefore tightens option space. Lens is Causal throughout; no amnesia or soft resets. Minor wobble: village collective as “opposition” is off-stage, so pressure occasionally reads as atmospheric, but the final image re-centers agency on narrator—cost legible, lens intact.</comment>

<comment>Treetop village is never catalogued; instead “boards swayed like breathing” and “six ropes converged” give tactile geography that constrains planting location. Olfactory micro-setting dominates—scents are navigation tools—so body becomes environment. The woven cradle of air-roots is a micro-prop whose preparation is choreographed beat-by-beat and whose final state is re-checked at closure, satisfying 9+ gate. Weather and season are kept lyrically off-stage, but motion-sickness of bridges supplies environmental pressure equivalent to wind or rain.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“motion calm inside a swaying world”—is signaled early and sharpened by nightly bridge tremors. Tightening occurs once: the bloom’s stench forces village-wide inhale/exhale sync; option space narrows to either accept rot-breath or lose bridges entirely. Cost is visible (nausea, social scorn) and persistent: narrator must keep tending the fetid flower indefinitely. Would reach 9+ if a secondary concrete loss (tool, time, friend) had been forfeited on-page; currently only sensory/relational price is dramatized.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: knowledge-as-undercurrent that must be breathed, even when rank. No character moralizes; instead the corpse flower becomes living subtext—wisdom stinks, but shared inhalation re-knits community. Final image re-prices prior motifs: wrapping-paper cartography becomes stewardship map; ambition is not expelled but composted. Ambiguity lingers—village may yet reject the bloom—creating resonant after-shiver without sermon.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>First-person voice is irreducibly synesthetic: “scent stitched the canopy,” “smell nudged like remembered grief.” Rhythm tightens under pressure—short clauses mirror held breath during bloom. Compression (“Grow motion calm here” 4-word note) teaches reader to accept elliptical ritual instructions; payoff is legible at closure. Diction stays within rustic-herbal lexicon; no filter-verb fog. Dialogue minimal, but courier’s single line carries subtext of inherited obligation—voice remains singular and confident throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is almost loop-free; only tiny scaffold (“I journalize...I journalize...”) recycles stem but serves as mantra and is paid off. Metaphors stay coherent (rot=road, bridges=breath) and never crowd a single sentence. Information density high: one sentence often handles scent, ritual action, and social reaction. A single mixed vehicle—“village inhaled wrong”—is permitted because it is later literalized by the stink ritual. Final paragraph cadence slows into long sentence that mimics exhalation—line-level craft actively collaborates in the closure effect.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Corpse-flower-as-therapy is a fresh inversion: usually horror, here community recalibrator. Wind-village mapped by smell rather than sight is novel sensory topiary. Wrapping-paper cartography turns ephemeral rubbish into generational archive—specific, low-tech, irreplaceable. Concept never feels gimmicked because each oddity tightens the motion-calm problem. Could edge higher if seed origin or grandmother’s vanishing carried a non-generic myth; as is, risk is local but memorable.</comment>
