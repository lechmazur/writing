<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The translator’s interiority is specific and embodied—“we unknot weather in other people’s chests”—and his micro-choice to decrypt the cast turns the coral from relic to key, charging the closure. His contradictory motives—grief-archive versus peace-broker—co-exist in scene, never summarized. The moment he trades a Reka word for an Atapo one shows status dynamics and value hierarchy under pressure, foreclosing old silence with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the coral placed at bedside reconfigures both families’ options while the fog-lowering treaty is felt, not declared. The accumulative lens holds throughout—each smeared signature tightens the shared anxiety pattern until the uncle’s nod makes the reweighting undeniable. Cost is legible in the mother’s sleepless dry eyes and the uncle’s first sleeve-touch.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The mist-clad atrium and coral fragment function as micro-setting: the coral’s grooves steady the translator’s pauses, literally guiding speech rhythm, while the fog exteriorizes the treaty only legible by touch. Spatial choreography is clean—bedside table, sleeve reach, palm-turn—anchoring bodies. Weather and object constrain choice rather than decorate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will shared anxiety drown or tether?—is signaled in the boy’s cartoon cloud stitched from both islands’ words. Escalation is textural: each decoded smear thickens the common bruise until the coral-turned-key punctuates the pause that forces mutual recognition. The tightening forecloses silence without guaranteeing peace, leaving felt cost in the uncle’s rain-soaked nod.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the coral’s shift from patrol-route archive to bedside lighthouse: translation as graft, not suture. The final image—fog lowered like a treaty read by touch—offers a non-literal answer without moralizing. Shared anxiety is reweighted from wound to dictionary, inviting lingering ambiguity about whether fog hides or holds.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Perceptual signature is sustained—Pacific idioms, salt-softened diction, and lyric cadence that breathes with vent-surf. Compression—“deep as a tidepool”—is patterned early and paid off at closure. No head-hopping; coral rotations replace filter verbs, tightening psychic distance. Dialogue-free design keeps voice singular and ocean-spelled.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary from tidal clauses to fragment-lighthouses; no loops or scaffold. Figurative layering is disciplined—rain as type, kestrels as commas—each image advances atmosphere without muddling causality. High-pressure decrypting beat keeps clarity while coral turns in hand, propelling silence into speech.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of conflict-zone translator as lexicographer of grief, reef-skeleton as dictionary, and fog as treaty-text feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk of lyric, object-driven plot pays off without gimmickry. Specificity—cartoon cloud with split belly, salt-softened name-trade—prevents generic peace-story template.</comment>
