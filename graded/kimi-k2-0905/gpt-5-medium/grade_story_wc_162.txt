<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The lost-child motivation is palpable in every image; the refusal to descend keeps the distance rule alive and charges the final image with felt cost. Interiority stays concrete—no diagnostic labels, only weather-code and grain reading as thinking. The only drag: “featherly determined” repeats without new contradiction after the opening beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the decision to hold the distance reweights every prior maze metaphor and leaves the terrace drifting—visible cost is the postponed reunion. Accumulative lens holds: each code-to-grain alignment thickens pattern until the seam yields orchard-shadows. Causality remains intact; no teleporting props or retro-patches.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The prism terrace is both setting and tool: its glass seam is the literal threshold that must be palmed open, its color refraction supplies the final orchard projection. Micro-setting (bench grain) constrains the “intuit” action and directly maps the weather code—no other surface would serve. Spatial choreography clean; no floating rooms.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</question><comment>Dominant stake—“keep the distance or close it”—is signaled early and tightens once: the palm-to-seam choice forecloses immediate reunion. Cost is conceptual but legible: the father stays scarecrow, the narrator keeps ache. One micro-turn suffices for this length; escalation is atmospheric, not causal, fitting the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><answer>9.3</question><comment>The sacred threshold theme emerges solely through image—glass seam, corn gleams, withheld descent—never abstract assertion. Final image re-prices “necessary distances” as the companion rather than wall, achieving Conceptual Repricing without moralizing. No thematic echo in dialogue; resonance carried by color and withheld motion.</comment>
<question>6</question><answer>9.1</question><comment>First-person lyric voice owns a distinct syntactic ripple—compressed clauses, weather-code diction, no filter-verb stacks. “Wind smelled of sugar glass” is perceptual signature, not ornament. Rhythm modulates: longer rushes for orchard reveal, micro-clauses when palm meets seam. No head-hopping; POV modesty intact.</comment>
<question>7</question><answer>8.8</question><comment>High information density: every sentence advances pattern or stakes; no scaffold or synonym churn. Metaphors stay coherent—prism, raft, color—anchored to physics of light. One register drift: “conceptual repricing” is evaluator language, not narrator’s, but occurs outside text; no line-level artifact touches closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><answer>9.4</question><comment>The corn-maze/weather-code fusion feels inevitable yet unseen before; the terrace-as-prism literalizes threshold optics without gimmick. Risky second-person address to father (“Father, said the whisper”) is earned by prior pattern. Transformation test fails if any element swapped—specificity is the story.</comment>
