<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority is lyric and embodied (“knuckles to rain,” “bones softening like wax”), but the protagonist’s contradictory impulses are stated more than enacted in scene; the confession of selling a lullaby is the only beat where interior conflict visibly alters tactics. The final renunciation (giving his shadow) carries felt cost and is consonant with the established moral allergy to dishonesty, earning the change. Still, we get only one micro-choice on the page; the rest is retrospective summary, keeping it below the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: because he despises dishonesty, he elicits the watchman’s truth; because he confesses, the chamber accepts; therefore he can trade his shadow. The closure beat—shadow stepping away, light returning—lands as a Decisive Change with visible cost. Mosaic structure is taught early via named shards and floor glyphs, transitions legible. Minor loop: “mending what isn’t torn” is repeated four times without new causal payload, blunting final impact.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Resonance chamber functions as micro-setting: brass ribs, copper veins, floor glyphs constrain tactics—only honesty vibrates the tuning box. Sensory hierarchy skews auditory, matching music-box POV; lunar flecks and tin-and-pears taste keep atmosphere sharp. Spatial choreography clean: chip placed → glyphs glow → rafters shiver. Tool (tuning box) and body (his knees fold) serve as setting extensions that charge the final image when he winds it closed.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reclaim stolen light—signals early; pressure tightens when the covenant of rust demands a binding price, foreclosing the option of simple repair. Protagonist’s agency drives the escalation: he names the price (tether light to listening) and pays it (yields shadow). Cost is legible on the page: he feels “lighter by a shade,” and the city’s dawn is now conditional on human attention. One meaningful tightening suffices; no reversals required.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the pattern of repair vs. ownership: light is borrowed, not possessed, and survives only through communal listening. Subtext in gesture—shadow’s solemn nod—carries the weight of covenant without exposition. Final image of streetlamps breathing “gold not of ownership but of listening” reweights prior material, achieving Conceptual Repricing. No moralizing sentence at the end; ambiguity remains (light can still wander), sustaining complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>First-person voice is distinct, percussive, synesthetic: “ribs of brass catching lunar flecks,” “hush that tasted like tin and pears.” Syntax compresses under pressure—“I breathed, and pressed”—then elongates during reflection, mirroring emotional cadence. Elision (“the whole attempt in the balance”) is pattern-taught early and paid off in the taut spring image. No head-hopping; diction stays within music-box horologist lexicon; rhythmic control heightens without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>High information density: one sentence often does three jobs (anchors time, advances plot, carries metaphor). Minor paraphrase loop on “mending what isn’t torn” costs −0.3; otherwise no synonym churn or mixed metaphors. Strong verbs (“rivering chord,” “threaded the rafters”) replace modifiers. Read-aloud rhythm varies; paragraph cuts are clean. Closure image (“light returned as a pale choir”) is precise and uncluttered.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Fusion of music-box craft, philosopher’s-stone shard, and sentient rust feels organic rather than checklist; specificity of tuning box as wooden lung that “remembered every lullaby” transforms familiar relic into lived tool. Premise—light stolen by covenant of rust—offers fresh angle on city-wide stakes. Risk in lyric mosaic structure pays off: final reprise of dawn as “borrowed instrument” reweights earlier motif. Could not swap “resonance chamber” for generic hall without breaking logic.</comment>
