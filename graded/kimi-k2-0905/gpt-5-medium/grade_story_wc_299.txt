<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The narrator’s insulating tactic is shown in embodied beats—measuring the scrap, pricing it separately—and the final micro-choice to list the cloth as “memory load” is earned. Interior contradiction is live: wanting numbness yet fingering the singed corner. The scrap’s re-weighting is credible because the hand remembers before the mind consents. Only minor slip: “confidently uncertain” is named, not dramatized in a beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the scrap is re-classified from trash to relic with social/occupational cost visible in the ledger line. Causal lens holds—because the narrator failed publicly, therefore he seeks refuge in facts, but the cloth forces a repricing that reopens loss. The quarry as echo-chamber is set up early and paid off in the final image. No orientation debt; who/where/when anchored by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The trailer’s rusted squat, rock-dust frost, and puddles flecked with mica are filtered through the POV’s roadie eye—“evaporated applause” is character-specific. Spatial choreography is clean: door wheeze, locker on desk, narrator’s boots. Micro-setting (the cloth) constrains the final choice and charges the last image. Weather and quarry bowl serve as acoustic memory, mirrored in “echo valley longing.”</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: can the narrator remain fact-armored? Pressure tightens once when the cloth’s singe is recognized, forcing a choice—catalog as relic or trash. The repricing in the ledger is the visible cost, foreclosing the “old roadie trick.” No reversal, but the single deepening is meaningful under accumulative lens; coincidence is absent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the tension between appraisal value and memory value. The houndstooth scrap is a concrete particular that reweights “worth” without moralizing. Final image of the quarry breathing back our breath offers resonant, non-literal answer. No explicit thesis; ambiguity lingers about whether the ledger entry is healing or further self-burial.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>First-person voice carries distinct roadie diction—“coil hope onto spindles,” “printer-ink paycheck”—and perceptual signature filters quarry through sound tech metaphors. Rhythm modulates: long sentence stacking memories, then clipped cataloging beats. No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens when fingers recognize singe. Elisions (“after the sirens came silence”) are pattern-taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; metaphor density is high but patterned—“rusted thought,” “evaporated applause”—and justified by narrator’s lyric past. No synonym loops or scaffold. Information density strong: one sentence can do description, backstory, and emotional state. Minor mixed metaphor “applause sloshed off the shale like water” barely grazes closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Fusion of quarry archaeology with touring-band aftermath feels fresh; the grille cloth as memory trigger is specific, not archetypal. Transformation test: story fails if cloth is any generic token. Risky lyric compression is coherent, not gimmick. Slight echo of “echo valley” as phrase rather than image keeps it from 9.0.</comment>
