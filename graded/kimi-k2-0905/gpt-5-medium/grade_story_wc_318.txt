<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The conductor’s mournful eagerness is stated repeatedly yet never enacted through contradictory micro-choices; he pulls cords, mouths names, but we get no interior clash that forces a costly decision. The promised “profession of tending the unspoken” remains an abstract label—no beat shows him weighing, say, the risk of waking grief versus the need for laughter. The ending’s “repaired silence” is handed to him by the tunnel rather than earned through a visible renunciation or mistake, so the arc feels ascribed, not lived.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as an Accumulative Repricing: the tunnel returns a child’s squeal, the house “sighs awake,” and grief tips his hat—an image that reweights the silence. Yet the lens is taught late; the first 120 words swirl in lyric disorientation without cueing the accumulative design, so the orientation tax (−0.4) applies. Causality is lyric, not sequential, but the final image does carry felt cost—the conductor leaves without applause, having traded his own noise for their hush—so the unit is valid if thin.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The echo chamber tunnel is rendered with sonic particularity—whispers return “heavier,” rain becomes “cymbals of tin and sorrow”—and this acoustic alchemy directly charges the closure. Spatial grounding is deliberately dreamlike, yet bodies and machines remain trackable: vents snake to the basement, the pull cord is fingered, knuckles redden. The tunnel’s rule-set (it returns only what you risk) constrains the conductor’s tactic of yanking multiple cords, so the micro-setting passes the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Stakes—“restore lost laughter”—are declared early but remain abstract; no moment shows what he forfeits if he fails or what the household risks if laughter returns. Escalation is textural: each engine gust adds density rather than narrowing options. The single meaningful tightening is the mother’s lip-press in response to a distant squeal, but it is observed, not driven by the conductor’s choice, so agency feels diffuse and the cost is vicarious.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: grief as an audience member who stays to listen suggests art’s obligation to every haunting, not just the joyous. The motif of “macerating silence into mulch” literalizes the alchemy of memory, and the final tipped hat reconfigures grief from antagonist to witness. No moral is stated; the resonance lingers in the exhaling floorboard. Yet the theme is somewhat diffuse because the household’s interior shift is off-stage, diluting the conceptual charge.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Voice is lush, compressed, and consistently lyric—“skewed but honest about the missing”—teaching the reader to accept surreal causality early. Syntax warps to mimic tunnel echo: stacked clauses, hyphenated compounds, off-kilter prepositions. No dialogue means no register drift; the narrative diction stays inside the conductor’s mythic lexicon. The risk of purple density is high, yet rhythm modulates—short pulses like “He yanks the cords like bells” give the engine section a percussive lift that propels the ending.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Line-level ear is strong—varied sentence lengths, no template cadence—but figurative language is freighted in nearly every sentence (“lanterns in fog,” “mulch against the tunnel ribs”), creating a surplus that occasionally buries propulsion. Mixed metaphors appear: grief “shows up as a man with a wet hat” then “sits and listens,” a personification that collides with the earlier image of grief as atmosphere. The final third keeps its clarity, so 9+ is not disallowed, but the earlier density flirts with overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>The leaf-blower-as-orchestra is a fresh conceptual leap, and the inversion—machines making laughter instead of noise pollution—feels inevitable once sprung. Risk is taken in the lyric, non-causal structure, yet the piece commits fully rather than hedging. The conductor’s profession is particularized to this tunnel, this household; swap the instrument and the emotional calculus collapses. Minor deduction for echoing the “man with a wet hat” trope without fully transmuting it.</comment>
