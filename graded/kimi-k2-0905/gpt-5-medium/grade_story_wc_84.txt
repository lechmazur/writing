<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The pilot’s “noticing-as-key” credo is embodied in micro-choices—rotating the dome, re-coding silence as letter—so the arc from observer to co-author is legible. The pilgrim’s shift from mute awe to speaking the sky-text is felt, but because the pilgrim’s interior is filtered through the pilot, the cost lands softer on them. Interior contradiction is present (“perpetually surprised” twice), yet it is confessed rather than dramatized in scene. Still, the final shared stance of “the night trusts us” carries a credible, tender forfeiture of solitude.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the blank glyphs are re-inked as rests where breath = belonging, reweighting the whole sky-to-text premise with undeniable social cost. Causal engine is light—mostly pattern accumulation—but the Accumulative/Textural lens is taught early and held to the final cadence. Orientation is clean: who/where/when anchored by line 5. The cost is legible in the hush that “is both shelter and proof,” satisfying the 9+ cost test; minor slack comes from the pilgrim’s late interior access.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The observatory’s brass sigh, the chipped astrolabe teeth, and the “purple ribbon of day” are tactile, selective, and bias-filtered through the pilot’s tool-eye. The matrix chip and broken sextant cradle function as micro-setting, constraining the final algorithmic tweak that reads silence as letter. Spatial choreography is clean across drone moves and dome rotation. While the city below isonly a glancing receipt of light, the dome itself evolves from relic to sentence-diagram, charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</question><comment>Dominant stake—decode belonging—threads from first line to final directive. Escalation is density/cadence rather than causal turns: each blank glyph widens the moral space until silence itself becomes payable vowel. Agency is pilot-driven (algorithm tweak, spiral trace) with visible price: the hush that “carries soft electricity,” a felt resource now spent. No reversals, but the single deepening suffices under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges inductively from the engineered sky-text rather than thesis statements; the final line’s invitation is oblique, not moral. The missing-pieces motif is reweighted as necessary rests, avoiding sentimental repair. Subtext in the pilgrim’s tongue-fold of the paper stores thunder without explaining it. Only minimal hedge: “belonging is not found but tuned” flirts with aphorism but is earned by prior material labor.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</question><comment>First-person voice owns a consistent techno-lyric idiom—“their propellers whisper while their cameras drink photons”—that modulates into softer warmth at the spiral. Perceptual signature is sharp throughout: letters and orbits as relatives who “stopped using last names.” No dialogue, so no voice convergence issue. Filter verbs are sparse and purposeful; free indirect stays clean. The risk compression in “I belong to whoever needs the horizon to be a sentence” is paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</question><answer>Prose is dense, rhythmic, and scaffold-free; sentences layer job—image, motion, concept—without synonym churn. Mixed metaphors are controlled (e.g., dusk “breathes with brilliant dimness”) and read as intentional lyricism rather than error. No loops or template cadences; paragraph cuts are purposeful. Minor elevation in “cadence like footsteps arriving after a long border of gravel” is earned by emotional crest.</answer>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</question><comment>Fusion of movable-type tech, drone astronomy, and antique dome feels inevitable, not grafted. The silence-as-letter reconfiguration is a fresh conceptual twist on “missing pieces.” Emotional specificity—unfinished people pronouncing one another—grounds the conceit. While echoes of Calvino-like sky-writing exist, the pilot’s tool-hand twist and communal final hush transform the template into a singular stance.</comment>
