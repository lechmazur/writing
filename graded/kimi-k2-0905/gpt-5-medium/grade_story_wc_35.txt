<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The chef’s memory-tasting gift is never explained, yet every micro-choice (scraping the coral, blistering peppers, tasting broth) is grounded in sensory risk that visibly costs him jaw-ache, rust-blood mouth, and final steady breathing. The keeper’s single remembered gate-left-unbarred is compressed into one filament-touch—enough to earn the later quiet stand-taller. Interiority stays concrete, avoids therapy-speak, and the final jar-saving is a believable occupational reflex rather than savior framing. Only the brother-under-hooves image drifts toward shorthand violence instead of embodied consequence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the bowls emptied, the keeper stands taller, the dream exhales—cost paid on-page in the metallic-to-soft broth shift. Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout; each puddle, filament, and spoon adds density that re-weights remorse rather than causing external turns. Orientation is anchored by line 7 (chef, courtyard, post-rain), well within 120-word margin. No causality breaks; the coral’s consent is metaphorical yet internally consistent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is not backdrop but instrument: wet-stone scent, scalloped puddles, and non-melting ice constrain every selection the chef makes. The desert fortress after rain supplies both mirror-maps and the throat-opening that literally swallows options; environment shapes tactics and charges the final evaporating salt-rings image. Micro-setting objects (the blue-sand box, the jar of coral) evolve state on-page, satisfying 9+ gate. Spatial choreography stays coherent through descent into pavilion and return to kitchen.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—how to bear contaminated remorse—tightens once: from warning (don’t touch) through filament infection to ingestion and bodily cost. No external antagonist is needed; pressure accrues as coral pulses consent, narrowing options to cook or shatter. The single deepening (tasting broth) forecloses the option of returning the remorse untransformed and is legible under Accumulative lens. Visible price: metallic throat → softened wood, keeper’s taller stance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the metaphor chain taste→archive→broth: memory must be metabolized, not erased. Subtext lives in silence—bowls clink, keeper stares at hands—avoiding moral statement. Final image of saved coral reweights earlier warning into future tool rather than hoarding, achieving CR without sermon. No final-paragraph thesis line; resonance is felt in salt rings left behind.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>First-person perceptual signature is relentless: “borrowed thunder,” “sandpaper grain without splinters,” “dunes smoothed by cloudburst.” Syntax contracts under stress (“I reeled and steadied”) then lengthens for the broth simmer, mirroring emotional cadence. No head-hopping; keeper’s interiority is inferred solely through chef’s palate, maintaining distance. Purposeful elision (how tasting works) is taught early and paid off at consent moment.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is dense but never purple: one sentence often carries scent, metaphor, and causal cue (“puddles stitched the courtyard like mirrors without frames”). Mixed-metaphor risk (“coral… singing winter”) is justified by surreal premise taught in same sentence. Zero template cadence; sentence openings vary, paragraphs breathe. Only minor scaffold: “I tasted, and the first spoon…” could trim the echoic “I tasted,” but the beat is pivotal and rhythmically intentional.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: desert hydrology + frozen coral archive + gustatory empathy. Remorse as briny non-melting ice is non-obvious yet inevitable once tasted. Risk of lyric excess is held in check by culinary procedural detail. Transformation test fails if chef is swapped out—only this vocation could metabolize coral into barley-lime broth. Bold structural compression (one descent, one meal) heightens rather than obscures stakes.</comment>
