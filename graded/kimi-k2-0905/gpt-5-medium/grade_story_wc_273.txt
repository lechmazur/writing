<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The albino tracker’s refusal of the throne is earned by the mentor memory and the ink-river lie-down; cost is the self-erasure that leaves only a hollow for the bird to learn. Interiority is concrete—“question lodged under my ribs,” “body becomes a levee”—and the serene anger modulates under pressure. Micro-choices (spill second vial, lie in ink, refuse throne) reveal hierarchy of values. Flaw: no contradiction shown inside the final chamber; stance crystallizes but we do not feel the tug to accept.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the protagonist’s disappearance refuses the metronome’s bargain and the market collapses; the hummingbird’s new song is the visible cost/reconfiguration. Causal chain holds: ink tasting → pattern reveals stall zones → maps expose footfalls → metronome confronted → refusal erases self. Orientation anchor (who/where) is present by line 3; wind-carved camp and eclipse timestamp are immediate. One causality wobble: the algorithm is revealed only in the penultimate paragraph, so the early “buyers” remain abstract a beat too long.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The wind-carved camp is not backdrop; its auric ribs and flute-alleys guide the ink flow and physically house the metronome. Sand grains, cooling-rock clicks, and salt-blue hut are tactile and bias-filtered by the tracker’s professional eye. Spatial choreography is clean: lip → trough → hut → chamber, each move legible. The eclipse aftermath tightens the clock and licenses the slowed-time premise. The ink itself functions as micro-setting/tool and constrains every choice; its disappearance recharges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—end the market that sells crisis-time—is signaled early and tightened when the ink spine reveals the metronome hut. Agency is continuous: seed vial, spill second vial, lie in ink, refuse throne—each action forecloses options. Cost is visible: self-outline erased, mentor’s fate recalled, bird must learn a song of absence. No coincidence; escalation is driven by pattern-reading and refusal. Could use one earlier glimpse of the algorithm to raise pressure above 8.5.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: commodified panic, time as currency, refusal as resistance. The disappearing ink reweights from teaching tool to weapon of erasure; the metronome’s offer of “throne of pauses” crystallizes the moral calculus. Final image—bird singing the hollow—gives conceptual repricing: resistance is not conquest but vanishing. Serene anger stays honest, avoids sentimentality; no moralizing paragraph.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is distilled, arid, tracker-specific: “sand half-remember,” “clock inside turned viscous.” Syntax shortens under pressure—“I refuse the throne and let the ink…”—matching metronome tick. Perceptual signature never wavers; no filter-verb bloat. Patterned elision (“read the river of it”) is taught early and paid off when the bird learns the hollow. Rhythmic control heightens final quiet without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Sentence variation and muscular verbs propel; every line does double duty: “wind-carved into auric ribs” sets camp and metaphor. No loops or synonym churn; metaphors stay consistent (ink=river, metronome=bone). One mixed vehicle: “time refuses and then relents” is abstract but forgivable. Final third is artifact-free, allowing 9+ proximity; only minor diction elevation keeps it at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: albino tracker + ink-reading + crisis-time market is non-obvious yet inevitable after closure. Risk—lyric refusal instead of smashing the clock—pays off by reconfiguring meaning rather than object. Specific detail (“arid Morse,” “canvas falling”) prevents template feel. The vanished-outline exit is a singular image not swappable with generic rebellion.</comment>
