<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The narrator’s “carefully reckless” contradiction is embodied in the salt-ravine flashback and the present gamble of composing the suite; interiority stays specific to a linguist’s metaphors (“dust motes as footnotes”). Micro-choices—dipping the quill, singing the headings—reveal hierarchy of values. The final shared revision shows earned change: trust re-configured through joint authorship. Missing 9.0 because Lio’s return feels slightly convenient; his interior shift is implied rather than dramatized on-page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the two stand in the doorway holding the “door held open by joined hands” — the archive’s acoustics now re-tuned from silence to resonance. Cost is legible: the narrator’s vulnerability on paper, Lio’s visible aging, the rewritten promises that can still fail. Causal lens holds: because the narrator composed, therefore Lio could speak; because they co-revise, the archive’s hush loosens. No orientation drift; who/where/when anchored by word 60.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The ink well, lamp, and shelves function as micro-setting: the glass well “returns my face in wavering glyphs,” constraining caution; shelves “sigh,” guiding the choice to sing the pages. Salt-ravine flashback is anchored to present tactile cue (the quill dip), satisfying BRR. Auditory detail dominates—overtones, cadence, listening shelves—true to linguist POV. Final image of dawn uncoupling from night reweights the archive from tomb to threshold.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restoring trust after silence—tightens when the narrator risks composing the suite; each promise is a tangible test. Escalation is accumulative: density of musical metaphors increases until the room answers in overtones. Cost is visible: the stele’s hush still bruises; Lio’s lowered shoulders show release. One meaningful deepening suffices; no false reversals.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges as “truth needs accompaniment”: silence wounds, but resonance heals. Subtext lives in acoustics—listening shelves, shivering chords, sung headings—never moralized. Final image of dawn uncoupling reweights the premise: trust is not monument but ongoing chord. No thematic echo; the insight stays implicit in the jointly held door.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is linguist-particular: “dust motes hung like annotations,” “syntax of promises.” Rhythmic control mirrors musical structure; short cadences under pressure (“wrist steady, heart fugueing”). No head-hopping; Lio’s voice distinct via brittle onset then alignment. Compression taught early (“sound matters here, but so do pauses”) and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>High information density: single sentences do triple duty (“ink breathing into letters shaped like opened doors”). No loops or scaffold; metaphors stay coherent (glass = held breath = warning). One mixed metaphor only (“braids make strength visible”) but it clears within two lines. Closure line (“dawn uncoupled from the night”) is clean, propulsive, resonant.</comment>

<grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>Premise—restoring trust through extinct-language music—is non-obvious and fully committed. Risk of sentimental reconciliation avoided by keeping closure a shared, still-fragile choreography. Specific detail (“catalog numbers bent like reeds”) prevents template drift. The “symphonies of truth” concept is re-animated rather than quoted; freshness lies in acoustic linguistics as emotional tech.</comment>
