<comment>The summoner’s interiority is gorgeously particular—"eyes bright with inward constellations," "lantern of calm opened and burned without smoke"—and every micro-choice (placing the wing, guiding breath, renouncing victory) is tethered to the core task. The arc of endurance/renunciation is credible, but the absence of any visible failure or contradiction keeps the struggle a touch too serene for 9+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Closure is a perfect Conceptual Repricing: the prophecy’s code literally unties like wet shoelaces, leaving “room” rather than void—an undeniable reweighting of the future. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each ripple, fold, and hush-layer thickens the stake until the final image (“the valley listened”) pays off the pattern with felt cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The brook, wing, and fox function as micro-setting that constrains every tactic: the water’s arithmetic must be read, the wing’s folds must be honored, the fox’s trust must not be broken. Final image—the wing lifted with “a bead of water like a planet”—crystallizes setting into carryable cosmos, charging closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Escalation is textural: each ripple strips a digit, each hush-layer removes a future gear, narrowing the prophecy’s options until only “room” remains. The price is legible in the final breath: the summoner leaves the wing behind, paying with permanent vigilance—listening forward instead of owning victory.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the concrete paradox that silence is not erasure but release; the final ladder of moonlight re-prices “noon of iron” into “bread.” No moral is stated—only the fox asleep and the child untroubled—letting the reader feel the reconfiguration rather than be told it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The lyric third-person hovers at a consistent mythic distance; diction (“moonmilk,” “leafdark”) stays inside the summoner's poetic lexicon. Rhythm swells and subsides with the water’s pulse, teaching the reader the hush-pattern early and paying it off in the final syllable “Go.”</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Almost every sentence layers image, action, and concept (“foam rose and bowed, carrying away a letter here, a digit there”). One near-loop—“smoothed hush deepened like velvet riverbed, an understory where even rumors slept”—is forgiven because the cadence teaches the hush-texture required at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The prophecy-unwriting via origami hydromancy feels sui generis; the transformation of code into wet shoelaces is an image that would collapse if any noun were swapped. Risk—entire plot hinges on listening, not acting—heightens stakes without gimmickry and is rewarded by the earned cosmic hush.</comment>
