<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interior contradiction is vivid—“falling for others, never for myself”—and the final rooftop renunciation carries embodied cost. Micro-choices (breath-count steadied hands, reciting bone dates) tie fear to action. Relationship shift with brother lands, but child’s agency is asserted rather than dramatized, muting crucible effect.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of cast-cipher, shell hum, and bone-date constellation reweights identity stake to Resonant Reconfiguration on roof. Closure beat—“we unlocked our shared name by speaking both versions”—pays conceptual cost (foreclosed alias, exposed debt). Orientation anchors by line 4; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Rusted library groans like ships, skylight ladder, and bone-date dial physically constrain decryption path; micro-setting (shell half) charges final heartbeat synchronization. Sensory hierarchy skews auditory (shell, iron stacks) matching stunt-ear training. Specificity never stalls momentum; every tactile detail advances cipher solve or emotional pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—identity ownership—tightens when cipher demands literal body memory (broken-bone dates). Each decoded phrase narrows options until rooftop confrontation forecloses anonymity. Cost visible: shared name spoken = debts revive, knives await. Escalation is accretive, not causal, fitting lens; one meaningful deepening suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme—“vulnerability is power”—emerges through decryption tremors and final unarmored apology, never stated outright. Cast galaxies reprice brother’s betrayal as collaborative map. Final image of tracing fresh notes on damp plaster reframes fragility as treaty, avoiding moral summation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>First-person perceptual signature filters world through stunt-body lexicon—catalogued injuries, tidebreath, rope-over-wood syllables—maintaining rhythmic compression. Free-indirect slips are clean; no head-hop. Voice modulates from fear-scatter to surf-nod cadence under pressure, supporting Charged Poise closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lyric density high yet purposeful; metaphor chain (library as ship, constellations as lock) remains coherent. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances cipher or emotion. Occasional elevated diction (“testify,” “reknit”) acceptable within stunt-double eloquence register. Final third clean, allowing 9+ eligibility.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Identity-swapping stunt-double + coded child-cast + whispering shell fuses into fresh configuration; trope of hidden sibling debt becomes recursive performance art. Cipher mechanic teaches reader early, pays off in bone-date combination. Risky lyric compression succeeds; specificity prevents gimmickry.</comment>
