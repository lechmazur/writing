<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Mara’s interior contradiction—needing darkness yet craving a wick—is embodied in every tactile micro-choice (threading cards, braiding wick). The crestfallen artist flaw drives her to salvage a lighthouse she doesn’t own, compounding risk. Final endurance (“I will keep the light tonight”) costs her the safety of anonymity; causality intact, cost legible.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the relit lens reweights her earlier “fragmented reality” into custodianship of faces and beam. Causal chain—card threading → wick braid → light restored—lands with felt cost (salt-raw hands, public exposure). Keeper’s log line becomes the constraint she inherits; lighthouse and self simultaneously relit.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Forgotten library’s slanted shelves and sweating stones constrain her movements and supply the only tarot threads; environment literally holds the redesign plan. Micro-setting of the gear-house reservoir forces her fingers to work inside a rust-clock ribcage. Final image—column of brightness stitching her to weather—makes the lighthouse body indistinguishable from hers.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: save her eye from habitual dimming. Tightening occurs when she realizes the keeper’s threaded deck is a map she must physically enact; option to retreat vanishes once she descends the spiral. Price—accepting public guardianship—visible in ledger inscription. One meaningful turn sufficient for length; escalation coherent under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through recurrent threading/untangling images: light knows where to go only after threads are parsed. No moralizing; final line quietly reframes fragmented reality as communal responsibility. Ambiguity lingers—she owns no lighthouse yet keeps it—complexity preserved. Subtext in salt-twine smell and trembling cards carries the emotional aftereffect.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Perceptual signature is painterly—colors are “luminescent ache,” faces “frontiers”—consistent with crestfallen artist POV. Rhythmic control: long clause-laden sentences mimic tidal drag, then shorten at match-strike. Patterned elision (“questions drifted back like foam”) taught early and paid off in acceptance of irresolution. No head-hopping; psychic distance clean.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>High information density: each sentence layers sensory, symbolic, and causal work without scaffold. Metaphors stay physically coherent (rust ticking like broken clock). Minor overwriting in “luminescent ache” and “salt-threaded beard,” but cadence supports lyric mode. No loops, no synonym churn; final column-of-light image propels outward.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: tarot-as-lighthouse-map reconfigures fortune-telling into maintenance manual. Risk of preciousness offset by salt, rust, and match-sulfur grit. Inevitable hindsight—of course a portraitist would relight a gallery of faces. Conceptual integrity intact; no retreat to safe middle ground.</comment>
