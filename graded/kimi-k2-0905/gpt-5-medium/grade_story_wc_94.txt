<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>The poet’s interior contradiction—needing to read the scars yet fearing what the map will ask—is dramatized in the trembling thumb over the timer. Body/emotion integration is vivid: “thinning fear into a clarity that did not soften its edge.” The final tracing of the constellation on the chart is a micro-choice that costs the last of their detachment, foreclosing the safety of ignorance; the caretaker’s palm-on-palm cements the earned alliance. Still, the caretaker’s own motives remain a touch schematic, preventing full 8+ compression.</comment>

<comment> Closure lands as Charged Poise: the poet’s finger on the scar-constellation reweights the city and the self in one visible image. Causality is lyric-accumulative: each thunder-storm page-turn thickens the atlas of pain until the dome’s flicker offers a legible route. The envelope, timer, and storm are taught early; transitions are seamless. Cost is felt in the hush after the last bolt—language itself rarefied into breathable map—though the caretaker’s exposition slightly cushions the final punch.</comment>

<comment>The observatory dome operates as micro-setting: its brass switchboard, milky camera eye, and lightning-fed wires constrain every choice the poet makes. Storm-wet air thins lungs, forcing slower breath that matches the timer’s tick; altitude and weather together decide when masks slip. Spatial choreography is clean: steps up, envelope exchanged, chart spread beneath boots, finger tracing ash-lines. One minor slip—“the night opened” at the exit—leans toward abstraction, but the dome’s charged machinery still governs the closing image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—will the poet read their own scar-map or retreat—tightens when the caretaker demands the timer be started: silence measured in lightning becomes the price of knowledge. Agency is present: pressing the button, stopping the clock at thunder-crest, tracing the constellation. Cost is visible—poet’s hand steadies despite tremor, language rarefies to breath—but the caretaker’s speech absorbs some pressure, keeping the escalation just shy of 8-band intensity. Still, the storm’s final roll feels like earned complicity rather than external rescue.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without slogan: censorship reversed by weather-writing, scars becomes legible stars. The “cartography of scars” idea is re-priced in the final image—poet’s finger on the chart—turning private wound into public map. Subtext lives in gesture: the timer’s chrome button is a pulse no poem was allowed to have. No moral is stated; the healed page drying below is resonance enough, though a hair of caretaker exposition keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Lyric compression is consistent: “storm-kissed wonder,” “furiously tranquil”—pattern taught by repetition and paid off in the final hush. Syntax rarefies along with air—short clauses, en-dash pauses—mirrors thinning oxygen. Perceptual signature is strong: poet notices greasy envelope corners, ash-smudged fingerprints, milky camera glass—details a censored eye would seize. No head-hopping; caretaker’s voice stays exterior, observed only through poet’s filter, keeping focalization pure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm is supple: paragraph lengths swell and contract like storm gusts. Metaphors are selective—lightning as marginalia, timer as metronome—and never stack beyond one per beat. One near-loop: “furiously tranquil” repeats three times; the echo is purposeful but still noticeable, clipping the 9+ rung. Otherwise, information density is high—each sentence advances atlas, body, or stakes—and no scaffolding obscures the closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The blackout-poet decoding a storm-lit star-map of their own censored wounds is a fresh angle on trauma narrative. Risk is taken in lyric-accumulative structure rather than causal reversals, and it holds. Specificity—greasy timetable paper, ash-constellation strokes—keeps the concept from abstraction. While “masks slip” verges on prompt-echo, the final reconfiguration of scars into navigable constellations feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
