<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Registrar’s interior contradiction—covet the lens / fear silence—drives every beat; cowardice→public confession arcs credibly. Embodied tremble in “heartbeat is a drum in my wrists” shows pressure without label-speak. Micro-choice to mount bandstand, not hide, forecloses retreat with visible social risk. Cost scales to length: one night, one reputation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure = Earned Stasis: lens returned in open glare, registrar accepts permanent vulnerability (“they can decide if the ledgers deserve me”). Causal chain intact: eavesdrop→decode doodles→public reveal→trust restored. Accumulating ticket-images tighten stakes each beat; final image of rippled water reweights all prior mistrust. Cost legible in relinquished control and nightly vigil now unhidden.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Crystal forecourt, puddles, tarp screen—three tactile objects that constrain movement and charge final projection image. Rain-slick surface mirrors both city oath and lens-light, binding setting to theme. Spatial track clean: kiosk→bench→bandstand steps traced without drift. Sensory economy skips tourist checklist, favors sound of “rain ticks from the edges,” anchoring time and weather.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can communal trust survive projector sabotage—tightens when each ticket-doodle narrows possible culprits. Mid-story reveal that troupe tested, not sabotaged, flips blame vector under causal lens. Registrar’s public confession is decisive pressure point; no off-stage rescue. Cost = loss of anonymous authority; plaza laughter stays gentle to protect fragile hush.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through image-pattern: transparency (lens, puddles, tarp screen) versus occlusion (curator’s silence). No moral spoken; final ripple across shoes is non-literal answer to “what does shared truth feel like?” Subtext in doodles—tear over sprocket teeth—carries civic grief better than exposition. Registrar’s cowardice→honesty arc incarnates theme without thesis statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>First-person lyric dense with perceptual signature: “glass throats,” “prisms,” “crystal whispering”—idiosyncratic noticing sustains voice. Syntax compresses under stress: “I slot the lens in a brass ring, aim it between two rain columns, and wait.” No head-hopping; single registrar consciousness holds. Diction stays within plausible lexicon of night clerk who keeps ledgers. Rhythm modulates: longer clauses for contemplation, fragments for mounting dread.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High information density: one sentence often paints scene + emotion + stakes (“I patrol beneath the awnings where the last show shuttered, fingers worrying a lens…”). Figurative language spare, no stacked metaphors dulling closure. Filter verbs minimal; when used (“I see,” “I feel”) they serve registrar’s cataloguing nature. Occasional template cadence (“I tell them… I held the lens…”) but appears in reflective beat, not peak action, so clarity intact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh angle: civic reconciliation via micro-projection of children’s doodles on rain-wet tarp—quiet, original ritual. Trope of broken projector flipped: lens is not weapon but sacrament of transparency. Specificity of “square that flares with streak marks like a window wiped in secret” prevents generic anywhere-city. Risk in lyric hush pays off; silence becomes active character. Transformation test passed: swap plaza for any square, story collapses without crystal acoustics and lens ontology.</comment>
