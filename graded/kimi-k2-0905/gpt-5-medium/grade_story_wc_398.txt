<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The sentinel’s quiet endurance and micro-choice to hand over knife & twine embody a credible, costed stance; interiority is concrete (“vineyard and I breathe, verdicts loosen”). Yet the traveler’s arc is slightly more told than dramatized, softening the relationship-as-crucible effect.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the folded scorched edge inside the map reweights both their futures with felt cost under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality holds—every gift and image loops back to prior specifics—and the final cadence shift (“verdicts loosen”) crystallizes the new equilibrium.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Pavilion lantern, pruning knife, and coil of twine act as micro-setting that constrain the final ritual; autumn vineyard air keeps the sensory hierarchy tight. Spatial choreography is flawless—gravel, trellis, bench, fence line all tracked without drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—how to speak unkeepable love without apology—tightens once when the map-letter fusion is offered; the cost is visibly the traveler’s trembling map and the sentinel’s surrender of protective silence. Agency sits with both, but the single deepening is sufficient for lyric scope.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of “destined mismatches” emerges through grafting metaphors and the final rivers-rows covenant, never sermonized. The burned edge folded into the future map offers a Conceptual Repricing that reweights love’s geography without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice carries a contemplative viticultural cadence (“vines bow like listening elders”) that stays distinct under lantern light; compression like “ash scribbles still worried the stone” teaches the pattern early. No head-hop; perceptual signature remains steady.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High-density agrarian diction with rhythmic variety; occasional elevated latinate pairs (“intersubjective understanding”) flirt with register drift but stay within the sentinel’s self-aware lexicon. No loops or metaphor muddle near closure; prop tracking is immaculate.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The vineyard-as-confessional, map-as-letter, and grafting-as-love parallels form a fresh synthesis; risk in lyric stasis heightens resonance without gimmickry. Specific viticultural detail prevents template swap.</comment>
