<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The saxophonist’s interiority is concrete—hands tremor, breath feathers, memory tastes of iron—yet the only contradiction shown is between duty and grief, never fully crystallized into a visible mistake. The final endurance costs him nothing we haven’t already been told; the oath holds, but we don’t feel it chafe. Still, the embodied micro-choices under pressure keep the portrait individual and alive.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the prophecy is left open, the city spared, the oath intact, and the price—the eternal return to the grotto, the memory that cannot finish—is legible in the final image of the mist withdrawing. Accumulative lens holds: each condensation line, note, and echo thickens the texture until the last lullaby dissolves the sentence. No orientation debt; who/where/when anchors by line 3 and the pattern is taught early.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The prism atrium is not backdrop but instrument: its facets scatter dawn into “narrow, trembling ribbons” that the saxophonist literally plays against, letting tones climb and retreat along the glass. Micro-setting (sax, bell, breath) and macro-setting (grotto, ridge, city) interlock; the cold panes, iron-tasting echo, and retreating mist all evolve with the action. Environment constrains every tactical choice; without the glass the hush cannot be vested.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—keep the prophecy unfinished—is signaled in line 4 and tightens minute by minute as each dewdrop letter forms. The protagonist’s agency is pure attention and micro-intervention: lower register cancels a city-naming clause; a lullaby loosens the final thread. Cost is conceptual but felt—the ring of absence he carries back into daylight—meeting the 8+ threshold, though the absence could be even sharper on the body.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as the cost of custodial silence: memory, prophecy, and city are all preserved by being kept incomplete. The vested hush reweights from garment to obligation to wound without ever being named a moral. Final image—the grotto bright with absence—reprises the “quietly vivid” light and answers the central question: what does it mean to save the world by never letting it speak?</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is unmistakable: compressed syntax, tidal rhythm, saxophonist’s perceptual signature—sound as temperature, light as cloth, time as tide. No head-hop; psychic distance contracts under pressure (“my hands begin their learned tremor”). Patterned elision (“you move through negative space”) is taught early and paid off when the sentence fogs over. Register never drifts; every metaphor is playable on a sax or felt in mist.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Line-level craft is dense and musical—sentences do two jobs of atmosphere and causality without scaffold. Occasional stacked modifiers (“softly disciplined corridors of color”) flirt with excess but serve the prism’s physics. No loops, no synonym churn, no filter-verb stacks. Final third remains clean, allowing the lullaby to land with crystalline clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The fusion of prophecy-interruption with saxophone-negative-space is a fresh synthesis; the grotto-prism as scoreless sheet music feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk—lyric accumulative structure instead of causal plot—heightens coherence rather than obscuring it. No trope recycling, no prompt echo, no safety middle; the piece commits fully to its own weather.</comment>
