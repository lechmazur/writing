<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The dweller’s gentle, map-making compulsion is vivid and embodied; every kneepad-shuffle and cedar breath makes his “kindly methodical” nature a lived force rather than a label. His contradictory wish—to stay hidden yet be needed—drives every micro-choice and culminates in the silent, costly renunciation of the grate-arrow. The girl is sketched only as a silhouette of need, but that is sufficient for the story’s narrow lens; the emotional transaction still lands. Interiority stays concrete, free of therapy-speak, and the final cache-ledger feels earned because earlier chalk-marks foretold it.</comment>

<comment>Causal chain is immaculate: outage → sapphire hush → tape hum → girl summons → notebook recovery → dweller’s chalk-arrow of continued service, each link visible on the page. Closure is a Charged Poise: the dweller re-commits to invisible stewardship, the cost the ache of nearness forsaken. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 3 and tighten through duct-coordinates; no disorientation penalty applies. The outage is not mere backdrop—it lowers the world’s noise threshold, a causal enabler of the tape’s intelligibility.</comment>

<comment>Library-as-body metaphor is sustained: joists as ribs, Rare Folios Room as mouth learning, atlas case as storm-shelter; these concrete mappings constrain movement and hiding places. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true—felt drafts, smelled cedar, heard metallic ticks—never tourist-catalog. Spatial choreography is flawless: grate→atlas→chair→cache→arrow, every vector legible. The outage-timeframe and “sapphire hush” directly shape acoustics that let the tape speak, satisfying the 9+ environment test.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—remain unseen while becoming needed—tightens exactly once when the girl’s whisper of “mother” vibrates the tape, forcing the dweller to choose revelation-by-proxy. Cost is palpable: he forfeits the narcotic of total erasure, accepts future risk of detection. No external antagonist is required; the conflict is stance-vs-longing, and the narrowing is irreversible. Agency is continuous: every crawl, cache-open, and chalk-mark is an intentional tactic under pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme of invisible caretaking emerges from duct-dust and cedar breath, never sermonized. The blue notebook is both literal MacGuffin and symbol of trans-generational memory-keeping, its recovery re-weighting the dweller’s prior anonymity. Final image—arrow etched near grate—offers a quiet conceptual repricing: presence can be infrastructural, not seen. Ambiguity remains whether the girl will ever know her helper, preserving moral complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric-technical, marrying maintenance-man diction (“pipe chase,” “boiler riser”) with cathedral cadence (“velvet seam,” “sapphire hush”); compression is taught early and paid off. Perceptual signature is relentless sensory filtering—ferrous itch, moth-colored murmurs—never generic. Syntax flexes with stress: fragments when crawling, elongation when tape unwinds. No dialogue, so no register-clash risk; internal monologue stays within plausible lexicon of self-taught trades-philosopher.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Propulsion is high: every sentence advances mapping, memory, or micro-action. Figurative density is deliberate but patterned (tape=nerve, library=body), avoiding random pretty. One scaffold detected—“he had found it months ago” repeated in adjacent sentences—triggers −0.2. No mixed metaphors; vehicles stay coherent within building-as-organism logic. Final line crystallizes without overwriting: “etched a small arrow...closed the panel.”</comment>

<comment>The ferromagnetic tape reel as memory-nerve is a fresh synapse between steampunk salvage and Proustian madeleine; its physics feel inevitable in hindsight. Invisible caretaker trope is re-framed as civic infrastructure—kindness as maintenance. Risk of lyric elision is embraced yet closure stays legible, satisfying bold-choice bonus. Specificity (dustlavender, cedar button) prevents abstraction, making the concept non-portable to another names-and-places swap.</comment>
