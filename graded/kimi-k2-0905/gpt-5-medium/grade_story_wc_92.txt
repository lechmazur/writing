<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mother-bequeathed bronze quill gives credible lineage and mechanical agency; internal contradiction is shown in “I am calmly inventive” against the trembling locks he quiets. Decision to convert guardianship into sabotage is dramatized in a single, irrevocable kneel-to-latch beat with visible cost—loss of former identity. Captain Rhun’s leap from antagonist to ally compresses too neatly; medals-to-faces promise lacks on-page proof of stance change, capping at 8.7.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is an Earned Stasis: sentinel keeps post but now guards consent, price paid is lifelong duplicity limned in “warm bronze…owning neither ink nor chain.” Causal lattice holds: blackout → coded sundial → quill circuit → dimmed fort, each because/therefore legible. Lens ambiguity waived—pattern taught early, payoff lands clean. Cost is unmistakable in final hush image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Luminous fort rendered through sentient hinges and iron-tasting corridor; blackout turns architecture into instrument, forcing tactical use of vents, regulators, coals. Bronze quill doubles as micro-setting and tool that constrains final choice. Specificity peaks in “ceiling our sky” moment, re-weighted at closure when fort becomes listening lighthouse. Minor wish for more body-in-space orientation during Captain’s entrance.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—switch fort from spectacle to hearth—signals early and tightens when circuit tweak risks exposure. Protagonist agency drives every escalation: read sundial → pick locks → slot quill into control. Price paid is social identity as loyal guard; option to confess is foreclosed by Rhun’s nod. No reversal after blackout, but deepening suffices under causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through recurrence of “winking hush” that reframes silence from conspiracy to communal consent. No moral nailed—final answer dwells in “winking hush” reprise, reweighted from secrecy to shared possibility. Fort’s glare-to-glow arc supplies concrete metaphor for power that listens rather than blinds. Complexity preserved: blackout remains officially “unexplained,” sustaining thematic ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>First-person lyric texture sustained: “corridor tastes of iron and rain,” syntactic breath matches blackout hush. Perceptual signature—locks “singing with fear”—remains character-bound, no head-hop. Register stable; no elevated diction drift. Risky ellipses and fragments pattern-taught in opening stanza and paid off in closing heartbeat cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High metaphor density but patterned and justified—every lantern, hinge, wink re-illuminates blackout premise. No mixed metaphors; “bronze quill holder thrumming like a quiet heart” stays inside physical logic. Minor scaffold in “time is different when lamps go missing” restates known; clipped for momentum elsewhere. Final third clean, no artifact touches closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of heist, solarpunk tweak, and quiet revolutionary poetics. Sundial-as-cipher and quill-as-circuit fuse archaic with electrical, creating non-obvious MacGyver logic. “Consent of doors” reframes revolution as engineering rather than coup, avoiding trope template. Specificity of “cradle of sparks” workplace anchors novelty in lived detail.</comment>
