<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The investigator’s calm is credibly strained by the lantern-ignited entanglement of memories; the moment he turns the key and accepts the cost of refusal (“I turned them off…”) shows contradictory impulses in scene. The interior voice stays concrete—boot-level water, salt crust, lantern soot—never drifting into label-speak. His final act of carrying the lantern to the air shaft and signing the cause as “mine to report upward” crystallizes a hierarchy of values with visible cost. No secondary character on page, so relationship bullets waived; headcount stays clean, choreography clear.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: handing the lantern back to the night reweights the rule-set—light is for use, not storage—and the cost is legible in the supervisor radios going silent. Lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern of salt-locked drains, missed nod, buried alarms accretes until the final refusal reconfigures meaning. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive within 50 words; no penalty. Persistent constraint—metrics system vs. human witness—shapes every beat and the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The tunnel’s micro-setting—dead third rail, salt-veined grates, bricked niche—constrains the choice to open the bypass and charges the final lantern release. Body-as-setting is equally vivid: investigator’s knees in shallow water, trembling sheet, boots soaked. Sensory hierarchy obeys POV: professional gaze logs seepage, then personal memory slips in via soot-smudged glass. No spatial drift; every object is handled and tracked.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—owning the truth vs. algorithmic closure—tightens when radios order “finalize” after the lantern flare reveals the missed nod. Escalation is textural: salt bloom, buried protocol, lantern soot accumulate until the investigator’s refusal pays the visible price (silenced radios, signed report). Cost is felt on-page; no coincidence resolves the standoff.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from particular refrain of “waiting for a nod” vs. lantern’s historic signal of “go”; final image reweights that binary without moralizing. Subtext in silence—workers’ radios purr, investigator’s radios hiss, then both go dead—carries the ethical charge. No abstract thesis; insight earned through soot, salt, and signed responsibility. Emotional aftereffect lingers in families’ “dull ache reverberate into anger.”</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>First-person perceptual signature is sustained and specific: “wet breath rising where dust ruled,” “white teeth of thirst.” No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens under lantern flare, then widens to city exhalation. Syntax mirrors calm—long cadences for drought habit, clipped fragments when radios hiss. Metaphor stays within POV lexicon; no register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>High information density—single sentences do setting, metaphor, and interiority (“Salt had crusted… afterimage of the long summer”). No paraphrase loops; each image advances. Minor scaffold: “drought’s habits linger in machinery, like a body forgetting how to drink” could compress, but does not obscure causality or dull closure. Rhythm modulates with pressure; final line offers cadence release.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Freshest inflection: industrial drowning in ankle-deep water because drains thirst-locked by drought salt—physical paradox that reweights climate aftermath. Lantern as Underground Railroad relic passed to modern maintenance crew transforms trope of haunted object into systemic indictment. Synthesis of historical escape route vs. present-day fatal compliance feels inevitable. Risk-taking (lyric refusal of closure metrics) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
