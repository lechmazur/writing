<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interiority is lush, idiosyncratic, and continuously embodied (“ink sweating like dew,” “breathing their damp astonishment”). Contradictory impulses—desire to master time vs. surrender to its dissolve—coexist in scene, not summary. The final acceptance of continual fading is earned through successive sensual encounters with the halo, the pavilion, the submerged vault; the cost is visible in the swallowed ring and the lungs holding “the pale roar.” Micro-choices (pressing shard, stepping onto light-path) tighten the stance; no safety-hedging.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the ring’s light rewrites the garden into a “quaking reverie that holds still,” making the cost of endless fade legible. Causal chain intact: each bridge growth is triggered by shard-use; each memory-room is entered through deliberate physical step. Orientation taught early through tactile cues (“roots that walk above streams”) and pattern of recursive return; ambiguity serves the theme, not the writer. No teleporting props; halo fragment state tracks from shard→ring→tongue→light-path.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Environment is protagonist: bridges thicken or thin underfoot, pavilion breathes, vault braids into rooms that echo footprints. Hyperbolic geometry is not described but enacted—distances multiply as the POV walks, forcing tactical hesitation. The living root cathedral constrains the final image, its “wings” unable to close, embodying the price of perpetual openness. Micro-setting (halo shard, ink-swimming leaf) repeatedly constrains choice and charges the ending.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can grief be given exits without being devoured?—is signaled in blueprint memory and tightened when every exit reopens as mouth. Agency: each bridge taken is a conscious step into deeper retrocognitive debt; lungs fill with “pale roar” as visible price. One meaningful turn: acceptance of continual fading crystallized by swallowing halo-light; no off-stage rescue. Escalation is accumulative/textural: coral-like curves multiply density until the final image can no longer stabilize.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges from iterated images of dissolving media—ink, soot, emulsion, page-birds—without once naming “loss.” Subtext in gesture: woman’s reversed-eye negatives imply every gaze is developed too late. Final image reframes earlier blueprints as living membranes still breathing, not ruins. No sermon; the cost is the ongoing photograph fade, acknowledged by tongue-taste of iron and sap.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>First-person voice sustains a synaesthetic, labyrinth-minded diction (“ribs and knots like a patient skeleton training itself”) that is inseparable from profession. Rhythm swells and compresses with breath-length lines under water, mirroring pressure. No head-hop; woman speaks only once, her dialogue clipped as path-forgotten syllables, preserving distance. Filter verbs absent; perception rendered as tactile events.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High information density: one sentence often layers sensory, emotional, and conceptual work (“I kiss the wordless covers and feel their pages begin to disintegrate into birds”). Metaphors stay physically coherent—hyperbolic curves behave like coral, not random magic. Minor template cadence in “and the…” anaphora early on, but pattern is taught and pays off in litany of rooms. No loops or synonym churn in closure beats; final line lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: hedge-maze logic + hyperbolic topology + retrocognitive photography feels inevitable after first paragraph. Risk of abstraction continuously grounded in edible/tactile stakes—tasting shard, swallowing light. Familiar grief-archive trope retooled through living geometry that refuses Euclidean closure. No derivative echoes; imagery is peculiar to this voice and cannot be relocated without collapse.</comment>
