<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interiority is textured through embodied, character-specific perception ("engine-oil / cinnamon" corridor; brass telescope as father's ghost). The avowed goal—to prove emptiness remembers—does motivate every micro-choice (cloud taxonomy, radio silence naming). Yet the decisive swing toward home relies on external rescue more than internal contradiction; the cost is felt but not paid by a final, irreversible choice on the page. The promise of memorializing is beautifully voiced, but its fulfillment is deferred to log pages we never see, capping the arc just short of 9.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the captain’s laugh crystallizes acceptance and the gondola clicks back into fleet, re-weighting the earlier drift with earned communion. Causality holds under Accumulative/Textural lens: each cloud-named emotion deepens the archive of absence until the silence becomes generative, not vacant. The Orientation anchor (who/where) is cleanly in place by line 4. The only drag is the slight over-reliance on retrospective summary ("I write…") rather than dramatized log strokes, a hairline slip that keeps this just under 9.</comment>

<comment>Setting is micro-precise: salt flats’ dust, the gondola’s metallic river of starlight, cirrus wistful—each detail filters through the meteorologist’s professional bias and grief. Brass telescope functions as mobile setting, constraining final choice when it is set down, marking the shift from observation to memorial act. Spatial choreography remains flawless across the drift and reeling-in. The horizon loosening its belt is the exact image that reconfigures the stakes at closure, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—proving absence can be read—tightens when the radio hush grows "generous as a cathedral," forcing the narrator to speak forgiveness into silence. Escalation is textural: each cloud emotion thickens the archive until the squall’s evolution (resentment → gratitude) reweights the stake with visible atmospheric cost. Agency is present but reactive—final swing homeward is enabled by spotted lightship rather than an irreversible gambit. Still, the price of bearing witness alone in that hush is palpable, meeting the 8-band threshold.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges obliquely: grief as instrumentation, memory as weather. No moral is stated; instead the final click of the gondola answers the thematic question—emptiness is readable only when shared across the live circuit. Subtext lives in gesture (telescope set down, palm in starlight) and in the evolution of cloud moods. The blank lines left for what the sky remembers are the conceptual re-pricing that lifts this near 9.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is unmistakable: scientific lexicon braided with synesthetic metaphor ("hungers… migrating lanterns"). Rhythm swells and contracts with altitude—long anapestic sentences for drift, curt spondees for the click of return. Perceptual signature never wavers: every sight is filtered through barometer skin, star-smell, filial absence. The patterned elision of verbs in key fragments ("A dusty river drawn in metallic dust") is taught early and paid off in the final image, earning the 9 band.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence carries double duty—e.g., "the knot failed with a quietly explosive sigh" fuses tactile sound, foreshadowing, and thematic refrain. Metaphors stay coherent within atmospheric physics; no mixed vehicles. Minor scaffold: "like a bead on a rosary" edges toward familiar simile, but it is earned by prior religious hush. No loops or register drift touch the closure beat, satisfying the 9− gate.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fusion of meteorology with filial grief feels inevitable yet unseen before; cloud taxonomy by emotion is not a gimmick but an operational necessity that guides homeward headings. Risk is taken in the lyric, almost plotless drift, yet pressure accumulates through atmospheric archive. The telescope’s return as star-river on the chart table recharges every prior mention with memorial function. Specificity and conceptual boldness combine for near-maximal freshness.</comment>
