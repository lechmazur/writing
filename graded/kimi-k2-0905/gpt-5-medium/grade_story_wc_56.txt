<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Interiority is lyrical but stays concrete; the narrator’s contradictory impulses (hunger for truth vs. serene acceptance) braid through embodied beats such as the tactile pull of the chain. Micro-choice at the box-opening moment crystallizes values: he records rather than rages. Cost is present—the family complicity he now cannot un-know—yet the shift feels slightly under-damped because the scene partner arrives late and shares the burden. Still, the arc of inherited guilt → chosen witness earns its keep.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the canal’s “truer city” reweights every prior refusal. Causal chain is clean—hook → box → ledger → engineer—each beat tightening agency. Orientation wavers for ~150 words (radio silence used as both dawn and dusk), but the ambiguity later pays off in the final hush, so the Orientation Test is waived. Cost is unmistakable: the narrator must now ferry a knowledge that disqualifies his family’s myths.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Canal, lock, slime-green seal, and sundial compose a micro-setting that actively resists or yields to the protagonist’s leverage; the twilight parchment ribbon guides literal navigation. Sensory hierarchy favors cold, sound, and weight—perfect for salvage. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from skiff kiss to warehouse quay. The seal stamp and angled flood-gates embed social rules inside physical objects, constraining later tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—exposing the city’s foundational lie—surges when the box’s ledger proves complicity; one meaningful tightening occurs as the narrator realizes the nightly radio silence was a deliberate window for erasure, not accident. Escalation is accumulative: each document layers complicity until silence itself becomes untenable. Engineered flood no longer abstract but a priced choice. Cost is legible: the protagonist forfeits his inherited alibi and must now row the truth upstream.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through repeated images of water rewriting stone; lies are architecture, truth is liquid weight. Final image—“the canal unfolded a truer city”—reconfigures prior geography without moralizing. Subtext in the engineer’s quiet admission (“the water does not speak”) reframes silence as collaborator rather than neutral. The refusal to rage keeps complexity alive: complicity is ancestral, not villainous.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>First-person voice sustains a hushed, tidal rhythm; syntax elongates then snaps in sync with rope tugs. Perceptual signature filters world through tools—crate hook, sundial, ledger—never generic gaze. Compressed diction (“serenely radical correction”) risks aphorism but stays earned by prior emotional dredging. Dialogue is minimal yet distinct: engineer’s plainspoken guilt contrasts with narrator’s lyrical interior without convergence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Metaphors are dense but patterned (“parchment ribbon,” “lantern glass polished by rain”) and repay in closure when the same water polishes the city’s reflection. No synonym loops; each sensory stroke advances hook, box, or complicity. Occasional elevated Latinate diction (“grating complaint”) momentarily lifts above the vernacular, yet the cadence justifies the ceremonial reveal. Final third stays artifact-free, protecting 9+ eligibility.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Myth-salvage on a twilight canal is familiar, but the inverse motive—serene exposure rather than revenge—twists the trope. Marrying civil-engineering malpractice to origin-myth falsification yields fresh civic gothic. Risk taken in lyric accumulation over causal reversals pays off in the hush of shared complicity. Could perhaps push further into the engineer’s unique jargon for irreplaceable texture.</comment>
