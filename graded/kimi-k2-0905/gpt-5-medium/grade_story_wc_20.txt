<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The alchemist’s grief is embodied in tactile rituals—etching names, weighing rain-water against brass—so interiority stays concrete. The flaw is that Mara remains a golden abstraction; no contradictory memory or live detail complicates the narrator’s myth of her, so the internal conflict is single-track. The final stance (“I am not healed, but I am held together”) is earned: the fused coin physically forecloses the fantasy of retrieval, forcing Earned Stasis with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the coin, now alloyed with hair and button, literalises the weight of names and settles the stone debt. Causality is lyric-accumulative; each weighing iteration thickens the pattern rather than narrows options. The lens holds, but the middle sags slightly with repeated “again I tested” loops that delay the single meaningful deepening.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The rain-washed foundry is rendered through tool, body, and weather that actively constrain action—wet boots skid, furnace breath limits pacing, rooftops tint the rainwater blue. Micro-setting succeeds: the cracked assay cup becomes the crucible in which setting and psyche fuse. The coin’s nick and furnace glare charge the final image, meeting the 9+ gate test for object-as-setting.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—can the ledger between proof and wonder stay open—tightens when the coin first dips at Mara’s name. Agency is cerebral: each calibration risks tipping the narrator into sterile closure; the final alloy renounces further measurement. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral; the price (perpetual remembrance) is legible but not dramatically felt on the page, keeping the score below 8.0.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the iterative weighing ritual: remembrance itself is the redemption, not rescue. Subtext lives in object handling—gold seam, coin edge, hair curl—never in abstract declaration. The final image of the foundry glowing “like a memory that has learned to redeem itself” reweights earlier motifs without moralising, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice sustains a dense alchemical idiom—“quick to dance, quicker to burn,” “grammar older than books”—without purple drift. Syntax modulates to breathless listing under furnace heat, then slows for the final cadence. No filter-verb stacks; perception stays welded to the narrator’s professional eye for mass and alloy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm mirrors metallurgic process: long furnace exhalations yield to hammer-short clauses at the pour. Figurative language is controlled—one metaphor per beat, each paid off (“golden soot” returns as fused seam). Minor paraphrase loop in “name by name I tested / again and again I tested” costs −0.2, but clarity at closure remains intact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The fusion of kintsugi with metallurgy feels inevitable yet fresh; the premise would collapse if the coin were merely pocketed rather than melted. Risk lies in the lyric, near-static middle, but it pays off when the alloy literally seals the names, transforming ritual into artifact. No close echoes of familiar alchemist tales; the specificity of slag river and brass fund lifts the material.</comment>
