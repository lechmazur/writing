<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The copper-veined storyteller’s quiet articulation and texture-to-sound mission stay consistent; every micro-choice (climbing ridge, feeding listeners his breath, surrendering his travel-name) grows from the same interior contradiction between fear of the curse and duty to the dying language. Embodied emotion is vivid—palms warming to the diamond, thirst like dry ink—yet the arc is a credible endurance/renunciation rather than a sharp change, so the “earned stasis” lands but feels slightly foreknown. No secondary character pressure, so relationship crucible is N/A. Interiority avoids diagnostic labels; voice remains singular.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout: each new echo-layer thickens the linguistic sediment until the final braid of notes becomes the resonant reconfiguration. Orientation is immediate—“At dusk I arrived…” anchors who/where/when in first sentence. Closure is on-page: the protagonist’s surrendered name leaves a “ringing cavity,” a felt cost that reweights the canyon’s new school of texture-song. Pattern is taught early (notch where sound turns) and paid off when the tunnel folds around the diamond—no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The canyon is not backdrop but instrument: bone towers, updrafts, swifts’ choreography all constrain how listening can occur. Micro-setting objects—diamond fracture, reed/cloth/bone listeners—are handled tactilely and return in the final nesting image. Spatial choreography is clean; distance between ridge, tunnel, updraft is trackable. Weather (storms, drought) later alters tactics, fulfilling the 9+ gate that environment charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—save the dying language by translating texture—signaled in paragraph one. Escalation is accumulative: each new echo-word grows scarcer, fuzzed by overuse, until the canyon demands payment in voice. Protagonist’s agency drives the turn: offering his travel-name narrows future options (he stays as caretaker, no longer carries a name for roads). Cost is legible on-page—the ringing cavity—and reshapes later tactics (he can no longer leave).</comment>

<comment>Theme emerges inexorably from the conceit: language as palimpsest of erosion, where every act of preservation costs the preserver. No explicit moral; final image of dawn-to-dusk “moving concord” reweights prior material without statement. Subtext lives in gesture—birds teaching bone kites to bank implies that transmission always needs living intermediaries. Resonance lingers: reader left hearing silence as textured, not empty.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>First-person lyric voice sustains a copper-veined perceptual signature—rain-patient pulse, silk-thin shade, dry-ink thirst—without register drift. Rhythm modulates: long anaphoric ladders for climbing, staccato for rain-scored rock. No head-hopping; compression (“I offered my name, the small one…”) is taught early and paid off. Syntax mirrors canyon folds: sentences turn back on themselves like echoes, yet remain legible.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Near-zero scaffolding; each sentence carries dual duty (action + metaphor, sound + texture). Figurative density is high but patterned—feathered fracture, grammar between wings—teaching the reader how to listen. No mixed metaphors; vehicles stay within canyon/bird/weather logic. Final third avoids artifacts; rain’s staccato translates into shelter without overwriting. Minor template cadence in “I translated…into…” repetitions, but it serves accumulative design and does not blur closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>Fusion of linguistics, geology, and ornithology into a single listening machine feels non-obvious yet inevitable. Diamond-as-recording-needle, birds-as-grammatical markers, canyon-as-wax-cylinder: all transform familiar tropes into fresh procedural. Risk—renouncing name to a curse—heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specificity anchors freshness: “word for water lost on salt” could not exist in another tale.</comment>
