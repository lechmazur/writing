<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lio’s ache and restlessness are embodied in every sensory beat; the shell-test and kneel-song are micro-choices that cost him illusion. Interior contradiction is vivid—“I promise… I will be a knot-maker my own way”—but the turn arrives more as lyric pronouncement than as a forced, un-pretty decision under rising pressure; hence not quite 8+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of echo-tests tightens from silver-rope throw → braid of debts → shell → mother’s pot song, each loop reweighting meaning. Closure is Charged Poise: “I promise the water I will be a knot-maker…” reconfigures options with felt moral cost—he chooses tangle, not cut. Orientation and causality clean; no teleport, no amnesia.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Canyon, river-reeds, shell, and starlight are not backdrop but instruments: shell drinks/tells, reeds brush pages, stone refuses breath—each constrains Lio’s next sonic probe. “Crown of silt lifting” is the final image-tool that answers “Who keeps you?”—setting literally speaks back, charging closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“why some echo, some vanish”—tightens through each sonic return: boy → woman → cousin → river → stars, each knot foreclosing escape. Agency sits in Lio’s questions and shell-aim; cost is the recognition that his own unpaid promises echo, visible when mother’s pot-song braids back. One meaningful escalation, no reversal overload; fits 600-word escalative lyric.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of entanglement-vs-erasure emerges from sonic returns, never sermon. Final image—kneeling in shallows, voice doubled—offers resonant non-literal answer: to echo is to consent to knot, to vanish is to cut. Ambiguity lingers: is knot-making mercy or new debt? Complexity earned, no tidy moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is perceptual signature: “reed-blown melancholy,” “sand-syllables,” “moon bone”—diction stays inside singer’s mythic ear. Rhythm modulates: long breath-sentences for canyon width, staccato questions for test-beats. No head-hop, no filter-verb clutter; prose is character’s mind.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Lyric density is high yet each metaphor does double duty: “silver rope” is simultaneously sound-cord and debt-line. No mixed metaphors, no scaffold loops; clauses stay sequential and tactile. Minor near-repeat—“knot” over-loved—but not in closure beat, so caps at 8.3 not 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Premise—echo as debt ledger, canyon as auditor—is fresh synthesis of mythic acoustics and moral accounting. Risk of lyric mosaic pays off: reader can trace before/after in stance, not just mood. Micro-specifics (pot-song steam, shell half-moon) prevent generic anywhere-ness. Not 9+ because debt-as-door hinge feels slightly aphoristic, reducing surprise.</comment>
