<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The protagonist’s contradictory impulses—yearning for coherence yet renouncing reunion—are dramatized in embodied micro-choices (threading moon-light rope through glass eyes, pocketing the knotted end). Each beat reweights his relation to absence, culminating in an earned stasis where the cost is the very theorem he must keep carrying. Interiority stays concrete (“laugh survives without the body, like a theorem whose proof is lost”), never lapsing into diagnostic speak. The refusal to stage a spectacle is a credible, character-specific flaw that forecloses the easier path of public resolution.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the swaying glass-eye pendulum crystallizes longing as a stubborn variable, re-pricing the mathematics of emotion with undeniable conceptual cost. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of images (fruit spirals, dripping stalactites) tightens until the final image reweights the stake. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are taught by line 3 and echoed at the threshold exit; no ambiguity persists. Persistent constraint: the rope remains tied to stalactite and pocketed, a literal tether he must henceforth walk with.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The cavern orchard is not backdrop but instrument: fruit skins become “equations wearing festival clothes,” the moon-thread rope lowers a spatial path the protagonist must physically crawl through. Mineral blossoms on trunks and ticking stalactites constrain timing and acoustics, forcing hushed breath-counting. The stepping stone’s chipped tesserae literally map constellations that guide the final arc; remove it and the climactic proof collapses. Sensory hierarchy is POV-bound—he notices mineral sweetness because chemists “taste” air for data—never tourist catalogue.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—coherence over reunion—is signaled in line 1 and sharpened when he “speaks the names he never could pronounce without shaking,” a tightening that forecloses magical recovery as option. Escalation is textural: each spiral of fruit and knot in rope adds density until the pendulum eyes make longing a visible variable. Cost is legible—he leaves the eyes behind, accepting perpetual unclosed watch as the price of gentler mathematics. No coincidence; every forward move is an experiment he performs on himself.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.5</question><comment>Theme emerges from the refracted metaphor of mathematics as grief-work: love = attention × time ÷ courage-to-admit-uncertainty^return. The stepping stone’s cracked theorem is not stated but lived, re-weighted when the glass eyes sway like asymptotic curves that approach but never touch. Final image offers no moral, only a carried theorem—an earned irresolution that invites continued reflection. Ambiguity is meaningful, not decorative; the reader must solve for return.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyric third-person hovers at a chemist’s perceptual distance—selective, quantitative, tender. Syntax mirrors mineral accretion: layered participial phrases drip like stalactites, then suddenly tighten into short declaratives (“He ties the other end”). No head-hop; every perception is filtered through his bias for pattern and solvent. Register stays within a conjurer-chemist’s idiom—angles of tesserae, numerator stolen by cat—without academic drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is propulsive yet lyric: each sentence carries dual duty—information and atmosphere—without scaffold. Figurative logic is internally coherent (moon-thread rope, festival-clothes equations) and peaks in the final pendulum image without muddle. Zero paraphrase loops; every clause adds new angle or texture. Read-aloud rhythm accelerates with breath-counting drips, then slows on the final carried theorem, mirroring his exit crawl.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The fusion of taxidermy eyes, mineral orchard, and grief-as-calculus is a synthesis unseen in prior fiction; risk lies in the near-allegorical premise yet specificity grounds it. The “mathematics of emotion” could skew abstract, but here it is tactile: fruit spirals, knotted rope, glass pendulums. Final image of an unsolved theorem pocketed transforms the prompt’s buried optimism into praxis—hope as portable equation. Fresh inflection feels inevitable in hindsight: of course longing is a variable, not an error term.</comment>
