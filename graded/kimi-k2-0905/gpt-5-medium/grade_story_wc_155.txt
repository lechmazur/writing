<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>The mural artist’s interiority is vivid and embodied—light as “fruit baskets,” fresco shard as mentor—but the “rediscover lost joy” motive stays static; no internal contradiction surfaces under pressure. Micro-choices (threading film, holding shard to fog) show values, yet the final stance is only affirmation, not renunciation or fresh risk, so cost feels light. Enough for solid characterization, short of the earned stasis that would lift higher.</comment>

<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each projection onto fog thickens pattern until the reversed loop becomes a “fruit wreath” that reweights memory. The closure is a Charged Poise: the circle of film hangs, rooms of light keep revolving, and the artist pockets the fragment—joy’s trail now legible as ribbon, cost felt in the breath the fog “gives back.” Causality is associative, not linear, but the tightening is coherent; no orientation debt.</comment>

<comment>Sensory selection stays painterly—tangerine cart, pewter ladders, pith in pockets—each detail filters through the artist’s chromatic eye and steadies the hallucinatory fog. The orchard’s ruined architecture (branchless trees, bricked wells) constrains where projections can land, shaping the communal display. Micro-setting triumphs: the fresco shard’s pomegranate seeds become the color key that calibrates the final light-show, charging closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“rediscover lost joy”—is signaled early and deepens as damaged film threatens to erase the festival memory. One meaningful tightening: fog-bitten frames force the artist to cede control to the knowledge network, narrowing authorship from solitary brush to communal chant. Cost is present (fragile film, shared breath, fragment’s glow traded for collective image), but pressure stays lyrical; no irreversible loss beyond the original abandonment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as memory requires structure to rattle against—laughter needs plaster, light needs fog—without ever stating thesis. Subtext lives in gesture: palms “like sails,” stamp so “earth remembers to bounce,” implying joy is cultivated, not found. Final image of the revolving film-wreath reweights the premise: memory is not retrieved but continuously re-projected. Ambiguity lingers—will the artist return?—yet resonance lands.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Voice is a sustained chromatic riff—syntax bends like light, verbs (“budded,” “quivered,” “ferried”) paint motion. Compression taught early (“I paint with light, bending it as if brush and breath”) and paid off in every projection beat. No head-hopping; perceptual signature stays painterly, never explaining color theory yet seeing world as palette. Rhythm accelerates with crowd chants, then softens for “pensive mirth” cadence—lyric control under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>High figurative density is pattern-taught and earned; no mixed metaphors blur logic. Sentence variety is musical, paragraph cuts tight. Minor scaffold: “like” similes occasionally cluster (“like fruit baskets,” “like old theater curtains”) but serve POV’s visual mind. Opening and closing lines anchor and resolve with image-propulsion; zero loops, zero register drift. Read-aloud ear test passes.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fresco shard as projector color-key, fog as screen, knowledge network as chorus—synthesis feels inevitable yet fresh. Risk of preciousness is courted but offset by tactile rot (slick barrels, citrus ghosts) and communal stakes. Concept of painting with light on weather is non-obvious and followed to logical end: film loop becomes wreath, memory becomes orchard’s temporary costume. Specific detail prevents gimmick; transformation is complete.</comment>
