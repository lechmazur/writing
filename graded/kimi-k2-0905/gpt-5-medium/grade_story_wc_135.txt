<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The archivist’s interior contradiction—compiling absences while resisting the urge to impose meaning—remains embodied in small tactile acts (turning the valve, noting “tone: none”). His reactive-visionary trait constrains him to wait for the world, so every micro-choice is a visible cost: he must borrow the woman’s lived rhythm to “hearten” the harbor. No stock epiphanies; the final renunciation of the trumpet valve to her hands is an earned stasis that forecloses ownership of the return. The single flaw is the woman’s summary backstory of exile, which briefly flattens her to a cautionary tale rather than a co-agent.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: by surrendering the valve the archivist redefines “return” as a shared practice, not an archive. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each staggered tap and gull-cry adds density until the ledger “balances.” Cost is legible in the final image of channels navigated, not voids filled. Only a hair-thin slip: the parade-route tracing on glass risks a twee metaphor, but the erased water immediately re-grounds the gesture in physical consequence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The ivory harbor is not backdrop but instrument: the wet glass, staff-line masts, and valve-on-sill constrain how sound and memory can be organized. Micro-setting succeeds—the corroded valve’s lichen-green ports dictate the intervals of possible notes. Weather’s shift from rain to mist is causally tied to the workers’ glances upward, proving environment alters social attention. One minor spatial wobble: “balconies hung with damp laundry” appears after the exile’s end yet feels like a frozen diorama rather than a lived-in space.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: can the harbor relearn how to welcome without parades? Pressure escalates through accumulating absences—each staggered tap narrows the solution space from music to spacing to shared rhythm. The protagonist’s agency is precisely reactive: he refuses to compose, forcing the city to supply the cadence. Cost is the forfeiture of curatorial control; the final ledger entry “credits and losses speaking plainly” is the visible price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the inversion of archive: meaning is not extracted from fragments but performed into existence by communal intervals. Subtext resides in negative space—the silence between gull-cries becomes writable territory. No moralizing; the final image of tide carrying moonlight is a conceptual repricing that equates memory with gravitational pull, not possession. The single abstraction “navigated absences” is justified because it is physically enacted, not asserted.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is crystalline: salt takes shape in a handprint, masts draw staff lines—vision is scored onto surfaces. Syntax mirrors archival precision: paratactic ledger entries (“tone: none”) interrupt lyrical swells, enacting the reactive stance. No head-hopping; even the woman’s weather-name is filtered through the archivist’s cataloguer instinct. The one register drift—“practice its return”—leans self-help, but the next sentence re-anchors the verb in muscular rehearsal.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Rhythm breathes with scene tempo: long sentences during mist-thinning, staccato ledger notes under pressure. Information density is high—“gulls punctuate them” does three jobs: sensory, musical, spatial. Figurative language is selective; when “balconies were hung with damp laundry” edges toward postcard, it is immediately undercut by the anti-fanfare. No loops or scaffold; the only near-repeat (“staggered intervals”) is purposeful motif-reinforcement, not synonym churn.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Premise flips exile trope: return is not reunion but re-calibration of collective rhythm. Fresh synthesis—archivist as percussionist of silence—grows inevitable from the valve’s corroded ports. Risk taken in refusing triumphant parade is paid off by the quieter image of tide carrying moonlight. Minor deduction for echo of “after the rain” trope, rescued by the specificity of lifted gull prints in salt.</comment>
