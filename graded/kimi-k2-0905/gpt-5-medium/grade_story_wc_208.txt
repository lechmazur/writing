<comment>The narrator’s sculptor identity is vivid in the opening beats—“reads knots the way others read lines on palms”—and the lantern-slide kinship-net later forces a concrete micro-choice under the arch. Interiority stays embodied, but the emotional crescendo leans on thematic shorthand (“a vow to keep building bridges out of broken weather”) rather than a final, specific bodily cost; the Earned Stasis is felt yet not sharpened to a singe image.</comment>

<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: the slide’s projected “braiding of hands” is the pattern-break that reweights stakes, turning salvage into reciprocal gate-building. Closure lands as Charged Poise—timber gate humming with latent passage—whose conceptual cost (perpetual wandering in exchange for kinship) is legible in the final paragraph. No orientation debt; drift from GPS failure to arch is anchored by sensorial triangulation within 120 words.</comment>

<comment>Storm-tossed archway as micro-setting literally directs carpentry choices: ferric air guides peg placement, moonwash dictates shell spacing. The lantern projection overlays stone like “tide-light,” fusing environment and tool into a single decision surface—an 8+ integration that charges the gate image. One hairline slip: “turbine-hum reverie” is repeated without acoustic evolution, a micro-loop that blunts freshness.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—kinship vs. perpetual solitude—tightens when silhouettes invite the narrator’s hands; refusing solo escape costs the certainty of lone navigation. The gate’s completion is the visible price, foreclosing a life of mere passing-through. Escalation is accumulative: each salvaged timber ups the communal obligation until the storm pivots from threat to witness.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme of reciprocal craftsmanship emerges via shell-bronze-kelp talismans and “joins cut true and patient,” avoiding thesis statements. The lantern slide’s reprise as blueprint—not spectacle—gives a Conceptual Repricing that quietly indicts extractive wanderlust. Final image reframes driftwood from debris to social ligature, leaving ambiguous space for reader fatigue or hope.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>First-person coastal idiom—“salt teaches wood to remember”—maintains perceptual signature; syntax swells like tide then shortens under drill-and-peg action. No head-hopping; lyric elision (“timewoven alliances”) is taught early and paid off in gate joints. One register wobble: “scaffold complexity with simplicity” smells of workshop notes, not salt skin, but it is brief.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>High information density: one sentence pegs driftwood, storm, and kinship without scaffolding. Rhythm modulates from long wave-sentences to staccato tool strikes. Figurative layering is dense yet coherent—no mixed metaphors. Only micro-loop: “patience” is over-leant on in closing paragraph, a –0.2 touch that keeps the score sub-9.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fusing GPS-age disorientation with artisanal gate-craft under a copper-slide projection is a fresh synthesis; the “timewoven alliances” trope is rescued from abstraction into carpentry choreography. Risk yields payoff: letting spectral kin literally handle the timber converts magical object into social covenant without explanatory gloss. Hindsight inevitability holds—every knot read earlier now justifies the joint-cut ritual.</comment>
