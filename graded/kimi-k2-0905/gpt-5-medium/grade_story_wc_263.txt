<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is richly concrete—“brass chilled and calibrated by sleeplessness” embodies motive; the contradiction between craving silence and being doomed to hear is dramatized in every beat. Micro-choices (aligning the sight, whispering to the night, choosing to sleep inside the arch) visibly tilt the stake. The final endurance—shouldering the instrument for perpetual rounds—pays the cost of eternal service, fulfilling Earned Stasis. Only minus: the proclaimed “gift or curse” skirts diagnostic self-labeling, though the body of text instantly re-embodies the claim.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the city’s windows open “by a finger’s width,” reconfiguring both the town and the narrator’s future. The persistent price—lifelong nightly pilgrimages—lands on-page in the final sentence. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each meteor-sketched line thickens pattern until the blank pages tremble, then the aurora “gathers like a vow,” a final density spike that reweights meaning. Setup taught early; transitions are legible; orientation anchored by line 3—no ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The archway, brass instrument, and aurora function as micro-setting triplets that constrain every tactic: without the cold geometry of the arch the star-script cannot be read; without the instrument’s hive-hum the pages would not etch. Spatial choreography is flawless—circular sight aligned, vellum smelling of rain, pages drifting around the sleeping body. Sensory hierarchy skews to metallic chill and color-whisper, matching the POV’s synesthetic vocation. Final image—the bridge of notes and chisel marks—recharges these objects as shared city infrastructure, passing the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“free trapped creativity before their silence buries me”—is signaled in the first 120 words. Escalation is accretive: each falling star traced removes one artist’s blockage, tightening the narrator’s own inexhaustible obligation. Seventh-circuit meteor opens the brickless door, the decisive intensification that forecloses retreat; cost is the endless circuits still ahead, felt on the final line. Luck complicates (meteor timing) but does not resolve; the sculptor’s laugh is earned by prior stardust transference.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete particularity: statues exhale fear-clouds, pages tremble for touch. No explicit thesis; the final bridge of notes answers the question “can night speak without wounding silence?” with materialised sound. Ambiguity is preserved—city remembers “a little more,” not all. No moralising paragraph; resonance is image-driven, fulfilling the non-literal answer demand.</answer>

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>First-person lyric voice owns a distinct perceptual signature—synesthetic color-whispers, brass tasting like moonstone. Rhythm modulates: long breathless clauses during aurora circuits collapse into fragment-itches at meteor impact. Patterned elision (“across an unwritten calendar”) is taught early and paid off in closure. No head-hopping; diction stays within poet-astronomer lexicon; filter verbs serve voice not hesitation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>High information density: one sentence often carries sensory, emotional, and mythic labour (“the instrument hums in my hands like a hive discovering spring”). Figurative layering is purposeful, not ornamental—each metaphor re-weights the tool’s life. Minor scaffold: “I know then” x2 could be trimmed, but the second instance tightens to irrevocable realisation, so loop does not dull closure. Read-aloud rhythm reliably varies; no template cadence near end.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>Premise—“astronomer transcribes falling stars to unplug city’s creative blockages”—is fresh synthesis of sky-chart myth and arts trauma. The brass instrument’s evolution from cold key to feathered hive risks gimmick yet stays grounded in tactile use. Specificity of “marble lungs afraid of drawing breath” inscribes an entire ailment in four words. Risk of endless circular narrative is embraced, not hedged, turning potential monotony into Cost of Eternal Service; transformation test passed—story collapses if any named particular is swapped.</comment>
