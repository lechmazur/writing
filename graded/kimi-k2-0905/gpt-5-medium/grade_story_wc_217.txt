<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The poet’s interiority is richly textured through sensory attention and micro-choices (kneeling to write, threading ribbon), but the boy’s turn from stunned loss to “new listening” is asserted more than embodied; one more beat of visible internal contradiction would have pushed this into 9-band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the raft drifts toward the vanished kite, reweighting loss into collaborative attention; cost is felt in the boy’s empty spool and the poet’s ink left to silence. Accumulative lens holds—pattern of “woven dawns” braided from frays culminates in the final image without causal sleight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Lagoon, reeds, puddled sand, and drifting kite fragments are tactile and bias-filtered through the poet’s noticing; the crimson diamond snagged “on distances inside his ribs” makes the setting body-proximal and charges the final raft image. Micro-setting (feather-ribbon pen) directly constrains the joint writing act.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—beauty found in incompleteness—tightens when the snapped string forces the boy into raw asymmetry; poet’s offer to “write what the wind is saying” converts loss into collaborative attention, visible cost in the empty spool and ink left unfinished. One meaningful deepening suffices under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges musically: incompleteness as generative song. Final image of kite “writing the long sentence of sky” reweights earlier “woven dawns” without moralizing; ambiguity lingers about whether anything is truly mended, yielding resonant aftertaste.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Lyric third-person POV sustains a poet’s perceptual signature—burnished hush, reed-breath, “tide math”—without head-hop; syntax flexes from elongated cadence to staccato “spool light in his palm.” Compressed diction under peak pressure (“world tilts into loud asymmetry”) stays legible and pattern-taught.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>High information density—almost every line couples image with emotional valence; no loops or scaffold. Occasional stacked metaphors (“wicker lid from a sleeping basket of song”) flirt with overwriting but serve voice; no figurative muddle touches closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Familiar healing-through-art premise is refreshed by making the art act collaborative, improvised, and disposable (raft of reeds). Drake-feather quill repurposed as kite-ribbon pen feels inevitable yet surprising; risk-taking in lyric structure heightens coherence rather than gimmickry.</comment>
