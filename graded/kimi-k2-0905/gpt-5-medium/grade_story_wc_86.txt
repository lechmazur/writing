<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The negotiator’s interiority is textured and consistent—embodied in the pocketed drawer pull, micro-choices of hand-offs, and calibrated silences. Contradictory impulses (need for neutrality vs. personal history) stay active in-scene, and the final stance of standing alone with cooling brass shows earned endurance. Minor slip: the boy’s smile feels slightly over-tidy amid the parapet’s peril.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the emptied parapet and cooling drawer pull reweight every prior exchange with undeniable social cost. Causal chain holds—moon-phase synchronization → delayed arrival → trades under clipped coin → final solitude—each step foreclosing alternatives. No orientation debt; anchors clear by line 20. Cost is legible in the final image alone.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mist-soaked parapet functions as micro-setting: slick stones dictate foot placement, narrowed width forces proximity, moon acts as shared clock. Drawer pull recurs as tactile constraint, warming then cooling to mark emotional expenditure. Weather and stone actively shape the choreography of exchange; no postcard vistas. One hairline slip: “forbidden horizons” is abstract amid otherwise concrete sensorium.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—lives for reputation—tightens when the second trade snags on a misremembered raid; negotiator’s intervention with the tarnished pull forecloses violence, paying visible social cost (both sides’ grudging nods). Escalation driven by protagonist’s micro-choice to expose shared history under moonlight, not by coincidence. Felt price: the healer’s departure leaves Estaran boy at risk, grain sacks acknowledge Voric hunger—resources spent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of recycling damage into fragile linkage emerges through brass artifact, grain sacks, and negotiated breaths—never stated outright. Final cooling of the pull reconfigures “mistakes into wisdom” as solitary vigil, not moral. Ambiguity remains: both sides still armed, calendars still untrusted. Avoids sermon; resonance arises from tactile particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>First-person voice carries consistent perceptual signature—wind combs mist, moon is clipped coin, ledger sits on wet stone. Syntax lengthens under reflective pressure, shortens during trade snags, mirroring pulse. No head-hopping; diction stays within negotiator’s lexicon. Dialogue sparse but subtextual—Raglen’s single grunt and Della’s grip speak volumes.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers weather, body, and politics without scaffold. Metaphors (wind as cold fingers, moon as clipped coin) recur with purpose, never congesting beats. One paraphrase loop—“furrowed hush” appears twice within six lines—drops the score a hair. Otherwise rhythm breathes with scene tension.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Fusion of lunar phase diplomacy with tactile heirloom feels fresh; seed-swap grandmother backstory seeds specificity absent from standard war-parley trope. Transformation test fails if drawer pull removed—closure image collapses. Risk in lyric compression pays off: neutral ground becomes moral crucible rather than mere backdrop.</comment>
