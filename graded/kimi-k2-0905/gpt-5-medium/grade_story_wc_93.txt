<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The narrator’s vow to decode the “grammar” of currents for his brother anchors every choice; embodied ache when the herder’s footprints shimmer under the aurora shows interiority without diagnostic tag. The climactic trade—brother freed, herder trapped—was earned by the twin promises dramatized early and paid with on-page cost. Micro-choices remain consistent: each stone laid is a visible bet that his ribs still burn. Flaw: her “resigned grace” is more label than physiology, trimming the top band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: because the narrator clings to promise → seeks herder → accepts her rule → trades places. The spiral-door beat (tightening) is dramatized with felt cost to both siblings and the herder, satisfying closure. Orientation anchored by word 50 (“tidal bluff under aurora”) and who-what cues. One soft spot: the dust’s physics is asserted not tested, a trace causality wobble.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Setting is weaponized: cliff lip and frictionless season literally decide how bodies can anchor or slide; the aurora’s pressure is metered through “singing wire” and “velvet gravity.” Painted rock weights and colored nets make math tactile, charging the final spiral. Micro-object—the emptied pouch—carries the price at the end, qualifying for 9+ gate. Only the village geography stays sketch; spatial tracking inside the spiral is impressionistic, not crisp.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Single dominant stake—redeem the brother—tightens twice: promise fire → learning grammar → choosing to keep the door. The final reversal forecloses rescue of the herder, price paid in real time. Tension accumulates under causal logic; no outside coincidence rescues. Escalation is linear, not deepening; no additional toggle raises stakes past midpoint, keeping it shy of 8-band peak.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of sacrifice-as-pattern emerges through stone sequences and eel choreography, never moralized. Final image—promise now “breathes” instead of burns—reweights earlier fire metaphor via quiet engine, meeting CR test. Ambiguity survives: the coast will keep claiming herders, math is endless. No echoic thesis sentences; subtext stays in salt-iron taste of gratitude.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice owns a synesthetic compression: “sea sang like wire,” “biography of slipping”—taught early and paid off at spiral read. Rhythm modulates: long clauses for aurora hush, staccato when rocks click into primes. No head-hopping; POV stays tethered to narrator’s ribs. Occasional elevated register (“decanting,” “conceptual repricing”) nudges past sailor lexicon but remains internally consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Density high—single sentences braid sensory, math, and metaphor: “polyrhythms of primes” simultaneously cue sound and pattern. No paraphrase loops; each rock placed advances either tactic or cost. Mixed-metaphor risk (“velvet gravity”) is accepted because physics is already dream-logic. Occasional modifier stack (“slick corridor between two moments”) momentarily thickens flow.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Frictionless season + eel herder + math-rocks fuses magic realism with topology in a synthesis that feels inevitable, not grafted. Precognitive curse traded for rescue flips the oracle trope into sacrifice mechanics. Risk of opaque spiral physics is embraced and paid. Specificity of rock weight/color tuning keeps concept from drifting into generic “magic math.”</comment>
