<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and profession-specific—names as weight, tide as forgetfulness—and the mortuary voice anchors every perception. The lens-tending micro-choices (angling shards, tapping code) dramatize stubbornness and grief simultaneously. The only flaw is a touch of diagnostic self-labeling (“I was never brave…”) that momentarily flattens the contradiction already shown. Cost is visible: the mortuary stamp on the desk cedes his life-ledger to the drowned, an irreversible forwarding order.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: package → descent → lens-mending → address-registry → harbor answer. Each beat tightens options—first only the library can receive the dead, then only his stamp can accredit it. Closure is on-page: the plankton rune ignites, the mantled thing withdraws, and the pier lanterns swap SOS for SOR—Decisive Change with civic cost. Orientation is taught early through tactile descent and kelp map; no disorientation survives.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Environment is not backdrop but filing system: shelf-numbers become street addresses, card catalog turns into census of drowned. The broken lens re-imagines bioluminescent plankton as living bulbs—setting literally supplies the light that powers closure. Spatial choreography is watertight: service-well bubbles, dome ribs, desk vents all tracked without drift. Micro-setting triumph: the lens itself, a portable room of refraction, finally steers the current.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“give rest a permanent address”—is signaled in paragraph two and escalates from personal vow to civic infrastructure. The plankton rune and harbor lantern reply materialize the cost: he has traded his own mortality registry for the city’s, an irreversible tightening. Agency is continuous: every shard aligned is a renunciation of return. No coincidence resolves; the sea’s patience merely recognizes the new address system.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</question><comment>Theme emerges as logistics of memory: cataloging is love, indexing is resurrection. Subtext lives in gesture—the hush replacing SOS—implying civics of mourning without stating it. Final image reweights prior motifs: the mortuary stamp on a drowned desk fuses business and abyss, a Conceptual Repricing that makes civic infrastructure out of private grief. No moral is spoken; the after-effect is a hush that feels like policy change.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is embalmer-poet: tidal forgetfulness, linen names, kelp tea. Rhythm swells and contracts with dive pressure—long sentences underwater, staccato code tapping at climax. Chased stillness personified as mantled thing keeps tone consistent through threat. No register drift; even elevated diction (“registry,” “vestibule”) fits the undertaker’s ledger mind.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</question><comment>Density is high—every sentence at least doubles duty: “I occupy impossible spaces between bubbles and beams” advances descent and theme. Metaphors are coherent light/water interface; no mixed vehicles. One paraphrase loop—“patience is how the sea kills; it waits and calls it rest”—is deliberate incantation, not scaffold. Closure image crystal-clear: stamp on desk, no filter verbs dulling it.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Premise flips hauntology into civil service: underwater dead need street addresses. Synthesis of undertaker lore and lighthouse optics feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk—turning card catalog into census—pays off by making bureaucracy lyrical. No familiar trope untouched: SOS becomes SOR, mortuary becomes post office for souls.</comment>
