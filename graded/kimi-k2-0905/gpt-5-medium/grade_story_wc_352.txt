<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The archivist’s interiority is vivid—refusing “glitter,” “starving the familiar”—but the arc is more pilgrimage than struggle; no contradictory impulse is dramatized, so the promised flaw-to-cost link is asserted rather than lived. The iron crown’s warmth is the only embodied price, and it arrives as blessing, not loss.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the city’s locks “pause before accepting imprecise grief” reweights the stake from personal recovery to civic patience, with the iron band’s warmth as felt cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density of inverted imagery and pollen-letters tighten until the final hush—though the grotto’s rule-set is taught late, slightly blurring causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The grotto is rendered through kinesthetic synesthesia—“air becomes syrup, sound narrows to a wick”—and the crown’s plain iron constrains the final sight; micro-setting (the doodle’s tilt, the crown’s eye) repeatedly steers choice, not just décor. Spatial choreography stays legible even while upside-down.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—recovering forgotten combinations—tightens when “looking at the right absence” becomes the only key; the fortieth-beat hinge sigh offers visible cost. Escalation is lyric-accumulative rather than causal-reversal, sufficient under Accumulative lens, but no secondary loss (tool, time, social credit) materializes to raise pressure further.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without assertion: archival vigilance as civic gift. The inverted city locks externalize the interior arc; refusal of “inheritance” and “haste” re-prices memory as patience rather than possession. No moralizing caps the piece, letting the final “quietly scandalous” footfall resonate.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>First-person diction remains prism-specific—“angles translating into gentle verdicts”—with syntactic shimmer that escalates under pressure. No filter-verb clutter; elision (“I tuck both into my chest”) is taught early and paid off. Voice modulates from cerebral to corporeal without register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm alternates between elongated pollen-sentences and clipped imperatives (“So I slow…”) that mirror the tilted gravity. Only minor loop: two adjacent “refuse” anaphora, but it serves the beat’s ritual cadence. Figurative density stays coherent—no mixed vehicles—propelling rather than stalling.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The inversion of gravity as lock-picking hour, crowns that wait for “specific heads,” and memory-as-seeds synthesize archival noir with cosmic folktale in a way that feels inevitable yet unfamiliar. Risky lyric structure pays off because closure reconfigures civic memory, not just personal loot. Could not swap “prism-minded archivist” for generic thief without collapsing the concept.</comment>
