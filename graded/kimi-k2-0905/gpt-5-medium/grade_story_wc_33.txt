<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is rich and voice-specific (“maps hold their breath,” “boots prudent, heart ungoverned”). The mailman’s contradictory drives—regulation vs. rebellion—are embodied in micro-choices (staying at Mina’s, rerouting the sunflower letter). Cost is visible: the extra hour spent costs him risk at the checkpoint and emotional exposure. The only drag: “respectfully rebellious” is repeated as label twice; a small slip at this length.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the boy’s posture change reweights the whole route under the inferred Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality is intact—every beat (jar opening, mirror portrait, letter reroute) accumulates pressure until the final image. Cost is felt in the “lighter” exit and the ungoverned heart. No teleporting props; the sunflower letter is seeded early, paid off last.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setting is atmospheric but never backdrop: the cobalt arcade’s color is a lived threshold, the drone-whine roof constrains movement, the creek’s penny-taste affects thirst and risk. Micro-objects—jar, wire birds, battery casings—are handled and re-handled, altering tactics. Spatial choreography is flawless across the alley-to-Mina-to-fence traverse. Final image of the arcade “as if forgiven” charges the closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—deliver contraband storm and heal broken promises—tightens when the jar’s lid cracks and options narrow to staying vs. leaving. One meaningful deepening: the mirror reveals the boy, foreclosing the mailman’s detachment. Cost is legible in the extra twilight minutes and the emotional wager of rerouting official mail. Agency remains his throughout; no coincidence resolves anything.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: promises break when we try to fill absences instead of linking them. No overt thesis—Mina’s line is earned dialogue, not authorial sermon. The final image of the arcade as forgiven threshold reweights prior alleys without moralizing. Subtext lives in gesture (thumbprint crescent, nod at the jar) rather than declaration.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>First-person voice is distinctively lyric yet controlled: syntactic parallelism (“regulations say… streets ask”) taught early and paid off. Perceptual signature filters everything through postal cartography—windows that never light, names that never answer. No head-hopping; distance stays tight. Diction stays within courier lexicon except for one ecstatic spike (“ungoverned”), justified by climax.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; sentence lengths ebb with twilight hush, tighten during jar opening. Information density high—one line often does three jobs: “children skim the casings like shells, and the water tastes faintly of pennies” (world-rule, sensory, moral economy). No loops or scaffold; metaphors stay coherent. Minor register lift—“conceptual repricing” diction not quite inside courier voice—stops this short of 9+ band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Premise—postcolonial mailman healing political absences with bottled weather—feels fresh yet inevitable. Tropes (drones, smuggling, oracle elder) are retooled through postal logistics and absence-mapping. Final synthesis (linking holes instead of filling them) is non-obvious and grows from prior particulars. Risk in lyric density pays off without obscuring closure.</comment>
