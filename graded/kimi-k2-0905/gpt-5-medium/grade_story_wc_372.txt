<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The narrator’s “gently meticulous” nature is shown through tactile micro-choices (steadying lantern with mittened hands, slowing breath, lifting palms to lens) that visibly cost him body heat and solitude; the interior contradiction between clinging to order while surrendering to erasure is present in scene, but the final vow’s emotional price is more declared than dramatized—“I would catalog the erased months” tells the forfeiture rather than letting us feel the frostbite of that promise.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly as Earned Stasis: the narrator seals himself into the ledger, paying with perpetual exile and archival servitude; the Accumulative/Textural lens (pattern of spectral measurements tightening into birds that sew light) holds, reweighting the stake from saving the archive to becoming it. Orientation is taught by ~120 words (“In the frozen library above clouds… my post hung between eternity and weather”). Persistent constraint—being the last entry—shapes the final image, meeting the 9+ cost test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Frozen library, lantern lens, and frost-rimed carrel constrain every move; the lantern’s beam literally rewrites constellation-grammar, charging the final image. Sensory hierarchy obeys POV—quartz hush, sequins scraped by wind—while spatial choreography stays coherent across lantern-mounting and vow-binding. Micro-setting (cracked slide, frost on ledger edge) alters tactics, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“keep the last bright messages”—tightens when the mentor’s fractured pledge nearly shatters the lens, forcing the narrator to choose between personal memory and archival survival. Escalation is textural: spectrum tightening → birds of vows → narrator self-filing, each beat reweighting the cost of guardianship. The final renunciation (eternal indexing of erasure) forecloses escape, paying visible price under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from pattern: light-spectra as vows → vow-birds → narrator becomes spectrum, proposing that meaning is not preserved content but the act of measuring loss itself. Subtext crystallizes in the mentor’s cracked slide note—“Keep the promise, even after light fails”—a silent directive that reweights the premise without moralizing. The final constellation-grammar offers a non-literal answer: archives survive only by devouring their keepers, a resonant reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Lyric-compressed diction (“quartz hush,” “slow thunder,” “alphabets of patience”) remains stable under stress; patterned elision taught early (“everything breathed a quartz hush”) is paid off in final “deliberate, sheltering hush.” Perceptual signature—meteorological numerology, vow as frequency—stays character-bound; no head-hopping. Syntax mirrors meticulous frost-ritual: controlled caesuras, breath-length sentences, no register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>High figurative density risks purple fatigue, but metaphor chains obey consistent physics (light, frost, breath) and never stall causality. Occasional noun-phrase stacks (“filaments of vows,” “irridial sheen”) flirt with overwriting yet serve the spectral texture. Zero loops, scaffold, or filter-verb stacks; sentence rhythm modulates with lantern pulses. Closure image remains clear despite lyrical compression.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Frozen-cloud archive where vows are catalogued by sampling light-frequencies is a fresh synthesis of climate-gothic and information-mysticism; the cracked lantern slide as both mentor relic and self-authorizing directive transforms familiar “save the archive” trope into self-annihilating stewardship. Specificity of “snowbirds made from filaments of vows” feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking (lyric accumulative structure) heightens stakes without obscuring closure.</comment>
