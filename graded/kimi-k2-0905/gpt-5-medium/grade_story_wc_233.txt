<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Interiority is lush but occasionally drifts into lyrical self-exposition (“a net asking to be filled with answers”) rather than embodied contradiction. The queen’s renunciation is signaled early yet the climactic choice to merge with her stone double is accepted too smoothly; the cost is poetic but not dramatized in a visible wound or forfeiture. The wanderer’s cryptic guidance supplies external pressure, yet his stake remains opaque, so the queen’s final yes feels slightly under-earned. Still, her voice is distinct and the dream-motive is relentlessly pursued.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>The causal spine holds: crown abandoned → ridge → grotto → integration, each step triggered by dream hunger. Orientation is swift (“After the final warning tolled…”) and the lens is lyrical-accumulative: images layer rather than reverse. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—she wakes her stone self and forfeits the unblemished reign—yet the price is more atmospheric than concrete (no cut hand, no kingdom shown in collapse). The wanderer’s axiom-heavy dialogue sometimes substitutes for on-page turn mechanics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Sensory selection is acute: salt-cooled crown, warm ash breath of the ember grotto, starlight thick as wound. Each setting micro-shifts the queen’s options—ridge narrows path, grotto offers lantern alliance, cobalt cave presents the stone double. Environment-as-tool use peaks when starlight is daubed on her brow, literally unlocking the dream. The final image reuses the crescent mark to signal fused identity, meeting the 9+ gate cleanly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—dream knowledge versus sovereign duty—is signaled in line 3 and tightens when the wanderer warns “you will choose who rules.” Agency is present at every ascent pause, yet the tightening is largely atmospheric rather than tactical; no material resource is lost or deadline imposed. The final integration does foreclose her return to unexamined power, satisfying the cost requirement, but the price is felt conceptually rather than viscerally.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as the cost of self-examination: sovereignty cracks open under starlight scrutiny. Subtext hides in object handling—crown on salt, moth at candle—never sermonized. The closing image of starlight as “an eye that had decided to watch” reweights all prior dreams without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers: monarchy may survive, but only as a haunted ring.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Voice is richly textured, favoring kinetic verbs (“ribs cut the dusk,” “wind combed her braids”) and sonic patterning without drumbeat monotony. POV stays tightly latched to the queen; perceptual signature is mythic-lyric yet consistent. Dialogue is sparse but purposeful, carrying subtext in indirection (“You are late” read as thread, not scolding). Filter verbs are almost absent; immediacy remains intact even at high metaphor density.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Metaphor density is high but patterned early (“palace rafters,” “stars bled like wounds”) so accretive design justifies it. No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected; sentence openings vary. A few phrases flirt with overwriting (“lacy menace of power and mercy”) yet remain legible. Closure line is crisp, propulsive, artifact-free.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Familiar royal-abdication arc is re-angled through oneiric astronomy and the stone-double test. The wanderer-as-cradle-guardian twist freshens the guide trope. Recurrent moth-flame image feels specific rather than borrowed. Risk is taken with lyric density; payoff is a conceptual repricing rather than twist, making the synthesis feel inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
