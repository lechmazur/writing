<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The repairer’s quiet obsession with “harnessing the ephemeral” drives every micro-choice; the sanding of the burr is a perfect embodied cost. Interiority stays concrete—cameras “breathe,” chronometer “pleads”—never sliding into label-speak. No contradictory impulse is staged in scene, so the 9+ gate fails by a hair, but the endurance that re-tunes the world is fully earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the paused second-hand crystallizes the new listening stance and reweights the whole night’s labor. Causal chain holds—quake → misalignment → smeared photons → collar turn → sharp image—each step paid for with tactile effort. Cost is legible in the director’s bedside vigil and the weakest-tea dawn; no option is reset.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The cracked dome, sighing pedestal, and “pale claws” of tide are not backdrop; they force the micro-alignment that yields the tremor data. The leaf-as-microphone is a micro-setting that constrains the tuning method and reappears in the final memory, charging closure. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: only what vibrates in bearings or circuits earns attention.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—capture the Moon’s post-quake exhale—tightens when three-pixel smear threatens erasure; the collar quarter-turn forecloses further tinkering and locks in the image. Pressure escalates under causal lens: each adjustment narrows options until the final sharp frame costs the night’s stamina and the director’s silence. Price is visible on-screen and in body.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges: instruments and humans alike confess through noise; listening is a form of repair. No character moralizes; the insight is earned by the burr removed and the paused hand. Final image of weakest tea reframes earlier “luminous ache” into quiet endurance—resonant, unsentimental.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>First-person voice carries a distinct perceptual signature: lunar light is a “burn scar,” time is a “trapped mayfly,” regulators “whine.” Syntax lengthens under contemplation, then compresses during the collar turn, mirroring attention. No filter-verb stacks; every metaphor is POV-plausible for a technician who treats light as animal and metal as living tissue.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “I loosened the mounting collar, a quarter turn, and the image… clicked into a sharpness that hurt” does triple duty—action, result, sensation. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances bearing or bearing-feeling. One hairline slip—“pale claws across the sea” edges toward ornament—does not touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The fusion of seismic science, analog camera repair, and lunar photography feels fresh; no trope catalog predicts sanding a clock burr to hear tectonic breath. Specificity of diaphragm swaps and ground-loop tracing prevents generic “tech” gloss. Risk—letting the climax hinge on a quarter-turn of metal—pays off because prior tactile labor has taught the reader to feel that increment.</comment>
